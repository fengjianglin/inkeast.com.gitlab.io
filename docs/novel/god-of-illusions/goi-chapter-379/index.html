 <p>Chapter 379: The New Leader Wants to Cry!</p> 
 <p>After the second round ended, the Blossom competition officially entered its final phase. Except for the girls Bai Xiaofei knew had no intention of competing, the remaining 100 plus participants were busy preparing. A variety of canvassing set off wave after wave of excitement in Starnet. From the initial 500 to this point, almost all the remaining 150 people now had huge fan clubs. Outside of daily classes, those fan clubs turned the academy into a holy place for canvassing votes in their spare time.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, as the initiator of the screening competition, became the focus of attention as he personally organized the voting process.</p> 
 <p>When the final result came out, most people expressed their respect for this competition with surprise – Only 49 of the 100 original rankers stayed!</p> 
 <p>Moreover, the rankings had changed dramatically. Aside from Hu Xian’er who protected her number one throne, Lin Li and Chu Liuyun lost their original positions.</p> 
 <p>Of course, this was nothing unexpected. After the first round, it was a foregone conclusion that those two would slip down the ranks. The biggest attraction of the girls on the Blossom Ranking to the voters was their single status, but both Chu Liuyun and Lin Li conveyed their feelings for Bai Xiaofei in their performances, which in turn greatly impacted their popularity.</p> 
 <p>However, they didn’t regret it and were instead even a little proud. There were things that might earn bad responses if carried out, but if they didn’t do it, they would regret it in many years to come. And the two wanted no regrets.</p> 
 <p>Yet, even after the impact, they still finished fifth and seventh respectively, which showed how important it was to have good looks.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the new second place was far beyond Bai Xiaofei’s imagination.</p> 
 <p>Xue Ying!</p> 
 <p>Her ‘Thousand Image’ play placed her in the limelight, and her lonely figure was deeply rooted in the hearts of many, which skyrocketed her to second place!</p> 
 <p>Third place was a third-year senior. Her performance in the first two rounds could only be described as fairly satisfactory, but in the last canvassing, she revealed her identity as the daughter of the Nightingale mercenary group leader. The amount of people trying to ingratiate themselves with the group easily won her enough votes to obtain a Feature Locking Pill!</p> 
 <p>During the prize awards, Bai Xiaofei’s heart ached. He thought the top three places would end up with his own people, but one had actually slipped from their grasp!</p> 
 <p><em>My five billion!!!</em></p> 
 <p>However, no matter what, the promise had been made, and it was too late to regret.</p> 
 <p>At the closing ceremony, Yun Jingshuang appeared and announced that he was passing the position of the Blossom Pavilion leader to Bai Xiaofei. Just as he expected, this was quickly accepted by everyone. Some had even taken it for granted. With Bai Xiaofei’s fame in Starnet, it was more than enough to be the leader of the Blossom Pavilion.</p> 
 <p>However, when Bai Xiaofei settled into the position, he was dumbfounded.</p> 
 <p>“This is the list of this year’s Blossom Ranking and the personal information that the girls are willing to disclose. You’d better memorize this as soon as possible because you won’t want to violate any taboos when dealing with them. Also, there will definitely be people asking about the Blossom Ranking, especially those who are about to graduate. In such a situation, you have to distinguish those outsiders, tell the real, powerful from the swindlers, and then help match the girls according to their requirements, that is, you’ll be a matchmaker. Also…”</p> 
 <p>“Stop!” cutting off Yun Jingshuang who didn’t seem to have any intention to stop talking, the profusely sweating Bai Xiaofei gulped with difficulty. “Is there still time for me to go back on my word? I don’t want your family’s mines. I just want you to let me go!”</p> 
 <p>His eyes full of remorse, Bai Xiaofei now knew what it meant by ‘why you would rather not do it.’</p> 
 <p>“You tell me. Is something you promised in front of so many people something you can go back on as you please? Even if you don’t care about your face, you still have to stay in Starnet. How do you think your stay will be after you mess with the Blossom Ranking?” With a smile, Yun Jingshuang blocked Bai Xiaofei’s retreat as if he had anticipated this. “Alright, let us continue…”</p> 
 <p>The long handover resumed, and Bai Xiaofei didn’t leave for a whole week after he entered the Blossom Pavilion.</p> 
 <p>When he finally returned to the Demon of Illusions, the girls could see two words on his face – Worn out…</p> 
 <p>Only after a whole day of sleep did Bai Xiaofei get out and about. He thanked Yun Jingshuang for liberating him. As the guy said, he just wanted to let Bai Xiaofei familiarize himself with the business first. While he was still in Starnet, he would help Bai Xiaofei deal with the Blossom Ranking.</p> 
 <p>After returning to the Demon of Illusions, Bai Xiaofei finally lived a normal life as a student, taking classes, studying puppets, tempering his skills, and strengthening his six abilities. Reality proved that Bai Xiaofei could still be a good student as his learning ability soon conquered the teachers, even if they were all from other departments…</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei could no longer tolerate that kind of life after less than a week.</p> 
 <p>Too dull!</p> 
 <p>However, now, no one in Starnet would be so stupid as come to him looking for trouble. There was no chance for any excitement even if he yearned it.</p> 
 <p><em>Is this the legendary ‘it's lonely at the top’?</em></p> 
 <p>However, it seemed that even Heaven couldn’t stand Bai Xiaofei’s dawdling. Just when he felt that he was going to die idle, the arrival of a person gave him hope.</p> 
 <p>Qin Lingyan!</p> 
 <p>What mattered most was not Qin Lingyan, but the news she brought.</p> 
 <p>“I took a mission on the Starnet Ranking, and now I still lack one teammate. Do you want to come?”</p> 
 <p>“What mission?” His eyes shining brightly, Bai Xiaofei looked like he was holding onto his last lifeline.</p> 
 <p>“Hunting a thief group. This mission was announced by the president of a small merchant group. Word is that they are being targeted by a famous thief group, so they sent a request for help. The reward is bountiful,” Qin Lingyan calmly explained.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s concern wasn’t whether the reward was good. The important thing was that he could leave the academy!</p> 
 <p>“Can I bring a few people?” After thinking for a moment, Bai Xiaofei struggled to ask a question with a frown.</p> 
 <p>“No!”</p> 
 <p>Before Bai Xiaofei could list who he wanted to bring, Qin Lingyan cleanly rejected him.</p> 
 <p>“It’s said on the Starnet Ranking that only five are allowed to participate in this mission. I have already invited three, and there is only one place left. If you don’t come, I will find someone else.”</p> 
 <p>Qin Lingyan said and pretended to leave. Bai Xiaofei instantly panicked.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t don’t don’t don’t! I’m not bringing anyone, not bringing anyone! I’m coming! Don’t find anyone else!”</p> 
 <p>At that moment, Bai Xiaofei didn’t consider if Qin Lingyan had any ulterior motives at all. All he could think about was to escape his currently tedious life. This was his first opportunity to officially set foot on the continent!</p>
