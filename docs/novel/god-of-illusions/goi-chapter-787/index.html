 <p>Chapter 787: The Show Begins!</p> 
 <p>The lucky draw ended with the first prize going to a stranger who had not bought anything expensive.</p> 
 <p>Rui Mengqi was very efficient, having summoned everyone except for Wang Hang’s team. After Bai Xiaofei paid for his items, his eyes fell upon the crowd in the room and he chuckled. This line-up could even challenge the entire Windlove City, let alone a few so-called bosses!</p> 
 <p>“You guys remember what I said?” Bai Xiaofei reconfirmed for the last time and got a nod from everyone.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Blood Wolf and Strong Steel stared in shock. <em>These Grandmaster Rank youngsters want to challenge Dragon King and them? They don’t want to live anymore?!</em></p> 
 <p>Originally, the two experts thought that Bai Xiaofei was calling at least six or seven Exquisite Rank puppet masters, or else, given the angry crowd outside, their death would be certain! And yet…</p> 
 <p>Blood Wolf and Strong Steel deemed it impossible to get out of the auction house alive, but looking at the group of young people, they began to doubt themselves.</p> 
 <p><em>Why aren’t they afraid at all?! Could it be that I’m really too old…</em></p> 
 <p>“Erm, Young Master, the two of us…” Unable to figure it out, the two still had expectations for Bai Xiaofei’s ‘background.’ After all, they could not just abandon their new master and run away… because he could still completely crush them in strength.</p> 
 <p>“Just do what you’ve always done: follow me,” Bai Xiaofei replied.</p> 
 <p>With that, Bai Xiaofei assigned missions to everyone except for Blood Wolf and Strong Steel. The two gulped nervously.</p> 
 <p><em>So you’re just using us as targets!!</em></p> 
 <p>The two were extremely unwilling. However, at the thought that Bai Xiaofei himself was also a target, they reluctantly swallowed back their objection. All they could do now was pray for a miracle.</p> 
 <p>Getting their missions, everyone withdrew, leaving only Bai Xiaofei, Rui Mengqi, and the two experts in the room.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, I know they can’t wait.” Bai Xiaofei laughed and walked out.</p> 
 <p>Unify Business seemed to deliberately encourage their guests to fight each other for the items after the auction, as the auction site was ten minutes away from Windlove City.</p> 
 <p>Normally, a ten-minute journey was nothing, but in this area, it was enough to create a massacre zone, especially with a bamboo forest in the way.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had made preparations, but so had the people who were preying on him. ‘The enemy of your enemy is a friend,’ a proverb that was well implemented by these ‘hunters.’ All those who wanted a piece of the fat meat called Bai Xiaofei somehow had gathered together. Among them, there were three especially fierce parties – the Devil Forest Mercenary Group, Dragon King, and the shill-bidding alliance who had been tricked by Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Compared to them, the rest were only small fries. However, none of those who dared to get involved were below the Grandmaster Rank!</p> 
 <p>Possibly 80% of the experts in Windlove had gathered for this battle. The bamboo forest was destined to welcome bloodshed!</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei seemed to have not anticipated this at all, leading the group into the bamboo forest like a naive fool.</p> 
 <p>“He’s here!” a scout immediately delivered the news.</p> 
 <p>In the headquarters of the temporary alliance, Zhu Wuxin snorted coldly, his face full of murderous intent. “We’ll be at the front!”</p> 
 <p>Zhu Wuxin would never make this kind of decision normally. However, after judging the strength of both sides, he thought it was safe to say that Bai Xiaofei was going to die for sure. Moreover, Bai Xiaofei really pissed him off!</p> 
 <p>Upon Zhu Wuxin’s order, the Devil Forest members hiding in the bamboo forest immediately moved.</p> 
 <p>The reason they chose the name Devil Forest was that the puppets of most members were plant-type. They were not strong alone, but when in a large group, they were not scared of anyone, especially when the battlefield was full of plants!</p> 
 <p>The originally calm bamboo forest suddenly grew restless. Several bamboo trees near Bai Xiaofei seemed to come to life and began to shake wildly.</p> 
 <p>“Killing Leaf Formation!”</p> 
 <p>A heavy shout echoed and the falling bamboo leaves suddenly became sharp as they shot towards Bai Xiaofei’s group of four from all directions.</p> 
 <p>“Divine Beast Transformation, Blood-Devour Wolf King!”</p> 
 <p>Completing his transformation in the blink of an eye, Blood Wolf howled to the sky. Being engulfed by the sonic attack, all of the bamboo leaves dispersed and fell feebly.</p> 
 <p>Blood Wolf’s Exquisite Rank was not just for show!</p> 
 <p>After transforming, Blood Wolf’s five senses were greatly enhanced. He instantly located all of the enemies hiding in the forest.</p> 
 <p>“Go. Kill as many as you can, don’t worry about me.” Bai Xiaofei noticed Blood Wolf’s hesitation and gave him the go-ahead.</p> 
 <p>How powerful was a transformed Exquisite Rank who recklessly charged into a camp full of Grandmaster Ranks? Blood Wolf decided to find the answer with practical action.</p> 
 <p>With Blood Wolf rushing into the forest, the pressure on the remaining three plummeted as half of the enemies in the field were busy dealing with Blood Wolf’s hunt!</p> 
 <p>“You go too, or I’m afraid I’ll accidentally hurt you,” Bai Xiaofei said lightly.</p> 
 <p>Hearing that, Strong Steel shot out like a bullet, but in a different direction from Blood Wolf.</p> 
 <p>While Strong Steel did not dare to go against Bai Xiaofei, it did not mean that he was a weakling. Otherwise, he would not be ranked among Shaman King and the likes, and he was the only one among the many Grandmaster Ranks in Windlove to achieve this!</p> 
 <p>With the two experts deployed, the enemies from two directions were blocked. However, Bai Xiaofei also lost the bodyguards that the opponents were apprehensive of. The next second, a large group of people rushed towards him, many of them glowing colorfully as Ranged Stream puppet masters started to fire attacks.</p> 
 <p><em>With this many Grandmaster Ranks, one attack from each should be enough to blow him into pieces!</em></p> 
 <p>This was everyone’s thought, but when all sorts of colorful attacks rained down on Bai Xiaofei, they were shocked silly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, with open arms and without using any defensive measures, stood in front of Rui Mengqi to welcome the attacks. The imagined explosion did not appear as the attacks were strangely distorted around Bai Xiaofei before slowly turning into pure energy and absorbed into his body.</p> 
 <p>With the Endless State and Devouring the Heaven and Earth combined, all energy attacks were just nourishment for him, and Grandmaster Rank attacks did not exceed the limit of what he could take.</p> 
 <p>“It would be rude if we don’t return their favor, so…”</p> 
 <p>Behind Bai Xiaofei, Rui Mengqi laughed sinisterly, and a Recording Eyeball slowly flew into the air…</p>
