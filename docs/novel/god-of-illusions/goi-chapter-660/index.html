 <p>Chapter 660: Dueling Cang Lan! The Might of God Control!</p> 
 <p>As soon as Cang Lan’s voice fell, Bai Xiaofei was on alert. Although the old man had suppressed his rank to Grandmaster, he still had knowledge and experience. He could still do certain things that actual Grandmaster Ranks could not, which could not be helped when they had become a part of his instinct.</p> 
 <p>Moreover, Bai Xiaofei had already used almost all of his killer moves in the previous series of attacks. His power boost abilities were still constantly in high consumption while he had no idea when this match would last, so he dared not be too reckless.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, he could only watch Cang Lan fight back!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, however, did not have a well-disposed character. If he didn’t at least take some advantage of such a good opportunity, he wouldn’t be Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“As expected of a senior. Even your escape is so clean and neat. This is my first time seeing such a high-level carapace,” said Bai Xiaofei very slowly.</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan was so furious that his head spun.</p> 
 <p>“You brat! I’ll see if your mouth can still be this smart in a while!” roared Cang Lan who instantly launched an attack.</p> 
 <p>He himself didn’t move, but one of the three red glows around him dimmed. The next second, a small blood-red flag floated up. With a surge of wind, a scorching mass of fire was then blown toward Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Bai Xiaofei’s face was lit with pleasant surprise. <em>A pillow when I just got sleepy, I’ll gladly take it!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei rushed directly toward the sea of fire without scruple. Seeing this, Cang Lan frowned.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t be stupid enough to charge right towards death, so Cang Lan bet that this guy must be trying to distract him again. He immediately sent out the other two red glows, which revealed a shield and a short blade inside.</p> 
 <p>However, this time he really thought too much…</p> 
 <p>During the time Cang Lan thought and made his move, Bai Xiaofei went directly through the sea of fire that he deemed impossible to pass and continued toward him at a terrifying speed!</p> 
 <p>Despite feeling something amiss about this Bai Xiaofei, Cang Lan was not stupid enough to sit still. The short blade instantly floated in front of Cang Lan and multiplied. In just a brief second, a blade forest shot out at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Cang Lan placed his attention on his surroundings. In his view, a thousand blades were enough to deal with a fake image.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei, in the face of the incoming blades, suddenly flashed and teleported directly in front of Cang Lan. A palm fused with enormous energy landed on the latter’s chest as he was caught off guard, sending him flying.</p> 
 <p>This was far from the end. While Cang Lan flew backward, Bai Xiaofei took a big step and caught up. He definitely would not miss this rare opportunity!</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Bai Xiaofei’s opponent was Cang Lan, a man standing at the top of the continent. Being overwhelmed by a Grandmaster Rank was something that could never happen to him!</p> 
 <p>The shield floating in midair instantly blocked Bai Xiaofei. A giant light screen spread and bounced him flying back like a bullet. While Bai Xiaofei’s blood billowed wildly after the impact, the blade forest had once again located their target and rained down on his head.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had no choice but to teleport again. The blades fell onto empty ground.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Cang Lan had stabilized himself and was simply flying back. Two successive defeats had brought him to the brink of fury. If it weren’t for Bai Xiaofei’s flustered manner due to his counter-attack, he would have forgotten that Bai Xiaofei was a junior.</p> 
 <p>However, it was hard to remain calm for long in front of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“That fire just now was really warm and comfortable. Come again, please? All the energy I absorbed from it was used up in the two teleportations just now.” Bai Xiaofei crawled back up with a sleazy grin, as if not realizing the danger directed at him.</p> 
 <p>His verbal attack successfully achieved his purpose. Cang Lan was truly angry now…</p> 
 <p>“Unbelievable, you have fulfilled the wish of that boy Gu Xing and mastered Devouring the Heaven and Earth, getting it to the Endless State even. No wonder you came to me to learn God Control. Your body should be unable to hold up for long,” Cang Lan said coldly, stabbing Bai Xiaofei where it hurt.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei’s response was a faint smile and a deep disdain on his face.</p> 
 <p>“So what? At worst, the time I can use Spiritualization is shortened, and it’ll still be enough in normal battles.” Bai Xiaofei was nonchalant. “And that has just been confirmed, hasn’t it? If you weren’t a Legend Rank, you would have been down on the ground now.”</p> 
 <p>Coldly staring at Cang Lan, Bai Xiaofei then shook his fist.</p> 
 <p>“Come on, let me witness how strong the Legend Rank really is! In return, I’ll also show you how far my strength exceeds your imagination!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s words didn’t earn any recognition from Cang Lan. The anger of a Legend Rank expert could not be dispelled by just mere words, not to mention that the speaker himself didn’t have any persuasiveness at all.</p> 
 <p>However, Cang Lan was going to respect Bai Xiaofei this once and show him how far he was from the Legend Rank!</p> 
 <p>“In fact, God Control is my only puppet.”</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan raised his right arm, and the bandage wrapping it slipped down with a surge of origin energy, revealing a prosthetic arm made from a mix of unknown purple jade, black metal, with golden threads running along it. The moment the bandage was untied, Bai Xiaofei already felt a faint threat from it.</p> 
 <p>Now, Bai Xiaofei had seen all three of the legendary puppets for himself, and this God Control was the one which gave him the greatest pressure!</p> 
 <p>“But God Control itself allows me to break through the limit of puppet numbers. As long as it is an unowned puppet, I can achieve perfect control over it through God Control, and even for those that have a master, I can make an impact on them to a certain extent,” Cang Lan introduced as his origin energy poured into the arm.</p> 
 <p>The next second, at least twenty glows of different colors of light emerged from nowhere and quietly drifted around Cang Lan. They were puppets, and none was below red grade!</p> 
 <p>“I will only attack once. No matter what method you use to avoid it, if you succeed you might have a chance at learning God Control!”</p> 
 <p>All of the glows then dimmed and the puppets entered their charging state!</p> 
 <p>“Come, brat, let me see how good you are!”</p>
