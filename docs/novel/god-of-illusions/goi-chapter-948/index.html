 <p>Chapter 948: One Tiny Clue Reveals the General Trend!</p> 
 <p>“Elegy City is ahead. We will rest for 30 minutes and enter the city!”</p> 
 <p>The month-long journey so far had made everyone complain nonstop. Upon hearing that they finally got to stop at a city, they instantly perked up.</p> 
 <p>“We’ve passed through so many cities and never entered one. Why is this time different?” Bai Xiaofei walked up to Ye Xi and asked curiously. He did not think that she did this because of everyone’s complaints.</p> 
 <p>“Elegy is a very special city. Here, all those who sacrificed for Moonlight have a plaque. Every soldier passing by will stop to show respect,” replied Ye Xi slowly, her voice slow and sorrowful.</p> 
 <p>Many names left in this city were familiar to her…</p> 
 <p>“Actually, you can try to use men, it will be less hard on you,” Bai Xiaofei sincerely suggested.</p> 
 <p>His reply was a cold snort from Ye Xi. “If men are reliable, pigs can fly. You think we don’t know how miserable women in other countries are? Caring for their home, chores all day long, only to get beaten up and scolded when the men are slightly unhappy. We’d rather sacrifice our lives instead of having to live that kind of life.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was speechless. This was indeed true in many places.</p> 
 <p>However, it was a bit extreme to think like Ye Xi. Good men like Yun Lan existed.</p> 
 <p>“Then, what is the reason for the servant contest? Don’t tell me it’s just to pick a servant for the emperor. But if that’s the case, you guys will be no different from those bad men you despise,” Bai Xiaofei guided the topic toward what he wanted to know, but unfortunately, Ye Xi had no plan to elaborate.</p> 
 <p>“If you have enough rest, get prepared. We still have at least two hours on the road. Save your energy.” She got up and left.</p> 
 <p>Helpless, Bai Xiaofei returned to his carriage.</p> 
 <p>“Failed again?” Tan Xin mocked as soon as he entered.</p> 
 <p>“Moonlight’s prejudice against men is just too… Although they are right on some points, it’s a bit too extreme. At this rate, problems will arise sooner or later,” commented Bai Xiaofei with a sigh.</p> 
 <p>“Spare me all that stuff. Their empire has existed and thrived for so many years, how can it just go wrong as soon as you come? You’d better focus on the competition. Maybe they’ll ask you to put on a performance or something. Everyone else is practicing hard!” Tan Xin smiled evilly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei felt his scalp tingle at the word ‘performance.’</p> 
 <p>The other contestants had really broadened his horizons. There was really no limit to how far they could go!</p> 
 <p><em>Have they really thrown away all of their dignity?!</em></p> 
 <p>Seeing Bai Xiaofei getting all torn up, Tan Xin laughed out loud. Then, her face suddenly became serious. “Have you noticed something problematic?”</p> 
 <p>“Which do you mean? There are definitely more than one here.” Bai Xiaofei sighed. This period of time in Moonlight was definitely the most humbling one he had ever lived.</p> 
 <p>“Along the way, we have been ambushed by bandits twelve times, and each time they were obviously targeting those guards. If it weren’t for the two of us, I don’t think they wouldn’t even be able to make it here. Moreover, although it all stopped after we reached the vicinity of Elegy City, I always have a feeling that someone is watching us,” said Tan Xin as she looked out the window but still failed to find anything.</p> 
 <p>“The bandits are working for someone,” Bai Xiaofei uttered.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin was stunned. She asked, “For whom?”</p> 
 <p>“The Sacks,” he replied.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin’s eyes widened in shock.</p> 
 <p>“It should be impossible for those bandits to know that the guards have the power of sealing, but in their ambushes, it was obvious that they deliberately guarded against this. Therefore, someone must be behind them, guiding them,” Bai Xiaofei explained. “And no one else but the Sacks would want to target Moonlight ex-border soldiers.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Tan Xin frowned.</p> 
 <p>“What does the Sacks want? And what do those bandits get out of this? No matter how I see it, the loss outweighs the gain!” she asked in confusion.</p> 
 <p>“I asked that iceberg about the border situation, and she said that their soldiers would rotate once every three months there so they could get some rest. This method is definitely not a good thing for the Sacks, so they began to attack the soldier supply. That means the soldiers who would be sent to the border next can only be new recruits.” Bai Xiaofei had roughly figured out the Sacks’ plan despite having never been to the border battlefield. Then he sighed. “As for those bandits, it is very likely that they have not benefited at all.”</p> 
 <p>“Then why are they still risking their lives?” Tan Xin was in shock. She just could not understand it.</p> 
 <p>“At first, I couldn’t understand either, but having contacted the people in the Black Dragon Swarm, I did. Where there is oppression, there is resistance. Most of the bandits are men, and the conflict between them and Moonlight has gotten to the point that they just can’t wait to overthrow it. So, when the Sacks threw out bait, they took it,” Bai Xiaofei analyzed. “Therefore, it’s very likely that the Sacks gave them some verbal promises that drove them to put their lives on the line. They probably think they are devoting themselves to a great cause.”</p> 
 <p>This made complete sense, and Tan Xin believed that it was the cause as it explained the mountain bandits’ actions.</p> 
 <p>To put it simply, they were utilizing guerrilla warfare to sap away at Moonlight’s energy and create a favorable condition for the Sacks to win the border war.</p> 
 <p>“Get ready to hit the road!”</p> 
 <p>The 30-minute rest time came to an end. As the carriage started moving, Tan Xin’s mind was filled with the Sacks.</p> 
 <p>“Wait, I remember that the Sacks are famous as barbarians. All that has happened so far doesn’t seem like what they are capable of!” She finally realized something.</p> 
 <p>“That was before. Before, it was absolutely impossible for them to push Moonlight to this state. But now, I’m afraid that they have learned, which is why I really want to pay the border a visit.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei paused, his eyes fervent.</p> 
 <p>“I can’t wait to meet the person who changed the Sacks!”</p>
