 <p>Chapter 770: Taking a Walk!</p> 
 <p>Being beaten down by Bai Xiaofei, Blood Wolf was filled with shock. He sensed clearly that Bai Xiaofei didn’t use any power above that of the Grandmaster Rank. The reason why he emerged victorious was due to his abnormal physical strength and strange ability.</p> 
 <p>To put it simply, it was suppression from quality, the quality of Bai Xiaofei’s puppets helped him suppress someone of a higher rank!</p> 
 <p>Crawling up from the ground, Blood Wolf was feeling extremely unwilling, but when he looked at the mighty-looking Bai Xiaofei, he could not muster any courage to rush up again. What was the use, to only be bullied further?</p> 
 <p>However, if he chickened out, he’d lose face. If the news that he was crushed by a Grandmaster Rank got out, he would become the laughing stock of Windlove. Therefore, Blood Wolf was caught between a rock and a hard place.</p> 
 <p>“If you are troubled and don’t know how to announce this to the public, then you are overly worried. What happens here will only be known by everyone present,” Bai Xiaofei suddenly said.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, he deactivated Spiritualization. Whether it was fusing with Blackie or Huskie, he had to carefully control the duration, otherwise, he might have to say goodbye to his life at any time. However, thanks to the strange woman in the Holy Snow Mountain and his mastery of God Control, the cooldown time of his puppets for Spiritualization had been greatly shortened and compensated to this disadvantage to some extent.</p> 
 <p>Of course, no one else knew about this. In their eyes, Bai Xiaofei only dared to exit the transformation because he had no fear at all!</p> 
 <p>Seeing no response from Blood Wolf and Strong Steel, Bai Xiaofei added, “Moreover, I have a very bad habit. If I don’t get something or someone I want, I will destroy it by hook or by crook.” His eyes emitted horrifying murderous intent as he gently stroked Blackie’s fur, which had lost its luster after withdrawing from Spiritualization.</p> 
 <p>After a moment of silence, Blood Wolf slowly withdrew from his Divine Beast Transformation and knelt in front of Bai Xiaofei. “Blood Wolf greets the Lord.”</p> 
 <p>In Windlove City, no one was tactless. Not to mention for people like Blood Wolf who were constantly schemed against and had enemies that might come to the door at any time, it was not necessarily a bad thing to have a reliable backer.</p> 
 <p><em>What’s more, he’s already so powerful at such a young age. Just how much power does he have behind him?</em></p> 
 <p>Poor Blood Wolf had no idea that Bai Xiaofei was already the biggest backer of this group…</p> 
 <p>“What about you?” Bai Xiaofei turned to Strong Steel, who had been watching, but was scared witless before he even found an opportunity to help his friend. “Do you want to fight me, or fight Blood Wolf and Shaman King?”</p> 
 <p>Upon Bai Xiaofei’s question, Strong Steel responded immediately, “Strong Steel greets the Lord.”</p> 
 <p>Seeing the two experts yield to him, Bai Xiaofei smiled and said faintly, “Mengqi, tell me what they should pay attention to when they follow me.”</p> 
 <p>With that, he walked out, perfectly demonstrating the image of a young master with an enormous background.</p> 
 <p>“Please rise. Starting today, call him young master as he doesn’t like any other terms of address. On another note, don’t even have any idea of betraying him, because then you will die miserably. Finally, good news for you, our young master is very good to his people. Believe me, your future is definitely going to get much better,” Rui Mengqi slowly recited the speech that she had prepared.</p> 
 <p>Blood Wolf and Strong Steel listened as if it was an imperial edict, not daring to miss a word.</p> 
 <p>Watching this, Shaman King’s dejection instantly lessened. Now that he was not the only one, others would only say that Bai Xiaofei had a high status and not that he, Shaman King, was a coward. That was how great a difference between one and more than one was!</p> 
 <p>Moreover, given the fact that he was the first to submit to Bai Xiaofei, albeit for only a short time ahead of the others, it was not a problem for him to stand out a little among the rest with some careful planning. At this thought, Shaman King had a little more expectation for his future…</p> 
 <p>Once again, seeing Bai Xiaofei bring out Blood Wolf and Strong Steel, Snakehead was completely conquered. Bai Xiaofei was no longer just a god of wealth in his eyes, but an absolute boss who he could not afford to anger!</p> 
 <p>“Master, are we going to find Absolute Blade next?” asked Snakehead.</p> 
 <p>“Or else?” Bai Xiaofei asked back.</p> 
 <p>Snakehead immediately closed his mouth as his heart started to drum like crazy. <em>Damn mouth, that was completely unnecessary!</em></p> 
 <p>However, just as Snakehead was about to lead the way, Blood Wolf suddenly spoke.</p> 
 <p>“Master, if it’s Absolute Blade, there’s no need to go.”</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter?” Bai Xiaofei turned around with a frown. <em>This long march is only short of the last destination, and you’re telling me to stop?</em></p> 
 <p>“He is dead,” said Blood Wolf.</p> 
 <p>Except for Strong Steel, the rest looked surprised.</p> 
 <p><em>One of the famous experts in Windlove is dead?! And yet there’s no news about it?!</em></p> 
 <p>“What happened?” In order to show his superiority of being first, Shaman King asked in Bai Xiaofei’s stead.</p> 
 <p>One had to admit that this was a beautiful move. At least, Bai Xiaofei was not displeased, because he also wanted his underling group to have a leader, which would save him a lot of trouble.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know who he provoked. Two days ago, we left the city for some business and saw him fighting with a group of people. Finally, he lost and died. Those people took him away. We couldn’t see clearly enough to tell who those people were. We only know that their actions were unified, and their clothes and abilities are all we have never seen before,” Blood Wolf recounted.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s brows tightened. It seemed that there were more than just him who were sniping the experts!</p> 
 <p><em>But what is their purpose? Is it the same as mine?!</em> Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but sigh. <em>This Windlove City is getting messy!</em></p> 
 <p>“Young Master, are we…” Shaman King carefully went up to Bai Xiaofei and asked softly in a manner as if he had been around Bai Xiaofei for a long time.</p> 
 <p>“Find a place to rest, I am tired,” Bai Xiaofei said casually like the death of Absolute Blade was nothing big. “The one over there, you can go and hand in your mission.”</p> 
 <p>As a nervous Snakehead didn’t know how to speak up, Bai Xiaofei was actually nice enough to remember him.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you, Master! Lil’ Fish is leaving now! I wish you great achievements in Windlove City!” Snakehead was greatly relieved.</p> 
 <p>After the departure of Snakehead, Bai Xiaofei led his three new underlings to find a place to rest, but soon, they realized that his purpose was not this at all!</p> 
 <p>He was taking them on a walk!</p>
