 <p>Chapter 897: In-depth Communication!</p> 
 <p>Accepting the gracious invitation of the First Prince, Bai Xiaofei boarded his sedan, on which they chatted absent-mindedly along the way and tried to get to know each other until they arrived at the residence of the First Prince.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai, please come in.”</p> 
 <p>“No, Your Highness, you are my senior. After you.”</p> 
 <p>The First Prince was polite but Bai Xiaofei was even more so. He didn’t dare to be reckless in Ethereal, where he was only a passer-by. He did not wish to be sacrificed in their competition for the throne.</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t expect you to be so cautious, little brother.” The First Prince laughed and got off the sedan first. However, he didn’t leave but extended his hand to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“You’re not refusing this too, are you?” Every blow traded between experts was fatal. This time, Bai Xiaofei really couldn’t refuse.</p> 
 <p>The resting chamber of the First Prince was a small palace in essence with all the facilities one needed. Even the servant area was luxurious.</p> 
 <p>“Ask Madam to prepare a table of drinks and side dishes. I want to get drunk with Brother Bai!” instructed the First Prince to a servant as soon as he entered the yard. The ‘Madam’ he mentioned was his wife – the youngest daughter of the Imperial Preceptor, who was also the biggest reliance of the First Prince to date.</p> 
 <p>“Come with me, little brother, I have a lot to say to you. I didn’t know what it means ‘to meet each other too late’ until I saw you today.” The First Prince laughed, and his enthusiasm was in stark contrast with his indifference to the former Imperial Guard commander earlier.</p> 
 <p>Going all the way to the First Prince’s study and seeing a similarly simple layout like the emperor’s study, Bai Xiaofei officially witnessed the power of having a good role model. With such a great emperor leading the nation, his princes certainly would not be extravagant!</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness, I didn’t expect you to be such a person of simplicity.” Bai Xiaofei took the initiative to open up the conversation.</p> 
 <p>The First Prince naturally knew that those were only words of courtesy. “Why care too much about external things, right? How about you, little brother, are you here in Ethereal to settle down? If so, tell me if you need anything. I can’t decide anything too big in this imperial city, but small things are not a problem,” he started with an important matter and ended with a polite offer.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t plan to stay long, only fulfilling what is entrusted to me,” Bai Xiaofei answered truthfully as he pondered. <em>How do I do it? Go straight to the point or beat around the bush?</em></p> 
 <p>“Oh, is that so? Then I’d like to use this opportunity to present to you the customs of Ethereal. I currently still have quite many matters at hand. When I’m finished with them, I’ll show you around personally.” Once again giving out a blank check of courtesy, the First Prince inwardly felt conflicted.</p> 
 <p>It would make things a lot easier to deal with if Bai Xiaofei intended to stay in Ethereal, but he only wanted to interfere in this race to the throne without any worry. This was the last answer that the First Prince wanted to hear.</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness, do you know why I was willing to come to your place?” Bai Xiaofei suddenly got straight to business.</p> 
 <p>Going straight to the point was Bai Xiaofei’s final decision as he did not have a lot of time. There were four more princes that he needed to get to know, the rectification of the Imperial Guard had just started, the direction of the Yun clan hadn’t yet been decided, and the human puppet matter still hadn’t made any progress after all.</p> 
 <p>The First Prince instantly understood what Bai Xiaofei meant. Taking a deep breath, his expression became serious.</p> 
 <p>“Little brother, do you know that I am actually stuck in a difficult position just as you are?”</p> 
 <p>The lamenting tone immediately made Bai Xiaofei assume an all-ears attitude.</p> 
 <p>“Although Ethereal seems peaceful on the surface, the reason why we can have this kind of peace is because us brothers coexist.”</p> 
 <p>“Moonlight and Ethereal have never stopped having territorial disputes. Only thanks to Ling Ming constantly mediating between can the two empires have this current peace.”</p> 
 <p>“The Ethereal Merchant Group is an important financial source of our empire. It has been under Ling Zong’s management for so many years that if anyone else takes his place, whether they have the ability or not, the takeover alone will be enough to shake its foundation.”</p> 
 <p>“Similarly, the existence of Ling Hai stabilizes the Holy Puppetsmith Mountain. Although the contract has been signed, it’s him who communicates with the Mountain every year and keeps updating the contents of the contract. If it was anyone else, the Holy Puppetsmith Mountain likely will not give them face.”</p> 
 <p>“Ling Fan assumed the diplomatic role and has been coordinating countless concerning matters. Without him, I can’t even imagine there would be a second person who can always ensure Ethereal’s rights and interests in diplomacy. “</p> 
 <p>“This time, my father suddenly summoned the five of us and made us compete with each other. I know that no matter who wins in the end, the remaining four are bound to harbor negative feelings and may even choose to leave the imperial city, but Ethereal can’t afford any such departure.”</p> 
 <p>With a long, earnest speech, the First Prince let Bai Xiaofei understand why the Ethereal emperor needed his help. The old man certainly knew the situation of Ethereal better than the First Prince. Therefore, his real purpose was to find a way to unite these brothers forever.</p> 
 <p><em>Damnit! Old man, your requirement is sure as hell difficult!</em></p> 
 <p>“Your Highness, have you ever thought of a solution?” Bai Xiaofei tried to throw the problem back to the First Prince, but his answer was a wry smile and a harsh reminder of reality from the latter.</p> 
 <p>“Little brother, do you think such a solution, if it exists, would be appropriate coming from me? Or do you not realize the importance of your current position?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had admitted that this hit the bull’s eye.</p> 
 <p>“If one day, I find an opportunity for you brothers to sit together, would you like to have a good chat with them?” he asked.</p> 
 <p>“If there is such a day, I will definitely be the first to arrive,” replied the First Prince immediately without any hesitation, his expression solemn and his voice firm and sincere. He truly looked forward to it!</p> 
 <p>“I understand, Your Highness. Then, I’ll have to apologize to you for missing this meal. Please help me say sorry to the madam,” Bai Xiaofei said and got up.</p> 
 <p>The First Prince followed and stood up with a knowing smile. “That is not a problem. I will always reserve a meal for you, little brother.”</p> 
 <p>With that smile, the First Prince once again showed his demeanor befitting an emperor!</p>
