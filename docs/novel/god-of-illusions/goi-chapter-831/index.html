 <p>Chapter 831: Lin Li’s Significant Other; Graduation!</p> 
 <p>“Yes, there will definitely be!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei provided a solid positive answer after a short silence. He could not imagine a future where he did not get to reunite with the group of people in front of him.</p> 
 <p>“Then I am relieved, but we still have another question,” Fang Ye continued after getting a satisfactory answer. This time with a slightly hostile expression.</p> 
 <p><em>Damn, this brat wants to scheme against me!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately realized something was wrong, but before he could stop Fang Ye, the latter had already blurted out.</p> 
 <p>“We should be able to attend your wedding with Li Li in our lifetime, right?”</p> 
 <p>“Yes!”</p> 
 <p>“You better hurry up!”</p> 
 <p>“Have lots of babies!”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>Everyone immediately chimed in. Embarrassed, Bai Xiaofei looked over at the other person of interest and was flustered to see that Lin Li was looking at him with anticipation.</p> 
 <p>“Li Li is the best girl I know. If I could, I’d love for tomorrow to be that day, but now it’s not the time for us. However, Li Li can only be mine!” Bai Xiaofei spoke slowly and firmly.</p> 
 <p>The whole class fell silent for a moment. Then, deafening cheers erupted.</p> 
 <p>“At last!!! Class Monitor confessed!!!” Qi Wei screamed, and the rest chanted alongside her.</p> 
 <p>In such an atmosphere, Bai Xiaofei walked toward Lin Li, who was desperately holding back the tears in her eyes.</p> 
 <p>From an innocent girl to a domineering queen in battles, Lin Li could be said to have changed completely because of Bai Xiaofei. However, during the past four years, she felt she was getting farther and farther away from him, even worse than those who appeared around him later.</p> 
 <p>Lin Li did not know how many times she woke up in tears from the dream that Bai Xiaofei forgot about her. Only she could acutely feel this pain that outsiders, and even Bai Xiaofei, could never understand.</p> 
 <p>“Sorry, I am a little late to this confession. Will you wait for me? I will go to the Love Burying Mountain to find you and take you, this most beautiful girl in the world, to be my wife. Will you give me that chance?” With a foolish smile, Bai Xiaofei knelt on one knee and reached out his hand to Lin Li.</p> 
 <p>The tears in Lin’s eyes unwillingly fell as she gently placed her hand in his.</p> 
 <p>“I always want to be in the same bedroom as you, that is my initial dream!” Sniffling, Lin Li successfully made everyone laugh.</p> 
 <p>With everyone’s blessing, Bai Xiaofei pulled Lin Li into his arms and kissed her.</p> 
 <p>Tender and warm, tantalizing as heaven. Although it was late, it was still so beautiful…</p> 
 <p>“Go, go. What are you looking at? Class is over!” Xu Chen was the first to step out and clear the room. Then, she turned to Fang Ye, her eyes fierce.</p> 
 <p>‘If you don’t make moves like this soon, I’ll hack you to death!’ This was what her expression said.</p> 
 <p>Before long, the room was left with only Lin Li and Bai Xiaofei. She held his arm tightly, not wanting to let go. However, she knew that she could only be with him for a short time.</p> 
 <p>“I have to go back to the Love Burying Mountain, my mother will pick me up tomorrow. She said that if I get with someone who can’t beat her, she won’t hesitate to act. The current you will definitely be killed by her.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Li never lied nor was she ever implicit. Those few sentences made Bai Xiaofei sweat profusely.</p> 
 <p><em>Oh heavens, just how much does she hate men?!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had indeed seen Lin Nishang in action. Recalling the scene of her resisting so many attacks from the Demonic God of Pain, his mouth twitched. She could really kill him with ease…</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, it won’t be long before I go to the Love Burying Mountain. At that time, you will see a brand new me,” Bai Xiaofei declared as he stroked Lin Li’s hair.</p> 
 <p>Although he was still in a half-crippled state…</p> 
 <p>“Mhm, I believe you!” Lin Li smiled and nuzzled in Bai Xiaofei’s embrace. For her, nothing was more worthy of yearning for than in those arms. “Just hold me like this tonight? As a confession gift.”</p> 
 <p>In the face of her request, Bai Xiaofei did not have a reason to refuse. Just like that, he spent the night quietly holding Lin Li…</p> 
 <p>Early the next morning, when Lin Li woke up, Bai Xiaofei had already left. However, she revealed a satisfied smile. She had gotten what she wanted most…</p> 
 <p>The graduation ceremony started on schedule. The third-year students were in full swing making the last bit of preparations, while the seniors were bidding their final farewells.</p> 
 <p>“My dear students, this has always been the most sorrowful time of the year and also the time that I do not want to give a speech. However, I have to because, after today, a group of my lovely students will officially set foot on this continent and make a life for themselves. As your guide, I feel it is necessary to give you some heartfelt advice.”</p> 
 <p>Standing in the center of the square, Lei Shan opened the ceremony with his speech. The entire square quieted down. The graduates stood in the middle and the rest of the students stood along the edges.</p> 
 <p>“First, never forget that Starnet Academy stands behind you!”</p> 
 <p>“Second, never forget that you represent Starnet Academy!”</p> 
 <p>“Third, never forget that your pride is Starnet Academy!”</p> 
 <p>“Fourth, never forget that the pride of Starnet Academy is you!”</p> 
 <p>Lei Shan’s speech was as short as ever, but it set off the first climax of the whole ceremony because he represented Starnet Academy!</p> 
 <p>“I will be honest, the graduates this year are the best ones I have ever seen. You have created many miracles, and I have to admit that among these miracles, the most outstanding is a smelly boy who gives me a headache, so next…”</p> 
 <p>Lei Shan started introducing the next stage, but before he could finish, a big bird flew past and an envelope slowly floated into his hand.</p> 
 <p>The moment he saw the envelope, Lei Shan’s mouth twitched. Sure enough, after he read the letter, his teeth gnashed so hard that they nearly shattered.</p> 
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei, you smelly brat! If you ever dare to come back again, this old man won’t be called Lei Shan if I don’t strike you with my thunder!!!” Lei Shan let out a roar that penetrated the sky. As always, his speech was recorded in the history book of Starnet…</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei, within the Infinite Mountain Range, hurriedly covered his ears.</p> 
 <p>“Heh, fortunately I ran fast. His voice can actually travel all the way here. If I was still within the academy grounds, I’d be really burnt,” mumbling to himself, Bai Xiaofei once picked up his pace.</p> 
 <p><em>Starnet Continent, here I am!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Let the storms come!</em></p>
