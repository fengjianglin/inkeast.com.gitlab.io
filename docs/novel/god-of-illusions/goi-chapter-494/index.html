 <p>Chapter 494: Three-Rule Agreement!</p> 
 <p>A fragrant and sweaty Leng Liuying snuck back into her room like a thief. The flush on her face was in sharp contrast with the anger in her eyes.</p> 
 <p>But as Bai Xiaofei said, she couldn’t tell anyone about it…</p> 
 <p>At most, she would look for opportunities to retaliate back in the future. However, Bai Xiaofei already announced his stand: As long as she dared, he’d definitely returned the favor later, seizing every chance he had!</p> 
 <p><em>Revenge breeds revenge, as they would say. If you can do it, so can I!</em></p> 
 <p>After a night without words, Bai Xiaofei got his revenge and enjoyed a good night’s sleep. Meanwhile, there were thousands who didn’t.</p> 
 <p>The freshmen were too excited!</p> 
 <p>It was similar to Bai Xiaofei’s batch last year. The freshmen were half a step on the ladder to ascend to the sky. As long as they survived the next three months and passed the final test, they would become an existence admired by countless people. Therefore, the excitement was completely understandable.</p> 
 <p>Moreover, this year’s freshmen were lucky because they met Bai Xiaofei, their senior.</p> 
 <p>After getting up early in the morning, Bai Xiaofei went straight to Fang Ye and had all of the Student Community’s executives called over. Upon knowledge of his sudden summons, everyone was full of doubts.</p> 
 <p><em>He cut down a bunch of people in the last gathering. Is something big gonna happen this time…?</em> Everyone felt a sense of unease at this thought.</p> 
 <p>“While it’s not very nice to call you guys over in the early morning like this, but I’m afraid that if I don’t make it clear and a problem occurs in the future, it would be even worse for us all,” Bai Xiaofei started his speech with something that ran a chill down everyone’s spine. Seeing his expression that was as cold as ice, the two dozen executives were dead silent. No one dared to even breathe loudly.</p> 
 <p>This was the advantage of getting rid of dishonest people. It not only removed hidden dangers but also set an example for the rest.</p> 
 <p>“What are you saying, Manager Bai? As members of the Student Community, it’s our duty to be at your beck and call at any time. If it weren’t for you, we would still be ordinary students,” someone started to butter up, which was a good sign for Bai Xiaofei. Such people would make it easier for him to get things done.</p> 
 <p>“Not at all, Senior. We are all working for the academy,” Bai Xiaofei replied with a smile, then got down to the point. “This meeting, we will discuss the new students.”</p> 
 <p>Everyone’s eyes widened.</p> 
 <p><em>Could it be a policy to oppress the new students?!</em></p> 
 <p>At this conjecture, they were either delighted or puzzled. The delighted ones were all former members of the Student Union. They were familiar with this kind of thing and willing to participate in it. The puzzled ones were first-year students or those at the bottom in life. They thought that the Student Community was established with Bai Xiaofei’s intent to protect the students from being oppressed. If their guess was right, did that mean he already forgot his original intention?</p> 
 <p>However, no matter what kind of thoughts they had, no one dared to say anything before Bai Xiaofei opened his mouth. They were all afraid of any misunderstandings.</p> 
 <p>“Hence, we will establish a three-rule agreement!” announced Bai Xiaofei as he raised three fingers, his eyes serious.</p> 
 <p>The group perked their ears for fear of missing a word.</p> 
 <p>“First, no one can extort and suppress new students in any form!”</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei stated the first agreement, the expressions in the room were a sight to behold. This time, delight and puzzlement were swapped.</p> 
 <p>“Awesome!” Someone couldn’t hold back his excitement and successfully became the focus of attention. He then sat back down, embarrassed. His reaction was indeed inappropriate on this occasion…</p> 
 <p>“Second, no one is allowed to rally for personal force, nor can they use the advantage of being senior brothers or sisters to prey on freshmen. You will be free to do that when they officially enter Starnet.”</p> 
 <p>The second rule sounded quite obscure, but everyone here understood it. In the past, it was not uncommon for seniors to use their identities to tease or even coerce younger girls, and most of them succeeded in the end because those girls weren’t strong enough to resist and didn’t know much about Starnet yet. They didn’t end up well, because most of the seniors were just fooling around.</p> 
 <p>As for why Bai Xiaofei added senior sisters…</p> 
 <p>Maybe it was because of his own self-preservation!</p> 
 <p>“Manager Bai. I have a question, if I may?”</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei finished the second rule, a person solemnly raised their hand.</p> 
 <p>“Ask,” Bai Xiaofei curtly replied. Not a shred of emotion could be seen from his expression.</p> 
 <p>“It is bad for seniors to over-suppress new students, but have you ever considered that if we don’t say or do something, the new students will likely become arrogant. To some extent, this is not conducive to their development.”</p> 
 <p>These words could be said to hit the nail on the head. This was indeed a very difficult dilemma!</p> 
 <p>As the saying goes, young trees won’t grow straight if left unfixed and humans will run rampant if unchecked. In fact, even Bai Xiaofei’s close people already had this tendency. However, they had once gone through suppression in the past, and Bai Xiaofei had been deliberately guiding them onto the right path, so they didn’t get worse in the end.</p> 
 <p>However, this year was different. If he really went full-on about protecting them, the new students would go wild!</p> 
 <p>In a sense, education from seniors was also a kind of education in the academy. They let freshmen know what forbearance, concession, and bowing while under another’s roof were.</p> 
 <p>“Zhang Yun, right? I remember you. Well said!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing Bai Xiaofei’s response, everyone gently heaved a sigh of relief.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Bai Xiaofei smiled wryly in his heart. <em>Did I establish an image of a tyrant…?</em></p> 
 <p>“But you can rest assured. I have taken this into account.” Bai Xiaofei smiled, then went on to say, “The third rule: Tit for tat is fair play. If the freshmen are rude to you, beat them hard! As long as you don’t kill them, I’ll take all the responsibility!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was ruthless when he said this, looking like a completely different person.</p> 
 <p>“Also, the freshman period lasts three months. Every half-month, I will organize a ‘friendly’ meeting, where you’ll have the opportunity to teach them some good lessons,” his tone relaxed as he revealed an evil smile.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the rest of the people present had been completely convinced. His meticulous thoughts were far beyond their imagination. Seeing their faces, however, Bai Xiaofei was focused on something else.</p> 
 <p><em>Damn it, I’ve worked so hard to change my expressions so you’ll renew your understanding of me. But what’s with you lot’s silly expressions?! You didn’t notice?!</em></p> 
 <p>Complaining in his heart, Bai Xiaofei turned to Fang Ye with a frown. At the moment, Fang Ye was heartlessly laughing up his sleeve.</p> 
 <p>The others didn’t notice, but he did… which was useless.</p> 
 <p><em>Ah, forget it, if this impression can’t be changed, then a tyrant it is.</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had begun to accept his fate. Now, his only hope relied on that saying–</p> 
 <p>Only time will tell…</p>
