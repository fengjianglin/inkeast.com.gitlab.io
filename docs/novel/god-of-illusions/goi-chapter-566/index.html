 <p>Chapter 566: Bai Xiaofei’s Trouble!</p> 
 <p>“Can you find it?”</p> 
 <p>While everyone else was resting, Bai Xiaofei and Yun Jingshuang were contemplating the next course of action and searching for important targets respectively.</p> 
 <p>“I can’t. After arriving here, the monitoring level of the fog isn’t much lower than my Celestial Eye. I can only lock onto the approximate area, it’s impossible to pinpoint the target’s location.” Yun Jingshuang frowned. This result was a big blow for them both.</p> 
 <p>Although the strength of their team was growing, they were still a long way from taking down Kuang Ta, so Bai Xiaofei had to make sure to deal a fatal strike in order to guarantee a safe retreat for everyone.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, before locating the man in the fog, they had to take some risks!</p> 
 <p>“How big is the area?” Bai Xiaofei asked with compromise in his tone after a long silence. <em>If there really is no other way, then a run-through of a checklist it is!</em></p> 
 <p>“According to our current efficiency, we may have to check three to five points.”</p> 
 <p>At Yun Jingshuang’s answer, the crease between Bai Xiaofei’s brows deepened. Three to five points meant taking risks three to five times, and the distance between these points was definitely not far away. Going on such a mission was no different than provoking Kuang Ta.</p> 
 <p>“No, so many points are too dangerous…” Bai Xiaofei hesitated.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll go!”</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei fell silent, Wang Hang leaned in without knowing and suddenly spoke with a determination that lit up his normal face.</p> 
 <p>“This is the time for scouts to come on stage, right? And I’m the best candidate, aren’t I?”</p> 
 <p>“No!” Bai Xiaofei rejected Wang Hang as soon as he finished speaking.</p> 
 <p>He had thought about sending scouts, but once he expressed this idea, Wang Hang, an Assassin Stream who had shown amazing performance so far, would definitely become one of the scouts.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was very selfish. He didn’t want to make his own people take risks on his watch.</p> 
 <p>“There is no better way. If you drag on like this, not only it will sap away someone’s chance to survive, but even we may all be hunted down and killed. Don’t tell me you haven’t noticed that our battle frequency is higher than before?”</p> 
 <p>Wang Hang was obviously prepared. Without something to convince Bai Xiaofei, he wouldn’t enter an argument with the latter.</p> 
 <p>“You just stay obediently! There must be a solution, and even if we need scouts, it’s still not your turn!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei refused to be convinced at all. Even Wang Hang doubted whether he had listened to himself.</p> 
 <p>“What’s wrong, my words are useless to you now?” Bai Xiaofei's voice grew icy when he saw Wang Hang’s troubled appearance.</p> 
 <p>“No, I just think…”</p> 
 <p>“You think what?! If my words still count, go back and sit down!!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei‘s sudden outburst startled Wang Hang. He completely abandoned the idea of convincing Bai Xiaofei and dejectedly went to sit in a corner. However, his idea of going out to scout still remained. In his opinion, Bai Xiaofei was already at a dead end…</p> 
 <p>Which was a fact. Despite scolding Wang Hang and driving him away, Bai Xiaofei still planned to act on this risky move. Only, he was going to do it personally!</p> 
 <p>“You're not going to go by yourself, are you?”</p> 
 <p>Who was Yun Jingshuang? He had managed the Blossom Pavilion for years and had his own way of figuring out people, especially when it came to someone he knew so well like Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“I am the most likely to get away with it!” staring at Yun Jingshuang, Bai Xiaofei's tone allowed no refusal.</p> 
 <p>“But if you fail to get out safely, all of us will be buried with you. Without you, our leaderless team will be no different than a patch of loose sand.” Yun Jingshuang’s tone was so bland that it didn’t look like he was persuading Bai Xiaofei at all, but it was exactly this tone that made Bai Xiaofei helpless.</p> 
 <p>“But…”</p> 
 <p>“Who is it?! Show yourself!”</p> 
 <p>Just as Bai Xiaofei wanted to continue to persuade Yun Jingshuang, an Exquisite Rank puppet master suddenly shouted and the shuttle-shaped puppet in his hand was shot into the dense trees.</p> 
 <p>“Don't! We’re on the same side!” a familiar voice rang from the forest.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei thought for a long time but was unable to recall who this voice belonged to before he saw the person coming out – Heartseer.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s eyes immediately lit up. For some reason, he just felt that Heartseer would be able to help him solve the urgent problem at hand!</p> 
 <p>“Yes, yes, yes, don’t fight, same side!” Behind Heartseer was a nervous Yun Sheng. It was fortunate that the shuttle just now had missed, otherwise, Yun Sheng might have become skewered meat…</p> 
 <p>“They’re one of our own.” When Bai Xiaofei’s voice rang out, everyone let down their guard.</p> 
 <p>“Senior Grand Master, oh how long I’ve waited for you!!!” At the sight of Bai Xiaofei, Heartseer pounced over, rubbing his tears and snot on Bai Xiaofei’s clothes.</p> 
 <p>“If you don’t get up, I’ll kick you out on behalf of Master!” Bai Xiaofei said coldly.</p> 
 <p>Heartseer immediately bounced away from him like a spring. This was a joke he couldn’t afford to take. Who would feed him if he was kicked out of the pavilion?</p> 
 <p>“Please don’t be angry, Senior Grand Master. I’m just too excited to see you!” Heartseer playfully laughed, completely overturning his image as an elegant scholar. But he couldn’t be blamed. For him and Yun Sheng alone to last until now, it was already enormous luck not to be scared to death…</p> 
 <p>“How did you guys…”</p> 
 <p>“Senior Grand Master, do you have anything to eat? I’m really hungry!”</p> 
 <p>Heartseer and his growling stomach interrupted Bai Xiaofei. Seeing the guy’s puppy eyes, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t bring himself to finish the question.</p> 
 <p>“Jingshuang, give them something to eat.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing Bai Xiaofei’s call, Yun Jingshuang immediately came running and poured out a bunch of food from his storage ring.</p> 
 <p>Yun Sheng and Heartseer suddenly pounced like seeing their mother. They grabbed food in both hands and started wolfing down. What royal prince, what elegant scholar, all but nonsense for a starving person…</p> 
 <p>Just like that, nearly a hundred people silently watched two people eat like hungry pigs. When they finally finished, the rest had lost count of how many times they swallowed saliva. Watching hungry people eat was really a kind of tormenting pleasure…</p> 
 <p>“It feels so good to be full!” Heartseer exclaimed with tears in his eyes. Yun Sheng solemnly chimed in.</p> 
 <p>Watching them, Bai Xiaofei sweated. <em>Just how hungry were you…</em></p> 
 <p>“Alright, since we’re full, it’s time to get down to business!”</p> 
 <p>All of a sudden, the Heartseer’s attitude took a 180-degree turn. Bai Xiaofei, who was feeling ashamed to know him a second ago, instantly perked up his ears with great spirit.</p> 
 <p><em>Don't let me down!</em></p>
