 <p>Chapter 685: Magical Beast?</p> 
 <p>“We are not lost, are we…?”</p> 
 <p>The group had penetrated the valley maze. For the past hour, Bai Xiaofei had constantly felt that the scenery around had stayed completely the same, while the triplets never stopped merrily discussing the route.</p> 
 <p>Unable to understand a word they said, Bai Xiaofei could only obediently follow. After all, this was their territory. It wouldn’t be fun if they abandoned him.</p> 
 <p>“Shut your unlucky mouth. How can we, the princesses of the Snow Kingdom, be stopped by this meager Holy Snow Mountain?!” Leng Liuying proudly snorted and pointed in a new direction. “This way. It won’t be long before we get out!”</p> 
 <p>Looking in the direction she pointed, Bai Xiaofei saw no difference between the brightly white field he saw and the area he had walked past before.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, Liuying isn’t pointing at a random path. Apart from the snow layers, have you noticed the changes along the way?” Leng Liushuang prompted upon noticing Bai Xiaofei’s doubts.</p> 
 <p>It’s better to teach people to fish than to give them fish. She couldn’t guarantee that they would be by Bai Xiaofei’s side all the time, so it was necessary to teach him how to find directions in the Snow Kingdom.</p> 
 <p>Upon her words, Bai Xiaofei began contemplating. He hadn’t been paying attention, but now that she mentioned it, he actually felt something was different.</p> 
 <p>“The wind is getting stronger!” he exclaimed with confidence and excitedly looked at Leng Liushuang like a student answering a teacher’s question.</p> 
 <p>“Mhm, that’s right, this is the most apparent change. The wind is getting stronger and the snow thinner, indicating that the terrain is getting higher and higher. The valley here is lower than the mountain area, so the terrain rising means that we are approaching the mountain area. In addition to this, you can also observe the cliffs on both sides. The Holy Snow Mountain receives the north wind all year round, so the closer it is to the mountain area, the more serious erosion the exposed rocks show.”</p> 
 <p>When Leng Liushuang finished explaining, Bai Xiaofei was hit with enlightenment. There were certain things that would take years to realize if no one taught him.</p> 
 <p>At this thought, Bai Xiaofei suddenly understood why there were so many people holding the ‘guide’ signs listed at high prices at the entrance. It seemed that they were really worth the price.</p> 
 <p>“But this only applies to our present situation. How did you judge before we arrived here? We never hit a dead end and walked straight toward here,” asked Bai Xiaofei as he recalled their path.</p> 
 <p>“In addition to experience, the most important thing is the wind,” Leng Liushuang replied. “If the valley is open, that’s the direction that the wind blows. If the wind suddenly weakens at a certain intersection or its direction changes, it means we have entered a blocked area, which is the dead-end you mentioned.”</p> 
 <p>“Watch out!”</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuli suddenly shouted. At the same time, she leaped toward Leng Liuying and pulled her aside. The next second, a sharp spike landed where Leng Liuying had just been.</p> 
 <p>This was only the beginning. After Leng Liuying escaped this attack, more spikes shot down the cliffs on both sides of the valley, obviously wanting to turn the four into honeycombs.</p> 
 <p>Thanks to Leng Liuli’s quick reminder, the enemy above didn’t succeed as the group quickly retreated to the base of the cliff, and the sloping cliffs became their best barrier. However, they also blocked the view, so the four couldn’t tell who or what attacked them.</p> 
 <p>“Blackie!” Bai Xiaofei had no habit of sitting around waiting for death. Per his call, Blackie agilely jumped out from his shoulder.</p> 
 <p>Almost at the same time, spikes rained down from the cliff again, but the spikes were slower than Blackie, who shuttled back and forth without losing a strand of fur.</p> 
 <p>“What is it?!” Leng Liushuang asked. She is familiar with all of the magical beasts in the Holy Snow Mountain. As long as Bai Xiaofei gave a description, she could think of the way to deal with it right away.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei looked troubled.</p> 
 <p>“Hold on a minute. I can’t quite describe that thing.”</p> 
 <p>He then summoned Purple Luan and vanished. A while later, three figures fell off the cliff together with a rain of sharp thorns as well as a messy Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The triplets had a clear view of the creatures that attacked them, but that was it. Even they couldn’t give a definite answer to what those things were.</p> 
 <p>The attackers were about 1.2 meters tall and looked very much like dwarves with two feet and two arms, but apart from these characteristics, they shared no other similarities with humans.</p> 
 <p>Their bloated bodies looked like inflated balloons and their entire backs were covered with spikes similar to those raining down. Their ferocious faces made people uncomfortable at just a glance. Generally speaking, they looked like a combination of human and hedgehog.</p> 
 <p>Falling from the cliff didn’t seem to do any damage to them. After bouncing up, the three sharp-edged monsters immediately pulled out two sharp spikes from their backs and fearlessly rushed towards Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei frowned upon seeing this. It wasn’t that he found them terrifying, but he just couldn’t see their ranks! Or, he couldn’t figure out what they should be measured by.</p>
