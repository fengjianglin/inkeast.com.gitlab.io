 <p>Chapter 789: Kill Who?!</p> 
 <p>“If you’re not gonna do anything, we’re going!” Bai Xiaofei’s voice echoed again and could not be more provocative. It was just the two of them, walking slowly and openly in the middle of the road, yet no one could do anything to them.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Blood Wolf and Strong Steel were killing left and right. Fang Ye joining the fray making them the biggest fear of the Devil Forest Mercenary Group – a resilient team of both Assassin Stream and Ranged Stream puppet masters, not to mention that Fang Ye was holding the king of gun puppets! At this rate, none of the Devil Forest members would be able to return alive.</p> 
 <p>“Send in the main force!” Clenching his jaw, Zhu Wuxin finally decided to risk it all.</p> 
 <p>Heeding his order, a signal was shot into the sky. As the main members poured into the battlefield, the already restless bamboo forest seemed to come alive!</p> 
 <p>Zhu Wuxin also summoned his puppet, a gold puppet called Devil Forest. It was a rare domain puppet that greatly enhanced the flexibility of all plants and the power of all plant-type puppets within its domain.</p> 
 <p>The cooperation within Devil Forest’s main force was nothing its ordinary members could compare to. Blood Wolf and Strong Steel were pushed back and even Fang Ye’s sniping was restrained.</p> 
 <p>No one could let their weaknesses sit unfixed, especially the elite force of Devil Forest who paid more attention to this than anyone else. In this mercenary group, whether or not one could defend against the targeting of a gun puppet master or an assassin puppet master was a major criterion for whether one could join the elite force.</p> 
 <p>“Young Master, we’re losing…” Clawing off an unusually flexible bamboo tube that was trying to wrap itself around him, Blood Wolf panted heavily. His Divine Beast Transformation had a time limit despite him being the best in the Transformation Stream, and he was reaching that limit after such a long time fighting.</p> 
 <p>On another side, Strong Steel was not much better. His body was ridden with injuries, but fortunately, none were fatal.</p> 
 <p>“Plants are just plants after all.” Bai Xiaofei chuckled. He waved his hand, and Golden Feather’s unique flame spread.</p> 
 <p>However, the flame was not as effective as expected. All the bamboo trees attacking them were enveloped in a golden light that greatly weakened the effect of the flame.</p> 
 <p>“Domain puppet?” After figuring out the reason, Bai Xiaofei summoned Huskie. “Go and locate it, and then lead your Master Xian’er there.”</p> 
 <p>Huskie obeyed the order and broke through the encirclement of the bamboo trees.</p> 
 <p>“Young Master, what do we do…”</p> 
 <p>The bamboo encirclement was getting smaller and smaller. Strong Steel and Blood Wolf were barely coping.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, someone will take care of it for us.” Bai Xiaofei smiled and looked up into the sky.</p> 
 <p>The rest followed suit, and it was a scene that they would never forget.</p> 
 <p>Floating in the air was Lin Li in her Divine Phoenix Feather Dress, looking like a celestial being with her long hair dancing…</p> 
 <p>“This is my zone!” she coldly declared. Her dress suddenly burst with a dazzling golden light and thousands of stars sparkled around her.</p> 
 <p>Reaching out to pick the stars, the phoenix danced for her lover…</p> 
 <p>Thousands of stars spilled down and cut off every single bamboo. Just as Lin Li said, this was her zone. Without her consent, nothing could approach!</p> 
 <p>Once again, Blood Wolf’s and Strong Steel’s world view was refreshed.</p> 
 <p><em>Are Grandmaster Rank puppet masters so powerful these days? Or am I just a fake Exquisite Rank?! Also, isn’t the puppet she’s wearing the Divine Phoenix Feather Dress?! What is her relationship with the Angelic Maiden?!</em></p> 
 <p>Bogged by all kinds of questions, Blood Wolf and Strong Steel looked at Bai Xiaofei, their eyes subconsciously respectful. They really could not figure out his depth…</p> 
 <p>However, they then recalled something else: Why was Bai Xiaofei not fighting? If he used the strength that made them surrender before, they would have broken free by now!</p> 
 <p>The two experts had no idea that Bai Xiaofei could not do it even if he wanted to. Although the cooldown of Spiritualization had been greatly shortened and he could even continuously use the same puppet, doing so would not only cause a great burden to his body but also be of no benefit to his puppets.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, Bai Xiaofei would not use it unless as a last resort. Moreover, the situation was still under control… as long as Hu Xian’er successfully completed her mission.</p> 
 <p>In terms of locating people, Huskie never failed Bai Xiaofei’s expectations. Upon finding Zhu Wuxin, he couldn’t help an excited bark.</p> 
 <p>“Where’s this stupid dog from?!”</p> 
 <p>The bark attracted the attention of the sentry. An Onslaught Stream puppet master immediately rushed over. The scared Huskie wanted to run, fighting was definitely not his thing.</p> 
 <p>“Want to run?!”</p> 
 <p>Seeing Huskie turn away, the Onslaught Stream puppet master immediately sped up. At that instant, a black figure flashed across his face, and the puppet master collapsed to the ground with a scream and his hands over his face.</p> 
 <p>On a bamboo tree, Blackie’s eyes glinted eerily as she stared down at the victim, whose blood was dripping down her claw. When the puppet master got up, his left eye had three deep wounds.</p> 
 <p>“I want you dead!!” The puppet master erupted. Being wounded by an animated puppet to this extent deeply hurt his self-esteem. His speed exploded as a dazzling white light illuminated his fist. The gravity around him increased dramatically and firmly locked on Blackie, preventing her from moving.</p> 
 <p>“DIE!!!” roared the puppet master hysterically, as if he had already pictured the scene of Blackie smashed into meat paste. </p> 
 <p>Unexpectedly, however, Huskie suddenly ran back in Bai Xiaofei’s appearance and met the puppet master’s fist with his own.</p> 
 <p>Yet without Bai Xiaofei, Huskie was only a physical transformation without any actual power. The blow sent him flying backward and forced him back to his original appearance. However, this was enough to help Blackie regain her freedom. She picked up Huskie with her teeth and bolted into the forest.</p> 
 <p>“Leave them to me! I must kill them!” The Onslaught Stream puppet master’s eyes had become bloodshot. He sped toward the direction that the two puppets escaped.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, the person he met on the way was not someone he could provoke.</p> 
 <p>“Who do you want to kill?” With Blackie and Huskie on her shoulders, Hu Xian’er grasped the puppet master’s wrist, thick murderous intent radiating from her eyes.</p> 
 <p>“D…”</p> 
 <p>The puppet master urged his energy, but before he could even finish a word, Hu Xian’er had passed him in a flash.</p> 
 <p>“Noisy.”</p> 
 <p>With a snort, she walked towards Zhu Wuxin’s group. Behind her, the puppet master fell feebly, around his neck was a thin cut and blood was seeping out from it…</p>
