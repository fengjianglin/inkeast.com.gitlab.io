 <p>Chapter 1004: All is Fair in War!</p> 
 <p>Baijiang’s roar stunned his men. When they realized what he had just said, everyone instantly rushed out.</p> 
 <p>However, the scene outside horrified them.</p> 
 <p>Standing there weren’t his guards but a group of strangers in dark clothes and the guards had fallen into pools of blood at their feet.</p> 
 <p>“Sorry, you realized it too late.” Bai Xiaofei grinned. The next second, a series of hooks flew out from behind him and met the charging Sacks soldiers.</p> 
 <p>Hearing the shrieks of his troops outside, Baijiang’s face paled. With a wry smile, Baijiang put on his armor, picked up his greatsword, and walked out.</p> 
 <p>“Can you tell me your name?”</p> 
 <p>Facing the Fickle Army, no fear could be seen from Baijiang. On the contrary, his eyes were filled with fighting spirit.</p> 
 <p>“The first male general of Moonlight, Fickle Bai!” said Bai Xiaofei slowly with admiration for Baijiang in his voice. If it weren’t for them being on the opposite sides, he would have loved to get drunk with a general of such bearing like Baijiang.</p> 
 <p>“Very good! It seems that I, Baijiang, underestimated Moonlight! So, General Bai, how about letting me die a more decent death?” Baijiang raised his greatsword as his eyes intently watched Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Heroes, of course, die in their own way! Zhuang Shuo, take everyone to help Old Zhu,” said Bai Xiaofei as he drew Mind Sunder.</p> 
 <p>The Fickle soldiers instantly retreated.</p> 
 <p>The next moment, Bai Xiaofei and Baijiang charged at each other…</p> 
 <p>Heroes understand each other when their weapons clash. As Baijiang fell to Mind Sunder, a complicated smile rose from the corners of his lips. “You are very strong, but don’t underestimate the Saintess.”</p> 
 <p>With that last sentence, Baijiang slowly closed his eyes.</p> 
 <p>Putting away Mind Sunder, Bai Xiaofei took a deep breath. Blackie’s ability activated and a tombstone slowly condensed in front of him.</p> 
 <p>“If there is a next life, I hope we can have a drink together.”</p> 
 <p>After burying Baijiang, Bai Xiaofei headed out. At this time, Zhu Chunyang’s group had retreated from the west gate, while Ye Qingtong, Tan Xin, and Zhuang Shuo had started guerrilla warfare within the fortress.</p> 
 <p>That night was a long night for the Sacks. From the beginning to the end, they didn’t have any formal confrontation with the Fickle Army but kept falling down one by one. Finally, with the discovery of Baijiang’s death, they completely lost their will to resist and abandoned the fortress.</p> 
 <p>When it started to get bright, the Fickle Army had finished sweeping the battlefield. Ye Qingtong, Tan Xin, and Zhu Chunyang came up to the wall where Bai Xiaofei stood quietly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei inhaled deeply and asked, “What’s the situation?”</p> 
 <p>“We won big. We have no casualties except for 17 with minor injuries, were able to kill over 8,000 enemies, and capture 2,000. At present, we have complete control over the fortress.”</p> 
 <p>Zhuang Shuo’s report was gratifying, but Bai Xiaofei didn’t look happy at all.</p> 
 <p>“Bring this report back to the base so that Moonlight will send someone to take over. We will rest for the morning before going to the next one,” he instructed.</p> 
 <p>Zhuang Shuo withdrew with the order, while the other three looked at Bai Xiaofei thoughtfully.</p> 
 <p>“Let the prisoners go,” Bai Xiaofei decided after a long silence.</p> 
 <p>“Let them go?! That’s two whole thousand!” exclaimed Zhu Chunyang. In a head-on confrontation, these two thousand people alone could create huge problems for the Fickle Army!</p> 
 <p>“Otherwise? Kill them?” Bai Xiaofei asked back, rendering Zhu Chunyang speechless.</p> 
 <p>It was indeed inappropriate to kill prisoners.</p> 
 <p>“Even so, you should hand them over to Moonlight,” Zhu Chunyang remarked with a frown.</p> 
 <p>“How is that different from killing them?” Bai Xiaofei asked.</p> 
 <p>No one spoke again this time. However, the three still didn’t understand what Bai Xiaofei was thinking.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know what you have in mind, but letting them go is not good for our next action,” Ye Qingtong said the words that everyone was thinking.</p> 
 <p>If the prisoners were released, they would definitely report the existence of the Fickle Army to the Sacks. Once the other party was prepared, it would be difficult for them in the future as they had heavily relied on the element of surprise.</p> 
 <p>“Do you think I’m the type to make stupid decisions? I’m not scared of them reporting back to the Sacks about us,” replied Bai Xiaofei calmly.</p> 
 <p>The three were dumbstruck. <em>Do we actually have a wrong understanding of the Fickle Army?! Isn’t this a small elite team specialized in secret operations? That’s why we trained for half a month!</em></p> 
 <p>“No, but…”</p> 
 <p>“Just do it. If you believe in me, don’t ask too many questions. But if you have to ask, I only have five words for you.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei paused and the three pricked up their ears.</p> 
 <p>“All is fair in war!”</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>After the Moonlight people came and took over the fortress, the Fickle Army once again set out. Before leaving, Bai Xiaofei briefly inquired about the situations of the other three generals before leaving a letter to Ye Qingcheng.</p> 
 <p>Compared to Bai Xiaofei’s group, they fell short in the frontal siege ability despite their crushing numerical advantage. To breach their first fortress, they needed a whole day. However, after that, their numbers made it much easier.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, counting in the time to rest, the Fickle Army had to proceed without stopping to catch up.</p> 
 <p>Of course, that was the thoughts of most people. At this moment, even the Fickle troops didn’t understand what Bai Xiaofei was doing as they followed him. A day later, Bai Xiaofei, who was still on the road with his army, successfully aroused doubt.</p> 
 <p>“If we keep going further, we will be out of the temporary fortress area. What are you planning?” Ye Qingtong asked with a face of disbelief. The Fickle Army had been marching in a hurry for over a day. If they continued in this direction, they would soon reach Colorful Star Fortress, one of the six fortresses occupied by the Sacks.</p> 
 <p>“Since you have guessed the destination, why bother asking?” Bai Xiaofei smiled.</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingtong’s eyes widened. “You want to attack the fortress? With our meager numbers?!!”</p> 
 <p>She had actually guessed it right, she just didn’t dare to believe it.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be so surprised, it was my plan since the beginning, alright? Think about it, if we continue to follow the previous method, even counting in the progress of the other three generals, will one week be enough to clean up all the enemy’s temporary fortresses?” Bai Xiaofei asked back.</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingtong calculated, and it was indeed not enough.</p> 
 <p>“I gave my word to your sister to solve this problem completely, and taking down only a part can’t be considered ‘completely,’” Bai Xiaofei explained with a nonchalant expression.</p> 
 <p>The others had already felt like idiots hearing this.</p> 
 <p><em>When was this plan made? And didn’t you think we needed to know at all?!</em></p> 
 <p>“But no matter how strong the Fickle Army is, it is impossible to capture a fortress with hundreds of thousands of troops with our numbers,” Tan Xin voiced her confusion.</p> 
 <p>“It’s a long story, but I can tell you that Colorful Star Fortress doesn’t have to be captured, I just want to use it to do something,” Bai Xiaofei, who was prepared for any question, provided an answer that made the three heave a sigh of relief.</p> 
 <p><em>Mhm, there is nothing wrong with my brain, capturing the fortress is really impossible.</em></p> 
 <p>“However, if the Sacks aren’t competent, I might just capture Colorful Star while I’m at it,” Bai Xiaofei added.</p> 
 <p>The three once again gawked at him in utter shock.</p> 
 <p><em>Capture Colorful Star Fortress?! While you’re at it?! So if you insisted, you can definitely make it happen?! Are you dreaming or are we dreaming right now in broad daylight?!</em></p> 
 <p>“There are so many people watching, can you three pay attention to your image? They will think there is something wrong with you three,” Bai Xiaofei teased with a wry smile.</p> 
 <p>However, for once, the three didn’t refute him. Not to mention anyone else, even they thought that there was something wrong with their brains.</p> 
 <p>“The people behind you are the only members of the Fickle Army,” Tan Xin solemnly reminded Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I have no plan to risk our lives. I will definitely take back as many people as I bring out. Everyone in the Fickle Army is trained with my painstaking efforts. I will definitely be more careful than anyone else.” Dispelling Tan Xin’s last concern, Bai Xiaofei stretched his body. “Well, here we are. Get ready to change!”</p> 
 <p>After stepping into the controlled area of Colorful Star Fortress, Bai Xiaofei stopped. His storage ring flashed, and a hill of Sacks costumes appeared in front of everyone.</p> 
 <p>“What are you doing, get changed!” Bai Xiaofei urged before grabbing a suit and changing into it in front of everyone.</p> 
 <p>Returning to their senses, everyone immediately followed suit.</p> 
 <p>“Remember, from now on, we are Sacks soldiers. Except for me, try your best to avoid communicating with any others. Pay special attention to your behavior, watch more and learn more, and put all actions on hold until you are absolutely sure it won’t expose us.”</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei listed the matters needing attention, the whole army listened with pricked ears.</p> 
 <p>Infiltration was the most difficult lesson that Bai Xiaofei taught the Fickle Army. There was no room for negligence. Once something went wrong, the situation would be beyond redemption in an instant.</p> 
 <p>If it was in any other place, Bai Xiaofei had absolute confidence to make his infiltration a success. However, against the Sacks, he needed some luck.</p> 
 <p>To put it bluntly, this was another big gamble!</p>
