 <p>Chapter 714: There Is Nothing That Cannot Be Fooled!</p> 
 <p>“Oh? What can you have that I want?” The demon king looked at Bai Xiaofei ponderingly.</p> 
 <p>Everyone had also stopped attacking as Bai Xiaofei was being held hostage. Moreover, they were also curious about what he had in store.</p> 
 <p>“You want to leave this world, don’t you? Without this thing, you will never be able to even if you massacre the whole continent!” said Bai Xiaofei while donning a serious expression.</p> 
 <p>However, the demon king chuckled.</p> 
 <p>“What a joke. How can a weakling like you even touch that thing? What do you take me for, an idiot?” The demon king’s voice grew icy and his eyes flashed with a murderous glint.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t falter and even snorted.</p> 
 <p>“You <em>are</em> an idiot. Do you know who I am? Is power the only thing that matters in your world? Then its level is too low,” retorted Bai Xiaofei disdainfully.</p> 
 <p>This time, the demon king was swayed.</p> 
 <p>“Oh? You are saying your identity is special?” His brows creased as doubt replaced his icy expression.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Bai Xiaofei was secretly delighted and quickly proceeded.</p> 
 <p>“There are three legends in this world; one of them is my master, another I have the honor to have learned his cultivation technique, and the last one is my future mother-in-law. My principal is the only Timeless Rank puppet master on this continent, and I am currently the student he is most proud of. The place where I grew up has the highest concentration of wicked people, and it is also the place with the highest average strength and the widest knowledge. So far none of the places I have been to can forget me, Bai Xiaofei!”</p> 
 <p>After firing off a heap of information, Bai Xiaofei paused before asking.</p> 
 <p>“So may I ask, do you still think I’m an average person now?”</p> 
 <p>The question stunned the demon king briefly before he suddenly burst out laughing.</p> 
 <p>“Good! Well said! I don’t know what’s so special about the things you just said, but to be able to remain calm in front of me, you are already not an ordinary person!” The demon king then grew serious as he looked Bai Xiaofei in the eyes. “So, tell me, what do you have that can interest me?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei smiled.</p> 
 <p>“It’s a thing called ‘origin’ in our continent. My master asked me to keep it and said that one day when I reach a certain level, that origin could help me open up a new world. I thought he was just exaggerating, but after seeing you today, I realized that it wasn’t a joke,” said Bai Xiaofei plausibly, mixing lies and truth so skillfully that even the triplets couldn’t tell if he was lying.</p> 
 <p>“Is it? But words are not evidence. If you don’t show it to me, how do I know if it can be of use to me?” The demon king’s eyes flashed with a strange glint. “Why don’t you show it to me first?”</p> 
 <p>He had to admit that he was tempted by the thing that Bai Xiaofei described. A world-class power was what he lacked. Although he didn’t know how to use this power, he knew that he lacked such a thing in order to be a match to his enemy!</p> 
 <p>“Do you think I’m stupid? I am now the fish on your chopping board. If I let you see it, we’ll all die.” Bai Xiaofei snorted and looked at the demon king like he was an idiot, which was what the demon king had done to him just now.</p> 
 <p>“So you know that you are just a fish on my chopping board. But don’t forget that you are not the only fish here!”</p> 
 <p>The demon king raised his hand. The triplets floated up and hung in the air with painful expressions.</p> 
 <p>“Either you take it out now, or I’ll kill them!” the demon king coldly threatened, giving Bai Xiaofei a tough problem that had tortured many people in history.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei’s reply was beyond anyone’s expectations.</p> 
 <p>“Kill? Go ahead, don’t hesitate! You kill them or make the three of them feel just a little bit of pain, and I will drag that thing to the death with me. Since we’re all going to die anyway, why should I satisfy you? When you are trapped to death in this world, your ending will be the same as mine!” Bai Xiaofei started making a fuss as he refused to give in.</p> 
 <p>After less than two seconds of assessing him, the demon king stopped. He could see that Bai Xiaofei was capable of doing what he said.</p> 
 <p>“Very well, then what do I have to do to see the origin?!” the demon king conceded.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately heaved a sigh of relief in his heart, but his expression remained solemn. Hiding his true emotions was his specialty.</p> 
 <p>“Immediately let them go, and then promise me to never attack my people. As for other people on this continent, kill them how you like, that will have nothing to do with this lord,” Bai Xiaofei demanded. “This shouldn’t be difficult for you, right? The people I know are only a fraction of the world population. A fraction can’t affect your plan.”</p> 
 <p>The demon king found Bai Xiaofei’s proposal a reasonable bargain. Indeed, he would lose nothing.</p> 
 <p>“Letting all of them go is impossible. You can only choose a part!” With a smile, the demon king presented another tough problem.</p> 
 <p>The people around instantly erupted. Seeing how powerful the demon king was, this was their only chance to survive!</p> 
 <p>“You all shut up! Didn’t you f*cking hear that he said it’s up to me? Whoever keeps making noise will stay here!”</p> 
 <p>The several hundred people instantly went silent.</p> 
 <p>“Let the three of them go first, and the magical beast family,” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The demon king nodded with a smile and waved his hand. A breeze blew through the place where he had been sealed and revealed an ancient Teleportation Formation. With another wave of his hand, the triplets, the Blood-Eye Fox, and the baby foxes and phoenixes were sent to the center of the formation. Then, a dim light shone and they disappeared.</p> 
 <p>Golden Feather was spiritually linked to her children. She confirmed that they were safe and passed the information to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei exhaled a long sigh. Next would be a stalling tactic!</p>
