 <p>Chapter 828: Return!</p> 
 <p>“What in the…! What’s that thing?!”</p> 
 <p>“Enemy attack?!”</p> 
 <p>“Are you a fool? Who would dare to attack Starnet?</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>From above Starnet Square, a huge cruise ship landed slowly amidst the students’ frantic guesses.</p> 
 <p>“I knew it was you, you brat. Can you not worry me for once?”</p> 
 <p>In a flash of lightning, Lei Shan appeared in the air and faced Bai Xiaofei, who was wearing an innocent smile.</p> 
 <p>“Gramps, you already knew it was me, so it’s not necessary to cover it up like that. Just admit you’re excited to see me,” Bai Xiaofei teased Lei Shan.</p> 
 <p>As Hu Xian’er and the others came out and stood behind him, his declaration echoed throughout the square, “The Blood Diamond mission was successfully completed, and everyone has returned safely!”</p> 
 <p>The square fell into a three-second silence before a tsunami of cheers erupted.</p> 
 <p>“It’s Boss Bai!”</p> 
 <p>“Boss Bai is back!”</p> 
 <p>“Welcome back, senior!!”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>“Where are your manners? Don’t you have classes to attend?” an intimidating voice overwhelmed the cheers before the students could even catch a glimpse of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Upon seeing the owner of the voice, the students immediately clamped up and pretended that it wasn’t them who had shouted as they fled the square.</p> 
 <p>It could not be helped. Who wasn’t scared of Vice Principal Luo Xi?</p> 
 <p>“You have returned.” Luo Xi looked at Bai Xiaofei, her voice so gentle that Bai Xiaofei panicked a little.</p> 
 <p><em>Oh heavens, is the sun rising from the west?</em></p> 
 <p>“We accomplished our mission!” Bai Xiaofei did not forget what occasion this was and naturally would not fail to act in the appropriate manner.</p> 
 <p>“Mhm, it’s good as long as you’re back. Sure enough, the principal was right not to change the graduation time. You really hurried and made it back,” Luo Xi said.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei nearly choked. He looked at Lei Shan resentfully. <em>As if I’d believe in your nonsense about trust and all that. I bet you planned to exclude me if I couldn’t come back in time!</em></p> 
 <p>“Ahem, put this big obstruction away. It’s not good to leave it here. Moreover, today is the last day. You should want to see your teachers,” Lei Shan hurriedly changed the subject when smelling a familiar intent of extortion from Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>He chose the right thing to say. Upon his reminder, everyone looked melancholy. Indeed, after tomorrow, there would not be many chances to see their teachers again.</p> 
 <p>“The old man is right, let’s go and see the teachers,” said Bai Xiaofei with a smile.</p> 
 <p>The group said goodbye to each other. After all, few were in the same department.</p> 
 <p>However, after they dispersed, Bai Xiaofei still had a long tail behind him.</p> 
 <p>Except for Hu Ji, who was taken along by Hu Xian’er, Tan Xin, Gu Lingyue, Rui Mengqi, and Wang Chuan didn’t know where to go. If it weren’t for the Shaman King trio being sent to Illusion Demon along the way back, the tail would have been even longer.</p> 
 <p>“Smelly boy, these people are…” Lei Shan couldn’t hold back and carefully probed.</p> 
 <p>Out of his ‘trust’ for Bai Xiaofei, Lei Shan felt that no one who was able to follow him would be a simple character.</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, after Bai Xiaofei introduced them, Lei Shan gulped.</p> 
 <p>“Ahh, Starnet really can’t keep you. But forget it, you should start training your own people. They are rare help, you must keep them,” Lei Shan advised after accepting the reality that Bai Xiaofei had grown up.</p> 
 <p>However, after hearing what Lei Shan said, Bai Xiaofei’s face was full of bitterness.</p> 
 <p>“Gramps, I actually don’t want them to follow me, but as you can see, there’s nothing I can do!” How could one feel comfortable being followed around the clock?</p> 
 <p>“Hahaha! That’s none of my business. You’d better return to the Demon of Illusions quickly. Min’er has been waiting for you. If you didn’t come back, she probably would cut ties with me again.” Lei Shan smiled brightly at the mention of Lei Min. Although the two had made up for a while, he still had not gotten used to this happiness. Originally, he thought he would not be able to see such a day in his lifetime.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, I know, old man. Go and do your things.” Bai Xiaofei had no intention to drag on the conversation with Lei Shan. Leading his small team, he walked all the way to the Demon of Illusions at a decent pace despite his body having not fully recovered.</p> 
 <p>Compared with the depressingly empty department in the past, the Demon of Illusions could be described as completely revived!</p> 
 <p>The number of students coming and going was no less than that in the other departments. More importantly, everyone was filled with confidence that those from other departments could not.</p> 
 <p>There was no other reason, just because Bai Xiaofei came from the Demon of Illusions. In other words, as long as he lived, the mental pillar of the Demon of Illusion stood!</p> 
 <p>“You still know to come back?!”</p> 
 <p>An icy voice rang out right as Bai Xiaofei stepped through the entrance. Then, a puff of smoke appeared in front of Bai Xiaofei and turned into Lei Min.</p> 
 <p>“Big Sister Min, I wanted to return early, but the mission was too difficult!” Bai Xiaofei instantly acted pitiful like a bitter baby having no one else to complain to.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, as long as you’re back.” Pushing the shameless Bai Xiaofei away, Lei Min sighed.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter? Did someone upset our beautiful and amiable Sister Min?” Buttering up was one of Bai Xiaofei’s basic skills. Moreover, Lei Min was obviously weighed down by something, and Bai Xiaofei thought that it was likely related to him.</p> 
 <p>“It’s really nothing. Although you left many times before, tomorrow is different. You will really leave for good like Liu Yun and them. Whenever I think about it, I miss the time when there were only a few of you,” said Lei Min faintly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately understood. <em>So she’s grieving!</em></p> 
 <p>“Big Sis Min, isn’t that what you want to see most? Our departure means we will be welcoming our new life. You should be happy. Moreover, it’s not like we’re not coming back. I will return as an honorary alumnus to see you. Won’t that be the same?” Bai Xiaofei prattled. However, it was indeed what Lei Min needed to hear most at the moment.</p> 
 <p>“You have a way with words, smelly boy. Then, if you don’t return, be very careful. I will kill my way over to you.” Saying this, Lei Min’s hand flashed and an envelope appeared. “Vice Principal Luo asked me to give you this. She said that you’d better find her before you leave.”</p> 
 <p>Receiving the letter, Bai Xiaofei instinctively gulped and recalled Luo Xi’s meaningful glance just before.</p> 
 <p><em>Aargh, looks like I can’t easily pass Vice Principal Luo’s ordeal!</em></p>
