 <p>Chapter 735: Unprincipled Lei Shan!</p> 
 <p>“The door is not locked, come in!” said Lei Shan calmly upon hearing a knock on his office door. After more than half a year, the old headmaster had recovered from the tragic incident with the Infinite Mountain Range.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei pushed the door open and entered. Lei Shan didn’t seem surprised to see him as his expression didn’t change at all.</p> 
 <p>How could he not know of Bai Xiaofei’s return? He just didn’t want to disturb Bai Xiaofei. After all, he had been young once and knew the first thing Bai Xiaofei needed to do upon returning was not to see him.</p> 
 <p>“Finally coming to see this old man, huh?” Lei Shan smiled as he put aside his work.</p> 
 <p>“You look energetic, gramps. Has something good happened recently? Tell me so I can be happy too,” Bai Xiaofei was familiar as always. He didn’t need to pretend in front of Lei Shan, who he regarded as a lovely elder.</p> 
 <p>“The best thing for me now is that you are back. But if you brought back some good wine with you, it would be double happiness.” Lei Shan’s eyes shone. He had been to the Snow Kingdom before, and the impressive taste of their Snow Milk Wine was still fresh in his memory.</p> 
 <p>“Of course.” Bai Xiaofei chuckled. He took out a wine flask and placed it in front of Lei Shan.</p> 
 <p>As the rich aroma of alcohol drilled into Lei Shan’s nose, the old man of hundreds of years old became excited as a child at the sight of candy.</p> 
 <p>“As expected of my good student!”</p> 
 <p>Lei Shan picked up the flask and aggressively sniffed it before putting it away. Good things were to be enjoyed slowly, and now was not the time.</p> 
 <p>“Well, how was your trip to the Snow Kingdom? You left for quite a long time. Did you cause trouble again?” Lei Shan’s rich life experience allowed him to poke Bai Xiaofei’s sore spot with just a sentence.</p> 
 <p>It wasn’t just simple as ‘causing trouble.’ The Holy Snow Mountain was blown up and the Snow Kingdom’s only marshal was infuriated!</p> 
 <p>“All trivial stuff, basically all resolved.” Bai Xiaofei bit the bullet as he said this. It was not that he wanted to put on a strong front, but he must deal with this matter personally.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be shy with me or Starnet. I can come forward any time you have a need for me, you just have to prepare enough wine!” Lei Shan said with a crafty-businessman smile unbefitting his status.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry about the wine, gramps. But I really don’t need help. There are some things that you just can’t ask for help with.” Bai Xiaofei’s voice was laced with a hint of melancholy.</p> 
 <p>“In that case, I will wait for your good news. So, are you going to continue school or do you have other plans?” Lei Shan immediately understood Bai Xiaofei’s implication and quickly changed to the main subject.</p> 
 <p>To be blunt, there weren’t many things left for Bai Xiaofei to learn in Starnet, but if he decided to stay, it would be a great help to the academy. Therefore, Lei Shan asked that question with selfish intentions.</p> 
 <p>“I’m going to be a good student during my last year of course. No matter what, one should finish what they started, right?”</p> 
 <p>After Bai Xiaofei gave Lei Shan his desired answer, the latter laughed with joy written all over his face.</p> 
 <p>“Very good! Finish what you started! You are so much better than your rascal master!” Lei Shan conveniently dissed Revelation a little.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was speechless. He didn’t know how to evaluate the two old men’s love-hate relationship anymore. They talked bad behind each other’s backs but would drink together till drunk every time they met. He supposed this was what they called ‘real friends.’</p> 
 <p>“How are you and Big Sis Lei? Your relationship has been completely fixed?” asked Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Lei Shan’s smile grew even brighter.</p> 
 <p>“It’s been difficult, but the little girl has forgiven me now. I originally thought there wouldn’t be such a day before I died, yet it came when I am still alive and kicking!” Lei Shan burst out laughing. Indeed, this was something worthy of celebration.</p> 
 <p>“That’s great. During my trip, I’ve seen too many regrets. I don’t want similar things to happen around me,” said Bai Xiaofei lightly, but Lei Shan was stunned to hear it.</p> 
 <p>“Smelly boy, what happened to you?” The old principal gazed at Bai Xiaofei with a serious tone. As far as he was concerned, Bai Xiaofei shouldn’t exude such a feeling at his age.</p> 
 <p>“That’s a long story. You know me, gramps, I’m too lazy, so I’ll skip this topic.” Bai Xiaofei laughed foolishly and suddenly looked like a different person.</p> 
 <p>A leopard can’t change its spots. It was easy to tell that Bai Xiaofei had grown a lot in the past six months, but one thing could never change: He was still the same sleazy Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“If you don’t want to, then forget it. But don’t try to be lazy again. There are a bunch of things in the academy waiting for you. This time, you’re not allowed to cause trouble!” Lei Shan finally revealed his true intention, catching Bai Xiaofei between laughter and tears.</p> 
 <p>“Hey, hey, gramps, you are mistaken. I am a student, not a teacher nor a college manager. It’s unreasonable of you to throw such a heavy burden at me!” Bai Xiaofei smiled wryly. The helplessness on his face was not fake.</p> 
 <p><em>Smelly old man, didn’t you listen to me just now? I came back to finish my last year as a student! A student, not an administrator!!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei screamed in his heart, but he didn’t dare to say it aloud as he now had a better understanding of how terrifying a Timeless Rank was.</p> 
 <p>“With great power comes great responsibility. Rest assured, when you graduate, I will definitely give you an unprecedented graduation summary!”</p> 
 <p>Lei Shan painted a rosy scenario, but Bai Xiaofei didn’t listen to a word. <em>I have two Starnet Brilliances, you still think I need a graduation summary?</em></p> 
 <p>“I still have work to do. I heard that the Student Community has organized a welcome-back party today. I have already had Qingtian and Jing Cheng attend. You’re the main character, so don’t be late. Go get ready.”</p> 
 <p>With a wave of Lei Shan’s hand, a gentle energy pushed Bai Xiaofei out.</p> 
 <p>As the only one who ever enjoyed this kind of straightforward dismissal from the principal, Bai Xiaofei shook his head with a wry smile before heading to the square. He also knew about the party, he was just a little panicked so he ran to Lei Shan to hide a little.</p> 
 <p>After a long time of not facing so many people, he felt that he might have a slight fear of crowds. The thought of speaking in front of so many people made him nervous. When had this ever happened before?</p> 
 <p>“Brother Fei, you’re finally here. Any later and there’d be a messy situation!” Upon seeing Bai Xiaofei, Wu Chi dragged him to the prepared structure and pushed him in.</p> 
 <p>Everyone then waved to Bai Xiaofei. The next second, mechanisms turned, and the structure under Bai Xiaofei rose…</p>
