 <p>Chapter 875: Opportunity?!</p> 
 <p>“Oh… wait!” Bai Xiaofei’s eyes suddenly lit up after a long trance.</p> 
 <p>“Hmm? Can’t accept that reality?” Lan Qiushuang said. There were things she needed to stop in their infancy.</p> 
 <p>“No, Aunt Lan. According to what you said, my father was with Lin Nishang for five years after graduation and never saw her again later. If Lin Li is his daughter, she should be older than Brother Tianhe. The fact that she is the same age as me proves otherwise!” Bai Xiaofei analyzed.</p> 
 <p>However, Lan Qiushuang’s reaction was quite different from what he imagined.</p> 
 <p>“That’s why I only told you to keep a distance from her. Whether there are any special circumstances, you have to ask Lin Nishang to know, only her words are valid. Before that, you should avoid making any mistakes at all,” explained Lan Qiushuang.</p> 
 <p>The weight that Bai Xiaofei had just put down once again threatened his heart. He just wanted to fly to Lin Nishang and make it clear right at this moment.</p> 
 <p>“I understand, thank you.” For once, Bai Xiaofei was obedient to a person about this kind of sensitive topic.</p> 
 <p>“I have said everything. The rest is this.” From her storage ring, Lan Qiushuang took out something that Bai Xiaofei was familiar with. Her eyes flashed with reluctance.</p> 
 <p>It was a Token of Heroes, which was, just like with Luo Xi, one of the few mementos she had of Bai Longfei.</p> 
 <p>Accepting the token from Lan Qiushuang, Bai Xiaofei stuffed it with the other two at his waist. He had to say that he truly admired these things. They showed no sign of being melted in the Heavenly Nonaburn Formation at all!</p> 
 <p>However, that begged the question: What could possibly slice such a solid thing in half?!</p> 
 <p>“To be honest, I really don’t want you to reassemble the Tokens. That was… the worst nightmare one could ever have,” Lan Qiushuang commented with a hint of fear.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei did not know what she was afraid of. He only knew that he had to visit that legendary Ruins!</p> 
 <p>“Aunt Lan, I will be careful.” Bai Xiaofei smiled faintly.</p> 
 <p>“You seriously don’t even have a storage ring?” Seeing Bai Xiaofei stuff the tokens into his waistband, Lan Qiushuang frowned.</p> 
 <p><em>Just how poor is this pitiful child?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Well… I did, but it was destroyed in an accident.” When Lan Qiushuang mentioned the storage ring, Bai Xiaofei’s heart ached uncontrollably. His storage ring had been full of high-grade items! If nothing else, the Feature Locking Pills alone were priceless!</p> 
 <p>“Take this.” Lan Qiushuang helplessly shook her head. Taking off her storage ring, she erased her spirit mark. “There is nothing valuable in it so you can use it without worry. You are a guest of the Yun clan, we can’t treat you shabbily.”</p> 
 <p>Reflexively accepting the storage ring, Bai Xiaofei linked it to his spirit and was shocked silly.</p> 
 <p><em>What the?! You said there’s nothing valuable in it?! What about that mountain of origin stones and the piles of Amethyst Cards?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Thank you, Aunt Lan…” Wiping the cold sweat on his forehead, Bai Xiaofei was once again defeated by rich people’s generosity as he realized how small his Illusion Demon still was. Originally, he thought he was very close to the nine major merchant groups, but now it seemed he was still miles from them.</p> 
 <p>“If you really want to thank me, stay in this city for a while. It may not be calm at the moment, but in any case, small matters will never be able to affect the foundation of Ethereal. Compared to this empire, those things are too insignificant,” said Lan Qiushuang.</p> 
 <p>The clear implication gave Bai Xiaofei ideas. “Aunt Lan, what do you think of the human puppets?” he asked with vague expectations as he hadn’t gotten any feedback from the big shots on the matter. Lan Qiushuang was the first and this was a rare opportunity.</p> 
 <p>“In my opinion, it may be a good thing.” She smiled, giving an answer that Bai Xiaofei couldn’t think of even if it killed him.</p> 
 <p>“A good thing?!” He frowned, unable to see anything good from it, otherwise, it wouldn’t have given him a headache. Moreover, it was related to Shadow Death.</p> 
 <p>“As I said just now, this matter is not enough to shake the foundations of Ethereal, and the reason is that it was discovered too early. Therefore, what I care about is who will solve it. Now, as it has been assigned to the Yun family, it’s a good opportunity for Tianhe to prove himself.”</p> 
 <p>Lan Qiushuang’s explanation undoubtedly opened a new world for Bai Xiaofei. He had never thought about it like this at all.</p> 
 <p>“What is Brother Yun’s situation in the imperial capital now?” he asked. There was no detailed information about the younger generation of Ethereal in the intelligence he got, and certain things could not be understood by doing homework alone.</p> 
 <p>“You should already know about the four great clans in Ethereal. Among them, the Lan clan has been on the decline as it hasn’t given birth to any outstanding youngsters. The He clan is in a better situation, but most of the men in the family are silkpants, nothing to worry about.”</p> 
 <p>“The Yun clan and the Hai clan can be said to be equally powerful. At the same time, each occupies half of the influence in the court. The Yun clan is pro-military while the Hai clan is pro-politics. As much as they don’t see eye to eye, no one can do anything to the other.”</p> 
 <p>“At the moment, the emperor’s old illness has recurred and he has been meaning to abdicate. All parties are eager to make their move and the four great clans are all carrying out their plans in the dark. The Yun and Hai represent one faction, but it is difficult to find a breakthrough in the older generation, so the ultimate card lies with the younger generation.”</p> 
 <p>“It is not the time to side with a royal member yet, so what we need to do is to strengthen ourselves and make ourselves valuable. The competition between princes largely depends on their backing, and young people will naturally seek out young people, so Tianhe is the ace of both the Yun and Hai clan!”</p> 
 <p>Lan Qiushuang explained in great detail. Upon listening to everything, Bai Xiaofei knew what he had to do next. No matter what, the two clans had to lay a solid foundation for the turbulence of the throne competition in the near future.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei considered this paying back for his father’s debt. <em>He really owes too much…</em></p> 
 <p>“Aunt Lan, give me some time, and I promise that Brother Tianhe will become a sought-after person in the imperial city!” Bai Xiaofei said firmly.</p> 
 <p>However, Lan Qiushuang’s response was a long sigh.</p> 
 <p>“Speaking of this, there is actually quite a troublesome matter…”</p>
