 <p>Chapter 499: This is Real Bullying!</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t you hear Boss Bai?! Not even letting out a fart now? Weren’t you lot very arrogant before?!”</p> 
 <p>“Yeah, aren’t you formidable?!”</p> 
 <p>“If you have a problem say it now, or you won’t have a chance very soon!”</p> 
 <p>“They’re not scared silly, are they? Someone check if they’ve peed their pants!”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>Seeing no response from the other party after half a day, the crowd broke into a series of ridicule. The unbridled laughter made the new students panic. They already regretted grouping up for this opposition.</p> 
 <p>The Student Community was a giant tree, and they were simply ants in comparison!</p> 
 <p>Previously, Bai Xiaofei was able to succeed with his fuss because the Student Union hadn’t paid attention to him at first. By the time they did, the New Student Mutual Aid Community had already taken shape. Coupled with the emergence of several major events such as the Blossom Competition, various conditions came together and gave Bai Xiaofei time and opportunity to develop. The most important thing was that the Student Union itself was problematic, and Lei Shan was aware of this.</p> 
 <p>So, in the end, Bai Xiaofei succeeded.</p> 
 <p>However, if new students wanted to stir up trouble now, that would be nonsense.</p> 
 <p>Not to mention that Lei Shan would never destroy this stabilization that had barely been established, Bai Xiaofei alone would not give them the opportunity to unite. The Student Community was on a whole new level from the Student Union, and Bai Xiaofei was its absolute leader!</p> 
 <p>“So this is the bearing of you seniors? Are you useless without threatening us with numbers?!” Pressed by the pressure, the leader of the new students finally spoke. If he didn’t say anything, his party would crumble.</p> 
 <p>However, he didn’t know that Bai Xiaofei, who stood opposite him, was not someone who played along with others’ ploys.</p> 
 <p>“Every single person here was gathered by me. What’s wrong with using numbers to intimidate you? As for the bearing you said, mine is only so big. That’s right, I’m bullying you with my force that’s hundreds of times your number! You have a problem?!”</p> 
 <p>At his words, the leader of the new students froze on the spot. For the first time in his life, his tried-and-true moral blackmail encountered an exceptionally hard obstacle!</p> 
 <p>“You… you’re not afraid of losing face?! Is that something that the head Student Community should say?!” Despite managing to open his mouth, the new student leader was trembling all over, unknown whether it was due to fear or anger.</p> 
 <p>Yet whatever it was, it didn’t affect Bai Xiaofei. He now had the absolute advantage and whatever he said was law.</p> 
 <p>“How f*cking interesting, do you f*cking know who you are talking to?! Don’t you know what I represent? Don’t you know that the Student Community is acknowledged by the academy?” Bai Xiaofei’s face instantly filled with anger. He sneered. “Losing face… Do you even know what face is? If it weren’t for this lord, whether you’d even be wearing underwear now would already be a question, let alone standing here discussing face with me. How embarrassing, I don’t want this face. I just want to have, as per your words, a ‘fair and open’ duel with you!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s barrage of words rendered the new student speechless. He didn’t know how to reply. However, just because he didn’t talk didn’t mean Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t.</p> 
 <p>“By the way, don’t go around saying that I’m cruel and heartless to the new students. Except for these Master Ranks, as long as you leave now, I swear as the manager of the Student Community to let bygones be bygones!”</p> 
 <p><a href="https://zhdict.net/dictionary/釜底抽薪" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pulling out all the wood under their pot</a>!</p> 
 <p><em>You think the law can not punish the public, that I can’t be cruel to so many people all at once? Then I’ll show you how the hearts of the people work and let you have a little taste of despair!</em></p> 
 <p>Sure enough, it was exactly as Bai Xiaofei had expected. As soon as his words fell, the new students at the back immediately grew chaotic. Although the dozen Master Ranks tried their best to keep the situation in check, whatever they said now was counterproductive, and the group of new students decreased at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p> 
 <p>In less than five minutes, the crowd that the Master Rank new students had gone to great lengths to unite had completely dispersed, making them a group of armyless leaders.</p> 
 <p>Looking at the empty space behind them, the remaining thirteen people immediately panicked. Some of them even wanted to leave as well.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Bai Xiaofei didn’t give them that chance.</p> 
 <p>“To be honest, I actually admire you guys a little.” He slowly walked towards the remaining new students with a sneer and said something that stunned them. Then, his cold sneer warmed up. “Oh, by the way, I still don’t know your names yet. You, since you are their leader, state your name. I will lead by example, my name is Bai Xiaofei.”</p> 
 <p>Despite Bai Xiaofei’s change of expression, these new students weren’t so stupid to think that he was going to let them go.</p> 
 <p>“Wu Xizhao,” he bit the bullet and stated his name, starting to feel powerless.</p> 
 <p>“It’s a pity for such a good name. What happened to your intelligence?” Bai Xiaofei said with a slight frown. From the pitying expression on his face, it looked very much like he was sad for Wu Xizhao’s parents.</p> 
 <p>It was this expression that stung Wu Xizhao’s self-esteem!</p> 
 <p>“You… you… That’s uneducated of you to insult people!”</p> 
 <p>A simple sentence exposed a fatal weakness of Wu Xizhao, which was instantly caught by Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p><em>Turns out to be a greenhouse flower. Sorry, young man, this lord is going to destroy this flower today!</em></p> 
 <p>“Your family must have quite a status, right?” Bai Xiaofei suddenly asked.</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye’s group behind him was first stunned, but soon sympathy appeared on their faces. Sympathy for Wu Xizhao…</p> 
 <p>Since Bai Xiaofei asked this question, the money was as good as finalized…</p> 
 <p>However, Wu Xizhao didn’t understand. Instead, his face was full of pride and even his fear of Bai Xiaofei had vanished.</p> 
 <p>“Lucky you asked, or if you attack me today, you’d die!” After threatening with a vicious expression, Wu Xizhao folded his arms and looked at Bai Xiaofei with his head held high. “Ever heard of Unify Business? I am the first young master of Unify Business!”</p> 
 <p>Wu Xizhao expected Bai Xiaofei’s surprise after he finished, but had to be disappointed. The scene that he imagined didn’t happen.</p> 
 <p>“Unify Business, the one that started by selling illegal goods. Tsk, no wonder you are so confident,” commented Bai Xiaofei with a smile before he looked at Fang Ye. “Fang Ye, say, since we have dispatched so many people today, how much is appropriate for the activity funds?”</p> 
 <p>Suddenly called out by Bai Xiaofei, Fang Ye was briefly stunned but quickly reacted. Even so, how much of an amount should he give?</p> 
 <p>“Should be at least a hundred Starnet Stones a person. After all, everyone had to make time from their busy schedules,” Fang Ye stated a rather conservative figure after brewing an excuse.</p> 
 <p>“Ah, Fang Ye, you underestimate our first young master. Do you think he is that kind of stingy person? At least 500 Starnet Stones per person, then that won’t disappoint our first young master’s identity.”</p> 
 <p>At Bai Xiaofei’s words, Fang Ye couldn’t help but swallow his saliva. 500 Starnet Stones per person sounded very little, but that was before taking into account how many people had gathered!</p> 
 <p>Considering the price of Starnet Stones in the academy, then at 500 stones per person, and there were at least 5,000 people here…</p> 
 <p>Wu Xizhao hadn’t yet reacted, but he instinctively felt that it was not a good thing!</p> 
 <p>“What exactly do you mean?!” yelled Wu Xizhao, unable to stand this pressuring feeling.</p> 
 <p>“Sure enough, there is a problem with your intelligence if you fail to understand something simple.” Bai Xiaofei sighed. “Forget it, I’ll explain it to you. Now, you have two choices. One is that all of these people will come at you together and teach you how to be a good new student. The other is that you pay for your peace, 500 Starnet Stones each person!”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished, all the people present erupted.</p> 
 <p>They thought they were running errands, but now this seemed like they were going to make money! Sure enough, follow the boss and benefit!!!</p> 
 <p>“In your dreams!” Wu Xizhao was finally unable to contain his anger. He summoned his puppet, an odd-looking short sword, and stabbed at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei had been prepared from the moment he arrived. He slightly bent and dodged Wu Xizhao’s attack. Then, in a swing of his right arm, he slapped Wu Xizhao on the back of the head.</p> 
 <p>Just a slap and Wu Xizhao’s vision was filled with stars… By the time he recovered, he was already on the ground with Bai Xiaofei’s foot firmly on him.</p> 
 <p>“Do you think this is the outside world? Here, you Master Ranks better keep your tails between your legs, or you will die very miserably! Also, remember to do your research on who you are against in advance next time, otherwise, you may not be able to accept the results!”</p> 
 <p>Being stepped on by Bai Xiaofei, Wu Xizhao’s face was beet red. From his expression, he seemed like he just wanted to die…</p> 
 <p>“If you don’t want to let those people over there who were willing to trust you to end up like you, pay up. Or I bet my people are very willing to teach them how to behave.” Bai Xiaofei looked towards the remaining twelve people. At the moment, they didn’t even dare to move…</p> 
 <p>“Fine, I’ll pay!” Wu Xizhao spat a few words after a long hesitation.</p> 
 <p>After getting a satisfactory answer, Bai Xiaofei lifted his foot.</p> 
 <p>“Remember, this is called bullying new students. What we did before was only guidance.”</p>
