 <p>Chapter 759: A Long Journey!</p> 
 <p>“My brother, are you sure you want to bring so many people?”</p> 
 <p>Seeing the group of people behind Bai Xiaofei, Tong Fei was stupefied.</p> 
 <p>“Many? My three madams have always been inseparable from me. Chenchen, Sisi, and Weiwei are their close attendants who also take care of my two daughters. I can’t leave them behind. These guys are my trusted guards, you already know. And…”</p> 
 <p>“Alright, alright I know, brother, let’s go!” Tong Fei regretted even asking. Bai Sicheng was obviously taking this trip as a vacation.</p> 
 <p>But even so, he was still grateful. After all, Bai Xiaofei said he had received an order from his boss to continue their cooperation as long as his partner passed the investigation. In other words, Tong Fei’s money pouch could keep bulging!</p> 
 <p>A pile of luggage was loaded into the carriages. Bai Xiaofei had taken out the handsome Blackscale Horses once again since they were not too much for his current wealth and ‘status.’ As the huge motorcade set out, Bai Xiaofei’s group were excited beyond measure.</p> 
 <p>Tong Fei deemed their reaction to be natural. After all, they were going on a trip to a place they had never seen before. </p> 
 <p>He could never imagine that they were excited about their mission, which only officially started now. They had been waiting for this day for half a year!</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, their excitement was too early…</p> 
 <p>“Why did you stop?! We ran into bandits again?!” In the carriage for the women, Duan Yiyi’s arrogant voice rang out.</p> 
 <p>Mo Ka, who was driving the carriage, hurriedly poked his head in. “My second young miss, we have arrived at a rest stop. If we miss this one, it will be a week before we can find the next place to rest.”</p> 
 <p>Mo Ka’s teasing tone earned him a glare from Duan Yiyi.</p> 
 <p>Soon, Fang Ye guided the group out of the carriage and into the said rest stop, of which they only had one word to describe – Miserable!</p> 
 <p>Aside from a shabby little inn, there was nothing but bare rocks in the surroundings. The sign over the door was weathered and only half of it could be vaguely seen: ‘inn.’</p> 
 <p>“Pock, wake up! We have visitors!”</p> 
 <p>Everyone heard a bright voice as soon as they stepped out from the carriages. Right after, two men, one fat and one thin rushed out in a hurry.</p> 
 <p>“Greetings, honored guests! Thank you for gracing our little inn with your presence!” The fat man came over and greeted them warmly after giving the groggy-looking thin man a slight kick.</p> 
 <p>“Ah! Greetings! Thank you for your grace!” The thin man returned to his senses and tried to repeat the fat man’s words.</p> 
 <p>“Cut it with the nonsense. Prepare us rooms and food. This is for you,” said Heartless coldly as he tossed out a gold coin.</p> 
 <p>The fat man caught the coin and his eyes immediately lit up. <em>A gold coin! I actually earned a whole gold coin in this hellhole! This group is rich!</em></p> 
 <p>The two men were full of smiles as they started to busy around like fully wound-up clocks.</p> 
 <p>“Oh heavens! Can a room be any more tattered than this?!”</p> 
 <p>Looking at the room assigned to her and Zhu Nuo, Duan Yiyi was full of distaste. She wasn’t acting, the room was just too run-down. There were holes everywhere, and the sounds of all kinds of small animals could be clearly heard. The only acceptable thing was the bed that at least still looked sturdy…</p> 
 <p>“Why are you standing around?! Take out our own mattress, or how will I live in this terrible place?!” Duan Yiyi scolded Xu Chen. This scene was seen by Heartless who happened to be passing by.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, yes, Second Young Miss, I’ll get them prepared,” Xu Chen answered in a panic and ran out.</p> 
 <p>Heartless kept walking as if he had seen nothing.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Heartless! Did you finish settling in your room?”</p> 
 <p>Seeing Heartless, Wang Hang immediately came over. The fight at their first meeting did not create a gap between them. As far as everyone was concerned, Wang Hang had the closest ‘relationship’ with Heartless.</p> 
 <p>“I’m quite casual and don’t have much stuff. I can settle down in a place pretty easily,” Heartless replied and looked into the room behind Wang Hang.</p> 
 <p>Inside, Wu Chi and the guys were busy arranging their items, their faces ‘full of sweat.’ This level of acting was the hardest for them as they had to pretend to be martial artists and not puppet masters.</p> 
 <p>Relatively speaking, Chen Hui had the easiest role because he needed to hide very few things.</p> 
 <p>“What’s wrong, brother? Not like you don’t already know us, nothing but crude men to see there.” Wang Hang patted Heartless on the shoulder with a question that embarrassed him.</p> 
 <p>The closer they got to their base camp, the more cautious Heartless and Tong Fei became. The guard that they once put down had been picked up again.</p> 
 <p>Unlike the previous cooperation, they could not allow any accidents this time. Old Song’s result was their warning…</p> 
 <p>“No, no, my brother, you think too much. I was wondering if you guys can get used to such a lacking place. After all, we are the guides on this trip. We won’t be able to answer to my superior if we fail to take good care of you.” Heartless reacted very quickly.</p> 
 <p>“If so, brother, don’t look at us. We are only martial artists, what can we be picky about? But I’m sure our master and madams can’t get used to this place.” Wang Hang laughed and kicked the ball away towards Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p><em>Want to probe us? Then go see Big Brother Fei. I’ll hand it to you if you can find anything!</em></p> 
 <p>“How can a little character like me talk to Boss Bai? Our Boss Tong will take care of him.” Heartless smiled awkwardly, knowing he was destined to have no result this time.</p> 
 <p>“Are you all done? Let’s go for a drink! We actually caught our brother Heartless for once, I have to see his capacity for alcohol!” shouted Wang Hang suddenly.</p> 
 <p>“I’m all done!!” Wu Chi was the first to respond, fully demonstrating what an alcoholic was like.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t want to rain on your parade, but are you sure this hellhole even has wine?” Mo Ka blinked.</p> 
 <p>The question rendered everyone speechless. Indeed, the poor appearance of the duo stationed at this rest stop suggested otherwise.</p> 
 <p>“No worries, I brought wine with us!” said Heartless. A light flashed and an old wine jar appeared in his hand.</p> 
 <p>“A storage prop?! Sure enough, puppet masters are all rich bags! We gotta make you bleed gold this time!” Wang Hang laughed in joy, before hugging Heartless’s shoulder and dragging him downstairs with the rest of the guys.</p> 
 <p><em>Feeling us out? Maybe in your next life!</em></p>
