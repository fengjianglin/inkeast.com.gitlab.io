 <p>Chapter 400: Meeting Imperial Concubine Qing!</p> 
 <p>Shang Youdao could see that Bai Xiaofei’s aversion to him had reached an extreme, but he could also see that Bai Xiaofei wasn’t lying when he said he would help. So, he didn’t care if he was hated, it was fine. After this ordeal, they would no longer have anything to do with each other anyway. As long as the Bright Road Merchant House could pass this threshold, Shang Youdao would have no regrets even if the whole world reviled him.</p> 
 <p>Once one had a clear goal, they became horrifying, especially when they decided to do whatever it took for this goal. This kind of person had no rational mind at all.</p> 
 <p>After Shang Youdao revealed everything and left, Bai Xiaofei had put his finger on something. Now all he had to do was wait for news from the garrison commander. He had a hunch that all the information in his mind would connect once he talked to Imperial Concubine Qing Fei, and the fog covering everything would be completely removed!</p> 
 <p>Holding this expectation, Bai Xiaofei finally got the good news from the garrison commander.</p> 
 <p>First, the deputy commander of the royal guard personally paid him a visit. Because of repeated reminders from the garrison commander, Deputy Commander Li’s attitude towards Bai Xiaofei was quite friendly. Bai Xiaofei got the information he wanted after a pleasant exchange.</p> 
 <p>The five guards who suddenly went insane at the cocktail party had no motives at all, and the background of each one was cleaner than the last. Under the protection of Deputy Commander Li, their families were able to avoid being put in prison. At present, they were all grounded at home until the investigation was over.</p> 
 <p>Before leaving, Deputy Commander Li repeatedly pleaded with Bai Xiaofei to prove the guards’ innocence, saying that since they had worked for the royal family all their lives and died also because of the royal family, the word betrayal should not appear on their tombstones.</p> 
 <p>In the face of Deputy Commander Li who swore this as if treating the five guards as his own family, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t even feel any doubt. After all, he had already speculated that the five guards just accidentally became the pawns of someone else. Deputy Commander Li’s words basically confirmed his guess.</p> 
 <p>Anyone had to have a motive to do anything. However, the five guards had no motive in carrying out the assassination!</p> 
 <p>Then, it was obvious. Among those who attended the banquet that day, there was a puppet master who could control others’ minds, and this person was an enemy and not a friend!</p> 
 <p>And, Bai Xiaofei felt that this person was probably Imperial Concubine Qing who he was about to see. That’s right, the garrison commander made it happen. For once, the narrow-minded emperor didn’t want to execute Bai Xiaofei with a thousand cuts and instead agreed to let him meet the imperial concubine.</p> 
 <p>Maybe she persuaded the emperor, or maybe the emperor also couldn’t sit still in this situation, so Bai Xiaofei proceeded exceptionally smoothly.</p> 
 <p>After following the garrison commander through all kinds of checks, Bai Xiaofei followed a maid all the way to the female royal quarters. The place where Imperial Concubine Qing resided was called Qingxue Palace.</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness, Bai Xiaofei has been brought here,” the maid stopped at the door and spoke softly.</p> 
 <p>Soon, a lazy voice came from inside, “He can come in by himself. No one is allowed to come near Qingxue Palace until I call.”</p> 
 <p>“Yes,” replied the maid before she slowly retreated.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei stood at the door, gulping hard.</p> 
 <p><em>Shit, what’s with that voice just now? Did she just wake up? Will I see something I shouldn’t if I go in now?</em></p> 
 <p>“You went to all those lengths to see me just to stand outside?” the lazy voice rang out again.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was stunned briefly before he finally summoned up the courage and pushed open the door. Stepping into Imperial Concubine Qing’s room, a refreshing fragrance wafted over, and Bai Xiaofei also witnessed for himself the opulence of a royal family.</p> 
 <p>The pink room reminded him of the Red Sleeve Building, but at least twice the size. Standing there, Bai Xiaofei’s hormones couldn’t help but grow restless. The center of the room was separated by a pink veil. The side of the veil he was in was for dining and receiving visitors. As for the other side, of course Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t know. However, Bai Xiaofei could hear the gurgling sound of water…</p> 
 <p>“Come in.”</p> 
 <p>As the lazy voice turned into an enchanting call, Bai Xiaofei’s scalp tingled.</p> 
 <p><em>Why do I feel like this isn’t going quite right?</em></p> 
 <p>No matter what, Bai Xiaofei had to go along with Imperial Concubine Qing. She was the one holding all the information he needed. Biting the bullet, he slowly lifted the fine veil. The next second, the scene that greeted his eyes made his blood flow at an alarming speed.</p> 
 <p>The smoky inner room had a steaming hot spring, and Imperial Concubine Qing was slowly wiping her body. Her beautiful curves loomed under the water while her shoulders above shone with a milky luster.</p> 
 <p>All his prepared words and questions got stuck at his throat as Bai Xiaofei didn’t know what to say to deal with the present situation. His present state was unable to speak or leave. If a meeting already condemned someone to a death by a thousand cuts, what would it be for seeing so much of what shouldn’t be seen?</p> 
 <p>“Come here,” said Imperial Concubine Qing slowly with a shallow smile.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei woodenly walked over. Even he didn’t know if what he was doing was the right move, but his body still reacted on its own.</p> 
 <p>“Xiaoxing isn’t here, you help me wipe my back.”</p> 
 <p>Upon those words, Bai Xiaofei was dumbstruck.</p> 
 <p>“Err… why don’t I call the maid back, then she…”</p> 
 <p>“If you are not afraid to die, go ahead. Do you think she is the type who can keep a secret?” Imperial Concubine Qing directly dismissed Bai Xiaofei’s idea of escape before he could finish.</p> 
 <p>Gulping with difficulty, Bai Xiaofei picked up the towel nearby, wetted it before gently wiping Imperial Concubine Qing’s back.</p> 
 <p>“Your first time wiping a woman’s back?” she suddenly asked an irrelevant question after a few swipes.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei couldn’t think of any other response to this question except silence.</p> 
 <p>“Heh, you are unexpectedly quite pure, aren’t you.” Imperial Concubine Qing covered her mouth and chuckled. Her remark once again sparked a fire in Bai Xiaofei’s body.</p> 
 <p><em>Stupid, you can’t be like this! You’re going to make a mistake at this rate! Have to divert attention! Yes, divert your attention!</em></p> 
 <p>“Your Highness, what do you think of what happened at the party?” asked Bai Xiaofei in a serious voice while forcing himself not to look at the imperial concubine’s body.</p> 
 <p>“What else can I think? Some people deliberately tried to stir up trouble and make the imperial city uneasy. You and the Bright Road Merchant House are just scapegoats,” Imperial Concubine Qing pulled some random nonsense, her words full of loopholes.</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness, even though I don’t know what’s really going on, I still find your answer a bit too perfunctory,” Bai Xiaofei cut to the chase, having no intention to play around with her.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t really understand what you are talking about. I am just duckweed<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span> in this deep palace, what do I know? It’s already not easy for me to pass my days safely here.” Gently wiping her arm, the imperial concubine kept pretending.</p> 
 <p>“A Master Rank puppet master is only duckweed?”</p> 
 <p>A sharp glint flashed in Bai Xiaofei’s eyes. Imperial Concubine Qing’s trembling body at his words did not escape his eyes and touch…</p>
