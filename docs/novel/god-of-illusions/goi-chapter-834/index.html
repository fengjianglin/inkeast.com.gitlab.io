 <p>Chapter 834: Following Rules!</p> 
 <p>“Ah, very bold about who to pick, huh?! Do you know how many dogs like you were killed for biting around?!“ the triggered leading disciple cursed.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, the thirty-six selected people prepared to fight.</p> 
 <p>It was never necessary for the Revelation Pavilion to destroy a person by itself, which was why these disciples dared to be fearless. They relied not on the reputation of the pavilion, but on the hopeful hearts of those who waited for divination. They knew that those people would do anything for an opportunity to be chosen!</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei was not easily scared, let alone in his own home!</p> 
 <p>“Want a fight? I’ll happily oblige!” Tan Xin waved her little fists as if afraid the fuss was not big enough.</p> 
 <p>“Outrageous!!”</p> 
 <p>The angry shout from the leading disciple was like a command. The next second, the thirty-six chosen people rushed towards Bai Xiaofei’s group. The crowd consciously made way for them. They had seen the same kind of drama many times before.</p> 
 <p>However, what happened next was different from what they were used to. The thirty-six seemingly decent puppet masters had yet to even deploy their strength when they were sent flying with a wave of Tan Xin’s hand!</p> 
 <p><em>What the hell?! Did anyone see what her puppet was? Did she just rely only on energy to crush them?! What rank is she?!</em></p> 
 <p>Astonishment filled everyone’s heart. They immediately felt that the situation was not as simple as they had thought. Bai Xiaofei’s group obviously came prepared!</p> 
 <p>“If this is all you got, you might as well save yourself a fight. Either call someone higher up or redo an honest draw. Otherwise, don’t blame me for not giving you mercy!” Bai Xiaofei said coldly.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the three disciples finally looked troubled. It did not do them any good to drag it on like this. After all, with so many spectators, they would not be able to cover up their deed when the mess became a big deal.</p> 
 <p>“Do we really seek Master Heartseer…?” one of the three disciples finally lost his composure.</p> 
 <p>“Of course we’ll call someone, but not Master Heartseer. Go and get Uncle Wang!” The leader was the leader after all. He was still relatively calm. “Brat, just you wait!”</p> 
 <p>Looking at the three disciples who refused to behave, Bai Xiaofei reluctantly shook his head. Despite seeing someone leave, he knew that they were definitely not looking for Heartseer. However, it was all right since he was going to uproot the rotten. The person they were calling was definitely one of theirs.</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, the helper of the three disciples soon arrived. From the man’s outfit, he was obviously in a rather high position.</p> 
 <p>This was soon confirmed. As soon as the man appeared, the crowd erupted.</p> 
 <p>“Master Wang!!!”</p> 
 <p>“Master, draw me a stick!!”</p> 
 <p>“Master, just tell me what you want!”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>Everyone went crazy like they were seeing a millennial idol. It was the 11th grand disciple of the Revelation Pavilion, Wang Ling!</p> 
 <p>“Who dares to make trouble in the Revelation Pavilion?!” a deep voice resounded. Wang Lang held himself up very high, but not in his wildest dream could he expect Bai Xiaofei’s answer.</p> 
 <p>“Your grandfather!”</p> 
 <p>As these two words echoed in the air, the crowd fell dead silent.</p> 
 <p><em>Oh dear heaven, is this fellow crazy?!</em></p> 
 <p>Let alone the onlookers, even Wang Ling was dumbstruck. His mind went blank at the answer, but he quickly reacted and his face distorted in fury.</p> 
 <p>“Anyone who kills him, I’ll give up ten years of my longevity to draw a divination for them!!”</p> 
 <p>Upon Wang Ling’s roar, the crowd grew listless. They turned to Bai Xiaofei all at once and stared at him like he was a precious treasure.</p> 
 <p>Heavy rewards called for brave souls, not to mention when the offer reward far exceeded what everyone present desired.</p> 
 <p>However, facing the pack of hungry predators, the ‘prey’ lightly uttered, “You help me catch him, and I’ll give you a chance to get a divination from the 5th grand disciple.”</p> 
 <p>“Your joke’s killing me, hahaha! What makes you think you can order the 5th…”</p> 
 <p>The smug Wang Ling suddenly stopped in the middle of his words. Then, under the gaze of all and sundry, he plopped down on the ground.</p> 
 <p>“11th grand disciple Wang Ling greets Great Great Great Great… Great Granduncle!!”</p> 
 <p>In the face of Bai Xiaofei, who took out the exclusive token from Revelation, cold sweat immediately covered Wang Ling’s face. <em>I must be seeking death!!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Ohh? You know your stuff, you can recognize my token from so far away? Can I call the 5th grand disciple now?” Bai Xiaofei asked softly.</p> 
 <p>The brains of the people around him had all crashed. They did not know the token in Bai Xiaofei’s hand, but they knew Wang Ling, and his reaction had already said everything…</p> 
 <p>“Please forgive us, Great Ancestor, we little people were blind and could not see Mount Tai! As long as Great Ancestor…”</p> 
 <p>“Oh come on, I’m not as old as you say. Besides, I don’t intend to let worms like you remain in the Revelation Pavilion, I’ll deal with you all in a while. As for today’s draw, redo it. This time, I don’t want to see what I should not see,” Bai Xiaofei said, and walked towards the gate. As the crowd along the way squeezed their hardest to make way for his group, he looked at the two shocked disciples who were with the leading disciple and ordered, “One lead the way, I want to see Master. The other go and call Heartseer.”</p> 
 <p>When the two came to their senses, Bai Xiaofei had walked far in.</p> 
 <p>“Why are you standing around?! Go and do what our ancestor said!!” Wang Ling scolded as he kicked the leading disciple flying. If it wasn’t for him, he would not get involved in such trouble. It was still a question whether he could remain in the Revelation Pavilion now.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>“What are you going to do with those people?” On the way, Tan Xin suddenly showed interest.</p> 
 <p>“They are definitely in a chain of benefits, or else the few of them alone would not dare not tamper with the draw plate. I intend to dig deeper, but it depends on whether the old man will give me permission. It’s hard to say if he’s actually the biggest boss in the chain.” Bai Xiaofei pictured the obscene Revelation. After all, that was the same method the old man used to flirt with women.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei had no apprehension for the 11th disciple and those around him at all. Wang Ling was obviously not powerful enough to stir any waves.</p> 
 <p>“What a high evaluation you have for your master.” Covering her mouth to hide a smile, Tan Xin began to look forward to seeing Revelation. A few of his disciples alone were able to make people scrabble around madly for their attention, just how perverse was he?</p>
