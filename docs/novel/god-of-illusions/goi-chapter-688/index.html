 <p>Chapter 688: Jackdaw’s Pain!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei returned to the inn with an uneasy stomach, thinking about how he could resolve his financial issues. However, this place wasn’t Starnet, and he could not come up with any ideas.</p> 
 <p>“Heh, it seems I’ll have to live off my wives.” With a long sigh, Bai Xiaofei made a ‘tough’ decision.</p> 
 <p>As he stood at the door planning the conversation, it was abruptly opened from the inside, followed by a frantic Leng Liuying, who crashed into Bai Xiaofei’s arms.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t you know to knock on the door when you come back?!”</p> 
 <p>Rubbing her forehead, Leng Liuying glared at Bai Xiaofei. Meanwhile, the latter ended up even worse. She was hit only on the forehead while he was hit on the nose…</p> 
 <p>“You’re blaming me? Why are you in such a hurry at night? You have a little lover to see?!” Bai Xiaofei refused to be outdone and retorted sharply.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, cut it out! We have something more important right now,” a serious Leng Liuli stopped Leng Liuying, who was about to retort.</p> 
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Bai Xiaofei frowned in confusion. He rarely saw such a serious expression on her.</p> 
 <p>“There was an incident with Jackdaw. They brought back some very important news and plan to make it public. Didn’t you notice that there was no one below when you returned?”</p> 
 <p>Her words struck Bai Xiaofei into realization. He had just wondered why the inn was so cold and lifeless today.</p> 
 <p>“We wanted to wait for you to come back, but there wasn’t even a shadow after half a day, so we were about to go and have a look. But now that you are back, we can save a lot of trouble.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei immediately understood. Blackie jumped off his shoulder and the appearances of the triplets changed…</p> 
 <p>The Jackdaw group’s place was not far away. When the group arrived, however, let alone the inn, even the outside were crowded, where the wind and snow were automatically ignored by everyone.</p> 
 <p>Nothing was more important than intel at the moment!</p> 
 <p>“Brother Feng!” a shout rang out from the crowd.</p> 
 <p>Looking in that direction, Bai Xiaofei saw three familiar faces.</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother Han San, I didn’t expect to see you here again!”</p> 
 <p>Greeting Han San who was rushing over enthusiastically, Bai Xiaofei made a gesture of silence to the three sisters.</p> 
 <p>“These three are…”</p> 
 <p>“My wives.” Bai Xiaofei didn’t mean to hide it at all and was even a little proud when he said this, resulting in the triplets feeling warm in their hearts. It was a simple happiness for them to be introduced like this.</p> 
 <p>“My brother is so blessed!” At first glance, the figures of the three sisters looked almost the same, and Han San knew the tradition of the Snow Kingdom. Therefore, he was quick to label Bai Xiaofei as ‘abundantly happy.’</p> 
 <p>“You flatter me, brother. By the way, do you know what Jackdaw is up to?” With some expectations, Bai Xiaofei steered the topic to his concerns. After all, he had missed out quite a lot of things.</p> 
 <p>“You asked the right person. I watched them withdraw from the mountain!” Han San patted his chest, saying what Bai Xiaofei wanted to hear the most. “Let me tell you, Brother Feng, this Holy Snow Mountain is truly formidable. If you are unsure, do not go in. There is an Emperor Rank beast inside!”</p> 
 <p>Han San’s expression was as exaggerated as could be, just like he had seen the magical beast with his own eyes.</p> 
 <p>“The Jackdaw Mercenary Group sent two whole branches this time, and the Fifth Team that arrived today was native to the Snow Kingdom, a very experienced team. Yet, they were nearly annihilated in the cave this afternoon. Only their two team captains and some elites escaped, the rest all died inside!”</p> 
 <p>Han San grew increasingly emotional the more he spoke with a hint of fear on his face. He had initially planned to try his luck this afternoon, but now it seemed that he was lucky not to have gone in…</p> 
 <p>At that information, Bai Xiaofei was surprised.</p> 
 <p>He had seen Emperor Rank magical beasts. The kind of soul-crushing power they showed really could make a person despair. He could also guess why Jackdaw wanted to gather so many people.</p> 
 <p>“Finally!” someone exclaimed.</p> 
 <p>The noise around came to an abrupt end. All eyes gathered on the stage of the second floor where two people with dignified expressions entered everyone’s field of vision.</p> 
 <p>Those two were no strangers to Bai Xiaofei – Jackdaw and Qiu Feng!</p> 
 <p>“I think you all know what happened this afternoon. I grieve for my brave brothers, but I will not disappoint their sacrifices,” Jackdaw said and raised his hand. A Recording Eyeball flew up, projecting the video saved inside onto the night sky.</p> 
 <p>Everyone had thought that they could catch a glimpse of the magical beast in question, but aside from seeing fire, they could only hear shouts and screams from the Jackdaw Mercenary Group.</p> 
 <p>The video was not long, but in this period, several hundred members were burned to death in batches!</p> 
 <p>“This is all we have. According to the judgment of our survivors, this unseen enemy has at least the strength of an Emperor Rank. The fire it releases can ignore most shield abilities and cannot be put out by water. Once set on fire, the only way is to cut off the ignited part immediately.”</p> 
 <p>Jackdaw said slowly, and the crowd immediately grew chaotic. Most started to retreat.</p> 
 <p>“This beast is entrenched in a very important fork. From there, we feel a very rich and pure force. If we’ve guessed correctly, it should be an origin mine,” continued Jackdaw when people started to leave.</p> 
 <p>As soon as he finished, everyone stopped.</p> 
 <p><em>An origin mine…</em></p> 
 <p>As a necessity, an origin stone had the exchange rate of one to thirty Amethyst Coins. A raw origin mine was worth at least seven to eight times as much Amethyst Coins.</p> 
 <p>Moreover, no one could empty an origin mine alone. Therefore, as long as the magical beast was killed, everyone present would get a piece of the pie!</p> 
 <p>“ I stand here today and say this in the hope that we can unite. Our Jackdaw Mercenary Group alone is not enough to take down an Emperor Rank magical beast. Only when everyone joins hands can we have a chance at victory,” Jackdaw said solemnly, but there was no response.</p> 
 <p><em>Are you kidding? Even the elites you recruited from all over the continent were wiped out. You want to push us toward death?</em></p> 
 <p>Just when everyone thought that Jackdaw was wasting his words, he suddenly laughed, his laughter cold and full of irony…</p>
