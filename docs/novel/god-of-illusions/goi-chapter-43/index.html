 <p><span style>Even though Fei Guangshi was astounded, yet he didn’t say anything, but this shock of his didn’t escape the eyes of Bai Xiaofei who had other motives.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not only is it Mimicry but high level Mimicry. Little fellow, your future is limitless. What’s your name?” Lei Shan’s voice carried an extra trace of closeness, and the gaze he looked at Bai Xiaofei with carried a trace of praise and satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai Xiaofei.” Bai Xiaofei grinned and had a rare moment of being straightforward….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? Your surname is Bai? If that little girl Luo Xi were to find out, you’ll probably have a hard time.” Lei Shan started laughing as he spoke, and it seemed as if he’d thought of an amusing thing, whereas, cold sweat flowed from Bai Xiaofei and the others instead.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Vice Principal Luo Xi….</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Little girl….</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei shivered unconsciously, and he had a new understanding of Lei Shan’s age. </span><i><span style>This isn’t an old man! It’s an old ancestor!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve met Vice Principal Luo already, and my enrollment letter was given to me by her.” Bai Xiaofei who spoke truthfully caused Lei Shan and Fei Guangshi who’d heard of this matter for the first time to be stunned at the same moment because this news was simply astonishing to both of them who were familiar with Luo Xi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That little girl Luo Xi actually let you pass?!” Even Lei Shan who was over a hundred years old was incapable of controlling his excitement, and he was unable to refrain from asking and the gaze he shot at Bai Xiaofei had a slightly unusual feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Vice Principal Luo Xi is actually rather nice. But, she might have some misunderstandings, and I’m confident of being capable of rectifying this misunderstanding.” Bai Xiaofei spoke words that went against the truth, and he directly boasted his ability up to the heavens.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, this boasting drew the attention of Lei Shan and Fei Guangshi instead. As far as they were concerned, someone that was capable of possessing such a thought was already extremely courageous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected of a young hero. I haven’t felt admiration for someone in a long time, and you’re one of them!” Lei Shan roared with laughter and the incident with Luo Xi allowed Lei Shan to once again have a new understanding of Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can request something of me if you’re really able to accomplish this. So long as it’s within my ability, I’ll absolutely satisfy your request.” As soon as Lei Shan finished speaking, it caused everyone else to be stunned in unison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scope of his ability was slightly huge, and even Xue Ying and Fei Guangshi were unable to estimate exactly how huge it was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just based on Lei Shan’s current status, they were utterly unable to think of anything that wasn’t within the scope of his ability….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll remember this. Grandpa Lei, you can’t go back on your word when the time comes.” Even though he was stunned, Bai Xiaofei wasn’t stupid, and he naturally picked up this pie that fell down from the sky at the first possible moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A promise can never be taken back once it’s made.” Lei Shan stroked his dense beard as he reassured Bai Xiaofei, and everyone present besides Lin Li simultaneously shot an envious gaze at Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa Lei, you didn’t come here merely for the sake of seeing Huskie or talking about Vice Principal Luo with me, right?” Bai Xiaofei paused for a moment before dragging the topic of the conversation back to the point. After all, the important matter at hand was to deal with the matter of the Bounty Rankings, and without Lei Shan’s word, he might need to go through a great deal of trouble and it might not succeed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, finding out about your puppet was only a necessary process. Only after I’ve confirmed your identity as a Mimicry Stream puppet master would the remaining parts of the conversation be meaningful.” Lei Shan paused for a moment before he continued. “Do you have clear thoughts about the choice of your future puppets?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The conversation had finally come to the point, and besides Bai Xiaofei, everyone in the classroom turned solemn at the same time as they silently awaited Bai Xiaofei’s answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I do.” Bai Xiaofei answered with extreme resolution, and his confident tone caused the everyone to concentrate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me hear it.” Lei Shan grinned and seemed very much alike to an amiable old grandpa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mimicry is a part of the Illusion Steam, and the Illusion Stream conforms to my habits. So, I plan to continue choosing puppets of the Illusion Stream in the future to make up for Huskie’s insufficiencies.” As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking, Xue Ying and the others couldn’t help but frown. Obviously, this was the answer they dreaded the most.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then how many puppets do you plan to use for this purpose? After all, a person’s limit is to only possess seven puppets.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Seven puppets were something one had to at least be at the Exquisite Rank to accomplish!</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Bai Xiaofei had an extremely long distance to traverse to achieve this objective….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of them! So long as I can choose, my puppets will be related to illusions. Of course, I will consider some very good life-saving puppets, but I won’t consider the puppets of other streams.” His new answer was firm as before, and it seemed as if he had gone through careful considerations countless times. But, Lei Shan who was grinning slightly showed neither approval nor disapproval.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So in this way, you intend to take the Extreme path?” Lei Shan spoke a name that Bai Xiaofei had never come into contact with as he stared fixedly at Bai Xiaofei’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Extreme?” Bai Xiaofei frowned slightly and answered with a question while a puzzled expression appeared on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right, you ought to have not taken a theory lesson yet. Then I’ll do something beyond my duty and explain it to you on behalf of your future theory teacher.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since the first generation of puppet masters appeared, how puppets should be chosen had always been a problem of great dispute. But, along with the passage of time and development, most people attained a common view in the end, and the notion of a ‘generation’ appeared after this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A ‘generation’ represents the common view that most of the puppets masters came to when choosing puppets during a certain period of time. Moreover, up until now, this common view has undergone three reforms. In other words, the generation we’re in is the third generation of puppet masters, whereas, the Extreme you’re pursuing it the creation of the last generation, the second generation.” As soon as Lei Shan finished speaking, Bai Xiaofei roughly understood what Lei Shan wanted to say, but it wasn’t sufficient to change his thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s different in this generation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The first generation was the initial stage of exploration. At that time, every single puppet master wished for nothing more than for themselves to become a godlike legend. So, they mainly chose a variety of puppets. The person with the most abilities and the most special abilities was the best. This generation was called the generation of diversification, and most puppet masters fought alone. This generation really did give birth to numerous legends.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But, after experiencing the development of time, someone found a method to completely counter the generation of diversification, and it was the Extreme. The Extreme path revolved around the person’s first puppet, and the remaining puppets were entirely for the sake of serving the first puppet. It strengthened the first puppet to a terrifying degree, using something refined to go against a variety, and it completely crushed the first generation in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But, countering between streams was extremely serious during the extreme generation. The Onslaught Stream was countered by the Ranged Stream, the Ranged Stream was countered by the Assassin Stream, the Assassin Stream was countered by the Defense Stream…. So, a person that dared say he was number one in the world didn’t appear during this generation. But, a terrifying product appeared from this generation — An Extreme Team!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A group of people that strengthened their puppets with the Extreme method and made up for each other’s weaknesses, and they were assembled together to form a formidable group that was called an Extreme Team. Moreover, this sort of team hasn’t been eliminated by the times. Presently, they can still be seen on the continent, but they aren’t the mainstream composition of a team any longer.” Lei Shan stopped here, and it caused Bai Xiaofei to suddenly feel that he was being strung along and asked Lei Shan impatiently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what about the third generation? What's our current generation like?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lei Shan who’d achieved his goal smiled lightly, and he drank a mouthful of the tea Xue Ying served him before slowly speaking once again….</span></p>
