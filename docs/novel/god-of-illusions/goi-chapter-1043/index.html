 <p>Chapter 1043: Starting a Fire!</p> 
 <p>The death of the Nine Dragons city lord settled the outcome of the battle. The soldiers were chopped down one after another in the killing spree of Illusion Sword. However, many soldiers escaped using their knowledge of the terrain, which Bai Xiaofei noticed but made no effort to stop.</p> 
 <p>Unlike with Yi Shuang City, Bai Xiaofei changed his management method after Illusion Sword took down the other six cities in a row.</p> 
 <p>“Reporting to Leader, all enemies within Nine Dragons City have been handled!”</p> 
 <p>The ten captains of Illusion Sword stood in front of Fang Ye with smiles on their faces, marking the end of their bet with Bai Xiaofei. At this moment, there were still two hours before the deadline.</p> 
 <p>Of the 6000 Illusion Sword members, except for a few who suffered some minor injuries from the rampage of the city lord, the rest had barely been touched!</p> 
 <p>“This is only the beginning, so don’t get carried away. If it weren’t for my ability to restrain the city lord and that he knew nothing about me, it wouldn’t have been so easy.” Fang Ye immediately doused cold water on their enthusiasm.</p> 
 <p>“If you hadn’t been able to restrain him, I would have personally acted.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s sleazy chuckle rang out before the Illusion Sword members could process Fang Ye’s words. Seeing him, their eyes lit up.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, we passed, didn’t we?!”</p> 
 <p>Looking at his fervent fans, Bai Xiaofei shook his head with a wry smile. <em>Geez, how did they develop such an unrestrained character? Are these still the same group of calm hunters from earlier?</em></p> 
 <p>“You’ve done well. Go and have a rest. You won’t have much free time in the next few days,” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The ten captains jumped in excitement and cheered as they brought back the good news to their comrades.</p> 
 <p>When there were only Bai Xiaofei and Fang Ye, the latter’s expression instantly became serious.</p> 
 <p>“Next, a big move?” Being Bai Xiaofei’s long-time partner, Fang Ye, had given the word ‘big’ a brand-new definition. At least to him, taking down six cities was no big deal at all.</p> 
 <p>“Time waits for no one. Every minute delayed puts Senior Sister Qianye at a greater risk. I’ve already missed it once, I won’t let that happen again,” said Bai Xiaofei coldly with guilt and murderous intent in his eyes.</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye’s heart ached. He wished for Bai Xiaofei to be forever be the carefree class monitor he once had been, but that was destined to stay in his memory only. After all, people grew up, and the price was their innocent smiles…</p> 
 <p>In Bai Xiaofei’s original plan, Wu Chi and the others should have been the ones to conquer the six cities. However, they arrived at their respective targets only to find six defenseless cities. Everyone quickly understood what had happened. Since they had seen Illusion Sword act before, they weren’t surprised at all. They just hadn’t expected the operation to be so quick.</p> 
 <p>Conveniently taking over the six cities, they carried out Bai Xiaofei’s arrangements and brought the six cities an earth-shaking transformation.</p> 
 <p>Cloudveil was the most special of the four empires in the Northern Border region. This lay in their system that was aristocratic to the extreme. Noble statuses existed in other empires, but they were nowhere like in Cloudveil where titles meant everything!</p> 
 <p>Even a small viscount could live their whole life comfortably in Cloudveil. Meanwhile, an ordinary civilian only had three ways out – Either serve a noble as a domestic servant, or join the army and risk their life to get promoted, or became a laborer working in farms or mines.</p> 
 <p>Despite having the most origin stone mines on the continent and high-tiered annual gross domestic product, Cloudveil was the only empire that lost a huge number of citizens every year to famine due to its insurmountable gap between the rich and the poor.</p> 
 <p>However, the officials of Cloudveil had never shown any care about this problem. In their words, as long as their origin stone mines existed, no one could shake the foundation of Cloudveil!</p> 
 <p>That was indeed an indisputable fact, but it had never crossed their minds that, were any other empire to possess the same natural resources as them, Violethorn wouldn’t be dominating the Northern Border region right now…</p> 
 <p>What Bai Xiaofei aimed to change was precisely Cloudveil’s system!</p> 
 <p>Within the scope of the cities captured, he took away the rights to exploit all mineral mines from the original nobles and offered it to all and sundry with the ‘first come, first serve’ rule. Anyone could go to harvest from the mines and then go to a city to exchange the ores for gold coins.</p> 
 <p>The announcement of this policy resulted in a 180-degree turn in the attitude of the citizens. The downfall of the nobles allowed Illusion Demon and Bai Xiaofei to successfully gain the absolute support of the people.</p> 
 <p>The news of the reform was quickly spread. Although Bai Xiaofei didn’t deliberately try to do anything, more and more people chose to escape the control of the original system and poured into the territory under his control. With this influx of new people, the seven cities quickly completed their restoration work and new armies were quickly formed.</p> 
 <p>It was also due to this big movement that Bai Xiaofei and his Illusion Demon Merchant Group was noticed by the Cloudveil Empire, who found the impact they had made unacceptable! The several princes reached a tacit agreement to reach a temporary truce and focus on the small border corner that they had never given much care to.</p> 
 <p>At this point, one month had passed since Bai Xiaofei had arrived at Cloudveil.</p> 
 <p>However, the attention of the princes and nobles was not the only trouble that Bai Xiaofei had to face. Compared with what was to come next, the pressure from Cloudveil could only be regarded as an appetizer.</p> 
 <p><strong>In the city lord’s mansion of Yi Shuang City</strong></p> 
 <p>“Brother Fei, here comes the thing you are most worried about,” reported Fang Ye with a serious expression.</p> 
 <p>“What should come will come, but you know that is not what really worries me.” Bai Xiaofei sighed.</p> 
 <p>“I’ve deployed the entire Illusion Sword. It shouldn’t be long before we get news on their whereabouts. With Senior Yun Sheng’s ability, I believe that they are still alive!” said Fang Ye solemnly.</p> 
 <p>To his reassurance, Bai Xiaofei’s response was a wry smile, but it was quickly replaced by a resolute expression.</p> 
 <p>“No matter what, I will turn this empire upside down!”</p>
