 <p>Chapter 1027: Brand-New Realization!</p> 
 <p>“Smelly brat, now that I can finally have my revenge, you shall repent for what you have done to me!!” The Demonic God of Pain howled in exhilaration as he shot toward Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“If you are not afraid that your soul will disperse from your new body, I won’t even evade,” declared Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>As soon as the last word sounded, the fist of the Demonic God of Pain stopped just a hair’s breadth from Bai Xiaofei’s face. He could not move it forward at all!</p> 
 <p>“Brat, what do you mean?! What did you do to this body?” The Demonic God of Pain withdrew his fist with a glare. At the same time, he carefully scanned his new body, but nothing unusual turned up.</p> 
 <p>“What kind of strength a person can exert is limited by the body, and your body can at most bring into play the power of a peak-grade Exquisite Rank puppet master. That is to say, there are many in this world who are stronger than you. Then, think about your present identity – a human puppet. Once you are subdued, anyone can link with you and make you their puppet, and your life will be decided by just a thought of theirs,” explained Bai Xiaofei slowly.</p> 
 <p>The Demonic God of Pain stopped to ponder.</p> 
 <p>He had to admit that Bai Xiaofei was right. He had seen the top experts of Starnet Continent, and with his present strength, it was possible that he would cross someone who could kill him.</p> 
 <p>“From just the ones we know, Shadow Death obviously showed strong interest in human puppets. I believe that your existence will soon be noticed by them, and up to now, we haven’t seen their real top experts. Are you sure you can handle them? Or will you bow your head and become one of their dogs?”</p> 
 <p>The successive questions stumped the Demonic God of Pain.</p> 
 <p>“However, if you are willing to continue following me, I promise you won’t be troubled by these problems. You should be very clear about my ability. No one can find out that you are a puppet unless I want to!” Bai Xiaofei finally threw out the bait.</p> 
 <p>At this point, the Demonic God of Pain had finally thought it through.</p> 
 <p>“So you were waiting for this, no wonder you complied so easily. Now, although you can guarantee that this lord won’t be discovered by others, you yourself are always in trouble. Following you is the same as being your underling for free. What’s the difference between that and being Shadow Death’s dog?” The Demonic God of Pain sneered.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had already prepared for this reaction.</p> 
 <p>“Of course there is a difference. Shadow Death will limit your freedom, I won’t. You can leave at any time. And if there’s something you don’t want to help me with, I won’t force you. Not only will it give you absolute freedom, but should you need it, I can even gather materials to help you strengthen your body. You also know my relationship with Ethereal. They will certainly be willing to help me out.”</p> 
 <p>Sentence by sentence, Bai Xiaofei showed that he had studied the Demonic God of Pain’s situation thoroughly.</p> 
 <p>Being rendered speechless for half a day, the Demonic God of Pain uttered with difficulty, “So you’ve concluded that this lord can’t live without you?”</p> 
 <p>Obviously, he was swayed. What he lacked was only a ladder to step down!</p> 
 <p>“No one can’t live without anyone. It’s about making the best choice among many after weighing the pros and cons. I’m just offering you an option and you’re free to choose.” Bai Xiaofei smiled.</p> 
 <p>This ladder checkmated the Demonic God of Pain.</p> 
 <p>“Fine then, since you refuse to let go of me, I will reluctantly agree, but I have a request.” The Demonic God of Pain revealed a look of ‘I’ve come to terms,’ but his expression ran a chill down Bai Xiaofei’s spine.</p> 
 <p>“What is it…?” Bai Xiaofei gulped as a bad feeling welled up in his heart.</p> 
 <p>“I want to test your strength with this body… now!”</p> 
 <p>As soon as those words dropped, the Demonic God of Pain attacked. Since they were so close, Bai Xiaofei had no time to hide.</p> 
 <p>“Starnet Brilliance!” He used his ace card without any hesitation. Then, his face lit up with excitement. “You asked for this!”</p> 
 <p>Taking advantage of the invincibility period, Bai Xiaofei grabbed the Demonic God of Pain’s arm with his left hand while his right fist, enveloped in a golden flame, punched at his face.</p> 
 <p>“Demonic Barrier!”</p> 
 <p>Dark demonic air gushed out from the Demonic God of Pain. Punching into it, Bai Xiaofei felt as if his fist had punched into a quagmire as the golden flame and the demonic air began to eat away at each other. However, neither side planned to continue. With a loud roar, Bai Xiaofei made the golden flame explode. The two were then blown away from each other.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei suddenly laughed. “It’s over.”</p> 
 <p>The Demonic God of Pain knew his situation was bad. The dark demonic air once again gushed out and condensed into sharp spikes, but before the spikes could reach Bai Xiaofei, he had disappeared.</p> 
 <p>The next second, various Bai Xiaofei clones emerged from all directions, each enveloped in burning golden flames.</p> 
 <p>“Do you still want to continue?” the ten-odd Bai Xiaofeis asked in unison.</p> 
 <p>The Demonic God of Pain helplessly shook his head. He knew that none of them was the original, but they could be. Once Bai Xiaofei had the right opportunity, he would be a god within an area!</p> 
 <p>No one could be Bai Xiaofei’s match unless they could insta-kill him.</p> 
 <p>“You are becoming more and more proficient with that power.” The Demonic God of Pain resigned himself to his fate as he retracted the demonic air.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had proved what he had just said with practical actions. In this world, there were many people who could beat the Demonic God of Pain.</p> 
 <p>“It’s alright, I guess. It’s all about mixing and matching my abilities. After all, I’m an Illusion Stream puppet master. The less brawn needed in a fight, the better.” Bai Xiaofei chuckled. After the clash with the Sacks, he had figured out what his real ultimate trump card was.</p> 
 <p>It was not the mixed origin energy, nor his perverse body, nor his heaven-defying cultivation technique. It was the endless possibilities that he could create!</p> 
 <p><em>God of Illusion, that’s the real me!</em></p>
