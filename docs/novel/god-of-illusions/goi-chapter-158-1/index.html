 <p>Heh! That title caught your attention, didn’t it? :P Well, I’m not kidding! We present to you <a href="https://www.volarenovels.com/novel/rebirth-of-a-fashionista" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">Rebirth of a Fashionista</span></strong></a>!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>“We have nine bets available for the champion. All of them have high – extremely high payouts!” As the woman spoke, nine options appeared on the virtual screen. One did not have to be a genius to guess that these nine options were for betting on one of the nine classes containing the Newcomer Kings.</p>
 <p>“I don’t need to look at anything else. I only want to know the payout for class 456,” Bai Xiaofei said, clearly excited. Fang Ye’s heart started pounding as well.</p>
 <p>“Amazing, fellow student. The class you picked is the one with the highest payout.” The woman smiled and removed the other options from the screen. Next, she enlarged the number representing the Savage Class on the screen. Gradually, the indistinct numbers beneath the class number grew clear. It had a payout of 128 to 1!</p>
 <p>When Fang Ye saw the payout, he had difficulty breathing. Even Bai Xiaofei gulped. Bai Xiaofei operated all his brain cells to do a huge calculation in his head.</p>
 <p>He had around 32.5 billion Amethyst Coins in his hands. If it were multiplied by 128…he would receive 4.16 trillion Amethyst Coins! After calculating this number, he started trembling. This leap of wealth was simply heaven defying! One Amethyst Coin was equivalent to one week’s worth of expenses for an ordinary household. What kind of money was four trillion Amethyst Coins?</p>
 <p>Although he did not know as much about money as Fang Ye did, he was still certain that obtaining this amount of money would easily place him into the Wealth Rankings.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei couldn’t imagine how much money four trillion Amethyst Coins actually was, but he believed it was already enough to raise a private army.</p>
 <p>“Is there a bet limit?” Bai Xiaofei asked as he looked straight at the woman. He was simultaneously anxious and expectant. His question stunned the woman, but only slightly. An incomparably gentle smile appeared on her face.</p>
 <p>“You jest, fellow student. Since we dared to open this bet, how could we place any limits on the bet? Whatever amount you dare to place, we’ll have the guts to accept it all.”</p>
 <p>The nervousness in Bai Xiaofei’s heart vanished when he heard her.</p>
 <p>“You guys won’t renege on the debt, right?” Bai Xiaofei gulped then continued to question her, asking a question that even he himself felt was stupid. Nevertheless, he still asked it because he believed it was something he had to make certain!</p>
 <p>The woman’s face suddenly grew serious. If customers weren’t required to have at least five million Amethyst Coins to enter this floor, she would have already thrown both Bai Xiaofei and Fang Ye out of the building. Asking this question was no different from causing trouble, and it caused her impression of the two to drastically change. She now labelled them as cavemen who hadn’t seen the world.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She said, “Fellow students, you are questioning the capability of the Babel Merchant House. I can assure you that since the founding of the Babel Merchant House, we have never once reneged on a single copper coin owed to our customers. We even directly fulfill payments of up to several hundred million Amethyst Coins.”</p>
 <p>The change in the woman’s expression did not escape Bai Xiaofei’s eyes. He frowned slightly, but then he stopped himself from saying something that he almost said. He casually picked up a crystal-like fruit from the fruit basket and asked, “Fang Ye, how do you eat this thing?”</p>
 <p>Fang Ye momentarily blanked out before he reacted. He would have known the answer if it had been any other fruit in the basket. Unfortunately, this fruit Bai Xiaofei had selected was the only exception. He had never seen it before.</p>
 <p>He said, “I’m as clueless as you…”</p>
 <p>The woman heard them clearly. The disdain on her face intensified, and the gentleness of her voice vanished, replaced by a slight impatience.“You can directly eat it.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t you plan to introduce this fruit to us?” Bai Xiaofei asked, taking a bite of the “crystal” he was holding. Immediately, an exaggerated expression appeared on his face. “Holy shit! It’s tasty!”</p>
 <p>These were truly his sincere words. The crystal was very crunchy, making one want to focus all of one’s attention on chewing it alone. The feeling would not last long, however. Upon being chewed, the crystal would transform into an aromatic juice – so aromatic one couldn’t bear to swallow it.</p>
 <p>When one finally swallowed it, one would sense a dense aromatic fragrance dispersing throughout one’s body. Finally, the dispersed fragrance would rush straight to one’s head…</p>
 <p>Therefore, Bai Xiaofei’s exclamation was an instinctive one.</p>
 <p>“This fruit is called Crystal’s Longing. Eating it will give the same feeling of first love. This is an extremely valuable fruit that is usually only used as tribute. Generally, only the royal family have a chance to eat one,” explained the woman as she swallowed her saliva.</p>
 <p>She was lucky enough to have tasted the fruit once, and its taste was truly unforgettable. Unfortunately, Crystal’s Longing was too expensive and rare, so the fruit she had once eaten was the only one she had ever had.</p>
 <p>“Fang Ye, try it! If I had known this fruit was this good, I would have brought everyone in the class here.”</p>
 <p>Fang Ye took the fruit from Bai Xiaofei, and after taking a bite, his reaction was even greater than Bai Xiaofei’s. Bai Xiaofei had only cried out, but Fang Ye, on the other hand, directly started crying.</p>
 <p>“Oh my god, how can a fruit so delicious exist…”</p>
 <p>The two lamented and started taking bite after bite off the fruit, eventually finishing it in its entirety. In return for their embarrassing behavior, they received obvious disdain from the woman beside them.</p>
 <p>“Do you have any more of these? Can you get some for us? We want to bring some back,” Bai Xiaofei asked in excitement, causing the woman to no longer be able to hold in her anger.</p>
 <p>“Do you think the Crystal’s Longing is some common vegetable? When sold outside, this fruit has a price tag of ten thousand Amethyst Coins per fruit. Moreover, this is a fruit whose supply can never meet its demand. We had only placed it here for true VIP customers, not for people like you to take the fruits back as if they were some fast food!”</p>
 <p>“What did you say? Ten thousand Amethyst Coins per fruit?” Bai Xiaofei cried out in surprise, and Fang Ye wasn’t any better off. They had never expected the fruit to be so expensive. But then, so what if it was worth ten thousand Amethyst Coins? Bai Xiaofei had so much money he could feast on this fruit until he started vomiting…</p>
 <p>The woman said, “I suggest you stop wasting time and make your bets quickly. I still have other guests to attend to. I can’t afford to be wasting my time here with you.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Despite her professional training, she could no longer stay professional. In any case, with her current status in the store, two insignificant customers like them would not be able to affect her in any way. One ought to know that she had been the top saleswoman for several months in a row. It would not be an exaggeration to say that she alone was half the pillar supporting the store. This was also the source of her confidence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Of course, Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t care even if she was the entire pillar, as even death wouldn’t scare him. How could he allow a mere store employee to bully him?</p>
 <p>“I’m very unhappy with your attitude. You may leave now. I want someone else to serve me.” Bai Xiaofei immediately calmed down and leaned into the sofa. A chilly expression crept onto his face.</p>
 <p>“You’re unhappy? Hah, how interesting. This is the first time I’ve ever seen a customer as cheap as you,” the woman said, her voice raised.</p>
 <p>“Did you hear me or not? Okay, I will repeat myself.” Bai Xiaofei leisurely stood up. “Get the f*ck out and get someone else in here.”</p>
 <p>“Fine. I’ll get someone else for you!”</p>
 <p>The two remained in a standoff for quite a while. Then, the woman sent him a fierce glare and turned around to walk out the room. With a bang, she slammed the door shut behind her.</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Fei…” Fang Ye swallowed, hesitation creeping onto his face.</p>
 <p>“Have you forgotten our slogan? It may be a rather old-fashioned slogan, but I meant it.” Bai Xiaofei sat down and sneered before he continued, “Don’t worry. I’ll definitely take back with us some of this bullshit Crystal’s Longing fruit.”</p>
