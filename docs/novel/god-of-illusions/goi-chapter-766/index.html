 <p>Chapter 766: Rich is Me!</p> 
 <p>Enjoying Rui Mengqi’s massage, Bai Xiaofei adjusted his mentality little by little into that of a corrupt playboy.</p> 
 <p>Before long, there was a knock at the door. As Bai Xiaofei waved his hand, Rui Mengqi immediately understood.</p> 
 <p>“Come in,” she said.</p> 
 <p>The door was then gently opened, and a spirited, middle-aged man entered with a smiling face.</p> 
 <p>“This humble one is Qing Han, head of the branch. I’m the main person responsible for the auction. It’s my honor to serve you, Boss.” Qing Han cupped his hands in greeting.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei snorted.</p> 
 <p>“Our young master doesn’t like others to call him boss. Please call him Young Master Bai,” Rui Mengqi commented in perfect cooperation with Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Just like that, Qing Han immediately sketched out the image of an arrogant young master in his mind.</p> 
 <p>“My apologies, Young Master Bai. What can I do for you?” As expected of a major business’ branch manager, Qing Han showed none of his dissatisfaction and still wore a respectful smile.</p> 
 <p>“This is my first time here. I heard that your auctions are very interesting, so I want to give it a go, but I don’t want to sit with those commoners…” Bai Xiaofei stopped and looked at Qing Han.</p> 
 <p>Qing Han immediately understood the implication. He explained, “If Young Master Bai wants a VIP room, you first need to become our VIP. The only condition is related to your transaction volume. That is, it will do if you auction a certain amount of items of worth.”</p> 
 <p>“Mengqi,” Bai Xiaofei lightly uttered.</p> 
 <p>Rui Mengqi’s storage ring flashed, and a variety of porcelain bottles appeared on the table.</p> 
 <p>“There are all pills from grade seven and up. The highest quality is a bottle of peak grade-eight Explosive Pills,” Rui Mengqi introduced.</p> 
 <p>Looking at the table full of porcelain bottles, Qing Han gulped. <em>My goodness, does this guy’s family own a pharmacy?! Does he have something to do with Devpath?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Don’t overthink it. We have nothing to do with the Devpath Merchant Group. This is just our own personal goods,” Rui Mengqi added.</p> 
 <p>This was what Bai Xiaofei had told her to say, but Qing Han naturally didn’t know this. In his view, Rui Mengqi had guessed his thoughts and he couldn’t help but raise his impression of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p><em>For just a maid to be this level, just how strong is his background?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Well? Are these enough for me to be a so-called VIP?” Looking at the shocked manager, Bai Xiaofei sneered.</p> 
 <p>“Enough, absolutely enough!” Qing Han hurriedly took out a shiny black card and presented it to him. He explained, “This is our highest-level card. Please take it, Young Master Bai. You can choose any of our most luxurious private rooms for tomorrow’s auction, and besides that, you can get a 5% discount on any transaction, including auctions.”</p> 
 <p>Rui Mengqi stepped forward and took the card as she threw out another question, “Can the contents of tomorrow’s auction be revealed in advance? Our young master is very interested and we would like to know if there is something we want so that we can prepare the money.” Of course, this was also taught by Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Qing Han naturally would not refuse.</p> 
 <p>As a middleman, Unify Business strived to sell their auctioned goods at sky-high prices. The higher the price, the higher their commission.</p> 
 <p>“This is the list of items. Although there are no details on them, they are marked with the category and grade. I believe this will be enough for you, Young Master Bai.” Qing Han took out a piece of paper from his chest pocket as if he already knew it would be requested.</p> 
 <p>“Why are there no details?” Taking the list delivered by Rui Mengqi, Bai Xiaofei frowned.</p> 
 <p>“You are joking, Young Master Bai. The charm of the auction lies in the expectation of the unknown, doesn’t it? You will lose your interest in our auction if we give you the details in advance.” Qing Han donned an ingratiating smile. He dared not to upset his newfound god of wealth in the slightest, despite how much he disliked his bratty manner.</p> 
 <p>“Fine, consider yourself having passed,” Bai Xiaofei said and stood up.</p> 
 <p>Rui Mengqi quickly stepped behind him.</p> 
 <p>“Arrange a smart one for me tomorrow. She will need to have a good understanding of the auctioned items. I want a woman, not a man.”</p> 
 <p>After dropping his final demand, Bai Xiaofei left with Rui Mengqi.</p> 
 <p>After Bai Xiaofei left his sight, Qing Han snorted. “Another idiot. I hope you can leave Windlove alive after the auction.”</p> 
 <p>He had seen many such people in Windlove, but none of them ended up well. In this city, moneybags with an empty head and no brawn were looked down upon.</p> 
 <p>“Young Master, where are we going now?”</p> 
 <p>The sky was getting dark after Bai Xiaofei and Rui Mengqi left the building. According to the plan, everyone else should have gone to perform their own tasks. Therefore, there was no need to go back to the inn.</p> 
 <p>“We’re going to see a few big brasses.” After thinking for a moment, Bai Xiaofei smiled. What he had recalled were the several names that the waiter had told him about.</p> 
 <p><em>Lone rangers? I’m coming to you. Hope you won’t let me down!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei set out in his determined direction, and Rui Mengqi quickly followed. Although she did not know who those ‘big brass’ were, she firmly believed that there would be no problem as long as it was Bai Xiaofei who led the way.</p> 
 <p>Trust can be blind sometimes, especially women’s trust in the person they love…</p> 
 <p>The two went all the way to the office that released missions to all the mercenaries in Windlove. Unlike the mercenary alliances in other cities, the one in Windlove did not give people any reassuring feeling at all. Eyes from all around never stopped assessing, just wanting to see through them. If it weren’t for Bai Xiaofei’s confidence in Huskie’s disguise ability, he wouldn’t dare to walk into this place.</p> 
 <p>“I want to release a mission.” Going to the reception desk, Bai Xiaofei threw out an Amethyst Card.</p> 
 <p>After sweeping the card, the staff’s eyes shone. “Sir, there are a hundred thousand Amethyst Coins inside. You can issue an S-rank mission.”</p> 
 <p>As soon as the staff finished speaking, the people around all turned their heads almost in unison.</p> 
 <p><em>A hundred thousand Amethyst Coins?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>A fat sheep has arrived?!</em></p>
