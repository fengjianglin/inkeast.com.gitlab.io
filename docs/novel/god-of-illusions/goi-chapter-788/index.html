 <p>Chapter 788: Counter Whatever!</p> 
 <p><em>What’s that for?!</em></p> 
 <p>This was the first idea that came to the mind of everyone, but soon they realized a problem – they were paying attention to the wrong thing!</p> 
 <p>A sea of flames emerged from Bai Xiaofei as repayment, containing all of the energy that he had just absorbed. At the same time, Rui Mengqi’s Recording Eyeball also took effect, projecting the image of everyone present right next to them. Before they could figure out what it was, the flames already came crashing at them in the form of a gorgeous fire phoenix.</p> 
 <p>What ensued was a series of seemingly endless explosions.</p> 
 <p>After a long while, the smoke finally cleared and revealed a tattered group of puppet masters, either dead or injured. Those who could still stand had their quick reactions to thank for activating energy shields in time.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei’s attack scared everyone witless, and on top of that, new projected images were slowly forming…</p> 
 <p><em>Run! This guy is not fat meat, but a grim reaper!!</em></p> 
 <p>With just one attack, Bai Xiaofei scared off all of those who wanted to fish in troubled waters. After that, he stood still without any further action.</p> 
 <p>“I’ve cleared up all the small fries. Aren’t you showing yourselves, our dear mastermind?” Bai Xiaofei’s voice faintly echoed around the forest with the help of origin energy.</p> 
 <p>“Heaven!”</p> 
 <p>“Earth!”</p> 
 <p>“Profound!”</p> 
 <p>“Majesty!”</p> 
 <p>Four figures descended from the air at lightning speed and their four long swords were inserted deep into the ground at the end of the fall, forming a square formation that surrounded Bai Xiaofei and Rui Mengqi.</p> 
 <p>“Brat, you are strong but too arrogant! I shall let you know that there’s always a mountain higher…”</p> 
 <p>The leader of the four hadn’t finished his words when a gloomy light shot at him. His reaction was quick, a puppet appeared and blocked the light.</p> 
 <p>However, he underestimated the situation. After the light struck his defensive puppet, a ripple spread and a sense of dizziness overtook him. A little later, the ripple retracted into a small black hole and dragged the dizzied man in…</p> 
 <p>Then, in less than a second, he was shredded!</p> 
 <p>With that, the square formation was declared useless due to the fall of one corner. The remaining three people were only Grandmaster Rank. Looking at Bai Xiaofei, who was staring at them with an evil smile, they felt the blood in their body turn cold.</p> 
 <p>“Wild Legion!”</p> 
 <p>A loud shout echoed just as Bai Xiaofei was about to attack. The pitiful guy who had failed to shill bid Bai Xiaofei was not alone. With him was a group of moneybags who had their own powerful cards to play.</p> 
 <p>The Wild Legion was a group completely composed of Transformation Stream puppet masters, each having grasped at least the first step of Divine Beast Transformation. Although their transformation was not complete, the degree of non-human overall was enough to scare normal people.</p> 
 <p>Looking at the over twenty half-beast humans rushing at him, Bai Xiaofei shook his head. <em>How pitiful!</em></p> 
 <p>“One more shot!” he shouted.</p> 
 <p>With a sneer, Fang Ye, who had just fired the shot earlier, pointed the muzzle again while activating the Immovable bracelet, Spiritual Attachment, and Into Oblivion all at the same time for one fatal blow.</p> 
 <p>A familiar gloomy light streaked into the center of the Wild Legion and a familiar ripple spread. An instinctive fear rose in their hearts which urged them to flee the ripple’s area of effect. However, the mental attack from Spiritual Attachment made them miss that slim timeframe to escape.</p> 
 <p>A black hole at least ten times the size of the last one formed, and when it disappeared two seconds later, what was left on the ground was only a ball of ground meat…</p> 
 <p>“Someone on their side is using Into Oblivion. We won’t be able to pass through without handling that gun puppet master first.” Zhu Wuxin was the first to figure out the situation.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the group of moneybags who had been tricked by Bai Xiao quickly responded.</p> 
 <p>“Leave that to my people, they are best at dealing with such a tough nut.” One of the moneybags sneered.</p> 
 <p>Upon his declaration, the ten Assassin Stream puppet masters behind him melted into the shadows.</p> 
 <p>After two shots, Fang Ye knew that his position had been exposed, but he had no plan to change places. He could, but he didn’t need to at all.</p> 
 <p>“Should be soon,” he muttered, hugging Into Oblivion to his chest.</p> 
 <p>As if to prove him right, a chill ran down his back right after he finished speaking!</p> 
 <p>“Get out of here!” Fang Ye shouted. Before the assassin behind could deal a fatal blow to him, a fiery light streaked out!</p> 
 <p>Assassins prioritized killing their targets above self-protection. However, for a bodyguard who worked for a fixed wage, this belief had long been thrown out the window. Sensing danger, the assassin chose to escape.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, the fiery streak turned into a valiant Xu Chen in fiery red armor, exuding an overwhelming aura.</p> 
 <p>“How dare you touch my man! You’re tired of living!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing Xu Chen’s domineering declaration as she stood in front of him, Fang Ye just wanted to pounce and repay her with his body…</p> 
 <p><em>Ahem… Be serious, be serious…</em></p> 
 <p>“A mere Grandmaster Rank, where did you get the courage?!” Having dodged the crisis, the assassin snorted coldly. Then, he reached Xu Chen with a long step.</p> 
 <p>Just as Xu Chen reacted, two more assassins dashed toward her from the left and right. The reason why the first assassin was so confident lay in their numerical advantage!</p> 
 <p>“Tri-Form Stone: Melee!” Fang Ye coldly uttered.</p> 
 <p>In an instant, Into Oblivion transformed into dark armor that completely enveloped him. Fang Ye raised his hands, and a terrifying suction pulled at the two new assassins.</p> 
 <p>Xu Chen never took the two assassins into account at all. All of her focus was on assassin number one. An Onslaught Stream puppet master rushing full-force at an Assassin Stream of the same rank, it was needless to discuss the result…</p> 
 <p>Punching the assassin paralyzed with her Firegod’s Grasp, Xu Chen then pierced her sword through him.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the two other assassins died in the small black hole. However, before the couple could enjoy their victory, the remaining seven assassins approached, wanting to catch them off guard.</p> 
 <p>They really expected too much…</p> 
 <p>“Bullying with numbers? I like it!”</p> 
 <p>Shi Kui’s sinister laughter rang out as the hammer in his hand grew bigger before smashing an assassin into mincemeat. At the same time, Xing Nan, Zhu Sisi, Ming One and Ming Two, Chen Hui, and Lin Li appeared around, and the seven assassins died under their bombardment without even catching a glimpse of their killers…</p> 
 <p>After all, Fang Ye the sniper was the VIP, having only one ‘bodyguard’ was definitely not enough!</p> 
 <p>With the assassins handled, the group scattered as not many people would dare to approach Bai Xiaofei due to Fang Ye’s presence alone, while the real battle had not yet started!</p>
