<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had been expecting that the audience would be passionate, but their passion had surpassed even his expectations. They were so passionate that he was forced to use Blackie’s ability to help him and his classmates escape the public square. The excitement of the audience was understandable. The Starnet Brilliance was too attractive. Now, it would be hard for him to not become famous even if he wanted to stay low profile.</p>
 <p>The seventeen Savage Class members ran madly and were finally able to escape the group of fans behind them. They rushed into the Thousand Aroma Restaurant that was still under renovation, and Bai Xiaofei quickly told the waitresses to shut the restaurant’s entrance.</p>
 <p>After Bai Xiaofei’s previous visit, his identity was now known by the employees within the Thousand Aroma Restaurant. Therefore, his words now carried as much weight as Lu Lingyun’s here. Once again, they were brought to the luxurious VIP room. While Mo Ka and the others were busy being dazzled by the room’s luxuriousness, Bai Xiaofei called Rui Mengqi over.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei did not really want to call Rui Mengqi over, but unfortunately, Rui Mengqi was the only employee of the restaurant who he knew. But to be precise, she was a manager here.</p>
 <p>“Boss, it has been a while since your last visit. Do you know how much I have missed you?” Rui Mengqi said, her voice filled with joy. She spoke earnestly and honestly, her emotions at full display. But what she said made Bai Xiaofei feel like hanging himself to death.</p>
 <p><em>Ma’am! I know you are behaving like that because you are naïve and innocent, but the others are not aware of that! Are you trying to kill me?</em></p>
 <p>A bitter expression covered Bai Xiaofei’s face. He did not dare to turn around, but he could feel the deathly glare of Xue Ying and the resentful gaze of Lin Li on his back.</p>
 <p>“Cough. Cough. Don’t worry. I will pay the salary I owe you on time.”</p>
 <p>“But you don’t owe me anything!”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei wanted to create an excuse, but Rui Mengqi immediately shattered his excuse.</p>
 <p>“Oh…What I meant was I have already decided on your request for a pay rise.”</p>
 <p>“When have I ever requested that?” Again, Rui Mengqi destroyed his excuse.</p>
 <p><em>Are you stupid? Are you dumb? Don’t you want free money?</em></p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei inwardly cursed non-stop, and with great difficulty, he wiped the awkward expression from his face.</p>
 <p>“You don’t even remember what you said? Fine, no pay raise for you. Go get someone to serve us some dishes. If you don’t serve us good enough, I will fire you!” Bai Xiaofei’s voice became frosty as he tried to scare Rui Mengqi with threats. Unfortunately, he had instead invited an even greater disaster upon himself.</p>
 <p>“When you bought my freedom, you promised that you will be responsible for me in the future. If you really fire me, where can I go? I know nothing. I will definitely starve to death…,” Rui Mengqi said, her voice filled with the tone of a person who had been greatly wronged. As she sobbed, tears dripped down her eyes. Bai Xiaofei felt like dying.</p>
 <p><em>Ma’am! Can you stop saying those easily misunderstood words? You will get me killed!</em></p>
 <p>“No, no, no! Don’t cry! I’m kidding! I will never break my promise. Just stay here. Nobody will fire you!” Bai Xiaofei immediately surrendered. As for Rui Mengqi, her tears immediately dried up. In fact, her control over her tears was even better than top-notch actresses. If one did not know who she was, one would probably think she was a top-tier succubus.</p>
 <p>“I knew it! Boss is the best!” Rui Mengqi said as she leaped forward, trying to hug Bai Xiaofei’s arm. This scared Bai Xiaofei so much he quickly stepped backward. If he allowed her to hug his arm, there would be grave consequences.</p>
 <p>“We haven’t eaten anything today. Shouldn’t you go to the kitchen and get some food for us?” Bai Xiaofei suggested, completely giving up on giving Rui Mengqi hints. Giving her hints was no different than an act of suicide.</p>
 <p>“Ok, I’ll go now!” Rui Mengqi replied and bounced away vivaciously. Bai Xiaofei heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p><em>Finally, she is gone!</em></p>
 <p>“Tsk, tsk. You’re great, aren’t you? So when have you gotten such an adorable girl for yourself behind our backs?” Xue Ying’s frosty voice sounded.</p>
 <p><em>It’s over…</em></p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei gulped and immediately adjusted his facial expression. Although he was about to speak the truth, for some reason, he had no confidence that his words would be trusted.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Xue, it’s not how it looks. She is someone we found when we went to the Babel Merchant House. Since the Thousand Aroma Restaurant is my partner, I need to have my own people working in the restaurant, right? I swear our relationship is pure, and it is definitely not what you think!” Bai Xiaofei swore solemnly, but the response he received were gazes of disbelief.</p>
 <p>“Oh, I see. I was wondering who in the Starnet Academy would need her freedom bought. So it’s someone from the Babel Merchant House?” Xue Ying sneered. She had heard of the Babel Merchant House before. The “special services” they provided was one of the reasons for their good business.</p>
 <p>“No, it’s really not what you think it is. She was only a normal waitress there!” Bai Xiaofei insisted. However, everyone still looked at him with the same expression of disbelief. He felt like even if he had more mouths, he still wouldn’t be able to explain himself.</p>
 <p>“Oh? So you mean to say that you are also aware of the <em>unordinary</em> waitresses there?” Xue Ying asked, immediately stunning Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p><em>Holy shit, I got trapped!</em></p>
 <p>“No, no, no! We rejected the offer! Ask Fang Ye if you don’t believe me. He can prove my innocence!” Bai Xiaofei had no choice but to use Fang Ye as his shield.</p>
 <p>“Oh? You’re part of it as well? I have been wondering why you were away for so long that day,” Xu Chen said in astonishment and pinched Fang Ye’s ear as she spoke, her voice filled with resentment.</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Fei is telling the truth! We hadn’t done anything! We only stayed for a long time because we were bringing some stuff back for you guys!”</p>
 <p>A spectator would always see more of the game. Having been a spectator for a while, Fang Ye had already thought of a way out. Crystal's Longing! After they took the Crystal’s Longings from the Babel Merchant House, Bai Xiaofei had been too busy to share it with everyone. Unexpectedly, this fruit would now save their lives!</p>
 <p>“Yes! I have been so nervous I forgot about it!” Bai Xiaofei quickly ran to the table, and with a flash of his storage ring, forty-seven Crystal’s Longings piled up on the table. Everyone looked at the Crystal’s Longings curiously.</p>
 <p>“Trust me. After trying one, you will understand why we spent so long at the Babel Merchant House for the sake of these fruits,” Bai Xiaofei explained with a resolute and sincere expression.</p>
 <p>“I don’t think Big Brother Fei is that kind of person. I’ll try one,” Mo Ka said, extending a much needed help to them. He picked up one Crystal’s Longing and bit into it. His eyes widened as he stood there blankly. By reflex, he started chewing before swallowing, and an expression of intense satisfaction surfaced on his face.</p>
 <p>“Holy shit! How can this be so delicious?”</p>
