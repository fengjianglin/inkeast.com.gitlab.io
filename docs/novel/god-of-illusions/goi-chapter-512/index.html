 <p>Chapter 512: The Son has to Pay the Father’s Debt?!</p> 
 <p>“Did he ever mention me to you?” Luo Xi’s voice suddenly became gentle, as if the softest part of her heart was revealed.</p> 
 <p>Everyone thought Luo Xi still resented Bai Longfei, but they overlooked one thing. Where did this resentment come from? In fact, the more she resented him, the deeper her love was, and this love that couldn’t be expressed had become mellow wine after a long time of fermentation. Opening it, people would only care about its wonderful aroma, not the process of brewing it…</p> 
 <p>“I have never seen my dad…” said Bai Xiaofei with a trace of sadness. This was his regret for more than 20 years. He had never seen his biological parents, and the only thing he had was some rumors about his father. As for who his mother was, Bai Xiaofei had never heard a word from anyone…</p> 
 <p>“This cruel man. Even if he abandoned me, how could he forsake his own son?!” Luo Xi bitterly complained, but this complaint wasn’t pure.</p> 
 <p>“Aunt Luo, you misunderstood. I haven’t seen my dad not because he abandoned me, but because he died when I was a baby…”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished, Luo Xi froze and then disbelief filled her face.</p> 
 <p>“What did you say?!” She grew emotional as she stared intently at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Aunt Luo, please calm down.” Bai Xiaofei could understand Luo Xi’s reaction. The news that a person she had waited for decades was dead was like a bolt from the blue.</p> 
 <p>It took a long time before Luo Xi finally accepted that fact. The expression on her face changed again and again until it settled on sorrow.</p> 
 <p>“Did he… leave anything behind?” There was a hint of expectation in her tone. Luo Xi just wanted to hear that Bai Longfei had left words of apology or regret or something related to her.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei really couldn’t lie to a senior who had been waiting for decades on such an issue, even if lying might make her feel better…</p> 
 <p>“My dad was seriously injured at that time. After making arrangements for me, he died before he could say anything else. I don’t even know my mother’s name…” Bai Xiaofei tactfully explained, hoping that the truth wouldn’t hurt too badly. When it came to this matter, his tone was exceptionally solemn. Having one’s parents dying during childhood was not an easy topic.</p> 
 <p>“Seriously injured?! Who did it?! How could anyone hurt him?!!” Three questions were blurted out in succession with surprise and anger. Luo Xi, who had barely calmed down, grew emotional again.</p> 
 <p>It was her limit to accept Bai Longfei’s death. She must find out the details of why he had been fatally injured. She was allowed to unleash her revenge on Bai Longfei, but she would not let anyone else hurt him! Even if it had already happened, she vowed to pursue it to the end!</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know. It’s also why I came out. I want to find that heinous scum who ruined my family!” Bai Xiaofei’s voice was soaked with hatred and his expression distorted. The animosity over the murder of one’s father was never-ending!</p> 
 <p>Getting another disappointing answer, Luo Xi fell into a long silence. In the end, she feebly backed up a few steps and collapsed as if her soul had been drained out of her body…</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei quickly caught her and helped her sit down.</p> 
 <p>After taking a deep breath to calm her emotions a little, Luo Xi asked softly, “Do you know why I brought you here?” Her eyes sparkled with memories.</p> 
 <p>“Aunt Luo, I have no idea. Does it have something to do with my father?” Bai Xiaofei asked.</p> 
 <p>However, Luo Xi did not give a direct answer and began to tell a story instead.</p> 
 <p>“This is the place where he confessed to me. At that time, I was number one on the Blossom Ranking. Your father used a sloppy excuse to invite me here, and then confessed to me hastily…”</p> 
 <p>Lost in memories, Luo Xi’s lips curved up into a sweet smile as if the scene she was describing had happened just yesterday.</p> 
 <p>“So I made a bet with him that as long as he could get first place in the competition between faculties, I would give him a chance. Later, this became a place that witnessed us becoming an item… That was the happiest time in my life. Longfei always found ways to make me happy and I often danced for him here…”</p> 
 <p>“Unfortunately, those good times didn’t last long. When we entered our fourth year, differences arose between us. I wanted to remain in Starnet and have a stable life, but he wanted to travel the world and enjoy the scenery of this continent.”</p> 
 <p>“In the end, he left, and I stayed. A cold war became a real separation. I don’t remember how I lived through that time, but since then, looking forward to his news every day had become a habit that I spent the most time on.”</p> 
 <p>“I have always naively thought that he’d come back as long as he has experienced enough of the outside world, so I have been waiting and never gone out to find him. But who could have thought that fate played such a joke? The wait lasted for several decades.”</p> 
 <p>Luo Xi laughed bitterly.</p> 
 <p>“Moreover, it ended not with his return, but the news of his death…”</p> 
 <p>Grief overtook her as she looked at Bai Xiaofei seriously with tears in her eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Say, am I very ridiculous, very pitiful?”</p> 
 <p>In the face of her sudden question, Bai Xiaofei was stunned before he fell into contemplation.</p> 
 <p>He didn’t have a rich romantic experience. At this point, his love life had been quite smooth and all the people he had met were bent on being nice to him. Therefore, he could only give an answer from objective analysis.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t have much experience, but I don’t think you are ridiculous or pitiful at all. From my personal point of view, I admire you very much!” This reply came from the bottom of his heart without any falsehood. As far as the stories he had heard were concerned, there weren’t many people willing to stick to their hearts like Luo Xi.</p> 
 <p>“You mean it?” asked Luo Xi as Bai Xiaofei’s words surprised her.</p> 
 <p>“Absolutely, and I think it’s my dad who owes you,” Bai Xiaofei confirmed and followed with something that touched the softest spot in her heart.</p> 
 <p>After waiting for so many years, wasn’t this what she waited for? Although it didn’t come from Bai Longfei, it seemed to Luo Xi that Bai Xiaofei represented his father when saying this.</p> 
 <p>“In this case, are you willing to repay this debt in his stead?”</p> 
 <p>Upon Luo Xi’s words, Bai Xiaofei was dumbstruck.</p> 
 <p><em>What kind of turn is this?!! You can actually make the son pay for his father’s debt for this kind of affair?!!</em></p>
