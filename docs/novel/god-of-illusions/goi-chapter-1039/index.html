 <p>Chapter 1039: Leader in Action!</p> 
 <p>“Handle the remaining people and get ready for Nine Dragons City!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei and Fang Ye watched Illusion Sword successively take over five cities in just less than ten hours, demonstrating absolute efficiency. Moreover, most of this time had been spent on the road and not the takeovers.</p> 
 <p>However, the Illusion Sword members didn’t show much joy about it. On the contrary, the ten leaders all flew toward the final target city with solemn expressions.</p> 
 <p>The reason why Nine Dragons City was placed last was not only because it was the farthest, but also, more importantly, it couldn’t be won with just one or two teams. The city lord of Nine Dragons City was a nine-aperture Exquisite Rank puppet master!</p> 
 <p>Although a nine-aperture Exquisite Rank meant one was doomed to never advance further in their life, they were still the peak under Legend Rank. Gaining strength by sacrificing one’s potential was not as pathetic as everyone would imagine.</p> 
 <p>Moreover, at the end of the day, Illusion Sword was but a group of Grandmaster Ranks.</p> 
 <p>“What do you think?” During the break, Bai Xiaofei looked at Fang Ye with great interest.</p> 
 <p>“It will be a war of attrition. Whoever fails to hold out will die,” said Fang Ye with a serious expression. He had heard about Nine Dragons City, a city built on a huge mineral vein whose city lord occupied the best cultivation resources in the area. He not only had a large number of experts working for him but also was unfathomably strong himself.</p> 
 <p>This would undoubtedly be a tough battle for Illusion Sword.</p> 
 <p>“You’ve seen everything you wanted to see. There’s no need for them to take this risk. I think you already know that the best outcome is mutual destruction. You don’t want them to lose their fighting capacity right now, do you?” said Fang Ye after a short silence.</p> 
 <p>“And here I was wondering how long you could hold it in. So, what are you going to do now?” Bai Xiaofei chortled.</p> 
 <p>“So you set me up, huh?!” Fang Ye’s expression instantly sank upon knowing he had unknowingly fallen into Bai Xiaofei’s ‘trap.’</p> 
 <p>“You are the leader of Illusion Sword, it’s incomplete without you. If you help them, it’s not a violation of my agreement with them,” said Bai Xiaofei. “Of course, if you feel that you can’t win either, I will personally act. From the information we have on this city lord, there’s nothing he can do to me in a fight.”</p> 
 <p>At Bai Xiaofei’s teasing, Fang Ye let out a long sigh. <em>‘Personally act?’ You obviously just wanted to watch a show!</em></p> 
 <p>“Forget it, I haven’t had a good exercise in a long time. He’ll be my warm-up.” Fang Ye accepted his fate and started mobilizing his origin energy.</p> 
 <p>“They will have started fighting by the time you arrive. Let me give you a hand as a friend,” Bai Xiaofei said and placed his hand on Fang Ye’s shoulder. Through Huskie’s Mark and with Purple Luan’s Teleportation, Fang Ye appeared next to a team captain in the blink of an eye.</p> 
 <p>“Head?! Why are you here?!” The team captain looked at Fang Ye in shock.</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye shot him a glare. “Or else I should just watch you guys seek death? Inform the others that I will take command from here on.”</p> 
 <p>The team captain smiled from ear to ear. “Gotcha, Head!”</p> 
 <p>As the rest of the team captains were informed through their Concentric Knots, they all smiled in joy. As far as they were concerned, they would be safe in Fang Ye’s hands.</p> 
 <p>If what they felt toward Bai Xiaofei was fanaticism, then for Fang Ye, it was unconditional trust. It was Fang Ye who had changed their lives!</p> 
 <p>Before long, Fang Ye and all of Illusion Sword approached Nine Dragons City. Ten teams scattered to the positions that he designated.</p> 
 <p>“The defensive formation protecting Nine Dragons is a high-ranked one. There can be no mistakes if we want to break it. Find the core and report to me once you do.”</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye’s order was sent out through the team captain that went with him.</p> 
 <p>“Do not let your guard down even for just a moment. Each group will be responsible for a separate part of the city, so do not be reckless either. Now, there are eight hours left until the deadline, and we’re going to use every minute of that!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing Fang Ye’s final’s demand, everyone grew serious. In their training, this kind of cyclic offensive operation would only be used under one condition – the opponent was extremely difficult to deal with!</p> 
 <p>The point of this method was to obtain a steady victory, and therefore they needed to be able to flexibly advance and retreat according to the situation!</p> 
 <p>“Start!” shouted Fang Ye.</p> 
 <p>The next second, nine beams of light shot out at the same time and hit their targets with precision, destroying the defensive formation of Nine Dragons City in one go!</p> 
 <p>The Tenth Team charged toward the front of the city. Upon approaching, they were immediately covered by three other teams from a distance. After the soldiers above were shot down, the Tenth Team quickly occupied the wall. That was when the remaining nine squads came and climbed the wall before starting a crushing shooting match with the arriving garrison.</p> 
 <p>The thick walls of Nine Dragons City not only failed to give the defenders any advantages but also became the main reason for their downfall when it was used by Illusion Sword. When the garrison realized that they were in a bad situation, they stopped charging.</p> 
 <p>In response, three Illusion Sword teams got down from the wall and penetrated into the city until they found another high place.</p> 
 <p>“Seventh Team, fly up to provide a lookout. Second and Third, stay behind to cover Seventh. The rest of you, handle all the enemies in the vicinity spotted by Seventh!”</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye issued a series of commands, turning Illusion Sword into a high-speed machine that efficiently eliminated all the forces in Nine Dragons City.</p> 
 <p>In just ten minutes, half of the eastern part of the city became completely silent!</p> 
 <p>However, this didn’t give Fang Ye the thought that Nine Dragons City was vulnerable. This was only the appetizer before the main course!</p> 
 <p>“Garrison, split into three and leave from the north and south sides to encircle the east of the city. Nine Dragons Army, go and capture those invaders in the sky and in the city!”</p> 
 <p>Finally, the city lord of Nine Dragons acted…</p>
