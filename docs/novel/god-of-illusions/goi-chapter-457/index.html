 <p>Chapter 457: I’ll Just Change, Alright?!</p> 
 <p>“Third Brother, give me one of those trump cards of yours.” After a long silence, Nie Qing took a deep breath and looked at He Rushi.</p> 
 <p>Once again, He Rushi hesitated.</p> 
 <p>“Give it to her.” After spitting out those words with a trembling voice, Fang Lei left.</p> 
 <p>The rest clenched their jaws and followed one by one after casting one last look at Nie Qing. Qing Shuang and Xia He had already burst into tears, but they didn’t say anything more. Nie Qing had already made up her mind. Any more words would only add to the pain at this moment.</p> 
 <p>The last to leave was He Rushi after handing a pill to Nie Qing with trembling hands. Some words rushed to his mouth, but he chose to swallow them back and left after while his head helplessly.</p> 
 <p>In such a large room, only Bai Xiaofei and Nie Qing remained. One was seriously injured while the other held a pill in her hand and looked at him lovingly.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, you will be fine,” whispered Nie Qing. Slowly, an illusory figure appeared behind her. The figure had a sacred aura and slightly resembled Nie Qing, as it half-closed its eyes.</p> 
 <p>And Nie Qing, the one releasing this illusion, was aging at the speed visible to the naked eye as her smooth skin started to wrinkle.</p> 
 <p>However, this process did not go on for too long but began to reverse as Nie Qing ate the pill. In the blink of an eye, she resumed her initial appearance.</p> 
 <p>Final Radiance Pill, the effect of which was to restore the physical state of a person to its peak in an instant. However, it only lasted for seven days before the user welcomed a sure death!</p> 
 <p>For normal people, this was definitely the most poisonous thing in the world, but for Nie Qing at this moment, it was simply a great pill to prolong life, because she wouldn’t be able to live past a day after summoning the illusion…</p> 
 <p>However, the ability of this illusion was heaven-defying.</p> 
 <p>Nie Qing had secretly linked with this puppet to save Qing Shuang. Unfortunately, Qing Shuang’s wound was spiritual, while this illusion could only treat physical injuries. Nie Qing originally thought that she wouldn’t have an opportunity to use this puppet, but now she didn’t expect it to come so quickly.</p> 
 <p>Inhaling a deep breath, Nie Qing gently waved her hand. The illusion bearing 99% of her vitality slowly spread its arms and embraced Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>After the illusion completely melded into Bai Xiaofei’s body, the decline of his body immediately stopped. With the simultaneous effects of her life force and the energy from the Nirvana Pearl in Bai Xiaofei’s body, his injury was almost instantly erased and his weak, ragged breathing became strong and steady.</p> 
 <p>Looking at his complexion getting better and better, Nie Qing smiled in satisfaction.</p> 
 <p>“Lazy, it is time to wake up!” After waiting for half a day without seeing him wake up, Nie Qing had an angry expression on her face. For her, every second was now especially precious. She didn’t want to just watch Bai Xiaofei sleep.</p> 
 <p>And her call was successful. Bai Xiaofei suddenly jolted awake, and his first reaction upon opening his eyes was to look all around for Tang Bing. However, the familiar and unfamiliar scene that he saw had him stunned on the bed.</p> 
 <p>“Scared me to death!” Startled at the way he suddenly sprang up, Nie Qing slapped his head and pulled him back from a myriad of silent questions of “Who am I? Where am I?”</p> 
 <p>“Qing’er?” exclaimed Bai Xiaofei then pinched his own face.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t pinch. You’re not dead, and you’re not dreaming. I saved you, so, are you gonna worship me now?” Nie Qing giggled playfully.</p> 
 <p>“I’m fine?!” asked Bai Xiaofei in disbelief. At the last second of his consciousness, he clearly remembered himself about to blow up.</p> 
 <p>“So? You remember what happened to you?” Rolling her eyes, Nie Qing looked at Bai Xiaofei like he was a fool.</p> 
 <p>“What about the others? How is Senior Chu Yue?” After making sure he was all right, Bai Xiaofei began to worry about others.</p> 
 <p>“We couldn’t stop Tang Bing from exploding…” Qing Shuang said slowly, her expression complicated. Although it was completely normal that Bai Xiaofei first worried about the others, Nie Qing wanted him to concentrate on her only.</p> 
 <p>This wasn’t selfishness, but her last wish…</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei seemed to notice Nie Qing’s thoughts. He temporarily set aside all other things and asked with a tender look on his face.</p> 
 <p>“How did you save me?” When the topic was changed back, Nie Qing’s face lit up in an instant. She didn’t think he would be so well-behaved!</p> 
 <p>“I’ll keep this a secret. But shouldn’t you be thanking me sincerely now that I’ve pulled you back from the gates of death?” said Nie Qing proudly.</p> 
 <p>If she could, she didn’t want Bai Xiaofei to notice anything off about her. She just wanted him to accompany her like normal, not with the attitude to repay or pity her…</p> 
 <p>“Okay, okay, okay. Thank you. Is there anything that you want?” It was impossible for Bai Xiaofei to defy Nie Qing at a time like this, even though he didn’t know what she had done.</p> 
 <p>“I want you to accompany me for six days! You are not allowed to think about anything else in these six days, you are not allowed to see anyone else! You are only allowed to keep me company!” Nie Qing seemed to have nursed this thought for a long time and put forward her ‘conditions’ the instant he asked.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei grew a little reluctant.</p> 
 <p>“But…”</p> 
 <p>“No buts! If you don’t promise me right now, do you believe I’ll make you lie back down?!” threatened Nie Qing as she stared intently at him. Although she looked domineering, she was feeling guilty inside. She wouldn’t know what to do if he really refused. To be able to say this was already her limit.</p> 
 <p>“Okay, okay, you have the final say. However, didn’t you say before that distance makes everything seem more beautiful? Also something about good wine only ages finely after being brewed for a long time, and…”</p> 
 <p>“Enough!” a livid-looking Nie Qing cut him off. He kept talking like that, and she had blown up. “Haven’t you heard that women are fickle? What I said before is what I thought before. Now I just want to occupy you for six days! Can’t I?!” Nie Qing stood up and put her hands on her hips. Her pose made Bai Xiaofei smile.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, yes, anything you say. But can I at least inform everyone? Or else they’ll crowd the door, or maybe they are already…” Helpless, Bai Xiaofei smiled wryly.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, this lord grants you permission! You have five minutes!”</p>
