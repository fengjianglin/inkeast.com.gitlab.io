 <p><span style>Mo Ka and the others who realized what Bai Xiaofei intended to do surrounded the senior right away, and the entire 10 plus of them tightly encircled the last remaining arrogant senior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, I’ll trouble you to wait for a moment, and I’ll come entertain you shortly.” Bai Xiaofei grinned as he spoke words that caused the arrogant senior’s heart to go cold, but besides listening to what Bai Xiaofei said, the senior didn’t have another choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Sister Lingyan, I didn’t let you down, right?” Bai Xiaofei returned to the crowd and started thanking them one by one. There was no lack of favors that he’d owed today but forming relationships with these people wasn’t a bad thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I almost thought you’d forgotten about me. Just don’t forget our agreement, and I’ll come look for you soon.” For some unknown reason, Qin Lingyan’s mood was exceptionally good. She glanced coldly at Bai Xiaofei before leaving along with the people she brought over, and she didn’t even give him the chance to speak a word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Brother, don’t forget about the Blossom Rankings. I’m looking forward to news from you.” Yun Jingshuang took the initiative to come over. Unfortunately, Bai Xiaofei was still unable to adapt to his pink colored clothes….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course! Of course! Our cooperation has only just begun. Thank you, Senior, for coming over to help today, and I’ll sure pay you a visit to thank you in the future!” Bai Xiaofei was utterly unlike himself when he became courteous, but it did carry a comfortable feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll remember what you said, and I’ll be waiting for you at Blossom Pavilion. You probably still have things to do now, right? So, I won’t disturb you for now. But, don’t blame me for resenting you if you don’t come to the Blossom Pavilion!” Yun Jingshuang sent Bai Xiaofei a flirtatious gaze as he spoke, and it shocked Bai Xiaofei to the point goosebumps rose all over his body….</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, no matter what, Bai Xiaofei still had to go to the Blossom Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because, Huskie was still over there!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Huskie knew what Bai Xiaofei was thinking at this moment, then he would surely be grateful to the point of weeping. After all, as far as Huskie was concerned, Bai Xiaofei had already forgotten him….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Fei, these are the seniors that are about to cooperate with us. Let me introduce them to you.” After Yun Jingshuang left, Feng Ye led the four third year seniors over, and needless to say, these were the store owners that Fang Ye had found.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the owner of Far and Wide Medicine Store, Xie Guangyun, Senior Xie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Guangyun was a rather gentlemanly and handsome fellow, and the symbol of the Furnace of Agarwood on his chest displayed that he himself was an alchemist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello Senior Xie, thank you very much. It’s thanks for your willingness to cooperate with us and your support today.” Bai Xiaofei stretched out his hand and Xie Guangyun shook it at the first possible moment, and he didn’t show the slightest disrespect because Bai Xiaofei was a new student.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Junior, you’re too kind. Whether my business will become slightly better in the future depends entirely upon you!” Almost everyone that was capable of becoming the boss of a store was astute, and even Bai Xiaofei was inferior to them in terms of social ability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next three seniors were basically the same. They exchanged pleasantries with Bai Xiaofei, and Bai Xiaofei almost spoke the same words four times during these introductions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, not a single one of the four of them felt that it was tiring, and it was Bai Xiaofei instead who was slightly unable to endure this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The remaining three people were Chu Dangyang who owned a food store, Jin Erpang who owned an accessory store, and Lin Lang who owned a medicinal material store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After some small talk, the four of them directly handed over the finances that they’d discussed and agreed upon with Fang Ye to Bai Xiaofei, so Bai Xiaofei directly transformed from a poor man into a minor rich man….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, there was a portion of this that had to be handed to Yun Jingshuang as operational funds. But, Bai Xiaofei didn’t have the intention to send it over right away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, the most important thing was to purchase second puppets from everyone in the Savage Class!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he sent the four store owners away, all the people that remained here were new students, and during the next few years, all of them would be an extremely large assistance to Bai Xiaofei. But, they required time and confidence to grow!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone, shouldn’t all of you cheer for a bit now?” The first words Bai Xiaofei spoke caused the slightly solemn atmosphere in the surroundings to ease up, and someone within the crowd cried out with agreement, causing the entire crowd to be stirred and instantly start seething with excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t speak any words of congratulations. I hope that our New Student Mutual Aid Community will grow better and better from today onward. Everyone, please feel free to ask help from me, Bai Xiaofei, if you need it, and so long as you pay sufficient fees, then I’ll accept any job!” After speaking seriously for some time, Bai Xiaofei cracked a joke at the end and caused everyone to explode with laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Finally, I hope everyone will be able to attain good results in the New Student Competition held two months from now, and then we’ll see each other as first years in the academy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cheers resounded out once more. After the various events that had occurred earlier, Bai Xiaofei’s popularity had already risen to a terrifying degree, and in the eyes of many new students, Bai Xiaofei had even become an existence that was like an idol or role model.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd gradually dispersed. After Bai Xiaofei bid farewell to everyone that came to strike up a conversation with him, it was already past midnight. But, the rare thing was that everyone from the Savage Class tired, and even Bai Xiaofei was no exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Fei, how do we deal with this fellow?” As Mo Ka spoke, he glanced coldly at the arrogant senior that was pressed down onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he struck at Bai Xiaofei with a killing blow, it was impossible for this fellow to calm the rage of the Savage Class even if he offered up his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Err, the following scenes might be slightly unsuitable. Female students, shouldn’t all of you consider looking away for a moment?” As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking, the female disciples of the Savage Class carried vicious smiles as they bid their farewells and left. But, there were two people who had no intention to leave at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Li and Hu Xian’er!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If he makes a move after I leave, then who amongst you will be able to stop him?” Hu Xian’er’s excuse was fairly sufficient. Of course, even if it wasn’t sufficient, Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t dare ask her to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Based on the strength Hu Xian’er revealed earlier, even Lin Li might not be a match for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her speed was too swift!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They have me here!” No one had expected that the usually sedate Lin Li would actually speak after her. Moreover, her gaze that was filled with battle intent caused her to seem like a completely different person when compared to before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But you seemed to have been half a second slower earlier.” Hu Xian’er greeted Lin Li’s gaze directly without showing any weakness, and her words carried sharp spikes within them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Lin Li was still Lin Li in the end. Hu Xian’er caused her face to flush red and be at a loss for what to say with a single sentence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Err…. Mmm…. Actually, it doesn’t affect anything if both of you are present, so why don’t I deal with him first?” Bai Xiaofei probed the two of them, and the reply he got was the icy cold gazes the two of them shot at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was utterly no need for any mind reading technique because any ordinary person would be able to understand their gazes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To conclude it in a simple manner, their gazes meant three words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who is she!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Err…. Let me introduce the two of you. Hu Xian’er, a good friend I’ve met a few times.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Li, my classmate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei spoke carefully and tried his best to place his valuation of them on par with each other. But, even if he tried his best, he was only able to describe Hu Xian’er as a good friend….</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, Hu Xian’er was displeased.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What have you done to me?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m just your good friend?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Hu Xian’er started regretting she didn’t smash Bai Xiaofei to death on that day, otherwise, she wouldn’t have to suffer such grief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll give you one more chance! What am I to you?” Hu Xian’er asked a question that caused Bai Xiaofei to have the impulse to smash his head on the wall and die.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>You’re my mother, alright!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What else could you be to me!!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If you’re unsatisfied then give me a slight hint!!!</span></i></p>
