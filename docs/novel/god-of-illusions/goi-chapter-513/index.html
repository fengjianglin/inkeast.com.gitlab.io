 <p>Chapter 513: Luo Xi’s Request!</p> 
 <p>“Aunt Luo, I… don’t quite understand what you mean…” Bai Xiaofei nervously gulped. It wasn’t that he didn’t understand, but that he didn’t dare to understand. He couldn’t imagine what Luo Xi would make him do!</p> 
 <p>“It’s very simple. As long as you promise me something, I will write off all of your debts. How about that? Didn’t you yourself say that your father owes me? It’s not too much to exchange my several decades for a promise from his son, right?“</p> 
 <p>Luo Xi left no room for Bai Xiaofei to refuse. Looking at her wondering eyes, he even suspected that he would be cut on the spot if he refused!</p> 
 <p>“About that… Aunt Luo, can you tell me what it is that you want me to do first?” Repeatedly gulping, Bai Xiaofei’s tone grew weaker and weaker.</p> 
 <p>“It’s not a bad thing for you. In short, just say yes first!” said Luo Xi with a slight, elusive smile. She looked like a completely different person from the woman missing her sweetheart just now.</p> 
 <p>Seeing Luo Xi like this, Bai Xiaofei inwardly panicked, but he was unable to think of any reason to shirk…</p> 
 <p><em>Fine, if I die, then I die! Dad, you owe me one!</em></p> 
 <p>“Aunt Luo, just tell me. I’ll do my best if it’s something within my capability!” Having accepted his fate, Bai Xiaofei no longer beat around the bush and agreed firmly.</p> 
 <p>“You know Luo Han.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei’s heart tightened! A bad feeling welling up as his mind began to process at its fastest. He had to find a proper reason to refuse before Luo Xi uttered that sentence. He was truly tired of dealing with this matter!</p> 
 <p>“Of course I know her, but I never thought there’d be such a relationship between us before. If I’m not wrong, she should be considered my little sister?”</p> 
 <p><em>Yes, little sister! This kind of relationship should be able to block every chance possible between us!</em> That was what Bai Xiaofei thought, but the older the ginger, the spicier it was<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>. He was still too green compared to Luo Xi.</p> 
 <p>“No, Luo Han is just my adopted daughter, so she is not your sister.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s heart sank again.</p> 
 <p>He was as good as finished. His refute was refuted…</p> 
 <p>“But I’m too old, and I don’t want Luo Han to end up staying in Starnet, alone for the rest of her life like me, so I want you to take her with you when you leave and take care of her in my stead. This is not difficult, right?”</p> 
 <p>Luo Xi was being tactful with her words, but this request turned out to be exactly like what Bai Xiaofei had feared, which was the most difficult thing for him!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei already had a hard time with his large group of girls. He didn’t even dare to think about everyone’s path after graduation yet. Yet, Luo Xi wanted to add Luo Han, which was tantamount to adding insult to injury…</p> 
 <p>“Aunt Luo, by ‘take care of her’, you mean…” Bai Xiaofei had to ask the question that he didn’t want to ask. This was his last hope to make Luo Xi loosen the condition and give him space to breathe.</p> 
 <p>“I’m entrusting her to you and letting you take care of her for a lifetime!”</p> 
 <p>She was simply straightforward.</p> 
 <p><em>If being tactful means you’ll play dumb, then I’ll just be direct!</em></p> 
 <p>In the face of this sudden frankness, Bai Xiaofei was stunned silly before fear soon followed…</p> 
 <p>After half a day, he finally returned to his senses and gulped.</p> 
 <p>“Aunt Luo, you may not know about my situation, so I will tell you the truth…” He gulped again.</p> 
 <p>“Aren’t there just a bit too many women around you? It’s not even certain how many can accompany you to the end. Also, I have made such a mistake once. I don’t want Luo Han to have the same regrets,” Luo Xi interrupted Bai Xiaofei, her words rendering him speechless.</p> 
 <p><em>Why are parents so open now? Even if she’s not your biological daughter, you can’t push her into a fire pit like that. And I’m a big fire pit!</em> Bai Xiaofei exclaimed in my heart but didn’t dare to say out loud.</p> 
 <p>“Aunt Luo, have you talked to her about this? Don’t you consider her thoughts? We should respect her opinion about this kind of thing.” This was the last resistance that Bai Xiaofei could think of. If it failed again, then he was really out of options…</p> 
 <p>“She has feelings for you, but she is too shy. Or else, do you think I would push my daughter to you just to make her fulfill my regret? Who do you think I am?!” Luo Xi questioned.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s face changed drastically. <em>Dang, this sin is too big!</em></p> 
 <p>“No, no, no, I didn’t mean that. Don’t get emotional, Aunt Luo. I promise you!” Bai Xiaofei chickened out upon seeing Luo Xi about to rage.</p> 
 <p>However, he immediately regretted it. How should he tell Hu Xian’er and the girls about this?</p> 
 <p>“Now, isn’t that better? You are much worse than your father on this, so fussy and indecisive,” Luo Xi said with disdain. At the mention of Bai Longfei, there was even a hint of bias in her tone.</p> 
 <p>The power of love was truly miraculous, it could make people like Luo Xi blind…</p> 
 <p>But this wasn’t Bai Xiaofei’s main concern. Her words had made him wonder about something else.</p> 
 <p><em>Was my father like me back then? But the old man said he was only in a relationship with Aunt Luo when he was in Starnet…</em></p> 
 <p>Complaining in his heart, Bai Xiaofei sighed helplessly.</p> 
 <p><em>Forget it, dad’s business is not something I should worry about. I must think about how to deal with my own problems first…</em></p> 
 <p>“Then… Aunt Luo, although I promised, I think we should get to know each other better first. What if Luo Han changes her mind after getting to know me?”</p> 
 <p>This was the last recourse that Bai Xiaofei could think of. He no longer had the wishful thinking that Luo Xi would budge.</p> 
 <p>“Well, you’re right. You guys indeed should. Come to my place when you have free time, I will arrange for you two to meet.” Luo Xi’s words once again stunned Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>He felt the urge to slap his own face. <em>How could my mouth be so stupid? Why did I have to dig my own grave?!</em></p> 
 <p>“What? Feeling troubled? Don’t tell me you don’t have time. Don’t think I don’t know what you do daily!” Luo Xi icily said. Bai Xiaofei was so frightened that he hurriedly agreed.</p> 
 <p>“No, no, no, no trouble at all! I will definitely report to you when I have time!” Wiping the cold sweat on his forehead, Bai Xiaofei felt that his bottom line was lowering little by little. In this confrontation with Luo Xi, he had been completely defeated…</p> 
 <p>“Alright, I’ll remember what you’ve said. Go home, I want to be alone,” saying this, Luo Xi’s voice mellowed.</p> 
 <p>Looking at the sorrow that was creeping up her face, Bai Xiaofei wisely left.</p> 
 <p>“Are you really gone, just like that? Do you think I’m doing the right thing? If you were here, would you support those two…?”</p> 
 <p>Once alone, Luo Xi began to mutter to herself, but she felt that Bai Longfei could hear everything she said…</p>
