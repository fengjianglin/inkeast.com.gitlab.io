 <p>Chapter 325: Dissolve with Dignity!</p> 
 <p>“Junior, there is no need for us two to beat around the bush!” Finally, Su Yu tore off his peaceful mask. He found himself unable to trick Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, I’m too lazy too. If you had said this earlier, I wouldn’t have had to talk so much nonsense.” Bai Xiaofei simply sat down, his calm demeanor made him look like a completely different person. “Acting is too tiring.”</p> 
 <p>With a few words, Bai Xiaofei successfully angered Su Yu to the point that all color left his face.</p> 
 <p>“Then you should know why we are here?” Su Yu asked with a frown. This feeling of being seen through made him very uncomfortable, but there was nothing he could do. He wasn’t daring enough to attack Bai Xiaofei in the Demon of Illusions.</p> 
 <p>“I can guess, but I don’t know exactly how big your appetite is.” Bai Xiaofei casually took out a ruddy apple from his storage and started munching on it. The Babel Merchant House couldn’t provide Crystal’s Longings to Bai Xiaofei as a snack, but other high-rank fruits weren't a problem at all. Now all kinds of valuable fruits had piled up in hills in his storage ring.</p> 
 <p>“Not very big. You only need to let our Student Union take over the reception work for a month!”</p> 
 <p>Su Yu said seriously, only to earn an extremely disdainful sneer from Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Not very big, huh? Then Senior, can you tell me why I want to agree to this? Because you are the top in the Combat Ranking? Sorry, that’s not even worth a copper to me.” With a snort, Bai Xiaofei’s attitude instantly grew icy.</p> 
 <p>“The top place in the Combat Ranking is nothing, true, but what if I’m acting on behalf of all the students in the second, third, and fourth year as the president of the Student Union?” Su Yu’s tone also turned icy, and the style of the two’s exchange had taken a U-turn from earlier.</p> 
 <p>“Ohhhh, I see, so you’re using your senior status and also the weight of ‘everyone’ to pressure me.” Dragging his voice, Bai Xiaofei donned a look of sudden enlightenment. “Unfortunately, Senior, you seem to have forgotten the reason why the New Student Mutual Aid Community was formed, and are you sure you can represent all the students in the second, third, and fourth year? If anything, can you represent the people on the Blossom Ranking? The Wealth Ranking? Let me guess, you can only represent those ordinary sophomores and juniors with no talent.”</p> 
 <p>Su Yu’s face changed a bit with every sentence. At the end of it all, it had become a colorful palette.</p> 
 <p>“With all due respect, Senior, the people you represent are trash to me!”</p> 
 <p>When those words dropped, the four other seniors immediately summoned their puppets. If Su Yu didn’t stop them, Bai Xiaofei would have been blown into slag by now.</p> 
 <p>“Junior, you should know that sometimes calamity comes from the mouth!” The threat in Su Yu’s tone deepened with each cold word.</p> 
 <p>“First, I’m not scared of trouble. I can destroy Di Jiang, so ‘teaching’ a few seniors one or two years above me a lesson is nothing at all. Second, I do not take kindly to threats! All those who threaten me will never have a good end!” Locking eyes with Su Yu, Bai Xiaofei showed no sign of retreating!</p> 
 <p>“Aren’t you afraid I’ll attack right here and now?” His face tense, Su Yu then stepped forward. The pressure of a fourth-realm Grandmaster spread and pressed down upon Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Enduring the discomfort caused by rank suppression, Bai Xiaofei scoffed.</p> 
 <p>“It’s not that I’m not afraid, but that you don’t dare! If I lose even just a hair, don’t even think of leaving the Demon of Illusions! Don’t forget whose territory this is!”</p> 
 <p>Upon these words, Su Yu, gritting his teeth in fury, slowly withdrew his pressure.</p> 
 <p>Indeed, no one could attack within the Demon of Illusions. Su Yu wasn’t afraid of Chu Liuyun and the others, what he feared was Lei Min!</p> 
 <p>Once, a student on the Combat Ranking, thinking himself very powerful, had ignored Chu Liuyun and Yun Sheng and ran into the Demon of Illusions wanting to force himself on the Leng sisters. Lei Min had been there at the time, and as a result, that student had been crippled for life, even the heaven-defying Rebirth Pill couldn’t have done a thing for him. Since then, no students ever dared to attack the members of the Demon of Illusions within their territory.</p> 
 <p>Because even the gods wouldn’t be able to save them!</p> 
 <p>“There’s no way you won’t leave the Demon of Illusions in your four years here!”</p> 
 <p>“You won’t even dare to attack me outside the Demon of Illusions. Believe me, you are no longer the top in the Combat Ranking.” With a smile, Bai Xiaofei poked at Su Yu’s most sensitive spot.</p> 
 <p><em>Whatever you say, the first place in the Combat Ranking is definitely mine!</em></p> 
 <p>“Oh? Do you want to challenge me, Junior Brother? I’m ready anytime!” Su Yu said with a trace of cruelty in his eyes. The four people around him were collectively stunned and looked at Bai Xiaofei in surprise.</p> 
 <p><em>An Illusion Stream Master Rank puppet master is challenging Su Yu?! Are you seeking death?</em></p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, someone will challenge you. Be prepared lest you lose too miserably.” Observing everyone’s expression, Bai Xiaofei was completely calm.</p> 
 <p>“Junior Brother, don’t be too arrogant. That New Student Mutual Aid Community of yours won’t last long. Once your number decreases, you won’t be able to compete with the Student Union! A wise man submits to fate. It’s no good to do stupid things!” This came from another senior, whose symbol of the Gods Amongst Men looked very conspicuous on his chest.</p> 
 <p><em>Ahh, have my last two days been all to compete with the Gods Amongst Men?</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but sigh, and then he looked at the senior who had just spoken like looking at an idiot.</p> 
 <p>“Who said there would be fewer freshmen? And, do you really think that your Student Union will last forever?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei threw back a question that shocked all five senior students.</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean?!” Su Yu was agitated again. Besides his ranking on the Combat Ranking, the Student Union was the second thing he cared most about.</p> 
 <p>Chasing after fame and benefit was an unhealthy thing that a 20-year-old prioritized easily, especially when he had some talent.</p> 
 <p>“The Student Union is but an accessory attached to the Popularity Ranking. If my guess is correct, the original intention of the Student Union is to assist the academy in managing student relationships and promote teaching to a certain extent.”</p> 
 <p>“However what has the current Student Union achieved? I’m afraid that it has become a place where senior students act all high and mighty, suppress and bully junior students. And all that you guys, its key managers, think about is how to reap benefits from it, right?”</p> 
 <p>“Wake up, the Popularity Ranking will last, but your Student Union might not if you continue to follow this routine. Nothing is absolute, especially when better substitutes appear!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei paused and a smile appeared on his face.</p> 
 <p>“So, think twice, and then dissolve the Student Union with dignity!”</p>
