 <p><span style>A short moment later, the Earth Dire Bear fled successfully to the bank of the river, and right at the instant it had just slowed down, Xu Chen walked out with Duan Yi’yi and Zhu Nuo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sharpness!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two beams of light flew out from Duan Yi’yi and Zhu Nuo’s puppets and shot directly onto Xu Chen’s body and weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Earth Dire Bear was still in a state of shock when the fiery red colored sword in Xu Chen’s hand had already pierced into its heart, whereas, the dying slap of the Earth Dire Bear was completely offset by the guard on Xu Chen’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s done. Let’s call it a day!” Xu Chen revealed a light smile and was extremely satisfied with her work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason Bai Xiaofei had placed the three of them here was precisely because of the ability of their three puppets to cooperate with each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Chen’s Crimsonflame Sword carried the effect of explosion and penetration, whereas, the first puppet of Zhu Nuo who was of the Healing Stream was the Bell of Guardians. It was capable of placing a layer of protective guard on a specified person to offset an attack that didn’t exceed the limits of its endurance. Finally, the first puppet of Duan Yi’yi who was of the Support Stream was the Rod of Strengthening. It was capable of attaching the effect of sharpness, speed, or weight onto a specified target.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Simply speaking, when the three of them were together, Xu Chen could be used like a Wang Hang that wasn’t afraid of death, and her lethality was even higher than Wang Hang!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they killed the two Earth Dire Bears, the boys played the role of coolies once more, and they carried the corpses of the Earth Dire Bears back to the campsite.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Xue Ying had already made a fire and was waiting to have some bear paws….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll officially return to the academy tomorrow, and I believe that the latest Qin Lingyan comes looking for trouble would be the day after tomorrow. I hope all of you are prepared.” Xue Ying’s satisfaction was already shown on her face, and the tone she spoke to all of them with had completely lost its previous sternness. </span></p>
 <p><span style>During the past month, Xue Ying had already taught everything she could to the 16 of them, and the effect of the training that originally ought to have been done in three months of time and was compressed into a month didn’t disappoint Xue Ying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, Big Sister Xue. They’re only a few Master Rank opponents, and we won’t lose too badly.” Xing Nan laughed slyly. His friendly nature had been completely let out, and this past month could be said to be rather delightful for him. Because he didn’t have to be alone with Zhu Si’si all the time, and the time he suffered torture had been reduced greatly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Xing, what you said is wrong, I don’t think we’ll lose.” As he bit on the paw meat of the bears, Shu Kui expressed his objection at the first possible moment, and his muscles that had become even stronger seemed as if they were carved out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the outcomes of the month-long training was that the all their constitutions had attained an abnormal level. Even if they didn’t utilize puppets, all of them were confident in completely crushing a Mastery Rank puppet master in a one on one battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Ying’s initial vision had utterly become reality now!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, it wasn’t just their constitutions that had changed. Most of the members of the Savage Class were at the Apprentice Rank before they entered the Infinite Mountain Range, but now, all of them had attained the Mastery Rank!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amongst all of them, the person that had improved the most in terms of Origin Energy was Mo Ka. Even though he was similarly at the Mastery Rank, but the abundance of Origin Energy in Mo Ka’s body now wasn’t the slightest bit inferior to Wu Chi who possessed the Heavenly Origin Physique!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, he’d boiled water for an entire month!!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Exactly. You quitter, all you know is to lose. Just you wait, I’ll seal up your stinking mouth when we get back!” Zhu Si’si took a large stride to arrive by Xing Nan’s side, and then she pulled on Xing Nan’s ears a few times. But, in the eyes of the others, this was more like an explosive attack on singles….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are we going to let Lin Li join this time?” As the group joked about, Xu Chen suddenly asked an important question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a time, everyone stopped talking, and they looked at either Bai Xiaofei or Xue Ying because only the two of them could make this decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the reason Xu Chen had asked this question was instead because of the distinctive nature of Lin Li’s puppet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Divine Phoenix Feather Dress, practically everyone in the continent knew the name of this puppet. But, its true grade shouldn’t be the gold-grade, and it should appear in the possession of a Master Rank puppet master like Lin Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Its true owner was one of the three Legend Rank experts on the continent, the Angelic Maiden Li Nishang!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was also during the first time Lin Li utilized her puppet that all of them found out about the relationship between her and Lin Nishang, they were mother and daughter!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This allowed everyone to understand why Lin Li was so extraordinary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Nishang was known as the number one beauty on the continent, and there had been countless experts that had given up everything they had just to meet her once!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Lin Li’s stumbling explanation, everyone finally found out the origins of her puppet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A copy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The owners of inanimate puppets at the violetgold-grade or above could consume a portion of their puppet’s core to create a copy that possessed a similar ability as it. But, the damage to one’s puppet was extremely great when utilizing this technique, and there were usually very few people that would give benefit to another at their own expense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, as Lin Nishang’s daughter, her safety was naturally more important than a violetgold-grade puppet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, if Lin Li utilized her puppet, then she would surely be recognized. At that time, a mess of problems would arise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most importantly, if Lin Li concealed her puppet, then she would become a strong trump card for the Savage Class during the New Student Competition!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, they won’t spread the news if we win.” The person that spoke was Bai Xiaofei, and his voice was filled with confidence when he said this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could that be possible? Wouldn’t a normal person look for a reason? Isn’t Lin Li a reason that’s difficult to come by for them?” Xu Chen just happened to have thoughts that were opposite to Bai Xiaofei’s. As far as she was concerned, unless Lin Li didn’t make a move, otherwise, it would absolutely stir the entire academy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because she was the daughter of Lin Nishang!!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That would depend on how badly they are beaten. If we beat them to the point they feel fear from just mentioning it, then do you think they would go around spreading it?” As they looked at the familiar smile on Bai Xiaofei’s face, all of them couldn’t help but gulp down a mouthful of saliva.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Bai Xiaofei revealed this expression, it meant he was about to do a major thing that would shake the universe and cause the gods to weep. Subsequently, all of them commonly started mourning silently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They mourned in silence for the seniors that were about to be their opponents….</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Now, no one is able to save all of you!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s discuss all of this when we get back. Can’t we talk about something nice during our final meal together here!?” Xue Ying who was tired of listening to this spoke abruptly and directly interrupted their discussion. She who’d successfully finished her job just wanted to properly enjoy her remaining two months of having no work to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, Xue Ying wanted to enjoy herself….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right, didn’t Wu Chi say he would dance if we’re able to kill those two Earth Dire Bears? I still remember his words!!!” Mo Ka desired to stir up trouble, and he mentioned a bet that everyone had almost forgotten.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a time, Wu Chi who’d flushed red from embarrassment became the center of attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Chi shot a resentful gaze at Bai Xiaofei and wished for nothing more than to find a hole in the ground to hide in. he was seduced by Bai Xiaofei’s Starnet Stones on that day he made the bet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The nearby Huskie barked at Wu Chi with extreme sympathy because they were a dog and man pair that had fallen to the same misfortune….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, it’s time to prepare some water to wash our eyes!” Adding insult to injury had always been one of Bai Xiaofei’s favorites….</span></p>
