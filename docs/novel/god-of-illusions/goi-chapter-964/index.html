 <p>Chapter 964: Moonlight Emperor</p> 
 <p>“Hey! What the hell are you doing?!”</p> 
 <p>The contestants instantly assumed aggressive postures when they saw Bai Xiaofei hoarding the food.</p> 
 <p>“Eating, of course,” said Bai Xiaofei as he started packing up the food… that he found delicious after having a taste.</p> 
 <p>“You are from the Northern District, your food is over there!” A contestant pointed at an area where the dishes didn’t emit any heat.</p> 
 <p>“Who told you that?” With a sneer, Bai Xiaofei stopped what he was doing and stood up slowly. As he walked toward the contestant, the latter immediately chickened out.</p> 
 <p>“It’s a consensus that you guys are the lowest status among us. What makes you think you get to eat the best food?!” yelled another contestant as he stepped out along with several people.</p> 
 <p>“Oh? If you want to know why, I can tell you.” Bai Xiaofei walked to the man. “With my fist!” And a punch to the stomach turned the man into a lobster.</p> 
 <p>Then, Bai Xiaofei coldly looked at the rest of the contestants who had stepped out to oppose him.</p> 
 <p>“From now on, we of the No.10 warehouse in the Northern District will be the boss here. We will eat the best and use the best. If anyone has any objection, first weigh whether your fists can handle ours!” His voice cold, he twisted his head to look at Zhu Chunyang. “If anyone dares to run his mouth again, beat him up until his teeth are all over the ground!”</p> 
 <p>Finishing saying his piece, Bai Xiaofei returned to the food. During this, none of the contestants in the square dared to stand up. Such were the men of Moonlight. Nearly 50,000 people were scared by a hundred.</p> 
 <p>Before this, the people of Warehouse No.10 could never believe this to be possible, especially that they’d be among the one-hundred party. Instantly, they experienced a strange satisfaction that Zhuang Shuo had just felt, and it was pride!</p> 
 <p>Seeing smiles bloom on the faces of the men of his group, Bai Xiaofei was pleased. <em>Fortunately, they can still be saved…</em></p> 
 <p>“Let’s go back and eat!” Bai Xiaofei turned to leave.</p> 
 <p>The men of Warehouse No.10 immediately caught up with him. Walking beside Bai Xiaofei, Zhu Chunyang’s smile kept growing wider.</p> 
 <p>“I underestimated you before.” In Zhu Chunyang’s voice, there was a mix of admiration and expectation.</p> 
 <p>“I think you looked down on me regarding many things. Which one do you mean?” Bai Xiaofei made a look of scorn, but the smile on his lips was also visible.</p> 
 <p>“You said you wanted to help Moonlight men rise by relying on themselves, but I always thought that it was something that Moonlight men weren’t capable of. Now, my mind has changed,” said Zhu Chunyang as he glanced back at the muscular men who were laughing as they carried off the food. “They can already laugh in joy like men outside. At this rate, they may really change completely.”</p> 
 <p>“Not ‘may,’ it’s ‘definitely!’” Bai Xiaofei clicked his tongue.</p> 
 <p>Chatting as they walked, the group soon returned to their warehouse. When they finished placing the dishes, Zhuang Shuo’s group also returned.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, mission complete!” Zhuang Shuo reported.</p> 
 <p>Behind him were two hundred men brimming with smiles as they carried a mountain of things, from bedding items to various furniture that were enough to renovate the whole warehouse.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s eat first. Only when your stomach is full will you have the strength to compete.” Bai Xiaofei waved his hand.</p> 
 <p>This drew a loud cheer from the three hundred men. They proceeded to have a great meal that some restaurants outside might not be able to match.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Ye Tong and the officials had gathered, in front of them were the scenes from every corner of the camp during the one hour given to have a meal.</p> 
 <p>“Fickle Bai actually guessed the purpose of this period so quickly?!” exclaimed one of the officials.</p> 
 <p>The others shared her surprise, only Ye Tong was full of displeasure.</p> 
 <p>“He’s a rogue. It’s normal for him to think that way. It’s just luck!” claimed Ye Tong coldly.</p> 
 <p>“Your highness, in that case, do we report to Her Majesty the Emperor?” asked an official. Although curious why Ye Tong was so displeased with Bai Xiaofei, she was afraid to ask.</p> 
 <p>Upon hearing the word ‘emperor,’ Ye Tong reflexively revealed a hint of fear. If she reported truthfully, Fickle Bai would definitely enter the sight of the emperor… But she didn’t have the courage to do otherwise. She was really scared of her big sister.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll tell her myself!” Ye Tong decided after some hesitation.</p> 
 <p>Then, she stood up and went back to her room.</p> 
 <p>“Damn Fickle Bai, I swear I’ll teach you the lesson you deserve sooner or later!!” She plunged into bed and rolled around in fury.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, a projection appeared in the room. In that instant, Ye Tong’s expression changed into that of a well-behaved girl.</p> 
 <p>“Big Sister…”</p> 
 <p>The figure projected was none other than the emperor of Moonlight, the only person that Ye Tong was ever scared of in this world.</p> 
 <p>“How is it going? Anyone worthy of attention?” asked the figure. Her calm tone sounded extremely serious in Ye Tong’s ears.</p> 
 <p>“There is someone who thinks the same as you, but there is definitely something off about him!” Ye Tong didn’t hide the truth but still added her own subjective judgment.</p> 
 <p>“It’s the one your second sister brought back, isn’t it?” The emperor shook her head with a smile. She knew her little sister too well.</p> 
 <p>“Big Sister, he really has a problem! He’s definitely not a simple servant! He reported that he was not a puppet master, but he used puppet master’s abilities! He even has a storage ring! He must have ulterior motives! “ Ye Tong tried to argue her point, but unfortunately, it was of no use to the emperor.</p> 
 <p>“Just do as I say. I won’t stop you from doing what you want, as long as you don’t go too far. I am very interested in this person now, and he should be able to see me if there is no accident,” said the emperor, the implication in her words obvious: ‘You can keep finding trouble with him, but you cannot send him away.’</p> 
 <p>“Don’t you worry, Big Sister. I will find out everything about him!” Ye Tong solemnly guaranteed.</p> 
 <p>However, the emperor chuckled. “Good, good, I know our Tong Tong is the best. However, consider the present state of Moonlight as you proceed. According to the divination of that Master, this may be our only chance,” the emperor reminded Ye Tong with a sigh.</p> 
 <p>If she could, she wouldn’t make this choice…</p> 
 <p>Everything was in the hands of fate now!</p>
