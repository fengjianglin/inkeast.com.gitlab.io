 <p>Chapter 497: The Dust Has Not Settled…</p> 
 <p>The atmosphere between the two people instantly grew cold at Xue Ying's question. For a moment, Bai Xiaofei didn't know what to say.</p> 
 <p>“Please welcome our main character tonight, Qin Lingyan!”</p> 
 <p>At that time, Bai Ye, the host of the night’s coming-of-age ceremony came on stage and attracted everyone's attention. Soon after, Qin Lingyan walked up slowly in her beautiful blue dress. All ongoing conversations stopped as everyone looked over with praising eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you very much for attending my coming-of-age ceremony. I hope my hospitality has not disappointed you. If you have a chance to visit Violethorn in the future, come to me and I will make you feel at home!” Qin Lingyan said and bowed slightly.</p> 
 <p>At the end of her speech, Bai Ye went up again. Bai Xiaofei didn’t know if it was just an illusion, but he saw Bai Ye cast him a strange glance while walking up on stage.</p> 
 <p>“Next is tonight’s most exciting moment. Which man present will be lucky enough to receive the favor of our star and become her dance partner?” Bai Ye aroused everyone's interest.</p> 
 <p>The eyes of most men present instantly shone. Being invited by Qin Lingyan to her coming-of-age ceremony already made them feel special about themselves.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei's state of mind was completely different…</p> 
 <p>Gulping, he finally knew where his worries came from. Looking towards Hu Xian’er and the girls, he harvested a bunch of murderous glares.</p> 
 <p><em>It definitely will be Bai Xiaofei!</em> This was the consensus in the hearts of the girls. Moreover, they couldn’t even stop him on such an occasion…</p> 
 <p>Under the gaze of everyone, Qin Lingyan slowly walked down from the stage, and sure enough, she did not disappoint their expectations. She went straight towards Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Won't you ask me for a dance?” Qin Lingyan tilted her head and asked with a smile.</p> 
 <p>Returning to his senses, Bai Xiaofei hurriedly donned a smile, then slowly bowed and stretched out his right hand.</p> 
 <p>“Beautiful lady, may I have this dance?”</p> 
 <p>As Qin Lingyan slowly laid her hand on his, elegant music sounded.</p> 
 <p>“Don't tell me this is your first time dancing,” Qin Lingyan complained as she followed Bai Xiaofei’s clumsy lead. As they danced, more and more couples began to fill the dance floor.</p> 
 <p>“I’m giving my first time to you. Shouldn't you be happy?” Bai Xiaofei retorted.</p> 
 <p>Qin Lingyan rolled her eyes. Then, she threatened with a hint of seriousness, “Listen and follow my lead. If you step on my foot again, don’t even think of leaving tonight!”</p> 
 <p>“That can’t be? You want me to pay you back with my body for just stepping on your foot a little?” Bai Xiaofei made an exaggerated shocked expression, and then his foot was stomped on by Qin Lingyan.</p> 
 <p>“Dream on! You will stay to brush my shoes!”</p> 
 <p>Knowing that there weren’t any benefits to enjoy, Bai Xiaofei immediately behaved. A simple social dance like this couldn’t trouble him for long. Under Qin Lingyan’s guidance, he soon got accustomed to dancing. Gradually, the two became the best couple on the dance floor. This coupled with their conspicuous couple outfits made them the focus of attention.</p> 
 <p>“If you lean so close to me, your girl group will be jealous,” Qin Lingyan suddenly spoke, catching Bai Xiaofei off guard.</p> 
 <p>He quickly glanced over at where the girls were, only to find that they were chatting wholeheartedly, having no intention to look at him at all.</p> 
 <p>Despite knowing that this reaction was abnormal, Bai Xiaofei was still relieved. After all, it was better to settle the accounts after, rather than now…</p> 
 <p>“They will understand,” Bai Xiaofei replied with difficulty as he couldn’t think of an appropriate answer.</p> 
 <p>“Oh? Aren’t they virtuous?” Qin Lingyan's tone was getting odder and odder, her questions trickier and tricker.</p> 
 <p>“That word can’t be used yet<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>. Our relationships have just recently been made official, and no one knows what will happen in the future, but I will treat them seriously with all of my heart.” Bai Xiaofei didn't shy away. One no longer feels itchy when there are too many fleas; he had been asked about this so much that he was used to facing this question.</p> 
 <p>Others might fear that this would affect their reputation, but not him. What he was really afraid of was that Qin Lingyan would become one of the moths that would fly straight into the fire. He already owed too much love debt, he couldn’t repay it all…</p> 
 <p>“If I say I want you to go to Violethorn with me, will you?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei was stunned. A while later, he looked at Qin Lingyan seriously and asked slowly, “Are you… serious?”</p> 
 <p>“Do you think I'm joking?”</p> 
 <p>At her counter-question, he looked troubled.</p> 
 <p>“I may go to Violethorn, but it’s definitely not because of someone. And as I just said, maybe I’m not doing a good job now, but there’s no way I will let go of them,” he said, his eyes full of determination.</p> 
 <p>Hearing his answer, Qin Lingyan didn’t reveal any strange expressions. She only smiled faintly. “Finish this dance with me.”</p> 
 <p>That was the end of the topic. In the next few minutes, neither of them spoke again until the music ended and everyone stopped.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you for coming to my coming-of-age ceremony. I won't forget it,” said Qin Lingyan with a smile, and then softly kissed his cheek under the gaze of everyone.</p> 
 <p>Sounds of discussions arose, but Qin Lingyan walked up on stage as if nothing had happened.</p> 
 <p>“Let's call it a day. If you haven’t had fun tonight, I'll make it up to you later, but today I'm really tired.” Having said this, Qin Lingyan left without waiting for the guests to react.</p> 
 <p>Everyone stared blankly on the spot.</p> 
 <p><em>What just happened?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>You can be like this too?!</em></p> 
 <p>“It's getting late. Let's disperse. We will have more chances to gather in the future.” Bai Ye stepped out and somewhat helped to conclude the party.</p> 
 <p>Everyone left one by one. Finally, only Bai Xiaofei’s group was left.</p> 
 <p>“Lingyan asked me to give you this. Hope that this can help you one day.” Bai Ye handed Bai Xiaofei a wooden box with a herbal fragrance. Having seen his fair share of good stuff, Bai Xiaofei instantly knew that this was something extraordinary.</p> 
 <p>“This is…?”</p> 
 <p>“When you pretended to be sick, Lingyan went back to her family and asked for medicine. This was given to her by her father. Grade eight Rebirth Pill. You know that the grade seven version saves lives, grade eight resurrects the near-dead. She asked for it just for you,” Bai Ye’s tone was icy. “But as far as I know, her relationship with her father is not very good, so I’m afraid she must have paid something to get this pill.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Ye left as soon as he finished, leaving only Bai Xiaofei rooted in place for a long time in a trance…</p>
