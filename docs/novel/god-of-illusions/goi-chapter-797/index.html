 <p>Chapter 797: Is That Important?</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei regaining consciousness injected new vitality into his group. However, under the pressure from Hu Xian’er and Lin Li as well as Luo Han’s insistence, he had to postpone the new action plan for one day.</p> 
 <p>As night fell, Bai Xiaofei climbed the roof of the inn with a wine flask in his hand. Although different from his familiar Starnet, the starry sky of Windlove City was special in its own way. Not very lively, but mysterious.</p> 
 <p>“Drinking alone is not a good habit,” a familiar voice rang out from behind.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei tossed the flask behind. Fang Ye, who caught it, revealed a big smile.</p> 
 <p>“Sure enough, I have to find you to find good wine!” He poured himself a mouthful and let out a long, satisfied sigh before sitting down next to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“What do you think of this city?” Bai Xiaofei asked.</p> 
 <p>The old Fang Ye would not be able to comment half a word, but he had been through great changes.</p> 
 <p>“Everything seems to be clear on the surface but is, in fact, covered in a thick fog. The Blood Diamond thing is definitely not the only trouble here.”</p> 
 <p>A serious Fang Ye was like a completely different person, but Bai Xiaofei did not find him unfamiliar at all.</p> 
 <p>“Troubles are always present in this city, only lacking someone to stir them all up at once. Believe me, when all the troubles come together is when the troubles are solved,” Bai Xiaofei commented as he received the flask from Fang Ye and then took a sip.</p> 
 <p>“Then, you are that someone. This has never been my concern. Do you know what I care about now?” With a sigh, Fang Ye stared fixedly at Bai Xiaofei and successfully had him flustered. Seeing this, Fang Ye burst out laughing. “How long has it been since I last saw you flustered?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei rolled his eyes and stuffed the flask into Fang Ye’s hand.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t tell them.” In the end, Bai Xiaofei helplessly shook his head and chose honesty.</p> 
 <p>“Are you stupid or do you think I’m stupid? How can they not see what I can see? They just don’t want to expose you.” Fang Ye drank another mouthful with a bitter smile.</p> 
 <p>Although Bai Xiaofei had woken up, his condition was extremely bad! The Endless State’s Devouring the Heaven and Earth that always claimed to never stop running had completely vanished, and it was impossible to feel any energy fluctuation from Bai Xiaofei. In other words, he was currently no different from a normal person… No, a normal person would still have a good body. Bai Xiaofei did not even have a good body. His physical quality that could crush same-rank martial artists had become powerless.</p> 
 <p>Everyone else saw this but decided against bringing it to open discussion.</p> 
 <p>“Hahaha, I really should have known. I thought you guys didn’t notice.” Bai Xiaofei laughed in embarrassment, then couldn’t help a sigh.</p> 
 <p><em>F*ck, does the heavens find this lord displeasing or what? Why do troubles keep happening to me?!</em></p> 
 <p>“It doesn’t matter to us, though. As long as you are fine, our hope remains,” Fang Ye said with a smile.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei gawked in shock. “Err… You call this fine?”</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye shook his head and explained, “I mean, as long as you are alive, it is not a problem.”</p> 
 <p>This was easy to understand and indeed the truth, not anywhere near a jinx at all, but it still sounded a bit weird…</p> 
 <p>“But I’m in a panic. I don’t know how deep the waters here are. If I can’t participate myself, I will always worry that something bad will happen. You know, if anything happens to any of you, I won’t be able to forgive myself,” Bai Xiaofei said faintly as he heaved a long sigh.</p> 
 <p>“You think your combat power is very important to us?” Fang Ye frowned.</p> 
 <p>His question struck Bai Xiaofei dumb.</p> 
 <p>“It’s not?” Bai Xiaofei blinked in confusion. His reaction earned a smile from Fang Ye.</p> 
 <p>“The Windlove Army was completely disrupted by Wang Hang, and Zhu Wuxin was beaten by Big Sis Xian’er. We have never been inferior so far, and importantly, how do you think the possessed you was stopped?”</p> 
 <p>Fang ye paused briefly before explaining,</p> 
 <p>“In fact, you losing your combat ability is not necessarily a bad thing. You have always been the pillar of our group, not as a fighter, but as the brain of the team. Because of you, we can display 120% of our strength.”</p> 
 <p>“However, since you mastered the Art of Spiritualization, you gradually made yourself a parent who stands in front of us and protects us. In the fight with Ling Tianxia, we all had assignments, but we could all feel that our value was significantly smaller.”</p> 
 <p>“Because of this, while you were away, we each desperately did the hardest to improve ourselves and received missions at the greatest intensity, and cultivated our energy day and night, so that one day we can be just like before.”</p> 
 <p>“So, your problem is even a good thing for us. This is our opportunity to tell you that the Savage Class is a collective that can stand the test of rain and storm, and not a carefully nurtured flower in a greenhouse.”</p> 
 <p>When the long speech finally ended, Bai Xiaofei was staring with his mouth agape. He had never noticed this before.</p> 
 <p>In other words, he had been a little obsessed after witnessing the power of Legend Rank puppet masters and even the terrifying demon king. He was in a panic and filled with the thoughts of making himself stronger, therefore ignoring what he was best at!</p> 
 <p>“I’m sorry, I haven’t…”</p> 
 <p>“No need for apologies, we all understand. However, you need to do well the role of our brain from now on. All of us are your weapons, the extent that we can display our power depends on your arrangement.” Fang Ye cut Bai Xiaofei off and handed him the flask.</p> 
 <p>“Rest assured! Leave it to me!” Bai Xiaofei laughed and poured the last mouthful of wine into his mouth.</p> 
 <p>“So, it does not feel so important that you can’t use your power now, right?” Fang Ye teased as he joined in and laughed as well.</p> 
 <p>“Hahaha, doesn’t matter! It doesn’t matter! I’m even happy to be idle! The planning goes to me, the dangerous implementation to you guys! If you really really die, don’t blame me!” Bai Xiaofei said unscrupulously, but Fang Ye only grew happier and happier upon listening.</p> 
 <p><em>Those are the words I’m waiting for! How can we leave all the dangerous stuff to you? We are family!</em></p>
