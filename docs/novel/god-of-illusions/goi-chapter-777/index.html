 <p>Chapter 777: Very Sorry!</p> 
 <p>After the recess was the third stage of the auction, with which the atmosphere in the hall became even tenser than before.</p> 
 <p>Whether it was pills or materials, the enhancement they provided puppet masters was indirect, unlike the next category – Puppets!</p> 
 <p>It was needless to say about the importance of puppets to puppet masters, especially for the guests of the auction. Many of them even reserved a puppet slot just for this day. Therefore, the next few competitions were destined to be bankrupting!</p> 
 <p>Originally, Bai Xiaofei was not interested in the puppet auction, but the appearance of Into Oblivion and the Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill had given him a sudden mission: to find a puppet that could cooperate with Into Oblivion!</p> 
 <p>Watching puppets going for all kinds of sky-high prices with great interest, Bai Xiaofei secretly scolded himself for underestimating this continent.</p> 
 <p><em>So there are this many rich bags! F*ck, I’m going to drain these guys with Illusion Demon someday!</em></p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei complained in his heart, the hall suddenly quieted down. The host, Qing Han, stood there full of embarrassment as no one showed interest in the item being auctioned despite all the good words he had said about it.</p> 
 <p>However, it could not be helped, this puppet had way too many restrictions!</p> 
 <p>“What’s the situation?” Bai Xiaofei looked at Qing Ya.</p> 
 <p>The latter seemed to have anticipated that he would be interested. She started introducing,</p> 
 <p>“This is a violet-grade puppet, Immovable Bracelet. It’s a semi-failed product for turning out different from the original idea of the designer, so there is only one product on the whole continent. Under normal circumstances, a failed product should have been destroyed, but it, by chance, came across an owner and then made that puppet master famous in just one battle. However, the puppet master later died to the Immovable Bracelet. Before his death, he refined it into an inheritance puppet.”</p> 
 <p>After a brief introduction on the history of the bracelet, Qing Ya explained its function,</p> 
 <p>“This bracelet will continue to absorb the energy of its master right after a successful connection, and there is no limit to its accumulation. The absorption rate is probably as much as when you continuously use a blue-grade puppet. Normally, even a Grandmaster Rank will be drained.”</p> 
 <p>“The accumulated energy in the bracelet can be used at any time, but there is only one effect: strengthen the next attack of another puppet in accordance with the amount of energy stored. Moreover, this ability must go through a ten-second preparation, during which the puppet master cannot mobilize their energy.”</p> 
 <p>After Qing Ya finished, Bai Xiaofei sat there, sunk in thought. Finally, he pressed the button, and successfully acquired the Immovable Bracelet at a low price of 100,000 Amethyst Coins.</p> 
 <p>Initially, he had no intention to buy it as there were too many restrictions, but in the end, he recalled Fan Xingyu’s charged attack that had seriously injured the Demon King.</p> 
 <p><em>No wonder someone was willing to use it. At the very least, this puppet is unique!</em></p> 
 <p>After passing the lowest point bought by the Immovable Bracelet, the auction again became lively. However, until the finale of the third round, Bai Xiaofei did not see anything that interested him.</p> 
 <p>“Next will be our finale, but this one is a bit special. Due to the owner’s request, I cannot tell you what it is, but I guarantee you that it is a top-tier puppet that will be useful to most people. The starting price is thirty million Amethyst Coins.”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Qing Han finished, the audience exclaimed in unison.</p> 
 <p><em>Thirty million for an unknown puppet, who would dare to bid?! Unless they bet on the credibility of Unify Business! But all businessmen are evil!</em></p> 
 <p>“Thirty million,” a faint voice rang out from a private room upstairs just when most people were still hesitating.</p> 
 <p>“Fifty million.” The next caller was Bai Xiaofei, after inquiring Qing Ya about the puppet. Although Qing Ya could not tell him what it was, she had solemnly advised him that the puppet was best obtained!</p> 
 <p>However, there was a premise: he must not be afraid of being targeted!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei directly ignored this warning. There were very few who could be more malicious than Shadow Death, the organization that was currently his mortal enemy. He had nothing to be afraid of.</p> 
 <p>“Seventy million!” The first bidder refused to be outdone.</p> 
 <p>“One hundred million!” Bai Xiaofei followed closely, obviously having no limit to his funds.</p> 
 <p>The start-up capital of Demon Illusion was nearly a trillion. After such a long time of operating, even Bai Xiaofei did not know what it had grown to, but anyway, the card Feng Wuhen had sent him had five hundred billion Amethyst Coins in it!</p> 
 <p>“Two hundred million!” an unfamiliar voice joined the bidding war. Seeing how much they raised the price, they seemed much more generous than the previous two.</p> 
 <p>“One billion!” Bai Xiaofei was ready to spend 100 billion. Until then, he would not hesitate.</p> 
 <p>“Friend, are you really so at ease to gamble that much? This is a puppet that you don’t know anything about,” the person who had just bid 200 million commented directly to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>His reply was a sneer. “This lord has nothing but money and is full of interest in the unknown. If I know what it is, I may not even bid.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s reply made the person completely abandon the plan to dissuade him. They simply raised the price to five billion!</p> 
 <p>At this point, the first bidder quit the race. His limit was one billion, any more would not be worth it.</p> 
 <p>“Ten billion.” Bai Xiaofei continued to increase the price without emotion, drawing a collective gasp from the whole hall.</p> 
 <p>They thought that he didn’t participate in the Pill auction because he did not have that kind of money, but now it seemed they had thought too much! <em>This guy really doesn’t consider money as money at all!</em></p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Qing Han standing on the stage could hear his heart dripping blood. He had just promised Bai Xiaofei a 20% discount, which meant 2 billion was gone!</p> 
 <p>“Fifty billion. If you can go higher than this, the puppet is yours,” the other bidder announced his limit.</p> 
 <p>Never did he expect that Bai Xiaofei would play dirty…</p> 
 <p>“Great, fifty billion and three million!”</p> 
 <p>According to the auction rules, each increase must not be less than 10% of the starting price…</p> 
 <p>What Bai Xiaofei added was like a thin layer of icing on top of a thick cake!</p> 
 <p>“Good! Good! Good! Little brother, I hope you can leave Windlove alive!” The other bidder burst out laughing, but the threat in his words was blatant!</p> 
 <p>“Thanks for reminding me, but I’m very sorry, for what you just said, I’m afraid you can’t leave Windlove alive!” Bai Xiaofei retorted with a cold sneer.</p> 
 <p>The whole auction gulped.</p> 
 <p><em>Very domineering! We have a show to watch!</em></p>
