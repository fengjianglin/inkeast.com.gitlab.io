 <p>Chapter 686: A Different Holy Snow Mountain!</p> 
 <p>After the smoke cleared and the snow settled, the three spike monsters at the center of the explosion had collapsed.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei heaved a long sigh of relief upon seeing this. <em>So these monsters are weak against energy attacks!</em></p> 
 <p>However, he couldn’t be happy for long as a huge mass of spikes once again shot down. He had no choice but to teleport and returned to the triplet’s side.</p> 
 <p>“So, what are those things?” asked Bai Xiaofei anxiously, but Leng Liushuang’s answer made his heart turn cold.</p> 
 <p>“I have never seen anything like them, but I think we should be able to give it a try,” she said and summoned her puppet.</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuli and Leng Liuying immediately understood her plan.</p> 
 <p>“If they are on top, we can’t affect them. You have to help us get them down!” Leng Liushuang told Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Leave it to me!” He nodded and flew out. As Purple Luan’s effects reached its limit in the Spiritualization State, the spikes could not pose a threat to Bai Xiaofei. He landed on the cliff and sent one spike monster flying down after another.</p> 
 <p>During this, however, he was also given a good beating. Fortunately, his physique was resistant enough to bear through anything so long as it was not fatal.</p> 
 <p>“The World in the Mirror!” The triplets launched their combination skill once all the spike monsters had fallen. The mirror that was at least twice as big as before instantly loomed over the whole valley.</p> 
 <p>God Control’s enormous enhancement on the practitioners’ control over their puppets was the reason why Cang Lan was so determined to make the triplets learn it. And the area of effect was only a part of the enhancement.</p> 
 <p>The mirror world opened and spike monster replicas came out. Compared with the previous mirror world, both the degree of replication and solidification of the replicas had improved greatly.</p> 
 <p>The real spike monsters obviously didn’t know what the replicas were, but they could tell that they were not their own, thus starting a chaotic battle. The spikes then showed their versatility as a weapon in both melee and ranged combat.</p> 
 <p>The real spike monsters went on a killing spree, but they didn’t understand why they were the ones being injured while killing an opponent. Still, this did not stop them and only incited their bloodthirst, making their attacks even more violent!</p> 
 <p>However, despite how strong the spike monsters were, the number of replicas did not decrease but was instead constantly increasing. This was the biggest enhancement that God Control brought to the Leng triplets.</p> 
 <p>With God Control from all three of them adding up together, the effect was terrifying beyond their imagination, so much so that even they were startled.</p> 
 <p>Just like that, the spike monsters gradually fell one by one, their lack of intelligence being the cause of their destruction. During this whole process, Bai Xiaofei just stood there gawking.</p> 
 <p>“Finally over!” After the last monster collapsed, Leng Liuying let out a long sigh of relief as the mirror disappeared.</p> 
 <p>Looking at over forty spike monsters sprawled all over the ground, Bai Xiaofei was in a long trance until Leng Liuying smacked him lightly.</p> 
 <p>“Idiot, what are you thinking?”</p> 
 <p>His senses back, Bai Xiaofei looked at the triplets in astonishment.</p> 
 <p>“You guys…”</p> 
 <p>“Amazing, isn’t it? Definitely not what your half-hearted God Control can match!” Leng Liuying smugly looked at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Behind them, Leng Liushuang smiled while Leng Liuli facepalmed. <em>We are back home indeed, Liuying is completely out of control…</em></p> 
 <p>“It’s really amazing. From what I’ve seen, magical beasts with insufficient intelligence should have no way to survive against you.” Bai Xiaofei was relieved by the improvement of the three’s strength. Their fighting capacity was originally limited without teammates, but now, this weakness had ceased to exist.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, alright. Let’s not talk about this. Shouldn’t we be studying these things now?” Leng Liushuang pointed to the ground full of spike monsters, successfully steering the attention of the others.</p> 
 <p>Indeed, they had to carefully study those monsters. Bai Xiaofei squatted down and began observing them. Leng Liuli and Leng Liushuang joined him, while Leng Liuying stopped half-way as she expressed strong distaste toward their ferocious looks.</p> 
 <p>“Not magical beasts, not human, they seem to be another race…” Bai Xiaofei finally made a judgment after long hesitation. </p> 
 <p>Leng Liuli nodded. “Indeed, and it’s a race that has never appeared in the Snow Kingdom before. But how can they suddenly appear here? The Holy Snow Mountain is the stomach of our country. If they migrated here, Father would have definitely imposed restrictions on them. At least he wouldn’t let them come to this place.” She was confused. No matter which aspect she considered, this was beyond the scope of her understanding.</p> 
 <p>“Then they are not from the outside.” Bai Xiaofei smiled as his whole face lit up.</p> 
 <p>Leng Liuli froze a little at the implication.</p> 
 <p>“You mean…” She stopped half-way and swallowed with difficulty. This idea was too horrifying!</p> 
 <p>“Nothing is impossible. None of us know what The Ruins is, and those who know it are all restricted. Therefore, the only way is for us to personally go in and see for ourselves. Only then can we get a clear picture!” Bai Xiaofei shook his fist, his eyes resolute.</p> 
 <p>“Look!”</p> 
 <p>Just as Bai Xiaofei was delivering an emotional speech, Leng Liushuang suddenly exclaimed. She seldom raised her voice, unless she had discovered something truly staggering.</p> 
 <p>The rest turned to look and were stupefied by what they saw.</p> 
 <p>Under Leng Liushuang’s control, two spikes were floating in midair and quickly responded to her movements.</p> 
 <p><em>Natural puppet?! The kind that doesn’t need spiritual linking at that?! Then all of these spikes…</em></p> 
 <p>Looking around, the shock on Bai Xiaofei’s face turned into ecstasy. They had struck gold again!</p>
