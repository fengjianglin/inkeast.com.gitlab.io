 <p>Chapter 809: Ulterior Motives!</p> 
 <p>“Haven’t found them yet?!”</p> 
 <p>Darting through the Windless Zone, Zhu Wuxin’s expression was extremely gloomy. His entire Devil Forest force was deployed yet they had lost their target! This kind of situation would normally be nothing important, but this time behind them was a group of loners wanting to fish in troubled waters. He could not afford to lose face in front of them.</p> 
 <p>“The search squad is doing their best. Their other party’s route has been very straightforward. It should not take long,” replied the vice captain, who had been acting as the think tank conscientiously but really did not know what to tell Zhu Wuxin at this time.</p> 
 <p>Looking at the vice captain, Zhu Wuxin thought for a moment and uttered, “You take charge from here.”</p> 
 <p>The vice captain could not believe his ears. <em>He’s finally calmed down?</em></p> 
 <p>“Captain, then you…” he asked nervously, still not daring to believe it.</p> 
 <p>“The collective goal is too big. I intend to lead a group of elites. No matter what, we must regain the face we’ve lost before!” Zhu Wuxin said coldly, completely different from the hysterical state he was in before. After all, he who could be the head of a big mercenary group was able to adjust his mind and attitude to its supposed position at critical moments.</p> 
 <p>“Rest assured, captain!” The vice captain was excited to see Zhu Wuxin had centered himself. There was nothing better than this news.</p> 
 <p>“How can I not be assured when handling it to you?” With a rare smile, Zhu Wuxin took seven people with him and left, leaving the rest to the vice captain.</p> 
 <p>“First Brigade, be on your utmost alert, don’t let the people behind scheme against us. Third and Fifth Brigade, pay attention and arrange the battlefield right after the search squad complete their mission. Second and Fourth Brigade, prepare your strongest attack. Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Brigade, you are on standby, be ready to replace the others at any time. Sixth Brigade, be ready for rescue.”</p> 
 <p>After the vice captain took over with a series of orders, the Devil Forest group, who had been moving like a rusty machine, instantly resurrected and quickly took action.</p> 
 <p>Their change was naturally noticed by the loners behind. They immediately became nervous. A sleeping lion was not scary, but it would be another matter once it woke up!</p> 
 <p><em>It won’t be so easy to fish in these troubled waters!</em></p> 
 <p>However, despite their worries, people still would risk their lives for benefits. This kind of situation was not enough to scare away the greedy. At best, it only made them more careful, the demonstration being the loners leaving the control range of Devil Forest…</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, another group of people was also moving. Unlike the confused others, this group had a clear goal and soon arrived at their destination. When they took off their hoods, familiar faces were revealed.</p> 
 <p>“I’m afraid we’re doing exactly what that boy wishes.” Sikong Ming laughed, there was no worry in his tone at all.</p> 
 <p>“He thinks he has everything under control, but isn't chaos what we also want? I even think this mess is not big enough,” said the middle-aged man, who had previously acted disdainfully back in Unify Business. The full set of puppets on his body would easily remind people of his name – Ruthless Dragon, Chen!</p> 
 <p>Besides this resounding title, Chen had another identity spurned by the whole continent: a Deep Night assassin of Shadow Death!</p> 
 <p>The killers of Shadow Death were divided into five levels from low to high: Obsidian, Shadow, Slaughter, Deep Night, and Blood Song. Back during Starnet’s grand celebration, all the Grandmaster Rank branch masters Bai Xiaofei had seen were Shadow Rank, but their identity was not something normal people could grasp.</p> 
 <p>Shadow Death was a place of strict social ranking. Without a good background, even a Deep Night assassin would not be able to become a branch master!</p> 
 <p>“Cut the crap and hurry. It won’t be good if that boy Zhao Ji does something out of desperation and affects the growth of the mother worm!” urged the impatient Bony Dragon, who Sikong Ming had called ‘Elder Bone.’</p> 
 <p>“You guys step back, just leave it to me.” The speaker was Mister Mirror, who was also a Deep Night assassin.</p> 
 <p>Having said that, Mister Mirror stepped forward. A unique fluctuation spread from him and the ground began to shake, revealing channels that led underground. Just like that, in less than ten seconds, all the retreat routes of the All-Round Merchant group’s underground base were wide open, and it was not the end. After Mister Mirror opened the channels, the remaining two people – Sun Shadow and Moon Trace – stood up. Under their joint efforts, all the channels were marked by dazzling lights that attracted all the people who were aimlessly wandering around in the Windless Zone!</p> 
 <p>In other words, they had done this to show the way for all those who wanted to find the All-Around Merchant Group’s base!</p> 
 <p>“Now that we’ve done our part, let’s enjoy the show.” Sikong Ming smiled with a hint of expectation. As long as it went smoothly, the next branch master of the Dark Wolf branch would be him!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, in a small space several hundred meters underground, Zhao Ji, the president of the All-Around Merchant Group, slowly opened his eyes and a sneer climbed onto his face. “Shadow Death, I was right to never think highly of you. You really think that I would wholeheartedly act as your puppet after what happened to the Globe Merchant Group?”</p> 
 <p>Zhao Ji set his eyes on the blood pool in front of him and conveniently the appearance of the whole space came into view.</p> 
 <p>In mid-air was a huge worm cocoon, where the blood in the pool kept flowing up into. With the constant absorption of blood, the worm cocoon beat like a heart as it emitted an uncanny aura.</p> 
 <p>“Hurry and grow up, my child! As long as I have you, this continent can only dance in the palm of my hand!!”<br> …</p> 
 <p>“What were the tremors just now?!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s group, who was still traveling through the land of bones, all felt the vibrations from Mister Mirror’s actions.</p> 
 <p>“Channels. The one we entered from is not the only channel here. All the channels have just been opened. Although I don't know who it is, they seem to be targeting the All-Around Merchant Group!” Tan Xin solemnly informed everyone of the situation she ‘saw.’</p> 
 <p>This kind of change was not within their plans!</p>
