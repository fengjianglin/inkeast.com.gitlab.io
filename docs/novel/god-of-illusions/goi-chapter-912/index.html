 <p>Chapter 912: Shadow Death’s Real Purpose!</p> 
 <p>“What are you here for?! The plan has failed! After the whole army was wiped out, our cooperation ended!” coldly said the puppetsmith clad in a black robe, no longer wanting to see the people of Shadow Death again now that his purpose had been achieved.</p> 
 <p>“Is it your first day knowing us Shadow Death? Ended? Who told you we cooperated for that stupid prince? Don’t tell me you did it for him? Or did you think we did it for him?” retorted the Shadow Death person.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the puppetsmith was dumbstruck. But it was just the beginning. What came next threw him into despair.</p> 
 <p>“Don't think we didn’t know that you were deliberately slowing down the progress. We just let it slide because it has no effect on our plan. Now that your goal has been achieved, our goal has also been achieved. Now, you have two options.”</p> 
 <p>As the man said, the puppetsmith thought Shadow Death to be too simple. They were not a mere killer group. No matter what they did, it only evolved around one core value: benefit the organization!</p> 
 <p>No one knew what Shadow Death’s ultimate goal was, but clearly, it was causing trouble all over the world for a purpose!</p> 
 <p>“This is my last concession!” said the puppetsmith aloofly.</p> 
 <p>However, his threat sounded quite ridiculous to the Shadow Death person. The puppetsmith had to mind his identity, while Shadow Death had no scruples.</p> 
 <p>“Either you hand over the core technology and help us build the puppet core we want, or we will take away what you have already built,” said the Shadow Death person.</p> 
 <p>Despite having guessed this, the puppetsmith still tensed up. He, in fact, had no choice at all. “The first one!”</p> 
 <p>“In that case, you will stay in this place. We’ll have the things you need sent here,” the Shadow Death person concluded.</p> 
 <p>The puppetsmith immediately panicked. “That’s impossible! Building that thing requires extremely high-temperature flames that only the Holy Puppetsmith Mountain has. Moreover, if I leave for a long time, I will definitely be discovered!”</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, all of that had been considered.</p> 
 <p>“We will deal with the flame problem and find someone to disguise as you. By the way, we are also monitoring your baby. If you are dishonest, we will let you know the consequences right away.”</p> 
 <p>The threat made the puppetsmith tremble in anger, but he couldn't say a word.</p> 
 <p>“Quickly get here, don't use this puppet to delay our time. Since we know your weakness, we already know who you are. And don't play any tricks, our people are already watching you. You do anything wrong and they’ll act!”</p> 
 <p>This time, the puppetsmith was completely desperate. He took out the last thing he could rely on. “If you don't keep your word, I swear the puppet core will be useless even if you get your hands on it!”</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, we Shadow Death are people of our word,” said the Shadow Death group leader before bursting out laughing.</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei had only emerged from an ocean of data sent by Ling He two weeks ago.</p> 
 <p>At the moment, he dared to say that his knowledge on the senior smiths of the Holy Puppetsmith Mountain was second to none!</p> 
 <p>“How is it? Found any clues?” Ni Xue came in carrying a tray of steaming dishes.</p> 
 <p>“I’d be condemned by Heaven if I don't marry you!” After giving Ni Xue a hug, Bai Xiaofei ignored her snort and began to enjoy the food.</p> 
 <p>“I’m being serious. Have you found a target after researching for so many days?” Ni Xue asked again.</p> 
 <p>“Your man is a godly genius, of course he has found something!” Bai Xiaofei's lips curled up.</p> 
 <p>During the past two weeks of Bai Xiaofei’s closed-door research, Ling Yue outside had turned his deeds into various stories and had people spread them. Finally, the title ‘God of Illusions’ was crowned upon Bai Xiaofei, which reached his ears and made him unusually satisfied.</p> 
 <p>Although he was no longer capable of such a legendary deed.</p> 
 <p>After all, he had consumed everything he had gained from the Holy Puppetsmith Mountain’s formation core, while Ling Yue was not going to compensate him…</p> 
 <p>Thinking of this, Bai Xiaofei’s heart ached. <em>That title is paid for!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Really?! Who is it?!” asked Ni Xue excitedly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei looked embarrassed.</p> 
 <p>“I only said that I found something, not the target. From my deduction, there are more than 200 qualified targets, and even after narrowing down, there are still more than 30 people. Further investigation requires checking them one by one.” He sighed at the huge workload.</p> 
 <p>“So, you’ll have to stay here for quite a while!” Ni Xue said, looking happy and troubled at the same time.</p> 
 <p>“Why? Are you fed up with me?” asked Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Ni Xue hurriedly fixed her expression and threatened, “If you say that again, I will go and you’ll never find me again!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately chickened out. “Alright, I won’t. But from now on, you are not allowed to leave my side for a moment!” When saying the second sentence, he looked serious.</p> 
 <p>“Lil’ Sis Xin’er won’t agree.” Ni Xue shifted the topic to a person who had been giving Bai Xiaofei a big headache.</p> 
 <p>During the recent period, Tan Xin had been… super tricky!</p>
