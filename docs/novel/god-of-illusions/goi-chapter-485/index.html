 <p>Chapter 485: The Third Ability of Devouring the Heaven and Earth!</p> 
 <p>Qin Lingyan’s coming-of-age ceremony was set a month later. Since the freshmen hadn’t arrived yet and the Student Community could operate by itself, Bai Xiaofei enjoyed a rare intermission.</p> 
 <p>However, during this period, Bai Xiaofei was going to do something big – Choosing his third puppet!</p> 
 <p>His wonderful, unexpected meeting with Nie Qing not only propelled Bai Xiaofei to the peak of the Master Rank but also qualified him to link a third puppet. Bai Xiaofei had already considered this back in Ancient Yue, but the conditions there were too poor. There was no decent puppet suitable for him there.</p> 
 <p>With no choice, he had to put it off until he returned to Starnet.</p> 
 <p>The Ethereal Pavilion’s investment in Starnet was no less than that in any great empire. After all, the academy was a genius camp with the highest demand for high-level puppets. What’s more, most people here could afford the sky-high prices that came with them.</p> 
 <p>This time, Bai Xiaofei didn’t have Feng Wuhen to give him advice, but he had an even better mentor – Gu Xing!</p> 
 <p>In order not to cause any unnecessary panic, Bai Xiaofei turned into a night owl, and under the cover of the night, he snuck into God Amongst Men.</p> 
 <p>This thief-like feeling drew a bitter smile from his face. This must be the dilemma of celebrities…</p> 
 <p>“Welcome…”</p> 
 <p>Gu Xing hadn’t finished his procedural welcome when he realized that it was Bai Xiaofei and simply swallowed the rest of the long speech.</p> 
 <p>“You have come? How’s it? Do you like the Spiritualization Art?” said Gu Xing with a faint smile. Their relationship similar to that of teacher and student had made them a lot closer.</p> 
 <p>“It’s great! But the cooldown is a bit long and there’s little room for improvement,” Bai Xiaofei said without holding back. Gu Xing nodded.</p> 
 <p>“This problem can’t be avoided. Otherwise, the Spiritualization Art won’t be so unnoticed. However, if the grade of the puppet is high enough, the cooldown can be shortened. The shortest won’t be less than three days, though, and that’s using violetgold puppets,” explained Gu Xing.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s eyes lit up. Compared with seven days, three was obviously much more acceptable. And as long as there were enough puppets, it wouldn't be impossible to maintain combat effectiveness for three days in a row!</p> 
 <p>Moreover, according to Revelation, the number of puppets wasn’t a problem for Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p>“Does it mean that as long as I upgrade all of my puppets to violetgold, my Spiritualization Art will rise to a new level?” asked Bai Xiaofei excitedly, but Gu Xing only smiled faintly.</p> 
 <p>“You think it’s so easy to upgrade a puppet to violetgold? Even during the peak period of mankind decades ago, violetgold puppets were still precious goods, let alone now,” Gu Xing said with a sigh. Humankind’s average strength could be described as declining. The catastrophe over 30 years ago was a great blow to them.</p> 
 <p>“At least there is hope, isn’t there?” Bai Xiaofei said, his face full of confidence.</p> 
 <p>“Then I’ll look forward to your good news!” Gu Xing laughed and didn’t belittle Bai Xiaofei’s confidence. In fact, he even had some expectations.</p> 
 <p>As the second descendant of the Spiritualization Art, he wasn’t so hopeful to push this art to the peak like his master, but this didn’t affect his expectations for a day when this art would be known by everyone. And Bai Xiaofei was his only hope!</p> 
 <p>“I suppose you didn’t come just to chat this time,” Gu Xing got straight to the main topic.</p> 
 <p>“I want to link my third puppet, so I hope to get your guidance!” Bai Xiaofei wasn’t the shy type. Since Gu Xing asked, he wouldn’t beat around the bush.</p> 
 <p>“You asked the right person!” With a hint of eagerness that was out of place with his age, Gu Xing rubbed his hands.</p> 
 <p><em>Why are all the old-timers I know so shady…?</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei secretly wondered, but didn’t dare to voice it. With a serious expression, he stared at Gu Xing waiting for his advice.</p> 
 <p>“The Spiritualization Art can restore the puppet’s ability to a certain extent, and it’s not limited to only animate but also inanimate puppets! So, I only have two pieces of advice for you,” Gu Xing paused a little before continuing.</p> 
 <p>“One: if there is no animate puppet to choose from, the inanimate puppet must be related to a magical beast. Even if others think it’s useless, it must radiate infinite brilliance in your hands. Two: it is best if it has the ability to fly.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was confused at this.</p> 
 <p>“Flying ability? Isn’t that kind of puppet generally considered for the 5th slot? Not to mention that I already have no fighting ability in the early stage. If I choose flying, wouldn’t I make no progress then?” Bai Xiaofei voiced his concern. He didn’t want to ever again experience what had happened in Ancient Yue.</p> 
 <p>“Not necessarily. You told me you also practice Devouring the Heaven and Earth aside from the Spiritualization Art and your physical quality is also far better than that of ordinary people,” Gu Xing slowly explained.</p> 
 <p>“What are you getting at?” Bai Xiaofei still didn’t understand, but he could feel that he had missed something big.</p> 
 <p>“You know, for practitioners of the Spiritualization Art, the best technique to incorporate into it is Devouring the Heaven and Earth. Unfortunately, I couldn’t do it back in my time, so you don’t know how excited I was when you said you had it. I just didn’t show it. If I’m right, you have only learned transformation and self-cannibalism from that technique.”</p> 
 <p>There was a profound smile on Gu Xing’s face. Bai Xiaofei inwardly panicked.</p> 
 <p>“Is there more to it?” Bai Xiaofei was in disbelief. His Fourth Father had promised time and time again that he had taught him everything about Devouring the Heaven and Earth technique. But now it seemed this wasn’t the case.</p> 
 <p>He was used to being fooled in the Gorge of Heroes, but he didn’t expect to be fooled by his honest-looking Fourth Father on such an important thing…</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei vowed that when he returned to the Gorge of Heroes, he would definitely settle this account with Fourth Father!</p> 
 <p>“Of course! Why else do you think my master was so crazy about learning Devouring the Heaven and Earth?” Gu Xing nonchalantly said.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei gulped.</p> 
 <p>“And… what is that?” he slowly asked in expectation.</p> 
 <p>“There is also the unstoppable Endless State!”</p>
