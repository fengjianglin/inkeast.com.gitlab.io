 <p>Chapter 341: Far From Over!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s group wiped out the army of Ground Dragons in less than ten minutes, and the most time-consuming part of it was Uncle Feng handling the second King Rank. The rest were basically instant kills.</p> 
 <p>Sometimes, if one dared to start on something, it’d turn out NOT as difficult as they had thought!</p> 
 <p>After collecting five magic cores as well as a lot of high-rank materials from the Ground Dragons’ bodies, the group immediately moved on, ecstasy written all over their faces. This great victory was a pleasing experience for them.</p> 
 <p>When the group finally stopped, they had already left Yelu’s territory. As for whether the opponent would dare to chase after them, that was what Yelu should consider. However, by the time he knew that his Ground Dragon army had been annihilated, it would have been too late anyway.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, are we going to keep this up?” Xing looked expectantly at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>He had been in a good mood after that triple kill. In fact, it would have been no problem if the two Ground Dragon killed by Hu Xian’er had been left to him either, only that he might not be able to guarantee to do it so cleanly that they wouldn’t be able to send out any news.</p> 
 <p>“Take a guess.” There was no direct answer to Xing’s question. Bai Xiaofei only gave a sentence that he thought to be very profound, causing everyone to be slightly stunned.</p> 
 <p><em>It definitely won’t end just like this!</em></p> 
 <p>“But if we continue to ambush Yelu’s underlings, we may alert him…” Uncle Feng expressed his worries. An Emperor Rank was entirely different from the Monarch Rank. Hu Xian’er and Xing could insta-kill a Monarch Rank beast, but this could only be their wildest dreams if they faced an Emperor Rank.</p> 
 <p>In fact, Hu Xian’er’s path had been so smooth only because none of the enemies she had encountered was good at speed. If one’s speed reached a certain height, it was possible to counter her Permanence!</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, we won’t provoke Yelu. The price of the two Monarch Rank magical beasts is already high enough. It is not too much to say that we have earned it back with profit.”</p> 
 <p>Upon Bai Xiaofei’s reply, everyone else, who should be at ease by this, actually felt a hint of loss. However, Bai Xiaofei soon erased this loss with his next sentence.</p> 
 <p>“But we can help Yelu find some trouble!”</p> 
 <p>As soon as the words dropped, everyone’s eyes shone brilliantly, especially Xing the combat lover. Unless someone could curb him with absolute brutality, he would definitely continue in that condition.</p> 
 <p>“How?” Uncle Feng remained calm as usual, but what had changed was his approval of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>If Bai Xiaofei put forward a plan now, he would definitely not oppose it anymore. At the same time, he also understood why Hu Xian’er was attracted to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei did have this qualification! He also had something necessary for the revival of the fox clan that was rare among the magical beasts – Knowledge from human society!</p> 
 <p><em>Cough</em>, in fact, it would be more appropriate to use ‘evil ideas’ instead…</p> 
 <p>“If I remember correctly, the fox clan has a big enemy in the Infinite Mountain Range? Moreover, it seems that his territory is quite close to Yelu’s?”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Hu Xian’er and Uncle Feng heard this, their faces were instantly heavy with fury! Their clear desire to drink the blood and eat the flesh of the enemy already explained their current state of mind. If Bai Xiaofei was going to scheme against Kuang Ta, they certainly would not hesitate, even if it meant dying!</p> 
 <p>“If you two can’t control your emotions, we should cancel our plan here.” Just as Hu Xian’er and Uncle Feng were about to erupt, Bai Xiaofei poured a pot of cold water onto both.</p> 
 <p>And the pot of cold water was indeed useful. The two were immediately jolted back to their senses. Uncle Feng even looked at Bai Xiaofei with shame in his eyes. Having lived for hundreds of years, he actually had to be educated by a teenager.</p> 
 <p>“Xiaoluo, Xiaobu, go catch some Roar Boars. We’ll have a meal first, letting our two fighting bosses adjust themselves while we’re at it.” Bai Xiaofei said quietly, having no intention of disclosing the plan.</p> 
 <p>Still ashamed, Uncle Feng and Hu Xian’er didn’t dare to ask. They believed that Bai Xiaofei wasn’t just trying to scare them. If they continued to be so emotional, he would definitely turn and leave immediately.</p> 
 <p>Xiaoluo and Xiaobu acted very quickly. Before long, they had already dragged back five huge Roar Boars out of the ground.</p> 
 <p>Although Bai Xiaofei seldom cooked, he was still a ‘savage’ who had lived in the Infinite Mountain Range for a month. This kind of work didn’t pose any trouble.</p> 
 <p>After all, besides him, Hu Xian’er was the only one with the capability for such work among the rest, and he couldn’t ask her who was still musing about life to do such a thing…</p> 
 <p>From slitting the belly to cleaning to the final step of seasoning the skewered meat, Bai Xiaofei did it smoothly and cleanly. Although the final product wasn’t very good-looking, the fragrance they emanated stirred the appetite of the present magical beasts.</p> 
 <p>In less than 30 minutes, the five Roar Boars had become a pile of skeletons as a result of the group’s satisfying meal. During this, Bai Xiaofei had once again shocked everyone.</p> 
 <p><em>Is this one really human?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Can humans really eat so much?!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was already accustomed to this kind of reaction, although he was barely full yet…</p> 
 <p>“Well, if you guys haven’t calmed down yet, I might as well go back now. There is something still waiting for me back in Starnet,” stated Bai Xiaofei calmly.</p> 
 <p>At this, everyone directed their gaze at Hu Xian’er and Uncle Feng. What they would do next all depended on a sentence from those two.</p> 
 <p>“I’m all right, I’ll definitely control myself!” Hu Xian’er was first to speak, her eyes glowing with determination.</p> 
 <p>“I am old, but I can still obey orders.” Uncle Feng no longer considered his face, this really wasn’t a time to insist on his seniority.</p> 
 <p>“Then we will continue!” declared Bai Xiaofei with a slight smile, causing everyone to raise their spirits and wait for him to continue. “Uncle Feng, is there any kind of beast at the Monarch Rank in Kuang Ta’s territory that is weak against Ground Dragons?”</p> 
 <p>Uncle Feng’s eyes suddenly lit up. He could roughly guess what Bai Xiaofei was going to do and began to search for useful information in his head.</p> 
 <p>“Yes!”</p> 
 <p>Uttering a confirmation in exhilaration, Uncle Feng earned a firm look from Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Then, let us go there!”</p> 
 <p>With their goal finalized, the small team continued on their journey. Even the gradually falling veil of night couldn’t stop their footsteps…</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the second public performance in Starnet had entered the preparation stage.</p> 
 <p>“Has Bai Xiaofei not returned yet?” Yun Jingshuang frowned.</p> 
 <p>The person he had asked – Fang Ye – reluctantly shook his head.</p> 
 <p>“Then leave him alone. Qianye, go on as planned, just don’t mention Bai Xiaofei.” After saying that to Han Qianye, Yun Jingshuang looked at Fang Ye again. “If anyone looks for Bai Xiaofei, tell them he has been called away by me and won’t be able to get away for a while. The rest will be as usual!”</p> 
 <p>After arranging everything, Yun Jingshuang sighed and looked up at the gloomy night sky.</p> 
 <p>“That fellow must be up to some huge, shady thing again!”</p>
