 <p>Chapter 823: Invisible Game!</p> 
 <p>Underground, Wang Hang and Wang Chuan were leaving while carrying the badly injured Hu Xian’er. Upon reaching the third floor, Wang Hang sensed something wrong.</p> 
 <p>“Who’s there?!” He had been having the feeling that someone was following them, but he could not be sure.</p> 
 <p>According to the situation, the All-Around people should have been all dead, Unify Business and Shadow Death were engaging each other and no experts should be able to roam freely around, while Devil Forest and Windlove loners had long disappeared along with the Blood Diamonds in the warehouse.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, Wang Hang thought that he was just too nervous, but just now, he was finally certain that it was not an illusion!</p> 
 <p>The Ghosting shot out from his body and attacked, forcing a person out of the shadows.</p> 
 <p>“Oh hey, I didn’t think you’d discover me.” A familiar face was slowly revealed from the dark.</p> 
 <p>Wang Hang could never have expected that this person was alive until now.</p> 
 <p>Tong Fei!</p> 
 <p>“You’re tired of living?” Wang Hang stared at Tong Fei, murderous intent pouring out from his eyes. Tong Fei’s rank was so low that the guy would not even survive one round against him, but for some reason, Wang Hang had a feeling that he could not just recklessly start a fight.</p> 
 <p>“No, no, no. Not only do I want to live, but I also want to live a very long good life, and therefore I’m here.” Tong Fei’s lips curled up.</p> 
 <p>The eerie feel that Tong Fei gave off was completely different from what Wang Hang knew before.</p> 
 <p>“Finding me unfamiliar?” said Tong Fei as he noticed Wang Hang’s doubts, and then started mumbling. “Since we just happen to have time, let me tell you about it.”</p> 
 <p>“Sorry, I don’t have the time!” Wang Hang interrupted and shot Wang Chuan a glance, intending to give Hu Xian’er to him, but the instant he wanted to act, he abruptly stopped.</p> 
 <p>Wang Chuan… seemed different!</p> 
 <p>“Ooh, good response, you actually saw through this too,” Tong Fei said and waved his hand. Wang Chuan, whose eyes had turned dull and aura completely changed, walked past Wang Hang to him.</p> 
 <p>“What did you do to Wang Chuan?!” Wang Hang glared at Tong Fei, his jaw clenched as if he wanted to eat the latter alive.</p> 
 <p>Wang Hang refused to believe that Wang Chuan had only been pretending from the beginning. Both he and Bai Xiaofei knew this for certain, otherwise, Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t have put in so much effort to train Wang Chuan.</p> 
 <p>“I only turned him into my puppet. Having said that, I need to thank you for making my puppet so perfect! Hahaha!!!” Tong Fei laughed hysterically.</p> 
 <p>Wang Hang just wanted to stomp on the man’s smug expression, but he was in a hurry. He was worried about Hu Xian’er’s condition, but he had no way to quickly escape the immortal Wang Chuan.</p> 
 <p>Right at this time, a voice rang out directly in Wang Hang’s ears.</p> 
 <p>Stunned for a brief second, Wang Hang quickly controlled his expression, then looked at the bragging Tong Fei. <em>You bastard really needs a good beating! Heh, but you can’t dance around much longer!</em></p> 
 <p>“Since I can’t just leave, I’m actually quite curious about you. As you said, the feeling you give me now makes it feel like the Tong Fei I knew before was a fake,” Wang Hang spoke slowly, his tone no longer anxious.</p> 
 <p>“You want to die a clear death now?” Tong Fei stopped laughing and taunted, then swung his hand.</p> 
 <p>Wang Chuan woodenly moved a huge rock over for him to sit down.</p> 
 <p>“As early as when I planned to develop the Blood Diamond business, I anticipated that I would be targeted by others. After all, there is no absolute secret in this world. Indeed, one escaped, and his ability was so special that I had no way to bring him back.”</p> 
 <p>“However, I located him in your academy, and so I collected all the recent information about Starnet. Your class naturally came into my sights, especially that boy Bai Xiaofei. After carefully studying him, I decided to play with him a little, thus there was that Tong Fei you saw. I found our acting competition quite interesting, in fact. That Bai Xiaofei must have thought I was only an ordinary pawn in the command chain.”</p> 
 <p>Tong Fei grew prouder as he spoke, each sentence accompanied by a disdainful sneer. He ended his narrative with a comment, “So, your so-called Illusion Stream miracle is but just a greenhorn.”</p> 
 <p>“Oh, so we have been dancing in the palm of your hand, huh? What about Unify Business and Shadow Death? Your people were all massacred, and I’m sure your base will be gone soon,” Wang Hang provoked.</p> 
 <p>However, Tong Fei had no plan to disclose more. “That’s not something you deserve to know. After all, who knows if you have an ability to remotely send messages. Just go on your road to hell!” He waved his hand.</p> 
 <p>Wang Chuan charged toward Wang Hang. The Dark Descent King’s ability locked on the latter and fixed him in place. However, space suddenly stilled at that moment!</p> 
 <p>Permanence!</p> 
 <p>With the tip of her toes slightly tapping on Wang Chuan’s forehead, Hu Xian’er leaped at Tong Fei and tore him apart with her claws.</p> 
 <p>When Permanence was over, Wang Chuan and Wang Hang collided and Tong Fei was dead. Hu Xian’er just quietly and coldly watched.</p> 
 <p>“What guts you have to bad-mouth my man. Enjoy your walk to hell.” She snorted, then walked to Wang Hang and Wang Chuan.</p> 
 <p>Wang Chuan had escaped the state of being controlled. It was not because of Tong Fei’s death, but because of Wang Chuan’s puppet.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei once asked Golden Feather to do a meticulous inspection of Wang Chuan’s body, and naturally discovered the puppet mark on him. Although they did not know who this mark came from, Bai Xiaofei decided to play it to his advantage.</p> 
 <p>To be predicted that he would buy Wang Chuan and train him, Bai Xiaofei felt like he was being deliberately targeted and challenged. Therefore, he especially found Wang Chuan a puppet that could restrain the puppet mark in him.</p> 
 <p>As for Hu Xian’er, her injury would have killed her if she was human, but she was not. The power of being a magical beast had restored her ability to act. She had wanted to continue to take part in the following actions, but Bai Xiaofei stopped her as he found it an excellent opportunity to end the game between him and that unknown enemy.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had made the right move. He won!</p>
