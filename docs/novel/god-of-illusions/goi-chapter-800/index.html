 <p>Chapter 800: Slave Market!</p> 
 <p>“Erm… Xian’er, as you can see, it doesn’t really have anything to do with me, does it?” Following Hu Xian’er, Bai Xiaofei the scaredy-cat finally squeezed out something after a long thought.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t tell me you didn’t have anything planned today,” Hu Xian’er coldly said.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was delighted. <em>Great! So I’m not being called out to be handled!</em></p> 
 <p>“How is it possible? Of course I do!” Bai Xiaofei then quickly told Hu Xian’er about the plan he thought out the previous night that had now become his life-saver.</p> 
 <p>“Then I’ll be the only one to accompany you today. That should be enough?” Hu Xian’er turned to look at Bai Xiaofei, her expression saying ‘If you refuse, I’ll strangle you to death!’</p> 
 <p>“Enough! Absolutely enough!” The desire for survival overtook Bai Xiaofei and saved his life.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, I hope we will gain something today.” Hu Xian’er came to Bai Xiaofei’s side and latched onto his arm just like when they were in Starnet.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, we definitely will!” Bai Xiaofei’s eyes lit up at the thought of the destination. No matter it was Unify Business or the All-Around Merchant Group, they were closely related to that place–</p> 
 <p>The slave market!</p> 
 <p>The slave market in Windlove was definitely the top on the continent. At least, it was impossible to find a bigger one in the Northern Border.</p> 
 <p>As soon as the two entered the slave market, they immediately felt its charm. There were shouting businessmen everywhere and far more customers than Bai Xiaofei had imagined. Nearly every store had its own features, such as humans, exotic races, magical beasts… Any existence found on the continent would be sold as slaves in this market!</p> 
 <p>“I warn you, don’t recklessly distribute your ‘kindness’ again!” Hu Xian’er warned Bai Xiaofei before they went deeper into the slave market. She did not care if he bought another group of beauties, but she was afraid there would be another Gu Lingyue.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry. Even if I have the heart to, I don’t have that much money!” Bai Xiaofei smiled wryly and then could not help a sigh. The auction had completely sucked him dry. The only thing he could do now was put on a rich-person act…</p> 
 <p>“Good that you know,” Hu Xian’er coldly said.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei wisely chose to keep his mouth shut. If he said anything to that, he’d be dead…</p> 
 <p>“Two distinguished guests! This must be your first time at the slave market, right?” A man with a goatee suddenly came up to them. He was obviously a crafty businessman from the expression on his face.</p> 
 <p>However, he was definitely the kind that Bai Xiaofei liked the most!</p> 
 <p>“How do you know we are ‘distinguished?’” Bai Xiaofei donned a curious smile.</p> 
 <p>“Who can be more qualified than someone who swept an entire auction?” The goatee man chuckled.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s heart tightened. <em>It’s over. Seems like my name has spread!</em></p> 
 <p>With no energy supporting him, Bai Xiaofei had been unable to maintain his disguise and was currently using his true face. Although it was within his expectation to be known, he did not think news would spread so fast in this city.</p> 
 <p>“If so, you should know that I have no interest in ordinary things.” Although being notorious was not a good thing, Bai Xiaofei could at least make good use of his lingering might.</p> 
 <p>“Rest assured, Boss. I dare not say the same about anything else, but my slaves will never let you down!” The goatee man made an inviting gesture.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei and Hu Xian’er followed him into the market all the way to a small yard. Inside, the waiters came and went busily, their faces beaming.</p> 
 <p>Being busy meant their business was thriving, and a thriving business meant two things: Reputation and power!</p> 
 <p>“Please take a seat. What kind of slaves are you looking for, may I ask?” asked the goatee man respectfully as he poured tea for the two guests.</p> 
 <p>“High-quality slaves have already been sent to be auctioned, so this time I want not quality, but quantity.” Bai Xiaofei sipped his tea.</p> 
 <p>The goatee man, who was ready for a big order, froze. “Boss, you may have come at a bad time.” He smiled bitterly with a hint of disappointment.</p> 
 <p>“Why? Didn’t you say you would not let me down? Or you just don’t want to do business with me?” Bai Xiaofei sneered, showing signs of anger.</p> 
 <p>When the king is angry, there will be thousands of miles of corpses!</p> 
 <p>The news that Bai Xiaofei smashed Dragon King to death was spread with his appearance. The goatee man did not dare to anger him.</p> 
 <p>“No, no, no! That’s absolutely not the case! It’s just that we have signed a contract with someone else to supply them with slaves over a long course of time. We regularly provide them with a large number of slaves every month, so… “</p> 
 <p>“That means I can only check out other places,” Bai Xiaofei interrupted the man and stood up from his seat.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, it’s not just our place. As far as I know, all the slave suppliers here have basically signed the same contract. They want an extremely large quantity!” the man explained.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was inwardly delighted with the information and the obvious meaning behind it.</p> 
 <p>“Such a big move? Who is that? Can I talk to their people? I also really need a lot of slaves!” Bai Xiaofei put on a frown.</p> 
 <p>However, the goatee man suddenly became wary. “You’re joking, Boss. I can’t decide something like that, and as far as I know, your group doesn’t need a lot of slaves as students.”</p> 
 <p>The goatee man’s probe was completely within Bai Xiaofei’s expectation. He had already prepared the answer.</p> 
 <p>“I can’t spend my whole life in Starnet. I’ve already thought about the development after graduation, otherwise, where do you think my money came from? One man cannot do anything, and buying slaves is my best option,” Bai Xiaofei explained slowly. The man listened with suspicion.</p> 
 <p>“If you want a large number of slaves, it’s actually not impossible. For some reason, the previous buyer delayed their demand for slaves this month. Therefore, almost all of us have a large backlog.” The man kept a close eye on Bai Xiaofei for his reaction but did not get the information he wanted.</p> 
 <p>“It seems your buyer is not very capable. Since they’ve defaulted on the contract first, you won’t be wrong to sell to me. How about I help you consume those slaves?” Bai Xiaofei laughed joyously.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, but you will have to wait. According to the agreement, they can postpone for half a month at most. There are only six days left,” after some hesitation, the man finally gave Bai Xiaofei the answer he wanted.</p> 
 <p><em>Six days, huh?</em></p>
