 <p>Chapter 795: New Goals!</p> 
 <p>“What is this place?”</p> 
 <p>In a dark space where he was the only light source, Bai Xiaofei looked around suspiciously. Although he didn’t know what was going on, the depressing energy surrounding him made him really uncomfortable.</p> 
 <p>“This is the blind corner of your consciousness, the darkest place in your heart.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s question was answered, but the voice made his hair stand on end.</p> 
 <p><em>This voice is… the demon king?!</em></p> 
 <p>“You got it right, it’s me! Hahahaha!”</p> 
 <p>Along with hysterical laughter, a face composed entirely of black fog slowly appeared. The originally anxious Bai Xiaofei magically calmed down upon seeing the entity in front of him. It was composed of pure energy and without any spiritual fluctuation, and its mind was only a broken piece of consciousness.</p> 
 <p>In other words, the demon king he was seeing could only be regarded as a talking robot.</p> 
 <p>“Tch! And here I thought I was possessed. Who could have thought, huh? You are actually so miserable!” Bai Xiaofei retorted with sarcasm.</p> 
 <p>The smoke face revealed a complicated expression. He did not expect the boy to see through him so quickly!</p> 
 <p>“That’s right, I already noticed that very quickly.” Bai Xiaofei smiled. It was not mind reading, but confident speculation.</p> 
 <p>“Brat, it’s too early to be happy. If you can’t leave this place, you’re no different from a zombie. My strength is not so easy to absorb! If I guessed correctly, your body should be killing outside. It’s very likely that you’ve killed those who are close to you!”</p> 
 <p>Like Bai Xiaofei, the demon king had been crouching in this consciousness corner, unaware of what was happening in the outside world. Therefore, he had no idea that Bai Xiaofei was lying on the ground like a dead pig…</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei did not know this either!</p> 
 <p>“Heh, don’t try to scare me. I did not grow this big from fear!” Bai Xiaofei appeared full of contempt, but his heart had leaped to this throat. This was not the first time he had been trapped in his sea of consciousness, but it was definitely the most uncanny one. Moreover, he could feel that the energy around belonged to the demon king, so what the latter said was not necessarily false.</p> 
 <p>“You know it, deep down. Yes, I have no control over you, but can you get out of here? If you don’t leave this place, your body won’t be under your control, and my energy itself is an assembly of killing and rage. What do you think you’re doing outside?” The demon king’s taunts end up being a quite convincing explanation.</p> 
 <p>“My body belongs to me! Just you wait, this lord will definitely find a way out!” Bai Xiaofei shouted angrily, but he froze after recalling something.</p> 
 <p>He had been trapped in his own consciousness many times, but was he able to leave on his own even just once?</p> 
 <p><em>Ugh, just whose sea of consciousness is this?!!</em></p> 
 <p>Despite his declaration, Bai Xiaofei scratched his head for half a day without finding a way out. When the demon king was ready to ridicule him, however, a light appeared.</p> 
 <p>“Hehehe, sorry, my teammates are too amazing. I’m leaving!”</p> 
 <p>With a sleazy laugh, Bai Xiaofei seized the opportunity and entered the light. Before long, the light flashed and he found himself in the space of his consciousness that he was familiar with. This time, there was another person inside who looked somewhat familiar but he could not remember who she was.</p> 
 <p>Moreover, she seemed a little weak…</p> 
 <p>“It’s good that you came out. Or else, there’s nothing more I can do. Everyone outside is…”</p> 
 <p>Before the girl could finish her words, her spirit dissipated from Bai Xiaofei’s sea of consciousness. Obviously, just as she said, she had really tried her best.</p> 
 <p>Returning to his senses, Bai Xiaofei hurriedly used his consciousness to check his body, and then… was stupefied!</p> 
 <p><em>Did something run over me? Why is my body in such a wretched state?!!</em></p> 
 <p>As severe pain hit his nerves, Bai Xiaofei, who had just opened his eyes, fainted.</p> 
 <p>“Did his eyes just…?” asked an anxious Lin Li.</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er, who was supporting the Paraselene girl who had also passed out, glanced over in doubt.</p> 
 <p>“Look!” Luo Han suddenly exclaimed with delight.</p> 
 <p>Then, everyone saw the demonic aura around Bai Xiaofei slowly retract. Before long, he returned to his original appearance. However, his original appearance was quite miserable… There was no uninjured area on his body, and inside, the fight between the energy of Thousand Star and his self-healing ability was still wreaking havoc.</p> 
 <p>Aware that her Thousand Star was preventing Bai Xiaofei’s recovery, Lin Li hurriedly pumped out the elemental energy of Thousand Star from his body.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Fang Ye and the others also finished cleaning up the battlefield. The ghosting was also brought over as the poor Dragon King died to Bai Xiaofei’s fist before he could tame it…</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go back.”</p> 
 <p>With Bai Xiaofei in a coma, Hu Xian’er assumed her imposing big-sister manner. The big team marched toward Windlove City.</p> 
 <p>On the other hand, Zhu Wuxin had fled the bamboo forest and brought the remaining members of Devil Forest back to their lair. Unlike Bai Xiaofei’s group who returned in triumph, they had failed to handle a few Starnet undergraduates despite gathering half of their elite. If this news got out, they might as well quit the mercenary world.</p> 
 <p>“Use all the Blood Diamonds we collected!” Zhu Wuxin gritted his teeth and announced a decision that shocked his people.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, we promised to distribute them according to contributions…”</p> 
 <p>“My orders are useless now?!” Zhu Wuxin coldly interrupted the vice captain, his ferocious expression fully demonstrating his mood.</p> 
 <p>“I’m going now!” The vice captain’s attitude took a U-turn and he withdrew from the room.</p> 
 <p>Seeing that even the vice captain took a loss, the rest naturally dare not say a word. They retreated one after another, leaving only Zhu Wuxin in the big room.</p> 
 <p>“My good sister! What a great ‘pulling the carpet from under’ tactic that you played! If you hadn’t taken away nearly the entire fund of our group, how could I end up where I am today?!!” His teeth creaking from gnashing too hard, Zhu Wuxin smashed the table into pieces with deep hatred for his so-called ‘sister.’</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, those who had just withdrawn from the room had started a discussion.</p> 
 <p>“Second Brother, was it wrong for us to force Big Sister away?” one of them asked dejectedly.</p> 
 <p>Upon his question, the atmosphere was filled with melancholy.</p> 
 <p>“Shut your mouth. No looking back, no regret is a rule for us mercenaries. Have you forgotten?!” the vice captain scolded.</p> 
 <p>Everyone fell silent.</p> 
 <p>However, the vice captain sighed in his heart. <em>Maybe… we were wrong…</em></p>
