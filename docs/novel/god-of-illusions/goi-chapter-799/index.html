 <p>Chapter 799: Gu Lingyue!</p> 
 <p>“Also, you will be my disciple and I will teach you everything I can. You will never be captured as a slave again.” Bai Xiaofei looked firmly at Wang Chuan.</p> 
 <p>Although Wang Chuan did not quite understand the meaning, he could feel Bai Xiaofei’s goodwill. He squeezed out a smile with difficulty and scratched his head. “Good, Master!” he candidly said.</p> 
 <p>Seeing him like that, Bai Xiaofei instinctively stroked his head. Wang Chuan’s reaction, shockingly, was a look of enjoyment…</p> 
 <p><em>He’s really like a magical beast!</em></p> 
 <p>Taking Wang Chuan as his disciple was a decision Bai Xiaofei only made after careful consideration. This was the most suitable identity he could think of for the boy, and he also believed that Wang Chuan, who had wild blood in his veins, would never betray him.</p> 
 <p>After settling Wang Chuan, Bai Xiao walked to the Ghosting. The latter’s body seemed to condense a little as it bowed its head to him.</p> 
 <p>Ghostings were a type of symbiotic magical beast whose way to survive was to depend on the strong, Since Bai Xiaofei killed Dragon King, the Ghosting deemed him to be the most suitable host.</p> 
 <p>“I’ve found you a suitable master. Believe me, he will not let you down,” Bai Xiaofei said.</p> 
 <p>The Ghosting fluctuated strangely.</p> 
 <p>“He said he’ll only recognize you,” Huskie interpreted.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be in a hurry to turn it down. When you see that person, you will know that he is much more suitable than me.”</p> 
 <p>Concluding the matter with the Ghosting, Bai Xiaofei went to the Paraselene girl. After some silence, Bai Xiaofei finally thought of a starting topic.</p> 
 <p>“Why didn’t you go with them?” With that question, Bai Xiaofei threw the responsibility to the Paraselene girl. To his surprise, however, the latter was not a pushover…</p> 
 <p>“Shouldn’t you ask my name first?” She tilted her head.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei instantly felt a chill along his spine as well as its sources – several pairs of cold eyes on his back. However, he could only go along!</p> 
 <p>“Alright, what’s your name?” He bit the bullet and asked, but instantly regretted it because he could guess her next sentence.</p> 
 <p>“Shouldn’t you say your name before asking for someone else’s?” the girl asked as if this was a matter of course.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei just wanted to slap his own mouth. <em>Damn it, this lord has been tricked!</em></p> 
 <p>“Starnet Academy, Bai Xiaofei!” Bai Xiaofei accepted his fate and ate the loss.</p> 
 <p>The Paraselene girl smiled. “Gu Lingyue.”</p> 
 <p>With the girl stating her name, Bai Xiaofei heaved a long sigh of relief. However, he immediately realized something was wrong. <em>Ughh! I was led astray!</em></p> 
 <p>“I stayed because I thought I would be more useful here. Most of them are going to be receptionists or something, right? Don’t you think it’s a waste to let a Paraselene descendant do this?” Gu Lingyue gazed at Bai Xiaofei as she finally answered his first question.</p> 
 <p>The whole hall tensed up at her words. <em>What does she mean?! Is it about her…</em></p> 
 <p>The sound of gulping echoed especially clear one after another. Bai Xiaofei’s brain had nearly shut down.</p> 
 <p>“Ahem… Our group is going to have a battle, while my current state…”</p> 
 <p>“It’s okay, I will not participate in the fight nor cause trouble. In any case, I have to stay. You bought me, and one of my few strong suits is that I’m willing to accept my fate. Since I’m your slave, you can’t easily drive me away.” Gu Lingyue’s attitude was clear and firm. Bai Xiaofei was rendered speechless.</p> 
 <p>However, it did not mean that someone else had nothing to say!</p> 
 <p>“You are playing with fire.” Hu Xian’er flew down from the second floor and landed between Bai Xiaofei and Gu Lingyue. Her ice-cold expression said it all.</p> 
 <p>She was angry!</p> 
 <p>Although she had said that she could tolerate Bai Xiaofei, her tolerance had a limit. If he continued to just take in everyone he saw, even she would not be able to stand it.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t think so. Moreover, although I pulled him out from his sea of consciousness, that demonic energy has not disappeared from his body. Are you sure that the next time he is possessed, you can find someone with the same ability as me?” Gu Lingye was a tough nut to crack not only for Bai Xiaofei. Her words immediately made Hu Xian’er hesitate.</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, they could not do anything when Bai Xiaofei was possessed, making the seemingly useless Gu Lingyue irreplaceable.</p> 
 <p>“So, there is no harm in me staying. Moreover, are you that unconfident in him?” Knowing why Hu Xian’er stood there, Gu Lingyue struck right at her weak point.</p> 
 <p>It was absolutely impossible to say that she was unconfident. However, saying otherwise meant that there was no reason for Gu Lingyue to leave. Leaving a determined person who had such a clear goal next to Bai Xiaofei, who could not panic?</p> 
 <p>“Aren’t you afraid that you’ll regret it one day?” Hu Xian’er stared at Gu Lingyue, her eyes threatening.</p> 
 <p>“A slave has no right to choose. I just hope that my master is a good person,” Gu Lingyue cleverly answered Hu Xian’er’s question and went straight to Bai Xiaofei. “I’m sorry, Master, I’ve upset the lady. I’ll pay attention in the future.” She stuck out her tongue, her playful manner completely different from that calm and wise girl just now!</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, everyone’s understanding of Gu Lingyue was refreshed. <em>Dang! This is also a big boss that we can’t provoke! Most people would be easily led around by her!</em></p> 
 <p>“Ahem, it’s good that you know. Fang Ye will arrange a place for you. I have something to do these days and won’t have time to take care of this stuff.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hurriedly distanced himself from the trouble, scared that the furious Hu Xian’er would include him. What’s more, she was not the only one who was upset!</p> 
 <p>“Yes, master, I won’t bother you!” Gu Lingyue snickered and stood beside Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Normally, there was only Rui Mengqi at this position, but now… both sides were taken!</p> 
 <p>“What are you looking at?! Don’t you have work to do?!” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly changed the topic for fear that the situation would continue to deteriorate.</p> 
 <p>The audience was jolted awake and quickly ran back to their rooms. If they remained, they might just become someone’s anger outlet!</p> 
 <p>“You come with me!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei wanted to run away as well. Unfortunately, a sentence from Hu Xian’er froze him on the spot.</p> 
 <p><em>Oh heaven! Just how are you gonna torture me?</em></p>
