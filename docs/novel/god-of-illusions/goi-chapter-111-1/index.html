<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei experienced both sorrow and joy during the few hours prior to lunch. With a beauty filled with joy and laughter by his side, it would’ve been hard for him to remain in a bad mood. At the same time, he couldn’t shake off the anxiety in his heart as he knew the consequences of this short joy. How could he not be anxious? The way things were going, any slight carelessness on his part would probably cost him his little buddy!</p>
 <p>Opposite him, Xue Ying was currently having some dessert. Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but fall into a slight reverie when he looked at her. Xue Ying was different from Hu Xian’er’s shocking beauty and allure. Instead, Xue Ying’s appeal was her unpredictability. Anticipation and novelty were the two sensations males found stimulating when the qualities were present in the opposite sex. Xue Ying allowed him to fully experience both of these sensations.</p>
 <p>“What are you looking at? Are there flowers on my face?”</p>
 <p>Xue Ying was acting somewhat shy, yet she still glared at Bai Xiaofei with a feigned anger. It resulted in the vivid image of a mischievous young lady.</p>
 <p>“There are no flowers. Though, you do look better than a flower.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had loosened up by now, resulting in his glib tongue resurfacing. With one sentence from him, a wide smile spread across Xue Ying’s face.</p>
 <p>“It’s a pity this place will be crowded soon. Otherwise, you could keep me company for a while longer…” Xue Ying said, a forlorn expression on her face.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. Didn’t you say there would be plenty of opportunities for us in the future?”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei felt like slapping himself the moment he finished his sentence. Saying that was no different from courting disaster for himself.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, you wish. How would you have this chance if it weren’t for my good mood today? You must have had a great time taking advantage of me, right?” she said with a light snort then pouted. Her expression made Bai Xiaofei’s blood surge again.</p>
 <p><em>Dear Old Geezer Lei, do you even interview the teachers you hire? How on earth did this seductress manage to get through?</em></p>
 <p>“Big Brother Fei!”</p>
 <p>Just as Bai Xiaofei was figuring out how to respond, a voice saved him. He looked in its direction. Xing Nan, Mo Ka, Wu Chi, and Wang Hang were running towards them in excitement.</p>
 <p>These days, the Hundred Flavors House was the Savage Class’s first choice whenever they needed a meal. Nowadays, money was a trivial matter to them.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Xue, you’re here as well? Initially, I thought you were a big beauty Big Brother Fei had seduced from somewhere.”</p>
 <p>Influenced by Bai Xiaofei, Xing Nan was now a competent flatterer as well. To be precise, this “fundamental skill” was a skill more than half the males of the Savage Class had mastered.</p>
 <p>“Mhm, you’re good with your words. Have a seat. We were discussing the New Student Tournament.”</p>
 <p>With others around, Xue Ying instantly assumed a formal attitude. She crossed her legs while her bearing went through a complete shift.</p>
 <p>“Teacher, you should put on your cloak. It feels weird when you’re not wearing it,” &nbsp;Bai Xiaofei suddenly spoke. His masculine possessive trait came into light. He didn’t want to share what was his.</p>
 <p><em>No one else is allowed to look except for me!</em></p>
 <p>With Xue Ying’s intelligence, she immediately understood what was going on in Bai Xiaofei’s mind. Although there wasn’t much change in her expression, inwardly she felt joyful. Putting on her cloak made her look more like a teacher. This prompted Xing Nan and the others to behave themselves as well.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Xue, Big Brother Fei, what were you two talking about? Can we be of any help?”</p>
 <p>Mo Ka asked, curiosity written all over his face.</p>
 <p>Unlike Bai Xiaofei who was always getting himself involved in numerous messy situations, right now Mo Ka was only looking forward to the New Student Tournament.</p>
 <p>The same anticipation was even more evident on Wu Chi. At the very least, Mo Ka, Wang Hang and the rest had Zhu Nuo and the other girls to keep them occupied. The same did not apply to Wu Chi. The world was never as kind to singles like him.</p>
 <p>“Are you guys aware of a new rank called the Newcomer Kings? It has recently been released,” Xue Ying asked dryly. Aside from Wang Hang, everyone else’s eyes lit up.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, I have heard of it. I think it was a rank suggested by the inspector of the Combat Ranking.&nbsp;Among the new students, he discovered a few geniuses with phenomenon strength and named them all Newcomer Kings.&nbsp;Although their strength is a little over-exaggerated, it’s true they really don’t seem to be easy to deal with,” Wang Hang explained. However, the fact he knew this shocked Bai Xiaofei and the others more than the information itself.</p>
 <p>“Holy shit, since when did you know about this? Why do I feel like we are not in the same class?”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei couldn’t stop himself from voicing his thoughts. Surprisingly, his question actually made Wang Hang blush.</p>
 <p>“Qi Wei was the one who told all of this to me…” Wang Hang revealed, his voice softer than a mosquito’s buzz. Nevertheless, this was enough for these busybody brats who loved nothing more than to blow anything they found out of proportion. They all heard him loud and clear. In fact, the shyer Wang Hang acted, the more excited they became.</p>
 <p>“Holy shit. Old Wang, you are progressing at a fine pace, huh? By the way, when did the two of you go out alone? How come we weren’t aware?” Wu Chi asked while he slung his arm around Wang Hang, his hoarse voice making it all the more destructive.</p>
 <p>“I know, right? I don’t even get alone time with Sisi. But you two are already whispering private words to each other!”</p>
 <p>The moment Xing Nan opened his mouth, he received looks of disdain from those around him.</p>
 <p><em>The only reason why you don’t get to spend alone time with Sisi is because you’re always avoiding her!</em></p>
 <p>“Alright, alright, stop bullying Wang Hang for his honesty. If none of you fear death, feel free to wait for Qi Wei’s arrival before continuing. Then, I will definitely respect you all as real men.”</p>
 <p>Xue Ying’s words successfully dampened their spirits.</p>
 <p>As far as they were concerned, Qi Wei had the greatest destructive power among their female classmates. It was not Lin Li with the strongest combat power, nor was it the masculine Xu Chen. After all, Qi Wei was the number one person who spoke without reservations. Her mouth had the ability to turn the dead back into the living!</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Xue, how many Newcomer Kings are there in total?”</p>
 <p>Xing Nan was the first to recover, and he asked a question that shifted the conversation back to the main topic. At the same time, a trace of anticipation surfaced in his heart.</p>
 <p><em>No matter what, Bai Xiaofei should be one of the Newcomer Kings, right?</em> <em>If so, then it’s even more reason for me to brag in the future!</em></p>
 <p>The rest shared similar thoughts, hence why they all expectantly looked at Xue Ying. After all, Wang Hang wasn’t sure of the actual names on the ranking.</p>
 <p>“There are nine of them, and all of them are in the Master Rank. Lin Li is the only one from the Savage Class who is on the list.”</p>
 <p>Everyone blanked out when they heard this because, firstly, they didn’t expect so many Master Rankers among the new students, and secondly, Bai Xiaofei wasn’t even on the list.</p>
 <p>“That inspector must be a moron, right? How could Big Brother Fei not make it on the list?”</p>
 <p>Mo Ka was the first to express his dissatisfaction. He looked as if he was about to go look for that inspector for revenge.</p>
 <p>“Personal combat power was the standard used in this ranking. Do you think Bai Xiaofei would've made it?</p>
 <p>The question rendered Mo Ka speechless. Personal combat strength was indeed Bai Xiaofei’s weakness. In fact, thinking about it, Bai Xiaofei would probably be at the bottom of the Savage Class in terms of combat. At least Mo Ka had the Floating Blade to help him…</p>
 <p>“Do you have any detailed information on these people? I need to know more about them.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei wasn’t angered by this at all. He couldn’t care less about a Newcomer King title. It was just an empty title of no substance that wouldn’t even be able to pay him… To be honest, Bai Xiaofei even felt like thanking the inspector. His actions had helped him with two great favors: he was helping him investigate the other students in detail as well as diverting attention away from him.</p>
