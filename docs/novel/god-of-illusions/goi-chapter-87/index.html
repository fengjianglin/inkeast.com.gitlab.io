 <p><span style>Time flowed by second after second, whereas, Bai Xiaofei acted just as he’d said, and he’d always been sitting on the chair with his eyes closed in meditation and would only take a glance when a large group of people came over. Now, there was already an enormous group standing behind him, and a rough count of them put them at over a thousand at least!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The propaganda throughout the afternoon had started to take effect!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, there were another two hours remaining before the agreed upon time, nine!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The facts proved that Bai Xiaofei’s decision to let those three seniors go was extremely correct because their return was equivalent to fixing the trouble that might arrive in the future to arrive at nine!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the situation that Bai Xiaofei made this proclamation before so many people and was on time, the seniors would seem inferior in the opinion of the public if they were to come look for trouble with him before nine!</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, regardless of it was the group that exploited the new students or the New Student Mutual Aid Community that Bai Xiaofei had just formed, both of them required the support of public opinion!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Simply speaking, no matter if you’re good or bad, if you lose the support of the public, then being doomed was only a matter of time. So, even if the public didn’t support you, you had to make sure the public didn’t stand up to oppose you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Water can carry a boat, yet it can also overturn one. These words were no joke!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was exactly what Bai Xiaofei was doing at this moment. He was creating an enormous wave that would overturn the large ship that exploited the new students!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The situation is just like this. If everyone still wants to continue having a share of this piece of cake, then try your best to call over every single person you can. Because according to my knowledge, the commotion there isn’t small any longer!” In the area that the third year students from the Sword of Assault resided, there were an entire seven third year seniors sitting together within a classroom, and it was one of the people amongst them that spoke these words. Moreover, the seven of them together were all the big bosses that maintained the current order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like Bai Xiaofei had said, not everyone would do things such as exploiting the new students. Firstly, it damaged one’s moral standing, and secondly, those people that were still able to stay in Starnet Academy in the third year might not really care about this income that didn’t come from regular means.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s only a new student, is it worth for us to mobilize so many people?” The tone of another senior carried a trace of disdain. Obviously, he didn’t understand the situation, and he was immersed in the false sense of superiority from them being third year students.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you know how many people have converged over there, then you’ll absolutely not be so composed as you are now. To put it bluntly, if we even relax slightly, then there’ll absolutely be no place for us in Starnet Academy, and graduating will become wishful thinking for us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tan Qiusheng’s sense of smell was extraordinarily acute, and he could be said to have seen rather far ahead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as he finished speaking, the expressions of the other six people focused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was obvious what being unable to graduate from Starnet Academy meant to them. Even though their status would remain high after leaving the academy, but it was like the difference between the heavens and the earth when compared with someone that had really graduated!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll go back and organize my people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me too….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One after the other made their stands clear, &nbsp;and only the senior with a sense of superiority remained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You better consider it properly, I’m going to organize my people as well.” Tan Qiusheng spoke coldly, and then only that senior remained within the entire classroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Bai Xiaofei’s side entered the peak period of members surging in!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amongst the largest groups of troops, there was one person that brought the most new students, and the appearance of this person was the most shocking to Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person was Hu Xian’er!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Hu Xian’er who had her face covered beneath a veil walked over in a graceful manner, Bai Xiaofei recognized her with a single glance. His heart carried a trace of bewilderment, and Bai Xiaofei who was slightly dazed stood up under the envious gazes of the group of people behind Hu Xian’er.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was also the first time Bai Xiaofei had stood up from his chair this afternoon!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You didn’t forget my name, right?” Hu Xian’er’s voice resounded out, causing the surrounding male students to feel as if they were walking on air. But, it was different for Bai Xiaofei, and his crotch instantly went cold….</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Of course!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>How could I dare!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style> Sister Hu Xian’er, I’ve already told you the other day. I’ll absolutely not forget a beauty of your level once I’ve laid my eyes on you. You wouldn’t have been thinking that I was boasting, right?” Bai Xiaofei smiled slyly while his bearing of a leader couldn’t help but weaken slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, it couldn’t be helped, because nothing in this world was greater than a beauty!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard there are many beauties by your side lately, and you seem to have even gone to the Blossom Pavilion. Also, call me Big Sister!” Hu Xian’er spoke coldly, and it caused cold sweat to flow out of Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Big Sister, why are you paying so much attention to me for!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, this was something Bai Xiaofei said to himself, and he didn’t speak it out loud. Otherwise, there would be no need for the seniors to come here because Hu Xian’er would cripple him on the spot.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why would I pay attention to you!? Tell me why would I!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I swear to god, it was absolutely for official business! Especially the Blossom Pavilion, if it wasn’t for official business, I wouldn’t go to such a feminine place even if I was bashed to death!” Bai Xiaofei appearance of speaking with all sincerity succeeded in obtaining a smile from Hu Xian’er.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, it was a cold smile….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can only bring over so many people, I hope they’re helpful to you.” When she got down to business, Hu Xian’er put away her intentions to continue questioning Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In any case, there was always time in the future!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kid, what you owe me can’t be returned in a short period of time!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if only you came, it would still be an extremely great help to me.” Finally, Bai Xiaofei spoke some words that caused Hu Xian’er to be delighted, and she smiled sweetly. After that, Hu Xian’er stood by the side of Bai Xiaofei’s chair, and this caused Lin Li who was originally standing by Bai Xiaofei’s side to be unable to refrain from frowning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the instant both of them glanced at each other, their intuition as women told them that the young woman before them would be an extremely great trouble to them!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Bai Xiaofei was completely ignorant about this, but he was able to sense the waves of cold wind that assaulted his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hu Xian’er’s arrival was merely the beginning!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next to arrive was Qin Lingyan who’d cost Bai Xiaofei great deal in the 100 Flavor House, and she’d brought an entire 200 plus people. Even though they were few, all of them were real elites amongst the first year students, and they were at the Master Rank!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After both of them had a simple exchange, Qin Lingyan noticed the ‘right and left guards’ of Bai Xiaofei’s, and for some unknown reason, she actually had a jealous feeling that she shouldn’t have…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, this trace of change was hidden very well by her, and it was even to the extent that Qin Lingyan herself overlooked it slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, Qin Lingyan’s arrival seemed to have opened up the door for the arrival of the seniors, and after that, the students from the higher years surged in to help Bai Xiaofei like spring water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the groups amongst these seniors were brought back by Fang Ye!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Exactly, it was Fang Ye!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The seniors he brought back were the owners of the stores that he’d come to an agreement with!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was mentioned previously that besides a few stores in the academy that were managed by the academy itself, the remaining stores were managed by others, and most of the owners of these stores were students!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Obviously, students that managed stores were on a much higher rank that students who relief on plundering to earn a living, and comparatively speaking, their influence was much stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, they didn’t do their best. After all, Bai Xiaofei’s success was uncertain. In other words, they were only observing now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, in Bai Xiaofei’s opinion, these forces were still very difficult to come by.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because all these people were second year and third year students!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gradually, the slightly perturbed new students firmed their beliefs, and they started to feel rejoice for making this choice.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No matter who it is, come!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>We’re waiting for you!</span></i></p>
