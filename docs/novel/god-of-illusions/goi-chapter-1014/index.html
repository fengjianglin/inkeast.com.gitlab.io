 <p>Chapter 1014: The End of War</p> 
 <p>Less than two months after Colorful Star Fortress was lost, the Sacks proceeded to experience successive defeats while their commander, Saintess Qiu Muxue, played her two-faced role perfectly. Publicly, she made speeches of encouragement after every defeat, but privately she couldn't wait to open a bottle of wine and celebrate it with Bai Xiaofei after returning to her place.</p> 
 <p>Equally happy were the soldiers of Moonlight, who had thought that this war would last for years. It had only been less than three months since Ye Qingcheng arrived at the frontier and their situation had already been completely stabilized.</p> 
 <p>The majority gave the credit to Ye Qingcheng, but the person herself knew very clearly that it was all thanks to Bai Xiaofei. Still, she hadn’t been able to figure out how he did it.</p> 
 <p>“According to our current progress, it should take another three days to break into the last fortress,” said Ye Qingtong, her tone indifferent despite this being a piece of news worthy of celebration.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, it's coming to an end.” Ye Qingcheng smiled wryly, then let out a sigh.</p> 
 <p>Realizing they shared the same mood, the two looked at each other and burst out laughing.</p> 
 <p>“How long has it been since we sat together and talked like this?” Ye Qingcheng's gaze softened as she turned to look at her sister.</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingtong lowered her head. “Are you going to keep your promise?” she suddenly asked with an anxious heart. After all, the reason why she was willing to come to the frontier this time was because of the big picture that Bai Xiaofei had drawn. Now that all the conditions had been met, whether her final goal could be realized depended entirely on Ye Qingcheng.</p> 
 <p>“Of course,” replied Ye Qingcheng.</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingtong was relieved. At least, the sacrifices of those ten thousand-odd men were not in vain…</p> 
 <p>“I've lost one of my dearest people once, so I won't make this kind of mistake again. Moreover, I know what brought Moonlight this victory. If it weren’t for the Fickle Army, we probably would still be worried about Colorful Light at this moment,” Ye Qingcheng said and fell into a long silence.</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingtong looked at her hesitantly.</p> 
 <p>“You and him are impossible.” She broke the silence, and continued despite Ye Qingcheng’s shock, “Moonlight can’t be without you, and he is not the kind of person who would give up his freedom. If you continue like this, you will follow in Mother’s footsteps. Are you sure you want that?”</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingcheng's expression dimmed. In the end, she smiled wryly. “I thought you would ask me when it started.” Unexpectedly, she did not deny nor refute and simply accepted it.</p> 
 <p>“Some people need a long time to fall in love, but some people just need a moment and I know you, sister. But in the face of reality, I hope you don’t continue to go down this road,” Ye Qingtong advised with conflicted emotions. She did not if she was right to say these words, but she knew that if she didn’t, she would blame herself later.</p> 
 <p>“I know, but there are things I can’t just control. But as you said, he will leave, and I don’t intend to do anything to keep him,” Ye Qingcheng said with a bright smile. “Let’s leave it to time to solve all problems.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Ye Qingtong fell silent. She knew that no matter what she said, it would be useless. Time really could solve everything, but not this kind of feeling as it would only keep fermenting…</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>“Welcome back, Great Actress. How was today? Did they make a fuss?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei's voice rang out the moment Qiu Muxue opened the door. Being limited by his identity, he had been hiding in her room during this entire time, and therefore poking fun at her was the only entertainment he had.</p> 
 <p>“A fuss? No doubt. But it’s all good as long as the initiator is handled, right?” Qiu Muxue’s lips curled up into a ruthless smile that ran a chill down Bai Xiaofei’s spine.</p> 
 <p>In the past two months, he had once tested her strength out of curiosity, and that was when he understood how terrifyingly strong she was!</p> 
 <p>Losing to Yan Ran’er in strength, Bai Xiaofei had begrudgingly accepted it. After all, she was a special case. However, being one-sidedly battered by a real person?</p> 
 <p>He couldn’t use origin energy against her and his physical strength alone was no match. Therefore, he had been spending his days treading on thin ice…</p> 
 <p>“How did you… handle them?” Bai Xiaofei gulped as he pictured the tragedy of the said unlucky initiator.</p> 
 <p>“Broke his two legs and punched out his teeth when he howled in pain, making him want to scream in pain but not daring to at the same time. Then, I announced that whoever dares to take care of him will be deemed guilty by association, leaving him to fend for himself,” replied Qiu Mu Xue with animated gestures, obviously not joking at all.</p> 
 <p>“Then, if you propose to retreat now, no one should have any objection.” Out of survival instinct, Bai Xiaofei hurriedly put an end to the idea of poking fun at her and got down to business.</p> 
 <p>“No, I haven't thought this out yet.” Qiu Muxue sighed with a troubled expression.</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean?” Bai Xiaofei frowned. <em>What else is there to consider?</em></p> 
 <p>“Do you think we can return to the Sacks safe and sound after retreating?” Qiu Muxue asked back.</p> 
 <p>“You mean, those Barbaric Godism people will make it hard on you?” Bai Xiaofei instantly understood.</p> 
 <p>“More than just ‘make it hard.’ They might even use this opportunity to handle me. You know, I was not promoted by them to this position, I earned it using my Starnet graduate identity. They already realized that I was no longer in their control, but I escaped with my people before they could do anything,” she said.</p> 
 <p>Although her tone was relaxed, Bai Xiaofei could imagine her dilemma.</p> 
 <p>If she didn’t return to the Sacks, it would be impossible to proceed with the plan, but if she retreated, it would become a weak point that the opponent would use against her. This was why Qiu Muxue sought out Bai Xiaofei’s help. It wasn’t that she didn’t know what to do, but that she couldn’t think of a way to ensure her group’s absolute safety.</p> 
 <p>“Why didn't you tell me earlier?” Bai Xiaofei angrily paced around the room. Pacing about for half a day without an idea, he asked, “What did you promise those people?”</p> 
 <p>“That I will lead the clan to take over all the fortresses, or they can have my life,” Qiu Muxue answered nonchalantly as if it wasn’t her life that was in danger.</p> 
 <p>This answer made Bai Xiaofei jittery. If something happened to Qiu Muxue, not to mention whether he could get the Revival Grass, even his little life would be at stake.</p> 
 <p>“Are there any weaknesses? Don’t tell me Barbaric Godism is monolithic. Does anyone have any special hobbies that we can use as leverage?” Bai Xiaofei suggested, but Qiu Muxue shook her head.</p> 
 <p>Subsequently, Bai Xiaofei began brainstorming. He put forward suggestions at intervals and Qiu Muxue kept shaking her head. This lasted for the whole evening until her eyelids could barely hold up and there was a knock on the door.</p> 
 <p>“If I didn’t know better, I’d think you were contemplating countermeasures.” Lan Shuang entered the room and pulled the two people out of their daze.</p> 
 <p>“What about now that you know?” Qiu Muxue conveniently followed up, but the answer she got immediately made her regret asking.</p> 
 <p>“A man and a woman in a room, sparks fly!”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Lan Shuang’s voice dropped, there was a sudden surge of murderous intent in the room.</p> 
 <p>“What? I got it right and you want to kill me to silence me? I’m telling you, before I die, I’ll make sure to make this public!” Lan Shuang hurriedly said upon seeing Qiu Muxue move, successfully pulling herself back from the gates of hell. She then looked at Bai Xiaofei. “Tell me, what’s keeping you two up so late?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, who was about to give up, simply explained the situation.</p> 
 <p>“What’s there to waste your brain juice on this? Didn't you tell him?” Lan Shuang looked at Qiu Muxue in disbelief. The latter immediately rushed to cover her mouth.</p> 
 <p>“What didn't you tell me?” Bai Xiaofei dubiously asked.</p> 
 <p>“No! I told you everything! She was talking nonsense!” Qiu Muxue hurriedly denied.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei naturally didn’t buy it.</p> 
 <p>“Fine, no big deal. At worst, we’ll just all die together. I hope they’ll let us choose a good block in a cemetery out of consideration for your Saintess identity,” he said and sat down, his posture saying ‘I give up.’</p> 
 <p>Qiu Muxue instantly looked troubled. “Ehh… can’t you continue to think of some way?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn't respond.</p> 
 <p>“You have to have confidence in yourself! I believe you can do it!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei still didn't respond as he picked up a fruit on the table and chomped on it.</p> 
 <p>“Fine! Consider yourself formidable! I’ll tell you!”</p> 
 <p>“Go ahead, I’m listening.” Bai Xiaofei instantly turned around with an ear tilted toward her.</p>
