 <p>Chapter 881: Pressing Yun Tianhe!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei changed his accommodation location after redeeming Mu Yun as per Tan Xin’s demand. In her words, there were too many beautiful little sisters in the Moon Beck Pavilion and they had to keep away!</p> 
 <p>A night quietly passed within which a storm brewed as some figures in the imperial capital contemplated their own plans…</p> 
 <p>Early the next morning, Bai Xiaofei arrived at the Yun residence early, anxious by the news that Yun Tianhe was seriously injured.</p> 
 <p>“Please come in, Master Bai. Our First young master has said that you can enter at any time.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei and Tan Xin were warmly received by the guards at the door. As for Mu Yun, Bai Xiaofei had her stay at the inn, feeling that she probably needed to stay put until the problem was handled.</p> 
 <p>Following a guard, Bai Xiaofei entered Yun Tianhe’s quarters.</p> 
 <p>Unlike Lan Qiushuang’s quiet yard, Yun Tianhe’s place was crowded with visitors since he was injured. Looking at the group of well-dressed people, Bai Xiaofei once again got to know the influence and status of the Yun clan. Yun Tianhe was not even in charge yet…</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei waited until the butler sent off the guests and finally got to see Yun Tianhe. However, the latter did not look like an injured person at all.</p> 
 <p>“Aii, sorry to make you wait, Lil’ Bro. There’s nothing I can do about those social niceties.” Yun Tianhe sighed. Unlike when talking to Bai Xiaofei, he had to keep his brain constantly processing when dealing with the nobles.</p> 
 <p>“I could see you have handled it very well, as expected of the First young master of the Yun family.” Bai Xiaofei smiled. He wasn’t impatient at all and was even happy for Yun Tianhe.</p> 
 <p>“You really look like my dad when you say this. However, the way he words it has become boring.” Yun Tianhe laughed. Then, his eyes fell upon Tan Xin behind Bai Xiaofei. Curiously observing her, who still looked like a minor, he asked, “And this is…?”</p> 
 <p>Since it was dark last night, Yun Tianhe did not see Tan Xin’s appearance clearly.</p> 
 <p>“You are Brother Tianhe, right? I’m your sister-in-law, just call me Xin’er. We met last night!” Tan Xin reminded.</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe’s eyes widened. Without delay, he bowed to her. “Thank you for saving my life, sister-in-law!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei really didn’t know what to say at the ‘sister-in-law’ address…</p> 
 <p>“Ahem, let us move to the main topic, otherwise I feel that you two will talk until dark,” he decided to change the subject.</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe smiled awkwardly and welcomed the two inside.</p> 
 <p>“Did you find out anything about the ambushers last night?” asked Bai Xiaofei after seating himself.</p> 
 <p>“Nothing at all. They should have been prepared for failure in advance. I suspect that they are Shadow Death people,” replied Yun Tianhe with a hint of anger on his face. It was exasperating when the enemy hid so well in the dark.</p> 
 <p>“No. Shadow Death people would not let you make a choice. The people ambushing you obviously had scruples, while Shadow Death is unscrupulous,” Bai Xiaofei immediately rejected Yun Tianhe’s speculation.</p> 
 <p>Stunned, Yun Tianhe revealed a look of disbelief. “You mean, there are others who want me dead?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei chuckled. “Brother, you underestimate yourself. Do you think this capital city lacks people who want you gone? This kind of thing didn’t happen before because they didn’t find you worrying. However, Princess Ling Ge making a public appearance for you at the Moon Beck Pavilion triggered some people. After all, she’s too special.”</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe fell silent. He really didn’t think that the imperial city had gotten so on edge.</p> 
 <p>“In that case, we have to do something.” Yun Tianhe suddenly looked like a different person as his eyes grew sharp.</p> 
 <p>“No hurry. We can wait until they resort to desperate measures to strike back and catch them all at once. What we need to do now is investigate the human puppet matter. As Aunt Lan said, this is a rare opportunity to gain credit!” Bai Xiaofei said with a smile.</p> 
 <p>However, Yun Tianhe looked troubled. “The human puppet matter is not that easy, though. Moreover, some people have already put pressure on my father, saying that he has not done anything and gotten nothing useful until now.”</p> 
 <p>Having said that, Yun Tianhe couldn’t help but sigh. He felt guilty. After all, his father had handed this matter to him.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, it will be resolved. While Shadow Death is a headache, they follow certain routines. Since they have appeared, it means that their plan has reached the final stage.” Bai Xiaofei actually regarded Shadow Death as his lucky star.</p> 
 <p>If this got out, Shadow Death would lose face, big time…</p> 
 <p>“Even so, we still need clues. We don’t even have a direction yet,” Yun Tianhe lamented.</p> 
 <p>“Who says we don’t?” Bai Xiaofei laughed and continued to explain, “Not long ago, a great deal of manpower was dispatched in order to ambush me. But even so, Shadow Death did not use human puppets at all to avoid real casualties. Therefore, the controller of the human puppets is not one of them.”</p> 
 <p>“That is to say, the person who’s cooperating with Shadow Death can restrain them to a certain extent. To be able to do that, their identity can’t be simple, which narrows the scope of our investigation.” Yun Tianhe immediately caught up and was horrified by his own conclusion. He looked up at Bai Xiaofei, his voice trembling, “Lil’ Brother, you don’t mean… those people!?”</p> 
 <p>Someone whose identity was not simple and excelled at making puppets… It could only be one of the several godsmiths. Every single one of them was of great significance to Ethereal, so whoever that person was, it would be an unacceptable blow to the empire!</p> 
 <p>However, if the human puppet matter was left unattended, it would develop to be an even worse blow!</p> 
 <p>Therefore, this conclusion was equivalent to putting Ethereal in a dilemma. The problem was no longer what Yun Tianhe or his Yun clan could shoulder…</p> 
 <p>“Isn’t it a good lead? Much better than looking for a needle in a haystack.” Bai Xiaofei didn’t have as many concerns as Yun Tianhe. If it was not that he wanted to inform Yun Tianhe first, he would already have moved on with the investigation.</p> 
 <p>“But… even if we set aside how much influence they have in Ethereal, those people aren’t someone who we can just see as we wish, let alone investigate. I’m afraid it’s hard to even take a step in that direction,” Yun Tianhe stated.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei did not find this troublesome. He said with a smile, “It’s indeed a bit difficult for me, but Big Brother, don’t forget that you still have a killer move!”</p> 
 <p>Guessing Bai Xiaofei’s idea, Yun Tianhe instantly panicked. “No way! I can’t go to Ling Ge!” he decisively refused.</p> 
 <p>“Well, then we can only rely on ourselves and it may take a while longer. I hope that by then, the human puppets won’t have spread and Ethereal can still keep a lid on it. Or else, the whole continent will know very quickly,” Bai Xiaofei said dismissively as if it had nothing to do with him.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Yun Tianhe was conflicted.</p> 
 <p>“Big Bro, I really don’t know what you are struggling with. Ling Ge can sacrifice her life for you, don’t tell me you really have no feelings for her at all? Are you hesitating because of the ridiculous so-called age gap? Or do you feel guilty toward Mu Yun? If it’s the latter, you really look down on the woman you love.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s long speech rendered Yun Tianhe speechless, and it was only the beginning.</p> 
 <p>“Moreover, you know what you have to shoulder. Although it’s a bit much to say this, the help Ling Ge can provide is greatly needed by both the Yun and Lan clan. If you want to secure yourself in the coming storm, she is the perfect safe haven.”</p> 
 <p>“And then again, I don’t think you need to feel sorry,” said Bai Xiaofei as Yun Tianhe started to doubt his existence. “I will find Ling Ge in your name. If you don’t want to, stop me before I leave. If you still hesitate, I will help you make this decision.”</p> 
 <p>With that, Bai Xiaofei got up and left without looking back. Just as he thought, Yun Tianhe didn’t stop him even after he walked all the way out of the yard.</p> 
 <p>Sometimes, what one lacked was courage and an excuse, and Bai Xiaofei helped Yun Tianhe with both…</p> 
 <p>“Aren’t you afraid that he will really stop you?” asked Tan Xin along the way.</p> 
 <p>“If nothing had happened last night, he might have, but when a woman stands in front of a man and takes a knife for him, even a heart of stone will be shaken.” Bai Xiaofei looked at Tan Xin. “I have never once failed to understand a person’s heart!”</p>
