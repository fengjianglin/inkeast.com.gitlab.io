 <p>Chapter 666: A Day of Lil’ White…</p> 
 <p>Hello everyone, my name is Lil’ White, my brother is Big White, my father is Old White, my mother is White White, and my sister…</p> 
 <p>Well, I don’t have a sister, but that doesn’t matter. It’s not what I want to say today.</p> 
 <p>Originally, I was a carefree Snow Mole. I’d gnaw at the grass buds under the snow when I’m hungry, and when I’m thirsty, I could just eat some snow. If there would ever be a lucky day, I could have something special for a meal to bid farewell to the identity of a Barbaric Rank.</p> 
 <p>However, all this was overturned with the arrival of an idiot.</p> 
 <p>That’s right, the idiot who is coming towards me right now. He thinks he is invisible, so he walks to me foolishly. This is the 763rd time during the past half month that he has forced me to hide.</p> 
 <p>Talk later, I’ll have to run now. This fool has caught many of my neighbors!</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>“You bastard!” Looking at the Snow Mole slipping away from right under his nose, Bai Xiaofei bitterly cursed.</p> 
 <p>The Endless State had a similar effect to Cang Lan’s skill as Bai Xiaofei thought, but its lowest frequency limit wasn’t enough to let him fully integrate with the surrounding environment when it was too quiet.</p> 
 <p>Aware of this problem, Bai Xiaofei decided to follow Cang Lan's approach.</p> 
 <p>Due to constantly applying the reverse effect on the Endless State for the last one week, Bai Xiaofei gradually got used to it and spent three days starving before he finally caught the first Snow Mole.</p> 
 <p>Of course, he didn’t slowly approach all the way, but accelerated after getting close to a certain distance. But this was already great progress. His confidence was boosted by this success and he grew more and more skillful. Now he could basically get within a meter to a Snow Mole quietly, which could be counted as the first step to mastering this skill.</p> 
 <p>However, the Snow Mole that just ran away was an exception. Bai Xiaofei had lost count of how many times he had eaten a loss from it. Anyway, he hadn’t succeeded once.</p> 
 <p>Calming himself down, Bai Xiaofei heaved a long sigh.</p> 
 <p>That Cang Lan could directly go and pick up a Snow Mole was certainly impossible to achieve by adjusting the frequency of energy alone. There must be something else that he had omitted, which was what Bai Xiaofei had been thinking about in recent days.</p> 
 <p>Sitting cross-legged on the ground, Bai Xiaofei stared at his hands and fell into a trance. His energy then started surging outward, and Bai Xiaofei's brows creased.</p> 
 <p><em>What exactly is the problem?</em></p> 
 <p>Contemplating to near insanity, Bai Xiaofei frantically scratched his head. This feeling of his brain being burned was really…</p> 
 <p><em>Huh?! Wait!</em></p> 
 <p>His hands on his head, Bai Xiaofei sunk into silence. Then, he slowly removed his hands and felt the change in them, which gradually brought delight to his dull face.</p> 
 <p>The energy store points in them attracted each other, and occasionally some energy would be transferred from one hand to the other!</p> 
 <p>Slowly bringing his two hands together, Bai Xiaofei began to consciously control this transfer. Soon, there was an energy bridge between the two hands. However, with the emergence of this bridge, the energy frequency of all other store points in his body immediately went haywire and the energy barrier covering him was also destroyed. Only the energy in his hands remained.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei wasn’t at all dejected. Instead, he was as excited as if he had discovered a whole new world!</p> 
 <p>“Hahaha! I told you I was a genius!!!”</p> 
 <p>He bounced up in excitement. After celebrating for half a day, he sat down again. He wanted to figure out what he did differently from Cang Lan.</p> 
 <p>The feeling that Cang Lan had given him half a month ago was similar to what had just appeared between his hands, where the energy released completely formed a whole, instead of forcibly adjusting its frequency to form a cover.</p> 
 <p>In fact, the previous method had worked, but it distracted the spirit the moment the cover formed and therefore would create a flaw, allowing him to be discovered by the target. But now, this problem had been solved with the appearance of the energy bridge.</p> 
 <p>The energy circulation between the store points was the key!</p> 
 <p>A bridge must be built at the same time between several store points all over the body, and then they could be left to circulate by themselves, so that after the frequency was fixed, Bai Xiaofei could maintain it without having to focus his spirit like before!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately started experimenting with this idea. The store points in his hands, feet, between his brows, his heart, and abdomen; a total of seven started to be connected by energy bridges. While he might not have been able to do this half a month ago, but it was now a piece of cake.</p> 
 <p>After the bridges were built, Bai Xiaofei slowly increased the output of energy, and after a few moments, a cover of the same kind as Cang Lan’s appeared on him!</p> 
 <p>Then, Bai Xiaofei finished with the last step, which was adjusting the frequency of energy.</p> 
 <p>“You little shit, I’ll see where you’re gonna run this time!!!” Bai Xiaofei curled his lips and started walking into the snowland again.</p> 
 <p>After a long, long wait, the Snow Mole who had bested him countless times once again emerged. Sunbathing was one of the Snow Moles’ daily practices. It raised their temperature, and the heat would then be stored in their bodies to fight against the cold at night.</p> 
 <p>Making sure that there was nothing amiss in the surroundings, the Snow Mole in question slowly laid down on its stomach and squeaked happily upon feeling the warmth of the sun.</p> 
 <p>However, it quickly felt something was wrong. <em>Why did the sun disappear? There are no clouds today!</em></p> 
 <p>The nervous Snow Mole pricked up its ears and looked around, but it found nothing… until it was slowly lifted from the ground.</p> 
 <p>“Huh? It’s you, little guy. Why didn't you run this time?” Bai Xiaofei burst into victorious laughter, like a general who had just won a grand battle.</p> 
 <p>The poor Snow Mole struggled hard, but it was too weak and finally collapsed in Bai Xiaofei's hands.</p> 
 <p>“Just as I’m tired of barbecue. Let’s keep you for braised meat today.”</p> 
 <p>The Snow Mole couldn't understand what Bai Xiaofei said, but his tone still struck a deep sense of crisis and a piercing cry came out of its mouth.</p> 
 <p>Hearing its cry, Bai Xiaofei was slightly surprised. He had caught his fair share of Snow Moles in the past half-month, but for some reason, he felt that he seemed to understand what this one was trying to say.</p> 
 <p>Lifting the Snow Mole to his eyes, Bai Xiaofei smiled.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, let’s spare you. After helping me practice for so long, I’d say you’ve made a great contribution.” He grinned and took out a piece of emerald grass from his storage ring. “Lucky you. This is a high-grade herb. I only found five in half a month. If you don’t advance to a King Rank mouse, you’ll really be sorry for my kindness.”</p> 
 <p>With that, he put the Snow Mole down and put the herb in front of it.</p> 
 <p>To Bai Xiaofei's surprise, instead of running away, the Snow Mole picked up the herb and looked at him.</p> 
 <p>“If you don't run, I will really eat you!” Bai Xiaofei tried to scare the little mole. The latter panicked and immediately plunged into the snow.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, a familiar figure appeared in the distance.</p> 
 <p>It had been half a month, it was time to go back!</p>
