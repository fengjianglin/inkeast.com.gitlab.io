 <p>Chapter 792: Nine-Dragon Reincarnation!</p> 
 <p>As Dragon King flashed a hysterical expression at Bai Xiaofei, his aura took an abrupt and uncanny change.</p> 
 <p>“Young Master, interrupt him!!!” Blood Wolf yelled out.</p> 
 <p>Although Bai Xiaofei didn’t know what Dragon King was doing, Blood Wolf’s reaction was enough to make him take it seriously. Without further ado, Bai Xiaofei retracted the sea of flame around him and compressed it into a blade of fire.</p> 
 <p>Holding the fireblade, Bai Xiaofei turned into a streak of light that shot at Dragon King and slashed. However, before the blade could even touch Dragon King’s head, a loud dragon hum resounded and the sound wave bounced him out.</p> 
 <p>“Brat, today shall be your death anniversary! Nine-Dragon Fusion!!” declared Dragon King as he made his move, his speed so quick that he became a phantom.</p> 
 <p>Before Bai Xiaofei could recover from the sound wave attack earlier, Dragon King had already appeared in front of him and smashed him into the ground, creating a big hole. Standing in the air, Dragon King looked down at Bai Xiaofei in the hole, vomiting blood.</p> 
 <p>“None of those who have seen me in this state has ever survived. However, I have to admit that for pushing me to this extent while being only a Grandmaster Rank puppet master, you are a genius among geniuses. Therefore, I’m willing to make you famous all over this continent,” said Dragon King coldly, as if victory was already in his grasp.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei struggled to get up from the deep hole. Although his injury was recovering, Dragon King’s previous attack left a special energy in his body that greatly slowed down his recovery speed. This was the first time that the Endless State failed to deal with an alien energy invading his body.</p> 
 <p>“You should have killed me directly instead of standing there spewing nonsense. But now, you have no chance.” Bai Xiaofei sneered as Blackie and Huskie appeared next to him. “You can also be proud to make me use something I have never used until now. Although I don’t know what the result will be, I believe that you won’t survive.”</p> 
 <p>On Bai Xiaofei’s back, a pair of purple wings opened. He placed his hands on Blackie and Huskie respectively.</p> 
 <p>“Spiritualization, fuse!”</p> 
 <p>His four puppets entered Spiritualization at the same time, Bai Xiaofei’s appearance changed repeatedly, and finally to his surprise, settled on the human form. However, this human form was a little different from an ordinary person.</p> 
 <p>Behind him was a pair of purple, black, and red wings with a span of nearly five meters. His hands had become sharp claws with slender and angular fingers that together formed a shape similar to a dark steel knife. There were flames flowing along his body, distorting the space around with their terrifying temperature. His eyes were eerie and flashing with a deep dark light.</p> 
 <p>Seeing Bai Xiaofei’s new form, Dragon King was stunned, but then filled with ecstasy.</p> 
 <p>“Hahaha! I bet you’re not feeling very well!” He laughed loudly, but only drew a sneer from Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Indeed, Dragon King was right. He could feel that Bai Xiaofei’s body was rapidly failing, and Bai Xiaofei himself was very clear of it as well. The backlash from fusing four puppets at once was extremely taxing. If he hadn’t reached the peak of the Grandmaster Rank, he would not be able to even try this.</p> 
 <p>According to the failure rate of his physical body, Bai Xiaofei calculated that he had at most one minute. However, Bai Xiaofei could feel the earth-shaking change in his power that Dragon King failed to notice. One minute was enough.</p> 
 <p>“You are right, but you’d better prepare your coffin!” said Bai Xiaofei as his eyes glinted. The next second, he appeared before Dragon King!</p> 
 <p>This was not speed, but teleportation!</p> 
 <p>Dragon King gawked in shock and his whole body tensed up. “F*ck off!!”</p> 
 <p>A familiar dragon hum resounded, but it was not Bai Xiaofei who was sent flying this time. As an even louder and deeper roar came out from Bai Xiaofei’s mouth, Dragon King felt like his head was hammered. After the burst of dizziness passed, there was severe pain on his face.</p> 
 <p>It was a punch from Bai Xiaofei that twisted Dragon King’s neck into a strange angle.</p> 
 <p>Any person would have died from such a punch, but Dragon King’s body suddenly emitted a golden light and then recovered immediately. Not only so, but his aura even soared.</p> 
 <p>The Nine-Dragon Fusion allowed him to fuse with nine dragon souls. Every time he suffered a fatal attack, a dragon soul would disperse but would also enhance his strength. This was the Nine-Dragon Incarnation Art!</p> 
 <p>Aware of the change in Dragon King, Bai Xiaofei quickly acted. One minute was not short, but nor was it very long.</p> 
 <p>Before Dragon King could react, a thread of fire pierced through his heart, taking away the second dragon soul and giving Dragon King his second reincarnation…</p> 
 <p>After being insta-killed until the sixth reincarnation, Dragon King’s power finally reached a level that enabled him to respond to Bai Xiaofei’s attacks! Catching Bai Xiaofei’s fist, Dragon King, who had been abused to insanity, revealed a ferocious smile.</p> 
 <p>However, his smile froze as Bai Xiaofei suddenly turned into stone and another Bai Xiaofei pierced a hand through his heart.</p> 
 <p>After Dragon King’s seventh reincarnation, Bai Xiaofei picked up speed for the next attack. His heart tightened as he felt Dragon King getting stronger again. His time was running out!</p> 
 <p>“Nightcharm!” Bai Xiaofei shouted.</p> 
 <p>Dragon King was confused, but when he caught Bai Xiaofei’s fist, he understood.</p> 
 <p>It was poison, the acutely deadly kind!</p> 
 <p>Being insta-killed for the seventh time into the eighth reincarnation, Dragon King was covered in a glow, which was a representation of adaptability. The Nine-Dragon Reincarnation brought him corresponding adaptability to his opponent. Since Dragon King had just died from Nightcharm poison, he had become more resistant to such poison.</p> 
 <p>Catching Bai Xiaofei’s strike again, Dragon King countered with a fist. However, Bai Xiaofei successfully caught it, and a horrifying face appeared above Dragon King – it was the full version of Devouring the Heaven and Earth!</p> 
 <p>Although the duration was shorter than when he had dealt with the demon king, it was enough to kill Dragon King. After all, he could not be compared with the demon king at all.</p> 
 <p>As a result, the ninth reincarnation happened. Looking at the resurrected Dragon King, Bai Xiaofei’s expression became sluggish. Finally, only one last blow!</p> 
 <p>“Phoenix Dances in the Ninth Heaven!”</p> 
 <p>Boundless purple-black flames gushed out from Bai Xiaofei’s body and enveloped Dragon King. Then, he withdrew from the Spiritualization state and weakly collapsed to the ground.</p> 
 <p>Everyone focused on the fire-wrapped Dragon King. Whatever happened next would decide the battle.</p> 
 <p>However, heaven seemed to be in a mood for a joke. At the instant when Dragon King was about to be swallowed up by flames, he detonated all of his puppets, and the impact offset the flames. Despite the fatal injuries he had suffered, he successfully saved his own life!</p> 
 <p>Moreover, puppets were no longer important for Dragon King at the moment…</p> 
 <p>“ALL OF YOU MUST DIE!!!”</p>
