 <p>Chapter 839: Sin!</p> 
 <p>“Smelly old man, why do I feel something weird about this?” Opening the bottle only to be greeted with a pungent smell, Bai Xiaofei chickened out.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t judge it by the smell. Its effect is more than just good. It can greatly stimulate your physical activeness and the circulation speed of your cultivation technique. If you drink it and run Lunisolar Brilliance, you’ll get twice the result with half the effort.”</p> 
 <p>Revelation praised his potion to the sky, but what he got in return was still Bai Xiaofei’s distrustful look.</p> 
 <p>“Consider it giving medicine to a dead horse<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>, okay? Do you have any other choice now?!” Revelation urged.</p> 
 <p>This poked Bai Xiaofei’s sore spot. <em>That’s right, since I’m already like this, what’s there to be picky about?</em></p> 
 <p>At this thought, Bai Xiaofei endured the overwhelming smell and drained the bottle. Then, he activated Lunisolar Brilliance. However, the so-called ‘getting twice the result with half the effort’ did not happen.</p> 
 <p>“No response, Master…” Bai Xiaofei checked his body and looked up at Revelation full of doubts, only to see a sinister smile on the latter’s face.</p> 
 <p>“No hurry, the effect will hit in a while.” Revelation chuckled.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was stunned. Right then, his vision blurred as an unbearable hot feeling rose from his abdomen before sweeping through his whole body. Finally, he fell over as the temperature in his body kept rising rapidly.</p> 
 <p>“Ah, my silly disciple. You have so many women around you, yet your cultivation technique is only earth grade. An earth-grade technique is as useless as a fart! Also, your master can’t watch you drag your crippled body to a place like Ethereal, so you can’t blame me this time,” Revelation justified his actions and waved his hand. Bai Xiaofei floated up.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Gu Lingyue, who had woken up from her sea of consciousness, had been arranged to a remote room by Revelation.</p> 
 <p>It didn’t take long for Revelation to appear with Bai Xiaofei. The latter was awake, but his bloodshot eyes were obviously not that of his consciousness at all, but raw instinct. To put it simply, Bai Xiaofei needed women at the moment!</p> 
 <p>“Have you considered it carefully? I can only fulfill your wish with him in this state, otherwise, with his personality, no one knows how long you’ll have to wait,” Revelation asked Gu Lingye as he kept Bai Xiaofei in check.</p> 
 <p>“I have!” replied Gu Lingyue firmly as she looked Revelation in the eye.</p> 
 <p>Giving a long sigh, Revelation lifted the shackles on Bai Xiaofei and left.</p> 
 <p>Without restraint, Bai Xiaofei instinctively looked at the only other person left in the room, whose beautiful body and impeccable face posed a fatal attraction to him! Without hesitation, he pounced. The next second, there was the sound of fabric being torn…</p> 
 <p>When the rooster sang, Bai Xiaofei was still lying in bed, having no idea what had happened the previous day. The only thing he could remember was that he seemed to have had a wonderful dream.</p> 
 <p>After jumping out of bed, he clearly felt that his body had recovered! When he activated the cultivation technique, the light indicating the rank of the technique shone from his hands. Seeing it, he was shocked.</p> 
 <p><em>This… What happened?! My technique ranked up?!!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hurriedly put on his clothes and rushed out.</p> 
 <p>As if having anticipated Bai Xiaofei’s reaction, Revelation was already waiting outside.</p> 
 <p>“Well, I didn’t lie to you, did I?” Revelation said, blocking whatever Bai Xiaofei wanted to say at his throat.</p> 
 <p>“My technique ranked up,” Bai Xiaofei squeezed out after a struggle, expressing himself clearly with just a few words. He wanted to ask, ‘Who was it?’…</p> 
 <p>“Don’t let your mind run wild. The bottle yesterday was a treasure I got from The Ruins, the effect is to raise your cultivation technique one level. When your technique ranks up, your body is cured as a result.”</p> 
 <p>Revelation didn’t tell the truth and Bai Xiaofei only had this to believe, although he really doubted the plausibility of it…</p> 
 <p>“Does that mean that my body won’t have the same problem again?” At this thought, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but smile.</p> 
 <p>“You think too much. To achieve that kind of recovery effect, your technique must rank up at least two more ranks, maybe even three.” Revelation directly dispelled Bai Xiaofei’s plan to use his ability recklessly, and brought along with it a piece of bad news, “I misjudged something before. Now that you’ve reached heaven grade, the requirement has become more difficult. As far as your present ability and physical condition are concerned, you need to co-cultivate with at least two other girls before your cultivation technique can rank up again.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei widened his eyes. “What the hell?!”</p> 
 <p>He felt that it had already gone too far, but it had become even worse!</p> 
 <p>“What’s so shocking about it? When you reach the saint grade, you may need even more. And it’s not like you lack women. It’s just your own mentality,” Revelation mercilessly struck back. If he were Bai Xiaofei, he would have reached at least divine grade.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, heaven grade is already very good,” Bai Xiaofei decisively accepted his fate. Luo Xi’s words before he left Starnet had impacted him greatly. When certain things were owed, it would be really difficult to compensate for…</p> 
 <p>“I have already sent those two girls away. Since you’ve more or less recovered, you can move on to your next stop when you feel the time is right,” Revelation tactfully dismissed Bai Xiaofei right after the latter came to terms with his situation.</p> 
 <p>“Huh? What happened? Don’t you want me around for two more days? Why are you in such a hurry? You have ulterior motives?” Bai Xiaofei’s intuition once again told him that the situation was not as simple as it seemed.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, in front of him was a crafty old fox!</p> 
 <p>“Want you around for two more days?! Am I tired of living?! Moreover, do you know how much of my business you have delayed by staying here?” Revelation put emphasis on ‘business’ and finished his words with a cold snort.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei sweated. <em>Damn! I can’t believe that someone can spout nonsense in such a righteous manner! As if I don’t know what your ‘business’ is! With the few things your Revelation Pavilion has, what can I delay? The only thing I can delay is you going out to find women!!</em></p> 
 <p>Despite roaring in his heart, Bai Xiaofei kept his mouth shut. He still had not lived enough…</p> 
 <p>“Ahhhhh, pitiful little me. I don’t even know what my father looks like. Now that I finally have a master, he doesn’t want to see me! Forget it. I’d better go.”</p> 
 <p>With a long, long tragic sigh, Bai Xiaofei turned and walked away in ‘loneliness.’ To tell the truth, he never planned to stay any longer. After the tour with Heartseer, he had figured that he was out of place with the Revelation Pavilion, which he deemed a nest of liars…</p>
