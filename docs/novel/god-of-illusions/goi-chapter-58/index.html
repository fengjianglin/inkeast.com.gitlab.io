 <p><span style>“This is… for you.” With a face that carried a trace of a smile and a blush that was illuminated by the campfire, Lin Li held the boar leg she’d personally roasted with both her hands and gave it to Bai Xiaofei while her gaze flickered full of anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei gulped down a mouthful of saliva with great difficulty when he looked down and looked at the roasted meat in Lin Li’s hand. The smell wasn’t bad because the quality of Roar Boar meat was obvious after all, and it was mixed together with a pile of inexpensive condiments. But, this appearance…. </span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for its rough shape still being discernible, Bai Xiaofei wouldn’t dare believe this was a roasted boar leg….</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, who would refuse at a moment like this? </span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the good intentions of a top beauty, and if someone was capable of refusing it, then it was absolutely a step towards being bound to be alone!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It looks really delicious!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Class Monitor is so kind!” As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking, the nearby Xu Chen instantly imitated his tone and added another sentence, and then she looked at the two of them with a slightly malicious smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you know? This is called tender with a crispy crust!” Bai Xiaofei grunted before grabbing the boar leg over, and then he braced himself before taking a bite.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, it really was crispy on the outside, and it wasn’t just slightly charred!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After successively eating a few mouthfuls of ash, Bai Xiaofei finally saw the bit of meat that still remained on the boar leg, and his eyes instantly glowed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The heavens are kind to me!!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As he took a bite while cherishing it extremely, Bai Xiaofei felt his tears were on the verge of dripping from being moved. He wasn’t grateful to Lin Li but grateful to this Roar Boar for being fat enough….</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other side, Lin Li didn’t think so much, and when she saw Bai Xiaofei eating so ‘happily’, the smile on her exquisite face grew even deeper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, Lin Li ran over and brought over another boar leg….</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Bai Xiaofei really cried….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck! Why am I still hungry!?” After he finished an entire boar leg in one go, Mo Ka patted his stomach and actually still felt hungry. Moreover, he wasn’t the only exception as practically everyone else was like him and had an appetite that far exceeded their usual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was even to the extent that the girls were no exception!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Besides being capable of eliminating the exhaustion in your bodies, the medicinal bath all of you soaked in today is capable of stimulating your appetite and coupled with the extremely high load of training all of you have had during these past two days, eating more than usual is normal. This is a good thing.” The nearby Xue Ying savored the roasted meat bit by bit as she casually explained the answer to the question in everyone’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Moreover, all of you will eat more and more in the future.” As soon as she finished speaking, the six female students stopped what they were doing, and they looked at their bodies with worried expressions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, so long as all of you don’t be lazy during training then not only would eating more not make all of you fat, it would promote your growth instead. After all, all of you are eating the meat of Magical Beasts, and ingredients like this are in great demand within Starnet Academy.” As someone experienced, Xue Ying was entirely aware of what the girls were worried about, and she directly dispelled their worry with a single sentence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Being able to eat without getting fat was probably one of the most tempting things to women, so Xue Ying had imperceptibly strengthened the resolution of the girls towards the training….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s standing watch tonight? I suggest that all of you better arrange two people to do it because it’s very likely that a single person would doze off.” Xue Ying didn’t choose someone directly and merely made a suggestion, and then all the male students looked at Bai Xiaofei in unison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wu Chi, Shi Kui, you two will stand watch tonight. Those will better physiques will start first, and the rest will take over after they get stronger in the future.” Bai Xiaofei was extraordinarily decisive because things like these were really not worthy of him wasting his brain cells.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After everyone ate their fill, the group greeted a rare moment of rest, or according to what Xue Ying said — </span><i><span style>All of you are free during the period after dinner and before sleep!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Freedom…. During these past two days, the members of the Savage Class had deeply realized how rare these two words were. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But, freedom was only relative in a place like the Infinite Mountain Range, so most of them chose to rest at the first possible moment. After all, they didn’t know how Xue Ying would torture them tomorrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei, on the other hand, didn’t return to his tent and walked to a slightly remote place while only being followed by Huskie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huskie, do you think the outside world is interesting?” As he looked up at the starry sky, Bai Xiaofei’s face couldn’t help but reveal a trace of a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Woof! Woof!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huskie barked excitedly while rubbing himself against Bai Xiaofei’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You glutton! All you know is to eat. If it wasn’t for me taking care of you, you would have been captured by Master Yi and made into dog hot pot since a long time ago.” As he rubbed Huskie’s head affectionately, Bai Xiaofei recalled his memories in the Gorge of Heroes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Are all my foster parents fine?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Would the Gorge of Heroes be boring without me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Question after question gushed into his heart yet before Bai Xiaofei could even think of an answer, the scenes of all these people were already replaced by his experiences during these past two days because every single person he’d come into contact with had left a deep impression in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Woof! Woof!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei was immersed in his own thoughts when Huskie suddenly barked while standing up on Bai Xiaofei’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he looked over along the direction Huskie was looking at, Xue Ying who wore tight clothes grinning at him, and under the moonlight, Xue Ying’s figure seemed breathtaking like a celestial maiden that had descended from the palace on the moon yet carried the playfulness of the jade hare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instantly, Bai Xiaofei was dazed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s already late in the night yet you aren’t sleeping, have you come here to feed the Magical beasts?” As she spoke, Xue Ying walked over to Bai Xiaofei’s side before sitting down slowly by his side, and a strand of faint refreshing fragrance entered into Bai Xiaofei’s nose along with this, causing him to be unable to help but feel a wave of restlessness. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Fellow, go play somewhere else.” Xue Ying patted Huskie’s head while she stared at him for two seconds, and then Huskie turned around and ran before vanishing without a trace in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the entire process, Bai Xiaofei was like a spectator, and he only recovered from his astonishment after Huskie had vanished without a trace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If someone told me that Huskie was your puppet and not mine, then I would surely believe that person.” Bai Xiaofei displayed his resentment as he sighed helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s because this beauty you’re talking to possesses boundless charm, and I conquer all male living beings.” Xue Ying raised her head up complacently, and she had once again become the playful big sister that wasn’t the slightest bit related to a teacher.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm, no wonder you didn’t come with us when we went to capture the Roar Boars today. So it turns out you were afraid they would take a fancy to you.” Bai Xiaofei puckered his lips and pretended to be serious as he spoke. In the next second, a slender hand had already pinched his waist, causing him to grimace in pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you say just now? My ears aren’t working too well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sister Xue is beautiful and moving, kindhearted and generous, and unrivaled in the world!” A string of praise escaped his mouth, and Bai Xiaofei received the safety of his life in exchange for this compromise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You still haven’t told me what you came here for?” Xue Ying withdrew her slender hand and asked a similar question one more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I miss my home, so I came over here to take a look because I can see the exact same starry sky from my home.” What Bai Xiaofei said was the truth because his home was the Infinite Mountain Range after all….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Home? How does it feel to have a family?” When she heard Bai Xiaofei mention this special word, Xue Ying’s mood instantly turned slightly dejected, and she asked a question that Bai Xiaofei had never heard in his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My situation is comparatively special. But, if the homes of ordinary people are like my home, then the feeling of having a family is probably very relaxed because no matter how unhappy you feel, you’ll feel relaxed when you’re with them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she looked at the smile on Bai Xiaofei’s face, Xue Ying’s eyes revealed a trace of yearning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If we have the chance, can you take me to your home to have a look?”</span></p>
