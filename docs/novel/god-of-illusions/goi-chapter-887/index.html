 <p>Chapter 887: Another Deal!</p> 
 <p>The wedding was held as scheduled. As the favorite daughter of the emperor, the ostentation and extravagance of Ling Ge’s wedding was absolutely unprecedented. At the same time, Yun Tianhe became a widely-sought figure in the imperial city.</p> 
 <p>As his best man, Bai Xiaofei was particularly conspicuous at the wedding. Surprisingly, this best man seldom communicated with people and focused more on eating.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s hope Huskie won’t expose himself, or I will strip his skin,” sighed the actual Bai Xiaofei as he snuck into the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain.</p> 
 <p>Blackie cast him a look of contempt. <em>As if that silly dog isn’t taught by you!</em></p> 
 <p>“Blackie, how is it?” Bai Xiaofei endured the contempt since he needed Blackie’s ability to scout the surroundings.</p> 
 <p>Blackie did not disappoint. A safe route immediately emerged in Bai Xiaofei’s mind.</p> 
 <p>“I thought everyone would leave, but they actually left some guards. Our advertisement work was not quite there, huh?” he complained upon realizing that he could not slack off and quickly moved forward.</p> 
 <p>According to distance, the closest to him, Pinocchio’s lair, was the first stop. After Bai Xiaofei bypassed the guard, he successfully arrived at his destination.</p> 
 <p>“What are you looking for? I can help you.” Golden Feather came out of the puppet space as soon as Bai Xiaofei stopped.</p> 
 <p>“The more complicated the puppet, the more diagrams are needed for its production. Since Ling Ge had put forward the requirement to check all of her guests’ storage items for safety reasons, our target would definitely leave such diagrams at home, and that’s what we’re looking for.” Bai Xiaofei would not act without thorough preparation.</p> 
 <p>The people of the Puppetsmith Holy Mountain would not doubt the emperor’s intentions because on the surface, all of his available personnel were present at the wedding scene, including ‘Bai Xiaofei.’</p> 
 <p>For nearly half an hour, the two searched the room without finding any suspicious diagrams and materials. Bai Xiaofei even scanned for grievances in the forging room.</p> 
 <p>“Does this prove that he is innocent?” Golden Feather was not bothered by the fact that they came out empty-handed. She considered this ruling out a suspect.</p> 
 <p>“No one can be proven innocent until the truth is in front of us.” With a smile, Bai Xiaofei headed to the next stop.</p> 
 <p>And then, the stop after that…</p> 
 <p>Using a day, he searched the residences of all the godsmiths and still found nothing.</p> 
 <p>“Can’t things like diagrams just be memorized?” Golden Feather suggested.</p> 
 <p>“I thought so as well and especially asked Yun Tianhe about this issue. He told me that forging human puppets is no small matter, there are thousands of cumbersome steps and even the very top-class puppetsmiths can’t remember them all. What’s more, what we’ve seen so far are obviously semi-finished products. In other words, that person is still experimenting,” replied Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Golden Feather couldn’t help but sigh. “In that case, we are looking in the wrong place, right?”</p> 
 <p>“Wait… Yeah! We may have come to the wrong place!” Bai Xiaofei’s eyes suddenly lit up at Golden Feather’s depressed words. Slapping his own head, he had decided on the next target. “Let’s go! To the public forging rooms!”</p> 
 <p>Golden Feather immediately understood what he meant.</p> 
 <p><em>How could someone carry out such a shady thing in their own home? The perfect place would be a public forging room where no one would know who have used it.</em></p> 
 <p>“But there are way more than just one or two public forging rooms here. I’m afraid the people here will return before we finish investigating them all,” Golden Feather reminded.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei mused on it a little and said as he walked, “First of all, the smith would need a lot of assistants to forge human puppets, so that place definitely can’t be small. Secondly, the hardest step in the process is forging the spirit, the materials of which vary and therefore require different temperatures for the fire, especially in the case of complex human spirits! So, except for the private forging room of the five godsmiths, the only public room that meets this condition is the central room that very few people go to!”</p> 
 <p>Before long, the two arrived at the central forging room.</p> 
 <p>Unlike other places, this place had no guards since no one could endure its high temperature for a long time and there was nothing to watch here.</p> 
 <p>“It should be this place. The grievances here are much stronger than in the ghost villages we went to before!” Bai Xiaofei exclaimed.</p> 
 <p>However, Golden Feather thought of a problem. “If so, all the human puppets came from this room. Then, why do they waste so much effort and go to the trouble to release them in all those different places? Isn’t that like shooting yourself in the foot? What good does that do for them?”</p> 
 <p>For once, Bai Xiaofei was stumped. This problem certainly had flashed through his mind before, but he hadn’t figured it out.</p> 
 <p>Originally, he thought that the ghost villages were remote testing grounds to avoid the eyes and ears of people, but those places did not meet the conditions for forging human puppets at all, so the human puppets had to be delivered there.</p> 
 <p>As for why the enemy released those defective products and left such an obvious trail, he still could not think of a reason no matter from what angle.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s think about this later. See if there are any clues here.” Bai Xiaofei set it aside and quickly searched the room.</p> 
 <p>However, the two searched for half a day without finding anything.</p> 
 <p>“Little guy, how about you agree to do one thing for me and I will show you what to look for?” the voice of the Demonic God of Pain rang out in Bai Xiaofei’s mind just when he was ready to give up.</p> 
 <p>“What do you want?” Bai Xiaofei was extremely cautious. Although the Demonic God of Pain had been reduced to only a body of consciousness and had helped him out before, Bai Xiaofei was not so foolish to think that one’s nature could be easily changed.</p> 
 <p>“I will help you with the human puppet problem, and you retain one soulless human puppet for me after this matter is over.”</p> 
 <p>It was impossible for the help of someone like the Demonic God of Fiend to come with good intentions. Bai Xiaofei was not a fool.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t need your help then.”</p> 
 <p>His reply threw the fiend into despair as the latter choked on his bellyful of alluring persuasion.</p> 
 <p>“Aren’t you in a hurry?! This concerns your half-brother!” The fiend really did not want to continue to exist in this state. He would be better off being killed directly.</p> 
 <p>“Compared with the human puppet thing, you are much more troublesome. Moreover, it’s not like I’m at a dead end. If I lie in wait here, that person will definitely show,” Bai Xiaofei said.</p> 
 <p>The fiend instantly panicked. Other people might not be able to stay in this room for a long time, but it was not a problem for Bai Xiaofei who could regard the core of the formation as a bathing pool.</p> 
 <p>“We both take a step back! You help me keep a human puppet, and when you think it’s okay, you let me out!” The Demonic God of Pain had waited so many years that he didn’t mind waiting some more as long as there was hope.</p> 
 <p>“This can be considered.” Bai Xiaofei smiled and released the fiend. “Alright, now tell me what I need to do.”</p> 
 <p>Seeing the sleazy smile on Bai Xiaofei’s face, the fiend just wanted to strangle him…</p> 
 <p>“Grievances are actually the lingering resentment of the dead. Ordinary people can’t feel the specific content of resentment, but you are different. Part of your energy is composed of resentment. As long as you focus, you may be able to get fragments of information you want from the resentment. Of course, this is only a possibility. Whether it can be realized or not depends on you,” said the Demonic God of Pain indifferently.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei was glad that he didn’t directly make a promise to this guy. <em>Damn you, so it still depends on this lord in the end, huh?!</em></p> 
 <p>Without hesitation, Bai Xiaofei focused and accelerated the Endless State. The grievances mixed with elements in the air were sucked into his body and quickly assimilated into his energy. Then, he submerged his consciousness into the grievances.</p> 
 <p>Two hours slowly passed… It had gotten dark outside and the marriage of Yun Tianhe and Ling Ge had concluded.</p> 
 <p>“He is not being swallowed up by resentment, is he?” Golden Feather couldn’t help but ask the Demonic God of Pain as she looked at the motionless Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>After knowing about the existence of the fiend, she unconsciously communicated with him more. Bai Xiaofei’s consciousness had become their secret room and the two oldies who had not communicated with the outside world for thousands of years gradually became acquaintances.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, resentment is a nutrient for him now. It is already good if he’s not addicted to swallowing resentment.” The fiend did not worry. He was more concerned about what progress Bai Xiaofei had made. As long as the human puppet matter remained unsolved, his new body would be far out of reach.</p> 
 <p>“Someone’s coming!” Golden Feather suddenly tensed. She released her spirit, and dozens of auras entered her perception.</p> 
 <p>“He can’t move! The messages within resentment can only be conveyed once! Where is that cat?!” The Demonic God of Pain also grew anxious.</p> 
 <p>Blackie immediately jumped out of the puppet space and used her ability to hide the group…</p>
