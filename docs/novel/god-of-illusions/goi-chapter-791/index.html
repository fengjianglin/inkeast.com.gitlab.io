 <p>Chapter 791: Battling Dragon King!</p> 
 <p>“Dark Dragon Day!”</p> 
 <p>A resounding dragon hum immediately gave Lin Li, who was fighting the bamboo siege, an oppressive feeling. She looked up and saw a ball of light rapidly approaching!</p> 
 <p>“Stand back!”</p> 
 <p>Just as Lin Li was about to counter the attack, Bai Xiaofei leaped up into the air and floated in front of her. Then, there was a brief silhouette of Golden Feather at the same time as Dragon King within the ball of light approaching right before their faces.</p> 
 <p>“Flame World Descends!” roared Bai Xiaofei, who turned into a huge fireball and met Dragon King’s attack head-on.</p> 
 <p>In a deafening explosion from their collision, Bai Xiaofei was smashed into the ground and Dragon King was sent flying. The first encounter ended with Bai Xiaofei seeming to be at a disadvantage.</p> 
 <p>However, Blood Wolf and Strong Steel were shocked silly. <em>He resisted that attack?! That’s Dragon King!!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Li Li, take them to help others. Tell everyone to not hide their real strength and try the hardest they can!” Bai Xiaofei stood up as if nothing happened at all. The expression on his face was not fear, but excitement.</p> 
 <p>He had been waiting for Dragon King. Because the guy had been hiding in the temporary alliance’s base, Bai Xiaofei didn’t dare to let Lin Li and others make a big scene as he wasn’t sure if they could handle this nine-aperture Exquisite Rank boss.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, all that he had personally been doing was for the purpose of forcing Dragon King out. After that, he would tackle Dragon King and enable the rest of his team to start the real harvesting!</p> 
 <p>However, there was one thing to be doubted about his plan, that was, whether Bai Xiaofei could tackle Dragon King!</p> 
 <p>“No wonder you dared to provoke this old man. Who could have thought you could take a blow from me? With this alone, you can already go around bragging about yourself.” Dragon King smiled, his face full of contempt. While the opponent was a little odd, he still found himself unable to take a puny Grandmaster Rank puppet master seriously. A few decades ago, he could crush this kind of character with one hand.</p> 
 <p>“I say, old man, you are a little too confident. To be honest, after beating even a Legend Rank, this lord cannot care less about someone like you,” Bai Xiaofei said this without batting an eye. He could even make a lie believable, let alone a fact. After all, the demon king did die to his hand.</p> 
 <p>However, this fact was a joke in the ears of Dragon King.</p> 
 <p>“Hahaha! Trying to kill me with your joke? Beating a Legend Rank? A loser like you?!”</p> 
 <p>After dishing out his opinion, Dragon King moved. His simple burst of energy alone tore the air and his speed could compare to that of Hu Xian’er. At least, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t react in time.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei did not need to. When fused with Golden Feather, he had perverse indiscriminate attacks.</p> 
 <p>“Prairie Fire!”</p> 
 <p>A sky-blotting flame spread from Bai Xiaofei, leaving the rapidly approaching Dragon King no time to dodge. However, he did not intend to either…</p> 
 <p>Another deafening explosion shook the area. Bai Xiaofei was blown away again, but Golden Feather’s phoenix fire successfully burned Dragon King.</p> 
 <p>Dragon King still felt that he took a win. In his opinion, his punch could even render a Grandmaster Rank martial artist half-dead, not to mention a Grandmaster Rank puppet master.</p> 
 <p>However, before Dragon King could celebrate, Bai Xiaofei wiped the blood at the corners of his mouth and staggered to his feet.</p> 
 <p>“Old man, your strength is lacking. You can’t even kill a puny Grandmaster Rank like me.” Bai Xiaofei smiled as his wounds healed at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Dragon King widened his eyes in shock. <em>What is this healing speed? What’s going on?! Is he really a puppet master?!</em></p> 
 <p>Dragon King gnashed his teeth. “Brat, I’ll see if you can still recover after I blow you to bits.”</p> 
 <p>With his declaration was the surging of energy in his body. Facing this, Bai Xiaofei’s expression turned serious for the first time since the start of the battle.</p> 
 <p><em>This old fart is getting serious!</em></p> 
 <p>“Aunt Gold, are you sure we can withstand it?” Looking at the ready-to-go Dragon King, Bai Xiaofei was uncertain. If he forced himself and used Blackie or Huskie, he gave himself a 40% chance of winning, but he could not tell with Golden Feather, especially after they were just injured.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, immortality is the feature of the phoenix clan, while you yourself have great physical quality and self-recovery in addition to the phoenix blood in you. People of his level can’t kill you,” Golden Feather’s voice echoed in Bai Xiaofei’s sea of consciousness.</p> 
 <p>Swallowing a mouthful of saliva, Bai Xiaofei turned his focus back on Dragon King.</p> 
 <p><em>This shall be the deciding round! Come on, let this lord see who will collapse first!</em></p> 
 <p>Letting out a savage roar, the flames covering Bai Xiaofei flared bigger. The next second, Dragon King came at him with a stormy combo attack!</p> 
 <p>“Nine Dragon Art! Mad Dragon Move!”</p> 
 <p>The feeling of one’s flesh being punched repeatedly was something that Bai Xiaofei gave to others, but now he could finally say to have a thorough taste of it.</p> 
 <p><em>It really hurts!!!</em></p> 
 <p>Every blow from Dragon King made him vomit blood. If Bai Xiaofei weren’t covering his weak points, he would have already passed out.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, despite crushing Bai Xiaofei, Dragon King was not in a good mood. After the first punch, Bai Xiaofei’s wound had already recovered before the second punch could land. At the same time, the flames that swathed Bai Xiaofei kept burning him, his energy armor was ineffective like an illusion and did not reduce any damage at all.</p> 
 <p>Just like that, Dragon King beat Bai Xiaofei all the way from the ground to the sky and then back into the ground. In the end, Dragon King was the first to be unable to stand it anymore and stopped.</p> 
 <p>As the scorched Dragon King backed away, Blood Wolf and Strong Steel, who had retreated and were watching from a distance, felt their hearts turn cold.</p> 
 <p><em>After that kind of attack, even a god would be dead!</em></p> 
 <p>No one knew if a god would die from that, but Bai Xiaofei did, alive and kicking even.</p> 
 <p>“Old man, didn’t you eat?” He cracked his neck and mocked in a tone that was asking for a beating.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Dragon King didn’t want to beat him up anymore. Despite being able to resist the fire to some extent, he did not have an abnormal recovery ability like Bai Xiaofei nor did he know if Bai Xiaofei’s recovery had a limit. At this rate, he would really be roasted if he continued.</p> 
 <p>For the first time, Dragon King grew anxious.</p> 
 <p><em>Could it be that this boy got that youngster’s immortal ability?!</em> Upon this thought, Dragon King gulped and his eyes glowed with greed. <em>Kill him, I must kill him! If I have this ability, I will be invincible!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Brat, this time, you will surely die!”</p>
