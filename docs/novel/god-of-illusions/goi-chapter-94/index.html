<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>A month was neither short nor long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After getting through the initial busy period, the matters of the Blossom Rankings and New Student Mutual Aid Community had successively stepped onto the right path, and besides some special matters, the Savage Class became free once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past month, everyone had become fully aware of the power of beauties. After Bai Xiaofei proposed the assignments of the Blossom Rankings, there was a continuous stream of people paying a visit to him every single day, and eight out of ten were boss level figures!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, at the same time that Bai Xiaofei gained a large amount of wealth, he obtained the good impression of the various bosses as well. After all, without Bai Xiaofei, they might not have the chance to have a meal with the beauties on the Blossom Rankings for their entire lifetimes. But now, they could as long as they completed the three assignments Bai Xiaofei proposed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, it only looked like this on the surface. Actually, whether they were able to get the girl depended on themselves. But, besides Bai Xiaofei and the senior sisters on the Blossom Rankings, no one else knew this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, it was a trade secret!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for whether anyone suspected it, there was utterly no need to worry because under Bai Xiaofei’s recommendations, three senior sisters had already been taken!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Living proof was right there, so Bai Xiaofei’s business would only get better and better. After all, who wouldn’t want to get a beautiful and strong wife!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, there were some ignorant seniors that acted arrogantly and even threatened Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without exception, all of them were hung before the door of the Blossom Pavilion, and it was Yun Jingshuang who did it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who would have imagined that Yun Jingshuang who seemed more feminine that a girl would actually be a rare ice Energy Stream puppet master!? Moreover, his strength could only be described as terrifying!</span><span style>All in all, in the past month, everything was developing like how Bai Xiaofei had described to Yun Jingshuang on that day, and both of them earned a large sum of wealth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other side, along with the passage of time, the New Student Mutual Aid Community’s membership fees were collected as well, and there was utterly no need for Bai Xiaofei to urge them because the various people in charge below him would directly send it over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first glance, it seemed no different than protection money, but there was something that was completely different from it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Protection money was handed over passively, whereas, membership fees were basically handed over out of their own free will!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, those days of paying protection money were days of being in a state of anxiety because even if one had paid the fees, one would still suffer bullying when the time came.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, the New Student Mutual Aid Community was different!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Firstly, the fees were merely half of the protection fees from before. Secondly, besides carrying out some games which caused one to be unable to stop yet was painful and delightful at the same time, he wouldn’t do anything excessive to the new students.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, it would be an entirely different story if someone caused trouble….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, so long as one was a member of the New Student Mutual Aid Community, then if one was bullied, one only had to report it and it would surely be dealt with in the first possible moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless of if the opponent was a first year student or a second year student, Bai Xiaofei had even brought some people along and deal with some ignorant third year students!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Simply speaking, Bai Xiaofei allowed all the new students to live days that they didn’t dare believe was possible in the past!</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, they willingly handed over this fee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fang Ye, is our money sufficient now?” The members of the Savage Class were seated together, and their lunch was still take away because the members of the Savage Class hadn’t gone to the canteen during this entire month….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Some people can buy their third puppets.” As soon as Fang Ye spoke, everyone was delighted because they knew that they’d earned a great deal, but they never expected it would be so much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, when Fang Ye said they could buy a third puppet, it was under the precondition that the grades of everyone’s second puppet wasn’t low!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because the standard Bai Xiaofei set was at least at the violet-grade!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s the selection of your puppets going? Are there suitable puppets in the academy for all of you?” Bai Xiaofei asked another question as he turned around to look at the others. There was merely less than a month before the New Student Competition began, whereas, everyone had to familiarize themselves with their puppets, so the purchase of their puppets had to be done as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ve finished choosing, and those of us that couldn’t find anything suitable have gotten in touch with the store. At this moment, they ought to have brought in some suitable puppets.” The person that answered was still Fang Ye, and he’d already completely taken the position of treasurer and logistics manager for the Savage Class….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then we’ll go over today!” Bai Xiaofei decided, and everyone cheered at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They’d waited for an entire month and had finally waited until this moment arrived!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Fei, I never saw you going to choose a puppet. Do you have a target for your second puppet?” Xing Nan carried a wisp of bewilderment on his face. All this while, besides entertaining the seniors that came to gain permission from him, Bai Xiaofei had only been going shopping with Lin Li and Xue Ying, and he would also vanish inexplicably sometimes. But, Xing Nan had never seen Bai Xiaofei going to places that he could choose puppets at.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m temporarily incapable of forming an agreement with a second puppet….” Bai Xiaofei revealed a bitter smile and spoke of a secret that wasn’t really a secret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could that be possible?! Didn’t you attain the Proficient Rank a long time ago? Moreover, the thickness of your Origin Energy is far superior to all of us!” As he roared with surprise, Xing Nan expressed the common view of everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right. Moreover, your brain is so good. You don’t seem like someone that doesn’t have the mental capacity!” Mo Ka added. He seemed to be flattering Bai Xiaofei, but he was actually speaking the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Ka would believe it if any other person was said to be too slow-witted and incapable of possessing a second puppet, but he would never believe it if it was Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have some special circumstances, and all of you wouldn’t understand even if I told you. There’s no need to be anxious, I’ll possess a second puppet one day. Moreover, isn’t it enough if all of you are formidable, I’m not of the fighting type anyway.” Bai Xiaofei laughed and directly jumped over this topic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t tell them that he needed a woman to form an agreement with a second puppet, right? It sounded like nonsense no matter who heard it….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But….” Mo Ka still wanted to say something, but it was stopped by a stare from Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need for buts. I said there’s no rush, so there’s no rush. There’s no need to linger on this problem. Quickly eat your foot and we’ll go buy things right after!” Since a gentle approach didn’t work, Bai Xiaofei used force because their curiosity had to be stopped, otherwise, his image would crumble….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Bai Xiaofei’s image amongst those of the Savage Class was already horrible….</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they jumped past this incident with Bai Xiaofei, all of them carried their excitement while running towards the shopping district in the academy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All along the way, all of them kept silent about the puppets they’d chosen because they wanted to give everyone a pleasant surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it because I haven’t bashed all of you up for a long time that you’ve forgotten who’s the boss of this class? All of you asked me to help check the goods, yet you actually came so late!” As a familiar voice resounded out, Xue Ying who merely wore a black colored tube top and shorts beneath her teacher’s cloak spoke angrily before the entrance to the Ethereal Pavilion. Especially when she looked at Bai Xiaofei, a trace of ruthlessness even appeared within her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sister Xue, how could we dare!? All of us were preparing ourselves well because we hadn’t seen you for a long time. Look, don’t we seem much more spirited!?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>As the saying goes, it’s impossible to have the heart to punish one who has admitted his mistakes. For the sake of not being beaten up, Bai Xiaofei smiled every single time he met Xue Ying to the point his face almost had cramps….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really have a way with words. Forget it, I’ll let all of you off this time because it’s an important day for all of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the ‘magnanimous’ Xue Ying spoke, her gloomy expression brightened up, and then she turned around and strode through the entrance of Ethereal Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Bai Xiaofei and the others were filled with lofty sentiments and aspirations as they stood before the entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once we enter, the Savage Class will be ascending to a new level!</span></p>
