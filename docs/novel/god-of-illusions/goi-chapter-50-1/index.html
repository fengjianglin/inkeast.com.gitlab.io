<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei’s words instantly jolted everyone awake. </span><i><span style>Tents….</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>There seems to only be a single place nearby the academy that requires tents, the Infinite Mountain Range!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When they thought up to here, a drop of cold sweat couldn’t help but flow out of everyone’s foreheads. </span><i><span style>Could it be that we’re really going there? Moreover, we’re going to stay outside?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Instantly, pure waiting had become a period of waiting for judgment once again. Even if there was a very close guess for this approaching judgment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Xue Ying was very swift as well, and it wasn’t long after she left that she ran back while beaming with excitement. Based on her expression, her plan ought to have gone smoothly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go.” Xue Ying spat out two words lightly before leading the way, and the direction she went was really towards the academy’s entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sister Xue, where are we going?” Chen Hui had a serious expression as he gulped down a mouthful of saliva, and Bai Xiaofei’s words from before were still reverberating within his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haven’t all of you guessed it already, why do you still ask?” Xue Ying grinned and didn’t answer him directly, and she continued walking with large strides towards the entrance of the academy while the hearts of everyone behind her had already fallen to rock bottom.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s actually true….</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello Teacher, what’re you…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they arrived at the entrance, they were stopped by the group of first year students standing guard there. Xue Ying didn’t hesitate in the slightest to directly retrieve a thin piece of paper. The content of it wasn’t important, but the exceedingly clear words ‘Lei Shan’ at the lower left corner was suffused with a slight fluctuation of lightning element Origin Energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sort of special signature couldn’t be faked. In other words, Xue Ying had already obtained Lei Shan’s agreement!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please go ahead.” As they opened up a path, the seniors that stood on guard at the entrance sized up Bai Xiaofei and the others who were exiting in single file with curious gazes, and they couldn’t help but reveal slight shock when they saw this group of people were still wearing the uniform of new students.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck! Are these people going out to give away their lives?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Under the focused gazes of these seniors, the members of the Savage Class whose hearts were filled with bitterness were really going out to become savages this time….</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they exited the academy entrance, Xue Ying scanned her surrounding as she walked ahead. After almost two hours, Xue Ying stopped at a place the group was unable to see the academy at all. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right here.” Xue Ying let out a long breath of air as she sized up the environment in the surroundings while feeling extremely pleased, and then she withdrew the tents she’d bought earlier from her spatial ring. There were a total of 20 tents, and they piled up into a large heap on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll give all of you an hour to set up the tens because we have other things to do later. Of course, all of you can delay. But, if that happens, then all of you will have to gaze at stars as you sleep tonight. As for the academy, all of you can dream of going back. I’ve already notified the principal that the classes for the next month have already been strung together.” She directly cut off their way of retreat, and Xue Ying had already sent all of them into an impasse where they had no choice. The only way to survive was to listen to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like she’d said, so long as they’d chose to follow her to train, then they couldn’t dream of giving up halfway!</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the sake of not sleeping out in the open, all of them acted instantly, even if their limbs were weak right now….</span></p>
 <p><span style>After burying themselves in work for another hour, 20 tents had already been set up when everyone stopped working, and this was something that even they didn’t dare believe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, Ming One and Ming Two had to be given great thanks. For some unknown reason, the two of them were actually familiar and skilled in setting up tents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a clear distinction between he finished tents on the two sides. One side belonged to the males while the other side belonged to the females while also being used to store the medicinal materials. Another two more tents were empty, and they were temporarily unaware of what Xue Ying wanted them for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Next is the benefit segment, and all of you will surely like it.” Xue Ying withdrew an entire 20 water barrels from her spatial ring as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Place six within the forest on the left, 10 in the forest on the right, and place the remaining four at the center of our campsite. Now, everyone go fetch water and fill up all the water barrels. Bring all of them to the center of the campsite first once they’ve been filled. Mo Ka, you stay behind.” As she activated her commanding mode once again, as she successively gave out orders that caused all of them to be unable to discern where the benefit was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, the group of people that already had no choice acted right away, and only Mo Ka stayed behind while feeling perturbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he could choose, Mo Ka would rather be manual labor like Bai Xiaofei and the other because staying behind alone with Xue Ying was truly too tormenting….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You intend to be an alchemist, right?” When faced with such a simple question from Xue Ying, Mo Ka couldn’t help but be stunned because he’d already prepared himself to receive an extremely difficult assignment….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“right….” Mo Ka’s tone carried a trace of lack of confidence and was deeply afraid he said a single thing wrongly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then the first puppet you chose is surely a medicinal cauldron, right? Take it out and let me see.” Xue Ying grinned as she gave him a simple assignment once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Ka who still hadn’t realized what Xue Ying intended to do took very obediently took out his palm sized medicinal cauldron from his pocket. Along with his Origin Energy being poured in, the medicinal cauldron was suffused with a yellow glow and started to gradually become the size of a person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The expansion and shrinking of size were a basic function of all puppet medicinal cauldrons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Ka’s yellow-grade medicinal cauldron was purchased with all the wealth he’d accumulated, and it was already rather rare for a newbie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the biggest it can become?” Xue Ying’s face obviously revealed a trace of joy when she saw Mo Ka’s medicinal cauldron was actually at the yellow-grade, but her subsequent question caused Mo Ka to be slightly stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it becomes too big, then it will become difficult to control the heart….” As he spoke of basic knowledge for Alchemists, Mo Ka still hadn’t figured the situation out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know, and it’s fine. Just make it bigger.” Xue Ying hurriedly urged him on while carrying a trace of anticipation on her face, whereas, the helpless Mo Ka could only follow as she said, and he poured in his Mastery Rank Origin Energy, causing the medicinal cauldron to start expanding madly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the blink of an eye, Mo Ka’s medicinal cauldron had already expanded to the extent it was as tall as a two floor building.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can only make it this big for now. Making it even bigger wouldn’t be a problem of heat but I wouldn’t even be able to maintain it.” As a layer of fine beads of sweat emerged on his forehead, Mo Ka had really tried his best already.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm, you can make it slightly smaller because it would still be sufficient like that.” Xue Ying revealed a satisfied smile as she patted Mo Ka’s medicinal cauldron because everything was moving according to her plan!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, Mo Ka wanted to ask Xue Ying what she wanted to do. But, he refrained from doing so in the end because he wasn’t fearless like Bai Xiaofei….</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, before long, he knew why he didn’t have to go collect water. Because he had an even more ‘arduous’ assignment….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Along with barrel after barrel of water was fetched back, the assignment of the 15 others had been completed, and all of them entered ‘staring blankly mode’ as they looked at Mo Ka’s medicinal cauldron.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s this about?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, leave four barrels of water behind and pour the others into the medicine cauldron!” As soon as Xue Ying finished speaking, Mo Ka suddenly had a bad premonition….</span></p>
