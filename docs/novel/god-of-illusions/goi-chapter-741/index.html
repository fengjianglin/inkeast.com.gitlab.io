 <p>Chapter 741: Peace Breaker!</p> 
 <p>The days before parting always passed the fastest. The last day came with Bai Xiaofei feeling that he still hadn’t been able to say goodbye to everyone.</p> 
 <p>Once upon a time, every student in the third and fourth year couldn’t wait to leave Starnet by any means in order to return to the bustling outside world. However, when the day they could finally leave for real arrived, none of the graduates wanted to leave. They hated that they could not stay for just a few more days.</p> 
 <p>Such were humans, only knowing how to cherish something after losing it.</p> 
 <p>The new managing group of the Student Community had properly arranged everything in an orderly fashion, and Bai Xiaofei’s so-called monitor group was basically useless. Reality had shown that the new generation did not disappoint Lei Shan.</p> 
 <p>To Bai Xiaofei’s delight, because of the graduation ceremony, those who were outside all hurriedly returned, making the day an exceptional reunion, especially for Fang Ye!</p> 
 <p>Ever since Illusion Demon started, Fang Ye had been ceaselessly helping around. In a sense, his studies in Starnet had ended ahead of schedule.</p> 
 <p>“Feeling like you’re beaten by the younger generations?” Fang Ye couldn’t help but tease Bai Xiaofei as he looked at the well-organized square.</p> 
 <p>Not only the grand-looking venue, but the ceremony included all kinds of small activities, which were no less innovative than Bai Xiaofei’s events during his most active time.</p> 
 <p>“I’m afraid you think too much. Consider carefully, what’s the difference between these activities and those organized by me back then?” Bai Xiaofei sneered.</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye was stunned. After thinking for a little, he found the key point.</p> 
 <p>Before, every activity organized by Bai Xiaofei made a whole lot of money, and it had also been the initial goal of the Student Community’s establishment. Now, however, although the students’ new ideas were better than Bai Xiaofei, they were actually confined to school activities and earned them nothing apart from fame.</p> 
 <p>Upon realization, Fang Ye burst out laughing. “<a href="https://www.learnwitholiver.com/chinese/translate-sentence-664" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Old ginger is spicier</a> indeed!” he sincerely commented with a sigh.</p> 
 <p>“But for Starnet, they may be more suitable.” After conquering Fang Ye, Bai Xiaofei revealed a happy smile.</p> 
 <p>“Nah, you just think that there’s nothing else to squeeze out of Starnet!” Fang Ye hit the bull’s eye in one sentence. </p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s magnanimous-looking smile instantly became sleazy. “Oh? You seem to have learned quite a lot of things outside, huh? Saw right through me! I need to have a talk with Big Brother Feng about this, or my friend will become a crafty fox at this rate!”</p> 
 <p>Then, the two big kids laughed and gave each other an affectionate bear hug…</p> 
 <p>“My dear students, today, you will leave Starnet and embark on a new journey…”</p> 
 <p>In the center of the square, Lei Shan had started his farewell speech. Facing him were the graduates who stood at the very front. Everyone listened quietly and no one made a noise. Except for sobs, of course…</p> 
 <p>When Lei Shan’s speech finally came to an end, the students began to hug and cry. There were brothers and sisters making promises to meet again, and couples whispering their last words of love. At that moment, the square became a heart-breaking place.</p> 
 <p>“Aren’t you seeing them off?” Standing on the roof, a puzzled Fang Ye asked Bai Xiaofei while searching for familiar faces in the crowd below.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t have the courage,” Bai Xiaofei said the most cowardly words in the most righteous tone possible.</p> 
 <p>Even after the experience he had gained during all this time, Fang Ye was struck dumb for half a day. And there he was, so naïve as to think that Bai Xiaofei had a complicated reason!</p> 
 <p>“Then what are you going to…”</p> 
 <p>“Hide, of course!”</p> 
 <p>Before Fang Ye could finish his question, Bai Xiaofei delivered another blow and then abided by it. Fang Ye still hadn’t returned to his senses when Bai Xiaofei summoned Purple Luan and flew away!</p> 
 <p>“I’ll leave it to you. If they ask where I went, just make something up. I’ll be back in half a month!” Bai Xiaofei’s voice echoed from the distance.</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye was thrown into chaos. <em>What the hell was that?! I will be torn apart, alright!?</em></p> 
 <p>At this thought, Fang Ye couldn’t help but gulp. He didn’t even dare to think of how many people wanted to see Bai Xiaofei one last time. Being torn apart might already be the best result…</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei really carried out what he had said. In the next three days, no matter who looked for him, he never showed up. What’s more, it was as if he had told everyone that Fang Ye knew where he had gone, even Hu Xian’er came to ask Fang Ye what he was doing.</p> 
 <p>Facing this situation, Fang Ye bit the bullet and made up a random reason.</p> 
 <p>Just like that, after Fang Ye took half a month of mountainous damage and the graduates all left Starnet, Bai Xiaofei finally returned.</p> 
 <p>It looked as if nothing had happened. Everyone devoted themselves to a new season of study. However, Fang Ye saw clearly as a bystander: Bai Xiaofei had changed…</p> 
 <p>Not for better or worse, he only became less easily seen through. It felt that overnight, he had hidden a lot of things. Despite still laughing with everyone at times, more often, he started to stay alone quietly.</p> 
 <p>This state lasted for a whole month until the appearance of a person broke this suffocating calm.</p> 
 <p>The person was not anyone’s acquaintance. However, what happened to him plunged the whole academy into panic and discussion.</p> 
 <p>On that day, that thin person hurriedly arrived at Starnet begging for help, but before he could say more than a few words, he exploded into a cloud of blood without warning!</p> 
 <p>From his body, five huge blood-red meaty worms crawled out before drying up speedily and turning into glittering blood-red diamonds!</p> 
 <p>Just like that, peace was broken…</p>
