 <p>Chapter 772: Money is to be Spent!</p> 
 <p>“We are sorry for the long wait, and offer our greatest gratitude to you all for coming all the way to our auction. Alright, I’ll skip the courtesies, I know you don’t like it. Let the auction start!”</p> 
 <p>Because Qing Ya was arranged as Bai Xiaofei’s temporary assistant, Qing Han could only step out and host the auction personally. If anything, he was still its former chief auctioneer.</p> 
 <p>With the announcement, the auction hall immediately became excited. Looking around, the spacious first floor was full of people, all of whom had certain economic power. Those who didn’t have the wealth to pass Unify Business’ inspection could not have entered this hall.</p> 
 <p>In other words, all those sitting here were money!</p> 
 <p>“Let us welcome our first item!” said Qing Han.</p> 
 <p>A female staff then wheeled out a small cart, on which was a box of around 40-centimeter square covered in red cloth.</p> 
 <p>“This item comes from an Exquisite Rank puppet master. Martial artists and honored guests who are concerned about physical health, please be prepared.” Qing Han pulled off the red cloth, and at the same time, information about the item appeared on a light screen in front of the guests.</p> 
 <p>“Elf Nectar, a special liquid that strengthens internal organs when taken orally, and external application can strengthen bones and muscles. The better the physical quality of the user, the better the effect. Elf Nectar is a rare item that is not restricted by ranks, a blessing for all martial artists,” explained Qing Ya. The information she provided was much more detailed than that on the light screen.</p> 
 <p>During this, the bids had increased to five times the starting price!</p> 
 <p>“Quite many martial artists here, huh?” Bai Xiaofei smiled and pressed the bid button. Moments later, his voice echoed throughout the hall.</p> 
 <p>“Fifty million Amethyst Coins.”</p> 
 <p>The hall then fell into dead silence.</p> 
 <p><em>What the hell was that?! The previous bid was only 8 million and the starting price was only 1.6 million! How can he bid like that?!</em></p> 
 <p>Although Elf Nectar was rare, its effect was in fact limited for most puppet masters who seldomly cared about improving their physical quality. Only martial artists would go crazy about it, and martial artists were too poor compared to puppet masters.</p> 
 <p>“Young Master Bai, could it have been a mistake? If so, I can apply for a change for you.” Not to mention the personnel in the auction, even Qing Ya was in disbelief.</p> 
 <p><em>Didn’t you want me here to help you save money? If not, why would you want to appoint me? For decoration?!</em></p> 
 <p>Despite her natural manner, Qing Ya’s heart was in turmoil.</p> 
 <p>“No mistake. Its value may be average for others, but for me, it is worth that much. More importantly, I am too lazy to compete,” Bai Xiaofei said nonchalantly and took a sip of wine as Rui Mengqi gently massaged his shoulders.</p> 
 <p><em>I see! This one here is a real boss!</em></p> 
 <p>Without any surprise, the Elf Nectar went to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Today’s auction is really a bit unexpected. Dear guests, I think you have strong competition today. If you want to get your favorite auction item, you’d better carefully measure your wallet.” Qing Han quickly recovered from his stupor and even conveniently used Bai Xiaofei to heat up the atmosphere. “Unify Business can accept goods on the spot and help you achieve your needs at any time!”</p> 
 <p>After promoting Unify Business, Qing Han returned to the topic.</p> 
 <p>“Now to the next item, I wonder if everyone is interested in gun puppets?”</p> 
 <p>Qing Han opened a long wooden, revealing a long crystal gun. The body of the gun was dark-purple, so dark that it seemed to suck in the light around.</p> 
 <p>“Inheritance gun puppet, Into Oblivion. However, its uniqueness lies in the fact that it is never voluntarily passed down by its masters. When creating this puppet, Nan Mosheng made it a compulsory inheritance, therefore, its owner has been changing all the time, and therefore, it has been nicknamed the Unreal Gun.”</p> 
 <p><em>A cursed gun! Nan Moqing really spared nothing to cheat people!</em></p> 
 <p>Nan Moqing was the one who created Into Oblivion. Bai Xiaofei suddenly took an interest in this creative puppet master as he sketched an unscrupulous image of the person in his mind.</p> 
 <p>To his surprise, no one called a bid!</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei quickly understood. None of the puppet masters present were simple characters. They should either already have a complete puppet collection or at least a clear direction for one. After being passed down many times, Into Oblivion was powerful to a terrifying degree, but few were interested in changing puppets.</p> 
 <p>In addition, as far as the compulsory inheritance feature was concerned, anyone who owned it would have to live in fear!</p> 
 <p>“One million Amethyst Coins.” Bai Xiaofei once again pressed the bid button and became the center of attention.</p> 
 <p>No one competed this time, but many were eyeing him. <em>This is someone we can rob!</em></p> 
 <p>If they knew that Mind Sunder was in his hands as well, ‘we can rob’ would probably become ‘we must rob.’</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei took the second item, the atmosphere reached new heights with rare props being pushed out one after another, dazzling the eyes with their powerful effects.</p> 
 <p>Every single time the bidding was so fierce to the point that a fight was expected. And every time, Bai Xiaofei forcefully ended the bidding by raising the last price fivefold, and this continued to the seventh item!</p> 
 <p>“F*ck! What the hell is that guy upstairs, an Amethyst Coin-making machine? Spending hundreds of millions in such a short time!”</p> 
 <p>“Are you sure he’s not here to spoil the auction? Is your business sure that he has that much money?!”</p> 
 <p>“That’s right, there’s definitely something wrong about him. We want to see him pay now!”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>Finally, those who failed to obtain their ideal items could no longer bear it. Curses and various demands were thrown at Qing Han on the stage, giving him no chance to introduce the seventh item at all.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, Bai Xiaofei pressed the button, and his domineering voice echoed through the whole hall, “Rubbish, don’t think that I am poor like you. I have as much money as I want. And what you are worried about will not happen at all, because I have paid for every item directly,” he paused a little. “Money, after all, is to be spent, no?”</p>
