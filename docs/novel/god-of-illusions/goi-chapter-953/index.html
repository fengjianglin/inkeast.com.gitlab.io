 <p>Chapter 953: Tan Xin’s Realization!</p> 
 <p>“What are you looking at? Do you think you won’t have to share the blame if you don’t do anything?”</p> 
 <p>After knocking down the two guards, Bai Xiaofei turned to Zhu Chunyang, who had already regretted his decision to side with Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p><em>Why do I feel like I’ve fallen into a trap?!</em></p> 
 <p>“You don’t plan to fight all the way in, do you? If you really disturb all the people here, we’ll never be able to get away with it.” Zhu Chunyang swallowed hard as his eyes scanned the surroundings warily.</p> 
 <p>“Of course I’m not that stupid. Besides, don’t you think that’d take too long?” Bai Xiaofei walked into the house.</p> 
 <p>Before long, the man inside was brought out.</p> 
 <p>“You understand what I said? If you do it well, I’ll give you the antidote,” Bai Xiaofei said to the man.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the man bowed to him and quickly ran away.</p> 
 <p>This scene made Zhu Chunyang frown. “What did you say to him?” he asked curiously.</p> 
 <p>“You will know soon,” replied Bai Xiaofei as he headed to the next dark house. Just like that, he released several more men.</p> 
 <p>Before long, the whole place was thrown into chaos. Only then did Zhu Chunyang understand what Bai Xiaofei was doing – He had told the men he released to cause a commotion!</p> 
 <p>As smoke and fire rose in all directions, the soldiers guarding the dark houses all fled their posts one by one. Although the dark houses were all locked up, the locks were nothing in front of Bai Xiaofei’s golden flame despite how strong they were.</p> 
 <p>In less than an hour, Bai Xiaofei had released all the captured men before taking Zhu Chunyang to flee the place as well.</p> 
 <p>By the time the girl called Tong’er reacted, it was already too late.</p> 
 <p>“Chief, there’s only one person who has not run,” a soldier came running to report to the raging Tong’er.</p> 
 <p>“Drag him out and behead him so that he can’t run like the rest! You just can’t give men face!” she roared. However, she suddenly remembered something and called back the soldier. “Wait, which one?”</p> 
 <p>“The one you personally brought back the day before yesterday,” replied the soldier.</p> 
 <p>The young girl furrowed her brows. “I’ll go and check!” she said and rushed out. Soon, she arrived at the dark house where Bai Xiaofei was supposed to be kept.</p> 
 <p>Seeing ‘Bai Xiaofei’ sitting obediently on the chair, the girl instantly resumed her high and mighty bearing.</p> 
 <p>“So many people have run away, why didn’t you run as well?” she asked lightly.</p> 
 <p>However, to her shock, ‘Bai Xiaofei’ turned into a dog right before her eyes!</p> 
 <p>“You’ve finally come, I’ve been waiting forever. My unscrupulous master wanted me to tell you that children should be playing house, and violence is not conducive to your development. If you want to find him, he will be waiting for you at the capital to help your sister educate you,” said Huskie.</p> 
 <p>Then, ignoring the girl who was so furious that her head almost emitted smoke, he disappeared in a flicker.</p> 
 <p>Standing in the empty room as Huskie’s words echoed in her ears and Bai Xiaofei’s face flashed in her mind, the girl trembled, her expression couldn’t be uglier.</p> 
 <p>“FICKLE BAI!! YOU SHALL DIE!!!”</p> 
 <p>A turbulent murderous intent shot to the sky. Too bad that the faraway Bai Xiaofei could only use his imagination to guess the girl’s reaction.</p> 
 <p>“Chief, Her Royal Highness Ye Xi is here.” Another guard came to report. Although she didn’t want to trigger the girl while she was still angry, she had no choice.</p> 
 <p>“What is she doing here? Did she come to see me make a fool of myself?” The girl snorted as she vented her anger on the guard.</p> 
 <p>“Her Royal Highness Ye Xi seems to be in a hurry. It seems… that it’s because of…” The soldier hesitated, not daring to mention Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, no need to say. I know what she’s here for. Tell everyone to pack up. We are going to the capital!” the girl coldly ordered.</p> 
 <p>Then, she walked out toward the hall where she saw Ye Xi.</p> 
 <p>“It’s been a long time, Second Sister. What is a general like you doing in my shitty little place? Oh, wait, I heard that you were removed from your post? Now you are what, an internal minister or something?”</p> 
 <p>From the girl’s sarcastic tone, it was obvious that she didn’t have much affection for her second sister.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t try to provoke me, you know it’s useless. Moreover, don’t even think about wasting my time. You know very well why I came here!” Ye Xi looked extremely sullen. The word ‘patience’ had nothing to do with her at the moment.</p> 
 <p>“Putting on the sister act again! I, Ye Tong, no longer belong to your so-called royal family now, so don’t even think about using it to pressure me!“ roared Ye Tong out of anger for Ye Xi’s attitude as well as Huskie’s words just now.</p> 
 <p>“You think you’re no longer one of us just because you say so? Every single day you live on this earth, the blood in your veins is the same as ours. You are forever a member of Moonlight’s royal family!” Ye Xi mercilessly refuted.</p> 
 <p>Ye Tong’s face turned beet-red. She had never been able to win against her second sister in a bicker. The latter was always too… proper!</p> 
 <p>“You’re here for that man, aren’t you? You’ve really given Moonlight a slap in the face. Have you forgotten our history?” Ye Tong immediately changed the topic and began to attack Ye Xi from a different angle.</p> 
 <p>“I can’t care less about your stupid quarrel, but can you not delay me looking for my servant? Even if you are royalty, you can’t interfere with my private property!” Tan Xin raged. Although surprised by the fact that the two women were royals, she didn’t have the heart to care.</p> 
 <p>“You guys are too late then,” Ye Tong icily uttered with a snort.</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean! What did you do to Lil’ Bai?! I warn you, if anything happens to him, I will massacre your entire Moonlight!!” Tan Xin erupted in fury. However, at the end of it, she froze.</p> 
 <p>Just now, she had forgotten about her original intention of approaching Bai Xiaofei. And it was that moment that the sense of unwellness that this world had imposed on her vanished…</p> 
 <p>Her eyes reddened.</p> 
 <p><em>So I’ve been going in the wrong direction… But why do I feel that it’s much better now?</em></p> 
 <p>The realization made her face flash with a hint of sadness. Quickly gathering herself, Tan Xin looked at Ye Tong again.</p> 
 <p>“Tell me, where is Lil’ Bai?”</p> 
 <p>For the first time ever, Tan Xin exuded murderous intent!</p>
