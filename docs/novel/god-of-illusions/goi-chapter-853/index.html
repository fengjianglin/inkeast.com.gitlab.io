 <p>Chapter 853: Huskie and Blackie’s new abilities!</p> 
 <p>Pondering, Bai Xiaofei thought of Lunisolar Brilliance. <em>Maybe because my cultivation technique advanced?!</em></p> 
 <p>Then, he couldn’t help recalling the past changes of Huskie and Blackie. Indeed, every time his cultivation technique ranked up, the two’s strength would grow with it and sometimes they even got new abilities.</p> 
 <p><em>If so, they currently…</em></p> 
 <p>“Say, stupid dog, did you just get a new ability?!” Grabbing Huskie, Bai Xiaofei pulled the meat on his chubby cheeks.</p> 
 <p>“Af yoh don let goh, thees lorhd won teel…” Huskie said with a mouthful of air as he looked at Bai Xiaofei with scorn, obviously having learned to resist his master’s inhuman behavior.</p> 
 <p>“Oh wow, you… Okay…” Bai Xiaofei wanted to teach Huskie a lesson but conceded as he was in a hurry to know.</p> 
 <p>“There you go, this is my new ability.” After being let go, Huskie jumped onto the table and scratched it twice with his claws.</p> 
 <p>“That’s it?” Bai Xiaofei failed to see anything after staring for half a day.</p> 
 <p>“That’s it! Isn’t it great?” Huskie was stunned by Bai Xiaofei’s shocked expression. The two stood there staring at each other.</p> 
 <p>“Feel it with your spirit,” reminded Golden Feather, who was trying to suppress a smile.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately did as she said. Indeed, the change was surprisingly within Huskie’s energy!</p> 
 <p>Mark, this was his new ability. After Huskie consumed energy and marked a spot, the energy would gain the characteristic of being owned by Bai Xiaofei. Simply put, it would not dissipate as quickly as normal after being used, but maintain mobility.</p> 
 <p>At first glance, this ability was nothing special. However, it was a BUG when paired with Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>For example, if Bai Xiaofei left Huskie’s energy on a person, he would be able to change that person’s appearance at the level of Mimicry; or if he left the energy on an enemy, he could ignite Golden Feather’s flame right on that person’s body; or he could leave the energy on any terrain and use Blackie’s Virtual Reality!</p> 
 <p>“Eat! Eat as much as you can today! I’ll keep ordering more if it’s not enough!” So excited that he did not know what else to say, Bai Xiaofei gave Huskie the best reward possible. Then, he turned to Blackie. “Well, if it’s convenient, can you tell me if you got any new abilities?”</p> 
 <p>The 180-degree change in attitude struck dumb the happy Huskie, who felt the food in his mouth suddenly not seem so tasty anymore.</p> 
 <p><em>What is this?? Is such a difference in treatment really necessary??! Dogs don’t have rights anymore?!!</em></p> 
 <p>To rub salt into the wound, Blackie’s response for Bai Xiaofei was a disdainful eye-roll!</p> 
 <p>However, Blackie still gave him face. After all, Bai Xiaofei ordered four more servings of fish for her…</p> 
 <p>As Blackie melted into the surroundings, a variety of bright spots emerged before Bai Xiaofei’s eyes and started to move under Blackie’s control.</p> 
 <p>Emerging a while later, Blackie lay down.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei swallowed hard. <em>Oh my Buddha in heaven!! Aren’t those bright spots the four major elements?!!</em></p> 
 <p>The four basic elements were fire, earth, wind, and water; Blackie’s new ability let her manipulate them. As long as she integrated into the environment, she could arrange them arbitrarily.</p> 
 <p>Although this ability could not be used to directly launch attacks, it made Blackie’s Virtual Reality more diverse and flexible. She no longer needed to stay in the same environment to maintain her illusions. In this way, it not only avoided the risk of her being pinpointed and attacked but also greatly increased the number of controlled environments.</p> 
 <p>Combined with Bai Xiaofei’s perverse brain, the effect would be several times more incredible!</p> 
 <p>“Invincible, I am invincible!” Half lying on the soft fur chair, Bai Xiaofei’s smile reached his ears.</p> 
 <p>“Although I didn’t get new abilities, I can now use more of my original skills after advancing. With enough supporting energy, I think I can go to battle directly.”</p> 
 <p>Surprise after surprise, Golden Feather brought a piece of good news when Bai Xiaofei still had yet to recover from happiness.</p> 
 <p><em>Mhm, I’m really invincible…</em></p> 
 <p>“You f*cker, my brother booked the room for me and you dare to give it to someone else? No matter what, we will eat here today! Get on it!!”</p> 
 <p>A sudden commotion outside interrupted Bai Xiaofei’s bliss.</p> 
 <p>“What the… I actually run into a cringy situation that only happens in novels? Whatever, this is a good chance to try out our new abilities.” With a sneer, Bai Xiaofei injected energy into Blackie’s body.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, the waiter who served Bai Xiaofei before was wearing a desperate look as he followed a young man in a plain white gown. The young man’s twisted expression was in sharp contrast with the elegant gown he wore.</p> 
 <p>Walking to the door, the young man aggressively pushed it open. However, behind the door was not the VIP room, but a bottomless abyss! If it weren’t for his quick reaction, he would have fallen in!</p> 
 <p>“How dare you scheme against the mighty Yun Tianhai?! Come out here if you have the guts!” Yun Tianhai roared.</p> 
 <p>The next second, the abyss in front of him disappeared and so did the door he just opened. Instead, a new door appeared.</p> 
 <p>This time, Yun Tianhai hesitated. He did not dare to open it…</p> 
 <p>“Go, open the door!” Yun Tianhai masked his anxiety with his vicious tone as he ordered the waiter.</p> 
 <p>The scared waiter immediately approached the door but hesitated when he put his hand on the doorknob. <em>What should I do?! Both inside and outside aren’t people who I can offend!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Come in, don’t worry,” Bai Xiaofei’s voice rang out faintly.</p> 
 <p>Delighted, the waiter hurriedly opened the door. Yun Tianhai behind him conveniently peered into the room. To his shock, however, the waiter disappeared the moment the door opened!</p> 
 <p>“If you want to come in, open the door yourself. How useless are you to fear opening a door?” Bai Xiaofei’s casual voice echoed.</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhai stomped his feet in fury. “Just you wait! You are dead today…”</p> 
 <p>“Tianhai! Did you forget what I said to you before we came out?!” a stern voice cut off Yun Tianhai’s threat.</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhai, who was arrogant to the sky and back a second ago, instantly turned into a trembling kitten.</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother…”</p>
