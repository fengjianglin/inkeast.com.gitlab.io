 <p>The first reaction everyone had when facing Xue Ying who’d appeared abruptly was fear, but, a deep feeling of humiliation assaulted their hearts once more when they saw the student uniform worn by Xue Ying.</p>
 <p><i>I was actually intimidated by a new student once more!</i></p>
 <p>“Junior Sister, you’re rather beautiful, there’s no need to stand up for this kid. Moreover, you aren’t capable of dealing with all the people present here. So, it’s best if you keep your distance if you don’t want to be injured!” Zhao Han took a step forward, and the threatening intent in his tone was already obvious to the extreme. If Xue Ying wasn’t a beauty, then he would have probably summoned his puppet since a long time ago.</p>
 <p>The attitude of the others was extremely obvious as well. So long as Zhao Han gave the order, they would absolutely not mind destroying a beauty ruthlessly. Of course, it couldn’t be avoided if a little bit of ‘friction between bodies’ occurred during this process….</p>
 <p>But, there was an exception within the crowd, and it was Bai Ye who’d stood out to expose Bai Xiaofei earlier!</p>
 <p>Not only did he not stand out to encourage everyone when he saw Xue Ying, he slightly retreated a few steps back instead, and he withdrew himself from the central area before looking at Xue Ying vigilantly.</p>
 <p>“That’s really reasonable. But, what if I don’t want to move aside?” Xue Ying grinned and didn’t take this group of first year ‘seniors’ seriously at all. But, she really didn’t take them seriously….</p>
 <p>But, the ‘seniors’ didn’t think like this. In their eyes, Xue Ying was only a junior sister that was adept at acting!</p>
 <p>“Then we can only offend you!” His voice hadn’t finished spreading out in the air when Zhao Han had already charged at Xue Ying while the sword shaped puppet in his hand was suffused with a yellow glow as it struck towards Xue Ying’s right shoulder.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the remaining 10 plus people followed him and surrounded her to completely seal off Xue Ying’s path of retreat. But, they’d forgotten to consider a single thing.</p>
 <p>What if Xue Ying didn’t require a path of retreat?</p>
 <p>It was exactly like this in reality!</p>
 <p>When Zhao Han’s sword was about to pierce Xue Ying, she moved slightly to the side and caused his sword to miss, whereas, Zhao Han seemed to be prepared for this since long ago, and his empty left hand pressed down towards Xue Ying’s waist.</p>
 <p>Since the very beginning, Zhao Han had held the intention of seizing the opportunity to reach out for her. After all, Xue Ying was only a new student in his eyes, and she was a new student from the Savage Class!</p>
 <p>But, Xue Ying’s reaction far exceeded his expectations, and Xue Ying had vanished in his field of vision long before he could react to what had happened. In the next second, an enormous force assaulted the area beneath his ribs, causing him to curl up into a giant prawn as he flew out horizontally.</p>
 <p>Besides Bai Xiaofei, no one had made sufficient preparations to face this sudden change of events, and by the time everyone had recovered from their shock, Xue Ying had already pounced into the group like a wolf pouncing into a herd of sheep and started sweeping through them without restraint.</p>
 <p>One after the other, the 10 plus seniors became human shaped punching bags successively, and they flew out with various postures. After they fell, not a single one of them had the strength to stand up once more, and all 10 plus of them lay all over the ground while rolling about ceaselessly with their hands holding their stomachs.</p>
 <p>“Tsk tsk, too weak.” Xue Ying patted her hands together while bluntly expressing her contempt towards the group of first year students on the ground, and she looked at Bai Ye who was the only person still standing at the same.</p>
 <p>Because Bai Ye didn’t enter within range of the battle, so he’d narrowly escaped disaster.</p>
 <p>“Is there anyone else coming? This little bit isn’t even enough for me to warm up.” Bai Ye who’d already mentally prepared himself to be struck to the ground was stunned slightly, and he gulped down a mouthful of saliva with great difficulty when he reacted to what Xue Ying had said.</p>
 <p>“You… are really a new student?”</p>
 <p>“I am new, but you can guess if I’m a new student or not.” Xue Ying raised her brows at Bai Ye, and she didn’t have the slightest awareness of being a teacher. At this moment, she seemed to slightly resemble Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“It’s impossible for someone with your strength to be a new student. But, helping him like this is equivalent to going against the efficiency of the Bounty Rankings. Even if you’re able to deal with it for a time, it’s impossible for you to protect him for four years, and it might even drag you down as well in the end.” Bai Ye assumed a serious attitude as he analyzed the situation for Xue Ying and tried to convince her to give up on helping Bai Xiaofei. Otherwise, his road to revenge might become exceedingly bumpy.</p>
 <p>“Come at me if you want or go call others over if you don’t dare. Talking all of this nonsense to me is useless because I’m protecting Bai Xiaofei for sure!” Xue Ying clenched her fists and didn’t have the slightest intention of giving up, and her firm attitude caused Bai Ye to instantly flush red with anger.</p>
 <p>“You’ll regret this!” Bai Ye turned around and left as he spoke. On the other hand, Xue Ying turned around to look at Bai Xiaofei instead, and then she saw a scene that almost caused her to spit blood.</p>
 <p>“Letting you leave for 50 Starnet Stones isn’t expensive at all. Otherwise, you can continue feeling the might of my Big Sister Xue’s iron fist.” Bai Xiaofei casually pulled up a senior before shaking his jade token before the senior, whereas, Xue Ying’s name was really effective because the senior could only obediently choose to pay up when facing her tyrannical power.</p>
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei!” Xue Ying roared furiously, and she seemed as if she was about to eat someone because she was fighting in the frontline yet this fellow had actually started collecting protection money!</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Xue, I heard there are numerous skincare products suitable for beauties in the shopping district of the academy. With these Starnet Stones, Big Sister Xue will surely be able to charm a myriad of handsome young men!” Bai Xiaofei’s reaction was extremely swift, and he’d already stopped her before the rest of what Xue Ying wanted to say could rage out of her mouth.</p>
 <p>The temptation of beauty was something that few women could resist, and Xue Ying was no exception.</p>
 <p>“Ask for 100!” Not only was she no exception, she was even more ruthless than Bai Xiaofei!</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei turned around helplessly before looking at the seniors whose faces were already completely ashen, and he revealed an expression of being extremely wronged.</p>
 <p>“Senior, you heard her. This isn’t something I said, so, how about….” As they forcefully suppressed the impulse to spit blood, every single one of all 13 of them handed over 100 Starnet Stones to preserve their lives and were practically crying as they left the classroom.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Xue, I’ve finished collecting it.” Bai Xiaofei held up his own jade token towards Xue Ying, whereas, a wisp of excitement obviously flashed past Xue Ying’s eyes, but he gritted her teeth helplessly and pushed it back to Bai Xiaofei in the end.</p>
 <p>“I’ll have to leave if I receive this. But, you said you’d buy me a top quality skincare product.” Xue Ying clenched her fists and spoke ferociously to Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“Hehe. Don’t worry. Big Sister Xue, I’ve never failed at handling things.” Bai Xiaofei raised his brows as he put away the jade token with extreme delight, and no matter how one looked at it, based on his expression, it seemed as if he’d expected this would be the outcome since the beginning.</p>
 <p>While the two of them were dividing the spoils happily, another large group of people surged over, and the impetus this time was at least 10 times when compared to the group from before!</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Xue, it’s up to you. We’ll be rich once we’re done with this group!” Bai Xiaofei didn’t have the slightest intention of feeling fear, and he gulped down a mouthful of saliva with excitement instead. As far as he was concerned, so long as it wasn’t third year students, then they were basically here to give away Starnet Stones!</p>
 <p>However, Xue Ying didn’t think so….</p>
