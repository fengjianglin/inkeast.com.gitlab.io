 <p>Chapter 690: Doubts Cleared!</p> 
 <p>Exiting the inn, Bai Xiaofei stood outside for a long time. In fact, he himself didn’t know where he needed to go. He was, bluntly, no different from a headless fly.</p> 
 <p>The abnormality of the Holy Snow Mountain, all the big forces gathering, and the strange attitude of the Snow Kingdom toward this matter…</p> 
 <p>Everything known to Bai Xiaofei was only the tip of the iceberg. He could not make out anything from it yet, not even a general direction.</p> 
 <p><em>In the end, I still arrived a little late.</em> With a long sigh, Bai Xiaofei walked in one direction. <em>Since I’m not familiar with it, let’s take advantage of this opportunity. Ah, talk about preparing at the last moment!</em></p> 
 <p>Nearly giving up on saving his situation, Bai Xiaofei headed to the temporary base of the Puppet Master Alliance.</p> 
 <p>Although the Puppet Master Alliance was open to all puppet masters, it actually was separated into internal and external.</p> 
 <p>External referred to all puppet masters registered with the alliance. The relationship between these people and the alliance was like that between temporary workers and bosses. Not firm but still strongly bound by mutual interests.</p> 
 <p>Internal referred to the people working in the Puppet Master Alliance. They held the core interests of the alliance and shouldered the task of developing it. In a sense, these talents were the real members.</p> 
 <p>The people currently stationed in the Holy Snow Mountain were all such ‘internal’ members.</p> 
 <p>After observing from outside for a while, Bai Xiaofei found a suitable target. Waiting until the target left the hold, Bai Xiaofei assumed his appearance and went in.</p> 
 <p>The Puppet Master Alliance sent a total of three Exquisite Rank experts, all of whom were branch masters of the nearest cities. There were also many Master and Grandmaster Ranks. Looking at their line-up, the Puppet Master Alliance was definitely the most extravagant party in the Holy Snow Mountain at present.</p> 
 <p>Other organizations simply didn’t have this many puppet masters.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei wandered around the hold for more than two hours. Except for getting to know some people, he made next to no progress. There was no sense of urgency that he could see from the Puppet Master Alliance, just as if they didn’t hear the news from Jackdaw.</p> 
 <p>Something was definitely wrong.</p> 
 <p>The Puppet Master Alliance could not sit idly by with something so important like an origin mine, so there was only one reason to explain their ease. They were putting on a front!</p> 
 <p>The more relaxed they appeared, the more nervous they might be. Bai Xiaofei was almost certain that there would be a good play from the Puppet Master Alliance during Jackdaw’s action the day after tomorrow.</p> 
 <p>Arriving at this conclusion, Bai Xiaofei felt that he had grasped something crucial, but it was a pity that this feeling passed before he could react.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, let’s switch to another one!”</p> 
 <p>He left the Puppet Master Alliance for the Martial Artist Alliance, where the atmosphere was exactly just the opposite. The Martial Artist Alliance was lively as everyone busily walked around while muttering about ‘Jackdaw’ and ‘magical beast’…</p> 
 <p><em>Alright, the Martial Artist Alliance is also eyeing this chunk of fat meat.</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei smiled bitterly, then suddenly froze.</p> 
 <p><em>That’s right! How could I forget about that?!</em></p> 
 <p>Finally capturing the crucial hint from just now, he hurriedly ran out. Unlike his previous confused state, Bai Xiaofei now had a clear purpose – the Snow Kingdom troops stationed in the Holy Snow Mountain!</p> 
 <p>This time, he didn’t fake his appearance and blend in, but waited outside the military base camp for three hours. At dawn, he finally saw what he was waiting for.</p> 
 <p>Jackdaw and Qiu Feng walked out from the camp in the company of Bryne. Judging from their expressions, they definitely had very pleasant communications. As for what they talked about, Bai Xiaofei didn’t need to know. It was enough to see Jackdaw there.</p> 
 <p>A satisfied Bai Xiaofei turned to leave, and after returning to his room, he fell asleep on the table. Staying up late was definitely not recommended for humans. The exhaustion was too uncomfortable…</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei opened his eyes, he found himself lying on the big bed where the fragrance of the three sisters still lingered. Huskie and Blackie were curled up beside him, looking like they weren’t going to wake up any time soon.</p> 
 <p>“You’re awake. Did it go well last night?”</p> 
 <p>Leng Liushuang, who was waiting next to the bed, had a happy smile on her face. Happiness was as simple as feeling content from just watching the one you love waking up.</p> 
 <p>“It went well, at least it’s no longer confusing.” Bai Xiaofei sat up with a smile. After looking around the room, he dubiously asked, “Where are the other two?”</p> 
 <p>“They went to prepare. Big sister said that we may have to stay in the mountain for a long time the next time we go in, so she went to prepare some necessities,” Leng Liushuang replied as she handed Bai Xiaofei his breakfast. “I have asked the waiter to reheat it several times. Any more and it won’t be edible.”</p> 
 <p>Receiving the food, Bai Xiaofei quickly emptied everything and finally felt revived. Getting out of bed and doing a long stretch, he suddenly picked up the unprepared Leng Liushuang.</p> 
 <p>“Heheh, we haven’t been alone for a long time, should we…”</p> 
 <p>Looking at the sleazy smile on his face, Leng Liushuang turned bright red and silently stuffed her head in his chest.</p> 
 <p>Her shyness completely aroused Bai Xiaofei. He put the two puppets inside the puppet storage and carried her to the big bed.</p> 
 <p>However, just as Bai Xiaofei was about to get his second ‘meal,’ familiar footsteps echoed outside the door.</p> 
 <p>“Sis, we are back! Is the pervy wolf up?”</p> 
 <p>The two on the bed instantly bounced up. Before Leng Liuying broke in, they had successfully resumed their ‘normal’ state, but Leng Liushuang’s beet-red face couldn’t be covered up.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Leng Liuli and Leng Liuying automatically imagined many unspeakable scenes. Then, they both rolled their eyes at Bai Xiaofei. <em>Doing such things in broad daylight!</em></p> 
 <p>Receiving their questioning eyes, Bai Xiaofei inwardly complained, <em>You wrong me! I haven’t had time to do anything yet! Why couldn’t you guys come back a little later?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Where did you go last night? Why did you come back so late?”</p> 
 <p>Thankfully, Leng Liuli was as wise as ever and got to the main business, otherwise, Bai Xiaofei really didn’t know how he could divert the topic.</p> 
 <p>“I think I may know what the Jackdaw Mercenary Group is up to!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei successfully caught the interest of the triplets in one sentence.</p>
