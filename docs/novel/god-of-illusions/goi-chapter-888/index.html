 <p>Chapter 888: Locking On</p> 
 <p>“What’s with the sudden change of plan?!”</p> 
 <p>In the central forging room, a group of people complained when they saw a man in black robes enter the room.</p> 
 <p>“Let me emphasize three things with you.” The man coldly snorted. “First, in our endeavor, I am in charge and you are only responsible for carrying out my commands. Second, investigate what happened today before you complain. Third, if I hear this kind of nonsense from you again, you can withdraw from our plans. I will talk directly to your boss. Also, I can pretend that your failed assassination did not happen, just handle that guy Bai Xiaofei as quickly as possible. He has been to Pinocchio’s place, I’m afraid it won’t be long until the trace leads him to me.”</p> 
 <p>Although the man’s tone was indifferent, it irritated the Shadow Death group. However, they didn’t dare to say anything. What this man had, they did not but were in urgent need of.</p> 
 <p>“Do you not understand what I said?” inquired the man after hearing no response from the Shadow Death people, with a trace of anger in his voice.</p> 
 <p>“Understood,” uttered the person who had complained earlier. The feeling of being slapped in the face was not pleasing at all.</p> 
 <p>“What’s with your response? Didn’t your master teach you how to talk to me?” said the man coldly.</p> 
 <p>The leader of the Shadow Death group knelt heavily. “Master, I was wrong. Please forgive my mistake!”</p> 
 <p>His voice was loud and his attitude sincere. Anyone else wouldn’t be able to believe that such a scene would occur from a Shadow Death assassin.</p> 
 <p>“Get ready. There’s not much time left today. As long as we succeed this time, the products of the second experimental stage can be officially put into use,” said the man in black as he walked toward the fire formation. His storage ring flashed and a pile of dead bodies appeared.</p> 
 <p>The Shadow Death people immediately moved to perform their roles, proficiently processing the corpses while the man in black melted something in the formation. From time to time, he would pull out the hem of his robe and look at something inside.</p> 
 <p>“No wonder we couldn’t find it. So he stores the diagrams in his robe and shrinks them in a way that space is compressed in a storage item. This person is not simple.” Golden Feather sighed in Bai Xiaofei’s sea of consciousness. Hidden in Blackie’s illusion, he had woken up.</p> 
 <p>With such a way of hiding things, even if the man took his robe off and presented it to others, the information inside could not be read at all without a particular method.</p> 
 <p>“Make them stay. This is a rare opportunity!” The Demonic God of Pain couldn’t care less. His way of doing things had always been simple and crude.</p> 
 <p>“Aunt Gold, block the door. I will deal with that puppetsmith myself!” Bai Xiaofei’s eyes glinted sharply as he stared at his target. This time, no mistake was allowed!</p> 
 <p>Under Blackie’s illusion, Golden Feather went to the entrance of the room. After she gave Bai Xiaofei an ‘OK’ signal, he activated Spiritualization and fused with Blackie!</p> 
 <p>“Who?!!”</p> 
 <p>The moment Bai Xiaofei used his energy, it was instantly perceived by the Shadow Death assassin watching over the room. The group of people immediately stopped their work and looked in Bai Xiaofei’s direction.</p> 
 <p>However, they were still half a beat slow. Teleporting to the puppetsmith, Bai Xiaofei grabbed him by the neck.</p> 
 <p>“Gold Wire!” Bai Xiaofei copied Golden Feather’s ability using Virtual Reality. However, the person in his hand suddenly turned into a Shadow Death assassin!</p> 
 <p><em>Replacement? Sacrificing his own life to protect the puppetsmith?!</em></p> 
 <p>Realizing this, Bai Xiaofei decisively set off the gold wire and blew the replaced person to bits before quickly locating the puppetsmith again.</p> 
 <p>“Equal Space!”</p> 
 <p>Just as Bai Xiaofei was about to teleport over, a Shadow Death assassin launched his skill, within the scope of which no one could teleport!</p> 
 <p>At the same time, five or six dark assassins shot toward Bai Xiaofei while the rest escorted the puppetsmith to withdraw.</p> 
 <p>“Burn!”</p> 
 <p>Golden Feather at the entrance turned the vicinity into a sea of fire. Caught off guard, several assassins were instantly reduced to ashes.</p> 
 <p>With the advancement of Bai Xiaofei’s strength, Golden Feather’s power had even surpassed her former peak state. However, she was still limited by his rank and could not use more strength than what he was capable of.</p> 
 <p>“Devouring the Heaven and Earth!”</p> 
 <p>On the other side, Bai Xiaofei had no plan to prolong the fight with the assassins. He rushed into their group and sucked them into dried corpses.</p> 
 <p>Having spent a month in the core of the formation, Bai Xiaofei not only got used to his reforged body but also re-honed the ability he had mastered. Thanks to the reconstruction of his body, he was now able to use the complete version of Devouring the Heaven and Earth for a short time.</p> 
 <p>This, after all, was an ability that could handle even Demonic God of Pain. Even though it only lasted for an instant, it could already insta-kill almost everything.</p> 
 <p>After handling the obstacles, Bai Xiaofei chased after the puppetsmith. At this point, the remaining assassins had entered a chaotic fight with Golden Feather, but the puppetsmith was nowhere to be seen.</p> 
 <p>“One of them has a pre-recorded teleportation ability, the distance can’t be too far. It’s not too late to chase after them. Just leave this place to me.” Bathed in flames, Golden Feather was like a gorgeous goddess of fire. However, Bai Xiaofei could see that she was struggling to deal with these elite assassins.</p> 
 <p>“If you can’t hold on, withdraw into the puppet space!” Leaving these words, Bai Xiaofei spread his wings and flew past the sea of fire. For him, the fire could be completely ignored.</p> 
 <p>“It’s really Bai Xiaofei! He’s catching up!!” alerted an assassin protecting the fleeing puppetsmith. Among the remaining three of them, no one was a match for Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“I can hold him for a while. Speed up activation of the long-distance teleportation formation!” One of them firmly said, obviously prepared to die. This person was the one with the teleportation skill.</p> 
 <p>Soon after their talk, Bai Xiaofei arrived. His wings flashing strangely in the night sky, he looked no different from the Grim Reaper in the assassins’ eyes…</p> 
 <p>“Are you ready to die?”</p>
