 <p>Chapter 515: Xue Ying’s Reminder!</p> 
 <p>Seeing Xue Ying suddenly serious, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but be nervous. Bai Xiaofei was already in a terrible fix, he really couldn’t take any more hits. Yet from Xue Ying’s expression, it didn’t seem like it was going to be a trivial matter.</p> 
 <p>“Big Sis Xue, please consider my current mental endurance.” Bai Xiaofei gulped as he stared straight at Xue Ying, inwardly preparing for the worst.</p> 
 <p>“How much do you know about Hu Xian’er?”</p> 
 <p>Her words stunned Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p><em>What does she mean?! Why asking this all of a sudden?! Is there bad blood between them?</em></p> 
 <p>One simple question stirred up a thousand waves as various ideas popped up in Bai Xiaofei’s head, each of which he found dangerous. Internal conflicts had always been a deep fear that he kept his guard up against, but when the moment really came, he realized that he was powerless. Maybe he should be more honest in the future, or something would really happen sooner or later at this rate!</p> 
 <p>“Very well, I suppose.” Bai Xiaofei chose a conservative statement and grew even more uneasy. He was afraid of hearing something that he didn’t know from Xue Ying’s mouth.</p> 
 <p>“Do you know her relationship with the Infinite Mountain Range? Or to be more exact, do you know her relationship with the magical beasts there?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was shocked. <em>How does she know about this?!</em></p> 
 <p>This was definitely not a guess. Since Xue Ying was so specific about this, she must have confirmed the news, or she herself saw and heard something. However, what Bai Xiaofei was worried about didn’t happen. Xue Ying didn’t say anything out of his knowledge.</p> 
 <p>“Her relationship with the magical beasts?” Bai Xiaofei asked with a frown, his acting at its best. Although he trusted Xue Ying, he couldn’t tell anyone about Hu Xian’er’s secret.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei underestimated something, and that was Xue Ying’s understanding of him.</p> 
 <p>“If you already know, then forget I ever mentioned this. I will pretend that I didn’t see anything. But if you don’t know yet, then be on your guard. I saw her communicate with magical beasts with my own eyes, and they were high-ranked magical beasts!” warned Xue Ying with a displeased expression. Bai Xiaofei’s reaction had upset her very much. “That’s all. Figure out the rest for yourself!”</p> 
 <p>Xue Ying turned around to leave, but he quickly pulled her back.</p> 
 <p>“I’m so sorry, there are some things I can’t say.” Even if Xue Ying knew something, he couldn’t explain it to her. This was his protection for Hu Xian’er.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t want to hear it either, but you have to know that since ancient times, magical beasts and human beings have drawn a clear line. Few of the people who get too close to magical beasts have had a happy ending. Even if they weren’t eaten by the beasts, they’d be cast out by the people on the continent. Moreover, magical beasts are inherently temperamental, and your method of dealing with humans may not work on them!” Xue Ying took on a lecturing tone as she warned from the perspective of an experienced senior. “As for what you plan to do, I won’t interfere, but don’t forget that you are not alone. You live for a group of people, and that’s your responsibility!”</p> 
 <p>When Xue Ying finished, she broke free from Bai Xiaofei’s grasp and quickly disappeared from his sight. This time, she was really angry…</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was not stupid, he knew how she felt. However, he also knew that this was not the best time to comfort her.</p> 
 <p>After this undesirable conversation, Bai Xiaofei abandoned his plan to return to the Demon of Illusions. He stood there in hesitation for half a day before heading towards the Blossom Pavilion. There were only two places where he could stay in Starnet, and since the Demon of Illusions wasn’t an option for now, this was the only one left.</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, Yun Jingshuang and Han Qianye didn’t go out today.</p> 
 <p>“What wind has blown you here? If I remember correctly, now is not working time.” Yun Jingshuang’s sarcastic greeting rang out as soon as he saw Bai Xiaofei. Noticing the latter’s long face, he gestured to Han Qianye to leave.</p> 
 <p>“Laughed at by you again. Please be merciful today, I am really in a mess.” With a long sigh, Bai Xiaofei collapsed on the sofa.</p> 
 <p>“Then, should I be glad that you’d think of me when you’re in a bad mood? It seems I still have a certain position in your heart, huh?” Yun Jingshuang smilingly poured a cup of fragrant tea for Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Gazing at Yun Jingshuang’s face that was prettier than any girl, Bai Xiaofei carefully savored his words as he felt goosebumps all over his body. If he didn’t know that Yun Jingshuang was straight, he would have been scared off by now…</p> 
 <p>“Try this Aroma Cloud Tea from my hometown. A good thing to calm the mood.”</p> 
 <p>Accepting the cup handed to him by Yun Jingshuang, Bai Xiaofei smelled a faint, soothing scent. Unknown if it was just a psychological effect, he actually felt his heart becoming much calmer.</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother Yun, how much emotional debt do you think a person can owe at most?” Bai Xiaofei asked a question that he couldn’t find an answer to. He considered Yun Jingshuang his last lifeline.</p> 
 <p>He asked the right person this time. Although Yun Jingshuang was very slow in realizing his own feelings, he had witnessed too many people and things in the Blossom Pavilion during the past several years. It wasn’t too much to say that he was a half an emotion expert!</p> 
 <p>In addition, Yun Jingshuang was a real outsider.</p> 
 <p>“It doesn’t matter how many emotional debts you owe because it doesn’t lie with you, but with your creditors. If they pursue it to the end, you will never be able to repay them, and just one of those debts will make you feel guilty for the rest of your life.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei’s heart tensed up and his face grew gloomy.</p> 
 <p>“However, if they are willing, you don’t have to think about whether you owe them anything. You just have to be yourself, because they will fill in the rest by themselves.”</p> 
 <p>This shocked Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Isn’t that too irresponsible? Isn’t this kind of thing supposed to be mutual?”</p> 
 <p>Upon Bai Xiaofei’s words, Yun Jingshuang burst out laughing.</p> 
 <p>“Are you just pretending or are you really stupid? When is there such a thing as absolute fairness in love? Especially in your case, unless you can split yourself up and give everyone a share, you can never be truly fair. Take me for example. Qianye waited for me for so long. Do you think I can still clear this debt?”</p> 
 <p>Yun Jingshuang’s question rendered Bai Xiaofei speechless. He fell into a long silence.</p> 
 <p>“You are not the type who takes things too hard. Sober up and be yourself, that will be enough. If you really change yourself from being too troubled by this matter, that’s when you’ll disappoint everyone.” Yun Jingshuang paused a little. “Remember, people who like you, like you for who you are and not the great things that you can do for them. Of course, doing that will make them happier, but it won’t affect anything if you don’t do it.”</p> 
 <p>Yun Jingshuang then took a sip of his tea.</p> 
 <p>“Just follow your heart.”</p>
