 <p>Chapter 528: Initial Probe Produces no Result…</p> 
 <p>“Senior, I don’t quite understand the meaning of that phrase.” Bai Xiaofei’s face revealed his doubt. He was unable to associate ‘risky investment’ with the event in Ancient Yue at all.</p> 
 <p>Ling Tianxia seemed to be prepared for his reaction. With a sad smile, he slowly explained.</p> 
 <p>“The so-called risky investment refers to creating profitable business opportunities by using radical means. As the creator of these opportunities, the Globe Merchant Group may not be the only beneficiary, but it will definitely be the biggest one.”</p> 
 <p>“And this idea covers all normal trade possibilities because its core lies in the creation of business opportunities. For example, the Blossom Competition that you organized is a kind of risky investment, only that the risk is relatively moderate.”</p> 
 <p>“But those people in my merchant group are not as gentle as you. What they have planned are moves that are big enough to subvert people’s perceptions!”</p> 
 <p>“However, the making of these opportunities sets foot in some forbidden areas that a merchant group must never touch. There is no problem if they aren’t exposed and made public, but if one is caught, it will be a disaster even for an existence like the Globe Merchant Group!”</p> 
 <p>Ling Tianxia began to grit his teeth again. He looked as if he was desperate to skin those people and rip them apart.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, with this explanation, Bai Xiaofei finally understood.</p> 
 <p>“So, their plan was to overthrow the Ancient Yue regime in order to completely monopolize its economy and achieve the purpose of developing the Globe Merchant Group?” Bai Xiaofei concluded with a glimmer of brilliance in his eyes.</p> 
 <p>“You’re right, but that’s not the end. Compared to those people’s appetites, Ancient Yue is really too small. If I guess right, Ancient Yue is just an attempt to test the waters. Their real purpose must be to accumulate experience and target more powerful countries!”</p> 
 <p>This shocked Bai Xiaofei speechless.</p> 
 <p><em>So many people died and that was just an attempt?! If they really execute this so-called plan, how many more people will die?!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t know whether Ling Tianxia’s anger was real, but he was truly furious. This kind of behavior had touched his bottom line, not to mention his group was the one who had suffered the most!</p> 
 <p>“Senior, can I know about this group of people?” Bai Xiaofei tried to control his voice as he suppressed his fury to make himself look less emotional.</p> 
 <p>However, his mood fluctuation was too obvious in front of someone of Ling Tianxia’s level.</p> 
 <p>“I can’t tell you,” he refused so frankly that it stunned Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Why?! You still want to defend them after all that?!” Bai Xiaofei had begun to lose control and at the same time exposed a fatal weakness…</p> 
 <p>“If you calm down, I can tell you why,” said Ling Tianxia slowly.</p> 
 <p>The reminder struck Bai Xiaofei dumb, and then he realized he had made a blunder. The older ginger was spicier, indeed. Bai Xiaofei never expected that he’d be led by the nose in the end. At this point, there was no need for any more probing. He had already lost this round of confrontation, and there would be no need to continue.</p> 
 <p>“Sorry, Senior, I was a little out of control.”</p> 
 <p>After adjusting his emotions, Bai Xiaofei immediately calmed down. This rapid change once again heightened Ling Tianxia’s impression of him.</p> 
 <p>“It is understandable. After all, a friend of yours died in this incident. There are not many people who value relationships like you,” Ling Tianxia said with a smile. Bai Xiaofei’s heart jumped a little.</p> 
 <p>“Senior, you regard me too highly. I’m not the type who puts weight on feelings and relationships. I just dislike being played. I’m not so impulsive to make decisions because of someone.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei returned a smile, but Ling Tianxia made no response. There was no need to bother with this matter anymore as Ling Tianxia only believed what he had seen.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s get back on topic. There are two reasons why I can’t tell you who they are.”</p> 
 <p>Ling Tianxia became serious.</p> 
 <p>“First, with your current strength and influence, it is not enough for you to compete with them. I’m afraid that if I tell you, you will try to fight them when you come across them one day. It will be like throwing eggs at stone. If that happens, I won’t be able to explain to Teacher.”</p> 
 <p>“Second, no matter what, this is an internal matter of our Globe Merchant Group. I have said so much today that it is already inappropriate. As for cleaning up my own house, it is better for me to carry it out in person!”</p> 
 <p>When it came to ‘cleaning up my own house,’ Ling Tianxia’s eyes were ruthless!</p> 
 <p>Since he had put it like this, Bai Xiaofei could no longer importune. He could not quickly come up with any reasonable excuse to refute Ling Tianxia.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you for your reminder, Senior. But if possible, I hope you can give me a chance to meet those people!” Bai Xiaofei didn’t completely back off but tried to negotiate.</p> 
 <p>“I will, but I hope that you won’t have this chance because that would mean I wasn’t able to even clean up my own house.”</p> 
 <p>Ling Tianxia burst out laughing and Bai Xiaofei joined him. A conversation that should have been intense ended smoothly in the laughter of those two people…</p> 
 <p>After leaving Lei Shan’s office, Bai Xiaofei felt extremely complicated.</p> 
 <p>Not to mention that Ling Tianxia’s actions were completely beyond imagination, who he was as a person alone and what he had was enough for Bai Xiaofei to contemplate for a long time. Talking with Ling Tianxia made him realize how insignificant he was.</p> 
 <p>Compared to this continent full of the unknown, Bai Xiaofei had seen and experienced so little that just a few new things would take him a while to digest and adapt. This ignorance would put him at a disadvantage for a long time to come!</p> 
 <p>“You’ve finally come out!”</p> 
 <p>Thinking as he walked, Bai Xiaofei suddenly heard a familiar voice that stunned him. Not because of anything else, but just that he hadn’t seen the owner of the voice for a while – Qin Lingyan!</p> 
 <p>After her coming-of-age ceremony, Qin Lingyan seemed to have vanished from his life. Even news related to her rarely reached his ears.</p> 
 <p>And now, the very person was standing in front of him. The reason was, of course, the Ancient Yue incident, but only she knew what she was really thinking.</p> 
 <p>“You must be here to ask about Ling Tianxia.” After a short moment of silence, Bai Xiaofei chose this unwise topic as the ice breaker.</p> 
 <p>He had no other choice. He just couldn’t think of anything else…</p>
