 <p>Chapter 1034: Bai Xiaofei’s Determination!</p> 
 <p>“I have a question.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei suddenly spoke when he saw some people were about to declare their stances. Everyone’s attention was immediately shifted to him.</p> 
 <p>Shi He was smiling, thinking that Bai Xiaofei was certainly going to ask about the treatment. At present, the princes had set aside a huge budget to win over any help they could get, so as a city lord and a middleman, he would earn a large sum as well.</p> 
 <p>“Little brother, ask away. I’ll answer everything I know,” replied Shi He.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s eyes glinted with a strange light. He slowly asked, “Do you know what happened to the Sixth Prince?”</p> 
 <p>As soon as the question dropped, Shi He’s eyes went wide, but he soon returned to his senses and shouted, “Guards, capture him!”</p> 
 <p>Shi He’s quick and decisive judgment showed that he was quite a character. Unfortunately, his men were not enough…</p> 
 <p>The same moment Shi He gave his order, Moshen stepped forward and released dark demonic smoke. In just a few breaths, all the guards in the yard were on the ground screaming in pain.</p> 
 <p>By the time everyone understood what had just happened, Moshen had lifted Shi He up by the neck like a chicken to be slaughtered.</p> 
 <p>Through the crowd, Bai Xiaofei walked towards Shi He. “You haven’t answered my question. Do you know what happened to the Sixth Prince?”</p> 
 <p>Shi He was horrified, but he knew the consequences of revealing anything about this matter. Enduring the pain, he struggled to ask, “Who… are you?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had no interest in answering his question at all. “It seems that either you don’t know or you won’t say.” With a sigh, Bai Xiaofei turned back to the puppet masters in the yard.</p> 
 <p>Moshen immediately revealed a knowing, ferocious smile, and then killed Shi He.</p> 
 <p>“Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce myself. I am Bai Xiaofei, a friend of the Sixth Prince, Yun Jinshuang, who I have agreed to help take back the throne. If you are willing to give me a helping hand, then please stay. If you think I’m just dreaming, the door is right there, I won’t stop you, but if we ever meet on the battlefield, don’t blame me for being ruthless!” Bai Xiaofei’s voice echoed in the yard.</p> 
 <p>The yard was dead silent. After a while, when the puppet masters finally recovered from the shock of Shi He’s death, discussions broke out as they recalled the name Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei?”</p> 
 <p>“The leader of Starnet’s miracle generation?!”</p> 
 <p>“Yes! That’s him! It’s said that he led people to stop Legend Rank Ling Tianxia during their bicentennial celebration.”</p> 
 <p>“Rumor has it that he went to Ethereal a year ago and had a big fight with Shadow Death!”</p> 
 <p>In less than a moment, all kinds of rumors about Bai Xiaofei spread, and many people became more careful when they looked at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“My time is limited. You can think about it here while I take care of something in the city first,” Bai Xiaofei said and opened his puppet space. Huskie, Blackie, and Golden Feather successively came out, followed by the eye-catching Mind Sunder.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei pumped origin energy into Blackie’s body and she immediately expanded the scope of her environmental simulation ability to the maximum. Then, Huskie used his Mark on Blackie and she quickly transported him to various places in the city. Mind Sunder shone and cooperated with Golden Feather to spread her flames through the Huskie’s marks and Blackie’s transportation.</p> 
 <p>The next second, a group of flame giants condensed in every corner of the city, followed by the sounds of fighting as all active soldiers became their targets. For the first time, elemental entities created by Mimicry and Mind Sunder demonstrated their crushing strength.</p> 
 <p>Within the control range of Blackie, as long as Bai Xiaofei’s energy was not exhausted, these elemental entities could be endlessly produced!</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be nervous, everyone. I’m just attacking the city. It will be over soon,” Bai Xiaofei comforted the panicking puppet masters.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Moshen stepped forward, and everyone quieted down. They didn’t know whether Bai Xiaofei was bluffing but they knew that Moshen, who could insta-kill a city lord, was not someone they could afford to defy.</p> 
 <p>Just as Bai Xiaofei had said, the suppression didn’t take long. In the face of the elemental entities who were nearly as strong as Bai Xiaofei, the ordinary soldiers in the city couldn’t put up much resistance. In less than twenty minutes, all the forces of the Fourth Prince in the city were eliminated. Not a single one escaped under Blackie’s monitoring.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, now that the unnecessary problems are all handled, welcome to my city. From today on, it will be called Yi Shuang<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>!” declared Bai Xiaofei coldly as his eyes swept over everyone in the yard. “You can now tell me your answer, whether to stay in my city or stand against me!”</p> 
 <p>Seeing Bai Xiaofei’s menacing expression, no one believed what he had just said before about letting them leave. So, the question was basically to choose between living or dying!</p> 
 <p>“Greetings, City Lord. This subordinate will follow you to the death!” One person finally stepped out.</p> 
 <p>Following his example, the rest bowed their heads one after another.</p> 
 <p>“You will be thankful for your decision today. Worry not, I can give you more than whatever the Fourth Prince can, but you need to remember one thing,” Bai Xiaofei said. “You are now working for the Sixth Prince and not for me. Everything I get here will be returned to the person to whom it belongs!”</p> 
 <p>Once again, Bai Xiaofei’s heart ached at the thought of Yun Jingshuang. <em>Will I really never see that pretty guy again…?</em></p> 
 <p>“Now, you will scatter around the city and put it under lockdown. No one is allowed to enter or leave without my permission, and no one is allowed to walk around the city. However, no one is allowed to attack civilians for no reason. Anyone who disobeys will die!”</p> 
 <p>Receiving their first order from the new city lord, the puppet masters retreated from the yard.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll leave it to you to supervise them. If anyone disobeys, you can eat them.” Bai Xiaofei looked at Moshen, who was digesting the power of the former city lord.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry!” Moshen licked his lips in satisfaction. For him, this was definitely a cushy job.</p> 
 <p>After arranging all this, Bai Xiaofei took a deep breath.</p> 
 <p>“Here we go, Brother Yun. If you are somewhere up there in heaven, watch closely. I will make all those who hurt you and Senior Sister pay!”</p>
