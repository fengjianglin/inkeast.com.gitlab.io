<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>“Let me out or I’ll kill him!” The voice of the young woman sounded out from within the light barrier, and the geezer that was already intending to take a rest was shocked to the point of jumping up from the ground.</p>
 <p><i>Shit! Shit! How silly of me! How could I have forgotten this!</i></p>
 <p><i>This kid took that young woman forcefully!</i></p>
 <p>The geezer whose heart was filled with regret and wished for nothing more than two slap himself hurriedly withdrew the light barrier, and then, he saw a scene that caused him to be horrified.</p>
 <p>The young woman that had worn a tight dress once more revealed an overbearing and dominating aura, and most shocking of it all was that she revealed the characteristics that belonged to a Magical Beast!</p>
 <p><i>Transmogrify Rank Magical beast?!!!</i></p>
 <p><i>What the f*ck, am I going to die here!!?</i></p>
 <p>This was the first reaction of the geezer. A Transmogrify Rank magical beast was an existence equal to a Timeless Rank puppet master, so annihilating a tiny Legend Rank puppet master like him could be done with a simple flip of the hand.</p>
 <p>However, in next to no time, he’d repudiated this guess. <i>If it’s really like this, then I’d have died since long ago. How could I have brought her over?</i></p>
 <p><i>But, if she isn’t a Transmogrify Rank magical beast, then how do I explain this?</i></p>
 <p>“Err, that…. You…. My disciple….” For a time, the geezer’s mind was frozen.</p>
 <p>“You aren’t wrong, I’m a magical beast. As for why I’m in this form, it isn’t something you can know of. But, I’ve saved him, and this is a fact. So, I require compensation from you.”</p>
 <p>Calm! Terrifyingly calm!</p>
 <p>On the other hand, the first thought in the geezer’s mind wasn’t astonishment. <i>So this young woman is actually a magical beast. No wonder she was able to endure an entire afternoon….</i></p>
 <p>“What sort of compensation can I give an existence at your level?” After he cleared away the inappropriate thoughts in his mind, the geezer swallowed a mouthful of saliva before he asked with a weak tone.</p>
 <p>He had to be frightened. She was a magical beast and this was the Infinite Mountain Range. This was her territory, and if she was unhappy, then even his corpse might not remain!</p>
 <p>“Since you dared to bring this trash along to the Infinite Mountain Range, you ought to have an extremely high status in the human world, right? I require a suitable human identity. Help me with this and I’ll allow the both of you two leave here alive.”</p>
 <p>Just like this, the person that just had a relationship…. No, wait! The Big Sister magical beast defined the pitiable Bai Xiaofei as trash….</p>
 <p>The geezer frowned instead. He was indeed capable of assisting her with this, but he was worried that this female magical beast would do harm to humans.</p>
 <p>“You don’t have the time to hesitate. Even though I’m not a match for you, so long as I will it, there’ll be at least 10 Monarch Rank magical beasts that would instantly charge over, and it’s even to the extent I can even call Emperor Rank magical beasts over. So, agree right away if you want to live!” It was all undisguised threats yet the geezer had no choice but to believe them because the magical beasts she mentioned were indeed capable of transforming him into fertilizer.</p>
 <p>“I can recommend you to a place that can clear away your previous identity. After you leave that place, you can get any identity you want!” This time, the geezer didn’t hesitate as he was deeply afraid the young woman would do as she said, and he instantly withdrew a golden colored invitation letter from his ring.</p>
 <p>But, he wished for nothing more than to slap himself after he withdrew it.</p>
 <p><i>F*ck, I took the wrong one!!!</i></p>
 <p>The young woman moved according to a strange set of steps to arrive right by the geezer’s side, and then she grabbed the invitation letter from his hand before casually scanning through it. After that, she glared fiercely at the geezer with a gaze filled with killing intent.</p>
 <p>“Both of you will pay for the incident today!” As soon as she finished speaking, the young woman raised her head up and whistled, and then she walked over to Bai Xiaofei’s side and stared at his face for a long time.</p>
 <p>Not long after, a leopard that was covered in green colored markings arrived swiftly, and it lowered its head with extreme respect before the young woman. After that, it allowed the young woman to sit on its back before carrying her to vanish into the veil of the night.</p>
 <p>As he let out a long sigh of relief, the geezer noticed his back was already completely wet.</p>
 <p>Wildwind Leopard, a King Rank magical beast. If he didn’t see it with his own two eyes, the geezer wouldn’t believe a fellow like that would actually have such a meek side even if he was beaten to death!</p>
 <p>The nine ranks of magical beasts that were known in the continent from low to high are respectively Barbaric Rank, Brilliant Rank, Spiritual Rank, Enlightened Rank, King Rank, Monarch Rank, Emperor Rank, Transmogrify Rank, and Saint Rank.</p>
 <p>Amongst them, Transmogrify Rank magic beasts are already existences that are extremely elusive, and there’re absolutely few that still exist in the world now, whereas, Saint Rank magical beasts were just like Eternal Rank puppet masters, and they only existed in theory.</p>
 <p>So, a King Rank magical beast was already equivalent to a higher up of the magical beasts!</p>
 <p>Thus, the young woman’s words earlier about calling over Monarch Rank magical beasts seemed to not be exaggerations!</p>
 <p>But, this sort of worry quickly dissipated as the geezer’s mind was filled with another thought.</p>
 <p><i>“Tsk, tsk, as expected of the good disciple of I, Revelations. He was even able to do a magical beast to that extent!” </i>The strange footsteps of the young woman flashed within his mind, and then Old Man Revelations started laughing villainously….</p>
 <p>For an entire night, Bai Xiaofei slept naked just like this, and early in the morning, the cold wind that was only present in the forest blew onto him to the point he shuddered.</p>
 <p><i>“What the f*ck is that monster!!!” </i>Bai Xiaofei leaped up from the ground while roaring loudly.</p>
 <p><i>“F*ck, that scared the shit out of me! So it was just a dream.” </i>As he muttered, Bai Xiaofei looked towards his body, and then he let out an extremely miserable and shrill cry….</p>
 <p>“F*CK!!!”</p>
 <p>“You f*cking perverted geezer! What the f*ck did you do to me! I’m still a child!!! I’ll f*cking kill you!!!” As tear and snot flowed down together, Bai Xiaofei charged straight towards the nearby geezer.</p>
 <p>But, he’d just taken the first step when he felt something was off, and he didn’t even have the time to readjust his body when his entire body had already shot out and landed with his face flat on the ground.</p>
 <p>There would truly be no justice in this world if his legs didn’t go soft after ‘battling’ a magical beast for an entire afternoon!</p>
 <p>In the next second, a set of clothes smashed onto his body, and following along with these clothes was the geezer’s faint voice that drifted over from afar.</p>
 <p>“Put away those filthy thoughts of yours. I, Revelations, am famous for only being interested in women. Even though you have the natural endowments of a pretty boy, but it’s f*cking useless.”</p>
 <p>After he calmed down, Bai Xiaofei let out a long breath of air before hastily wearing his clothes.</p>
 <p>“Then why were my clothes gone?” Bai Xiaofei wore his clothes as he asked because he was extremely perplexed by this question that was related to his purity.</p>
 <p>“A poison of lust erupted in your body, so I found you a Transmogrify Rank magical beast to vent your lust. In the end, both of you went at it for the entire afternoon, and both your clothes were torn into pieces.” Revelations pointed towards the nearby clothes that had already transformed into pieces, and if one carefully identified them, one would still be able to notice the clothes belonging to that young woman was amongst those pieces.</p>
 <p>But, Bai Xiaofei didn’t look so carefully.</p>
 <p>“Do you think you disciple is an idiot? A Transmogrify Rank magical beast? That’s a monster at the Timeless Rank. Not to mention if there really is one in this Infinite Mountain Range, even if we did encounter one, both of us would have been eaten since long ago.” Bai Xiaofei directly repudiated Revelations’ explanation because he possessed sufficient reason to think otherwise.</p>
 <p>“It’s up to you if you want to believe it or not, what I said was the truth.” Revelations waved his hand and didn’t continue arguing because even he himself felt that these facts weren’t trustable in the slightest.</p>
 <p>“But, kid, aren’t you going too far?” As he spoke, Revelations’ voice suddenly went cold.</p>
 <p>In the next second, Bai Xiaofei instantly realized his mistakes. <i>This isn’t the Gorge of Heroes nor is the person before me my foster fathers and mothers, and he’s my Master that might kill me at any moment instead!</i></p>
 <p>In a flash, Bai Xiaofei directly dashed over to arrive behind the geezer, and he started rubbing the geezer’s shoulders skillfully.</p>
 <p>“Master, calm your anger. I was too happy from suddenly obtaining the use of Origin Energy that I lost myself in my delight, causing me to speak nonsense! Your disciple will never forget the grace of new life you’ve given me. So long as you say the word, no matter if it’s a mountain of blades or a sea of flames, I wouldn’t even frown to traverse it for you!”</p>
 <p>Revelations who was pleased by the flattery laughed with satisfaction.</p>
 <p>“Kid, you can’t even utilize Origin Energy, so why did you come to this Infinite Mountain Ranger. You don’t seem like an ignorant person.” He’d already taken Bai Xiaofei as his disciple since long ago yet Old Man Revelation finally remembered to ask about Bai Xiaofei’s origins.</p>
 <p>“I didn’t enter here, I just came out from within.” Bai Xiaofei spoke indifferently yet Old Man Revelation was stunned.</p>
 <p>“You came out from within?!”</p>
 <p>“The Gorge of Heroes?!”</p>
 <p>Old Man Revelation that had surprise written all over his face suddenly turned around. “You came out from the Gorge of Heroes?!”</p>
 <p>“Right, what’s wrong? Master, you actually know of that desolate place of ours?” Bai Xiaofei was stunned as well.</p>
 <p>“So in this way, you have a Token of Heroes with you?”</p>
 <p>“Are you talking about this thing?” Bai Xiaofei withdrew a command token that was pieced together from his chest, and on the top and bottom of the split at the center was the characters of ‘英’ and ‘雄’ written in ancient characters.</p>
 <p>Old Man Revelation had a trace of a flustered expression as he received the command token from Bai Xiaofei and gazed at it, and then he returned it to Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“You must take good care of this command token. Moreover, don’t take it out in front of anyone. At the same time, don’t tell anyone that you came out from the Gorge of Heroes!” While carrying an utterly serious expression, Old Man Revelation stared right at Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, Master. My foster fathers and foster mothers have already told this to me numerous times. I told you because you aren’t an outsider.” Bai Xiaofei laughed slyly and took advantage of the opportunity to flatter the geezer.</p>
 <p>Actually, he’d already forgotten this matter. Of course, Revelations didn’t know this.</p>
 <p>So, the old fellow was very touched….</p>
 <p>“Then why did you come out from there? It’s impossible that you came out for a stroll, right? It isn’t so easy to return to the Gorge of Heroes.”</p>
 <p>“I want to take revenge for my own father that I never met. According to what my foster fathers and foster mothers said, my father was a great hero. But, the circumstances of his death are a mystery, and they asked me to leave and investigate it. I can only return after I solve it.” There was no grief on Bai Xiaofei’s face. Just like he’s said, he had no impression of his father, and the only relationship between the two of them was Huskie, this animate puppet that was forcefully bound to him since he was born.</p>
 <p>“A great hero? Bai….” Old Man Revelations frowned, and then he revealed a pondering expression. After a short moment, his eyes instantly stared wide open.</p>
 <p>“Is your father called Bai Longfei!?” As he grabbed tightly onto Bai Xiaofei’s shoulders, Old Man Revelations’ hands were trembling slightly.</p>
 <p>“Master, don’t get excited. You’re causing me to feel extremely nervous.”</p>
 <p>Old Man Revelations who noticed he’d lost his composure instantly let go of Bai Xiaofei’s shoulders, but the excitement in his eyes hadn’t vanished in the slightest.</p>
 <p>“Yes or no, is your father called Bai Longfei!?” Once again, Old Man Revelations pursued an answer, and Bai Xiaofei who was stared at to the point he felt his scalp go numb nodded.</p>
 <p>“The name my foster father and the others spoke of was indeed this name.”</p>
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking, Old Man Revelations roared three times with laughter towards the sky, but his eyes had become moist instead when he looked at Bai Xiaofei once more.</p>
 <p>“So many years have passed while countless rumors were spread outside. But, I didn’t believe a single one of those rumors. Never had I expected I’d actually encounter your son.”</p>
 <p>“Destiny! It’s destiny!”</p>
 <p>Even though he didn’t know what the reason behind it was, Bai Xiaofei was able to clearly feel the sorrow in Old Man Revelations’ heart because this sort of feeling was similar to how his foster fathers and foster mothers felt when they mentioned his father.</p>
 <p>“Master, do you know my father?” Bai Xiaofei gulped down a mouthful of saliva and asked with a light voice.</p>
 <p>“My understanding of your father is probably not much more than those foster fathers and mothers of yours. But, I can point you towards a place!” Old Man Revelations paused for a moment before his eyes recovered their luster….</p>
