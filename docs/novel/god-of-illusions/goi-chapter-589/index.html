 <p>Chapter 589: Lei Shan’s Promise!</p> 
 <p>“After the fourth-years’ graduation, I suggest centralized management and indiscriminate training for the remaining students!”</p> 
 <p>No matter what Bai Xiaofei said, everyone’s reaction would not be so adverse anymore because they knew he would definitely follow with a convincing explanation.</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, he immediately explained, “Starnet urgently needs a group of mainstays who are proficient in various abilities and have a strong collective awareness. They will become irreplaceable help once new students come in, and after the new students are stable, they will also become indispensable talents in the reconstruction of our academy.”</p> 
 <p>The department heads looked at each other and started a long discussion among themselves in whispers. Although the rest couldn’t hear what they were saying, it wasn’t hard to tell from their expressions that they agreed with Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Since everyone has no objections, it is decided,” Lei Shan concluded and turned to Luo Xi. “Luo Xi, select the most outstanding teachers from all faculties to form a team for the new training course. All personnel from the deputy director ranks and up must participate. I will also take a teaching role. Our remaining students must grow at the fastest speed!”</p> 
 <p>Lei Shan’s eyes shone with resolution as he felt that he had not been this serious for a long time.</p> 
 <p>“Fang Ye will take care of the preparations for the student side. The Student Community is very capable now and will be a great help,” Bai Xiaofei said and gestured to Fang Ye, who was sitting at the back. Then, he concluded, “And that will be our top priorities at the moment. Once we finish dealing with them, we will have the energy and ability to execute the next plan. I haven’t thought about it yet, so this is all I have to say.”</p> 
 <p>Everyone couldn’t help a sigh of relief after Bai Xiaofei finished. The amount of information so far was too much. None of Bai Xiaofei’s ideas was simple to carry out in reality.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, you all go and do your own thing. Smelly boy, you and the little girl stay,” said Lei Shan indifferently as he waved his hand to dismiss everyone.</p> 
 <p>The rest didn’t think much about it, while Bai Xiaofei and Hu Xian’er tightened their grip on each other.</p> 
 <p>After everyone left, Lei Shan raised a hand, conjuring a green light that spread out and covered the room in a barrier.</p> 
 <p>“Although I am not very good at isolating barriers, it is impossible for Legend Rank and below to break through my isolation,” Lei Shan said lightly, giving the two some reassurance.</p> 
 <p>“Gramps, did you already know?” Gulping, Bai Xiaofei probed. His reply was an elusive smile from Lei Shan.</p> 
 <p>“Did your old master already know?” Lei Shan finally said after his smile began to scare Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei immediately understood. <em>He really already knows.</em></p> 
 <p>“Master was also trying to protect Xian’er…” Bai Xiaofei didn’t cover for Revelation. There was nothing wrong with more divergence at a time like this.</p> 
 <p>“That fellow even lied to me. If I hadn’t had dealings with the Phantom Fox clan before, I’m afraid I would really be fooled.” Stroking his beard, Lei Shan then looked at Hu Xian’er. At the moment, she showed no fear and seemed calm.</p> 
 <p>Standing beside Bai Xiaofei, she feared nothing.</p> 
 <p>“If I remember correctly, members of the Fox clan have to pay a high price to have a human form ahead of time. Did your clan come into difficulties?” Lei Shan’s brows slightly creased in worry.</p> 
 <p>“Gramps, maybe a less sensitive question?” Bai Xiaofei pulled Hu Xian’er to his back, trying to laugh the matter off.</p> 
 <p>“Hmm, you and your tricks. You think I have to test her? Apart from royal contracts, there’s not a second way to make existences like the Earth Infants and Ruindemon Flood Dragon listen to you.”</p> 
 <p>This vanquished Bai Xiaofei’s last attempt at resistance. Behind him, Hu Xian’er poked at his back and then came forward.</p> 
 <p>“Principal, Xian’er didn’t mean to deceive you. Magical beasts and humans are just different after all…”</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, no need to tell me about all that. This old man is not stupid, not to mention that what I consider ‘different’ does not mean a thing. It’s all good as long as you don’t think there are any differences.” Lei Shan wiggled his eyebrows at Bai Xiaofei. At that instant, Bai Xiaofei could see Revelation in him…</p> 
 <p><em>He who stays near ink gets stained black, ahh!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Cough… Gramps, you didn’t leave us just to confirm Xian’er’s identity, right?” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly changed the subject before Hu Xian’er could catch Lei Shan’s implication.</p> 
 <p>“Of course not.” Lei Shan stopped smiling and grew serious. “In the past, for the stability of Starnet, I alone killed my way into the Infinite Mountain Range and forced them to an agreement of peaceful coexistence. Although this agreement seems meaningless now, I have to admit that it kept Starnet stable for over a hundred years.”</p> 
 <p>Lei Shan seemed to have sunk into his past memories.</p> 
 <p>“The world only knows that I conquered some powerful Emperor beasts in there, but no one knows that I was almost unable to make it out alive.”</p> 
 <p>Lei Shan smiled and looked at the shocked Bai Xiaofei and Hu Xian’er.</p> 
 <p>“At that time, it was the Phantom Fox clan head, Emperor Rank Hu Ji, who saved me. In order to repay her kindness, I promised her that if the Phantom Fox clan ever needed help, I would do my best!” Lei Shan’s voice gradually grew emotional as his eyes on Hu Xian’er became feverish. “But since then, the Phantom Fox clan never once contacted me. I went deep into the Infinite Mountain Range several times but failed to find any traces of them.”</p> 
 <p>Lei Shan’s tone was getting more and more off. The degree of excitement he was showing far exceeded that of someone who owed a favor.</p> 
 <p>“Why?” gazing intently at Hu Xian’er, Lei Shan threw out his last question.</p> 
 <p>However, he received not her answer, but an icy rhetorical question.</p> 
 <p>“Do you really want to know?”</p> 
 <p>At this moment, there wasn’t a shred of emotion on her face. She looked so cold that even Bai Xiaofei felt unfamiliar and Lei Shan felt a little afraid. But in the end, Lei Shan slowly nodded. He wanted to know!</p> 
 <p>“Leader Hu Ji risked our clan and formed a secret relationship with humans, therefore was stripped of her identity as our leader, was abolished of all cultivation, and expelled!”</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er slowly stressed each word which were like stabs into Lei Shan’s heart. By the time she finished speaking, Lei Shan was in a daze…</p>
