 <p>Chapter 962: Bulk-Buy!</p> 
 <p>“No… Didn’t hurt…”</p> 
 <p>The leader trembled as he answered Bai Xiaofei’s question in everyone’s stead. Now he had truly regretted taking on this stupid task.</p> 
 <p>“You guys are quite resistant to beating!” Bai Xiaofei commented with a smile.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the group of men was at a loss. <em>So should it hurt or not?!</em></p> 
 <p>“S…sir, please just tell us directly! We are really innocent!” The leader was on the verge of tears. Nothing was worse than the feeling that anything you’d say would be wrong but you still had to say it…</p> 
 <p>“What’s your name?” Bai Xiaofei asked him.</p> 
 <p>“My name is Zhuang Shuo.”</p> 
 <p>“Zhuang Shuo, huh? Before I arrived, how many people here were willing to listen to you?”</p> 
 <p>Zhuang Shuo pondered a little and decided to answer truthfully. “About a hundred people. The rest were already in groups, so there was nothing I could do about that.”</p> 
 <p>Zhuang Shuo indeed had some talent. In just half a day, he had been able to persuade a hundred people to follow his lead.</p> 
 <p>“Mhm, not bad.” Bai Xiaofei nodded in satisfaction, then swept his eyes over the rest of the men. “Zhuang Shuo’s group, stand with him to the left, the rest stand on the right. You have one minute.”</p> 
 <p>After two seconds of silence, the crowd quickly moved out of fear of being beaten again and finished in 43 seconds.</p> 
 <p>“Now, you have the chance to choose again. From now on, Zhuang Shuo will be my spokesman. If you are willing to follow him, stand to the left.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Zhuang Shuo felt flattered, while the crowd became chaotic. Another minute passed, and there were only less than fifty people on the right.</p> 
 <p>Looking at them, Bai Xiaofei shook his head with a sigh.</p> 
 <p>“A wise person responds to the situation. Why couldn’t your head just think it through?!” he commented and looked at Zhuang Shuo. “I’ll give you two minutes. I want to see them crawl out of here.” Having said that, he folded his arms, obviously expecting a good show. </p> 
 <p>Zhuang Shuo decisively got to work right away. Four hundred people beating up several dozens, the result could be imagined.</p> 
 <p>In less than three minutes, the stubborn 40-odd men crawled out of the room wailing.</p> 
 <p>Where they went was none of Bai Xiaofei’s concern. All he wanted was that there would be no voices of opposition in the warehouse!</p> 
 <p>“Sir, it’s done.” Zhuang Shuo eagerly came up to Bai Xiaofei. The feeling of commanding hundreds of people made him particularly thrilled.</p> 
 <p>“Well done. Now, I have an announcement to make.” Looking at everyone in the room, Bai Xiaofei took a deep breath. “From now on, I am your boss. Does anyone have any objection?”</p> 
 <p>These words were expected by everyone, but they still froze a little after hearing it for real. Zhuang Shuo was the first to react.</p> 
 <p>“Greetings, Boss!” He knelt down on one knee, setting an example for the rest.</p> 
 <p>Returning to their senses, the group of men followed suit. No one wanted to be the next person to be beaten into crawling out.</p> 
 <p>“I’m delighted to see that everyone is giving me face. Well then, let me inform you of my rules.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei donned an amiable smile.</p> 
 <p>“First, what I loath the most is betrayal. If I find out that you have done something against me, I will make you die very miserably!”</p> 
 <p>“Second, I’m not here to be some f*cking top-class servant. What I want to do is change the status of men in Moonlight so they can have human rights as well. Those who don’t have the courage to participate in this, you can leave now. I won’t do anything to you.”</p> 
 <p>By this point, everyone’s eyes were as wide as saucers, even Zhu Chunyang.</p> 
 <p>It wasn’t that he didn’t already know. He just never thought Bai Xiaofei would dare to say it out loud in this place that was currently under Moonlight’s highest level of supervision.</p> 
 <p><em>Is he tired of living?!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I’m not starting a rebellion. I will only use a method to prove to everyone that men are definitely not dispensable and that we have other functions besides helping them conceive babies!” Bai Xiaofei reassured just as the room was at a loss for words.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, many sighed in relief, but some looked at Bai Xiaofei strangely.</p> 
 <p>“Well, no more nonsense. The door is over there, leave or stay, your decision.” Bai Xiaofei sat down.</p> 
 <p>Zhuang Shuo, who was nearest to him, started to ponder. Although what he had just heard was different from what he was taught since childhood, the feeling of leading so many people was definitely the most fulfilling he had ever had!</p> 
 <p>“I, Zhuang Shuo, believe in you, Boss! From today, my life is yours!” he declared.</p> 
 <p>With Zhuang Shuo taking the lead, those who were wavering made up their minds. Bai Xiaofei’s strength was convincing, and they were willing to bet on this opportunity.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, many had the mindset of being obedient to women already deeply rooted in them. The first thing they thought of was the pressure from Moonlight that they would have to face if they joined Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Gradually, the men split into two groups. After everyone had made a decision, exactly three hundred people were left in the room!</p> 
 <p>“Very good! Thank you for giving me face. As a meeting gift, I’ll give you guys a surprise.” With a smile, Bai Xiaofei poured out a small hill of Amethyst Coins from his storage ring.</p> 
 <p>The men instantly drooled. <em>Oh hell! I certainly won’t be able to make this much money being a servant for the rest of my life!</em></p> 
 <p>“Money is only the lowest-ranked thing, but it can represent the beginning of this change. From now on, you are following me, Bai Xiaofei! Not having to worry about money is only the first step. What I want to give you is a brand-new way of life!” Bai Xiaofei declared and motioned for Zhuang Shuo to distribute the Amethyst Coins, then led Zhu Chunyang to a corner.</p> 
 <p>“Stick and carrot, huh? You actually played both the role of the good and bad man and got them to dance in your palm. But, don’t tell me you’re actually going to take them to the border? Are you sure they will accept this?” Zhu Chunyang commented, finally sounding like that of a king.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I will make them accept it!”</p>
