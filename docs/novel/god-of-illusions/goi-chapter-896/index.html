 <p>Chapter 896: First Prince!</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness, I rely all on you this time. I’ve only heard about the new decree today, but I guarantee that the Imperial Guard will follow you with one heart, so…” hinted the Imperial Guard leader with an ingratiating look.</p> 
 <p>Sitting in front of him, the First Prince only smiled quietly. “Don’t worry, I will certainly help you if you are reasonable,” he gave an ambiguous answer and stood up, not looking the slightest bit worried.</p> 
 <p>From the moment the Imperial Guard commander sought the First Prince and started persuading, three hours had passed. Although he believed in the First Prince, he somehow still felt a sense of panic. Fortunately, the First Prince had finally expressed his stand. In the commander’s impression, there was nothing that the First Prince could not handle.</p> 
 <p>However, the First Prince’s calmness was not an act. Leaving his room, he chose the sedan to set out, which was slower than walking. The commander was impatient but dared not say a word. The only thing comforting was that the camp was within the palace and it didn’t take them long to arrive.</p> 
 <p>Yet, the Imperial Guard camp had completely changed from what he once knew hours ago. As soon as the sedan approached, a group of guards stopped them.</p> 
 <p>“Sedan chairs are prohibited within the scope of the Imperial Guard military camp. We would like to invite you to get down, Your Highness!” a loud voice boomed, the tone neither servile nor overbearing.</p> 
 <p>The commander was dumbfounded, feeling like he had been slapped in the face. “Are you blind? Don’t you know me?! Get out of the way or you’ll be fired!”</p> 
 <p>However, the answer was something even more unexpected.</p> 
 <p>“My apologies, the current leader of the Imperial Guard is Commander Tian. You are no longer even an imperial guard,” said the gatekeeper coldly and fearlessly.</p> 
 <p>“I see you’re tired of living! Who dares to take my job?!”</p> 
 <p>The pitiful former leader rushed up in rage. However, a group of soldiers jumped out and pressed him in place. “The punishment for assaulting an imperial guard is execution!”</p> 
 <p>Seeing how the soldiers firmly controlled their former boss, they were obviously prepared for this situation, which was indeed the case. They had been selected by Tian Hai and stationed at the entrance in advance. To be chosen, they had to meet three conditions: had never colluded with Tian Hai before; had courage to act for real; and to be strong enough.</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness!!” Realizing his situation, the former commander loudly resorted to his ‘backer.’</p> 
 <p>Upon his call, the First Prince slowly stepped down from his sedan chair and said lightly, “Since you attacked an imperial guard, I can’t save you. After all, this is not my jurisdiction.”</p> 
 <p>The former commander froze in absolute bewilderment. “Your Highness! How can you say that?! I’m your man!! We agreed…”</p> 
 <p>“Accusing His Highness the First Prince of forming a secret party, your punishment is death!”</p> 
 <p>The poor guy hadn’t finished his words when the attendants of the First Prince dashed over and punched his mouth, shutting him up in a bloody fashion. At the same time, the First Prince walked to the head of the gatekeepers.</p> 
 <p>“I am here to visit the new leader, please report this to him. If it is inconvenient, I will pay him a visit another day,” said the First Prince in a relaxed manner.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, despair clouded the former commander’s eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Not only is it convenient for Commander Tian, but also for me as well. I wonder if Your Highness will give us the honor?” Bai Xiaofei’s voice suddenly rang out.</p> 
 <p>The First Prince looked over and saw a radiant Bai Xiaofei followed by a respectful Tian Hai. Bai Xiaofei’s appearance stunned him.</p> 
 <p>He had just heard that his father summoned a young man today – but he didn’t expect the person in question was this young – and even entrusted the Imperial Guard to him. The thought made him thank the former commander. If it wasn’t for this pitiful guy, he might have missed this opportunity to meet Bai Xiaofei before his brothers.</p> 
 <p>In any case, he must win over Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p>“I am Ling Yue, it’s an honor to meet you. May I know your name?” Ling Yue walked straight to Bai Xiaofei, his expression excited as if he wished to meet Bai Xiaofei sooner.</p> 
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei. It’s my honor as well, Your Highness. You are indeed a dragon amongst men as your reputation claims,” Bai Xiaofei clearly implied something.</p> 
 <p>“There are things that can’t be avoided. Although I know what the Imperial Guard looked like before, they aren’t under my jurisdiction. Even talking too much about it would bring trouble upon me. After all, all the people here were all appointed by my imperial father,” Ling Yue answered perfectly and neatly kicked the ball to the emperor.</p> 
 <p>“It seems that I still have a lot to learn. But Your Highness, how do you think he should be dealt with?” asked Bai Xiaofei as he turned to the former commander, posing a difficult problem to the First Prince.</p> 
 <p>“Whether it’s attacking the Imperial Guard or slandering someone of a higher position, the punishment is execution,” replied the First Prince nonchalantly.</p> 
 <p>The former commander, who was pressed down on the ground, lost all hope.</p> 
 <p>“However, he didn’t know that he was dismissed, so his action was an unintentional regret. And I don’t care much about his offense toward me. Therefore, he can be exempted from the death penalty. Just let him leave,” the First Prince continued.</p> 
 <p>The former commander was filled with pleasant surprise.</p> 
 <p>“Since Your Highness has spoken, I will deal with this matter accordingly. However, I have some newly collected reports. How do you think I should deal with them?” Bai Xiaofei threw out another problem and quietly looked at the First Prince.</p> 
 <p>“How about let bygones be bygones? The previous management was certainly undesirable, but it cannot just be blamed on a single person, right? I believe that the future of the Imperial Guard will only flourish,” the First Prince gave a near-perfect answer again with a smile.</p> 
 <p>This communication gave Bai Xiaofei a rough judgment of the First Prince. He was not suitable to be a friend, but as an emperor, he was an absolutely perfect candidate! All of his actions so far were textbook standard!</p> 
 <p>“Understood, I will conclude it according to your wishes. Do you have anything you would like to tell me, Your Highness?” Bai Xiaofei revealed a profound smile.</p> 
 <p>“This is not a place to talk. Are you interested in coming to my place, little brother?”</p>
