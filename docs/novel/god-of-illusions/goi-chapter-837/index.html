 <p>Chapter 837: A Way!</p> 
 <p>“Hello, grandpa.”</p> 
 <p>Unlike Gu Lingyue, Rui Mengqi’s sea of consciousness was very stable as she had reached the peak of the Master Rank. Although she did not know what this space was, she greeted Revelation politely upon seeing him.</p> 
 <p>“What a polite little girl. You make it a bit difficult for this old man to speak.” Revelation smiled and shook his head.</p> 
 <p>Rui Mengqi’s heart sank after hearing Revelation’s words and seeing his expression, but she put on a smile. “It doesn’t matter, grandpa. Just tell me.”</p> 
 <p>In addition to her ‘foolishly cute’ character, Rui Mengqi was particularly considerate. She never projected her negative feelings upon others and always quietly bore them alone.</p> 
 <p>“Are you really willing to follow the smelly boy for the rest of your life without status?” Revelation asked.</p> 
 <p>Rui Mengqi was dumbstruck. It was impossible for Bai Xiaofei to tell others about this, so there was only one explanation: Revelation got this from his divination.</p> 
 <p>After the surprise passed, Rui Mengqi nodded seriously. “As long as I can stay beside him, I can be his lifelong maid without complaints.”</p> 
 <p>Her tone was firm as ever. Although she had dreamt about better results, she was well aware of her abilities. The Master Rank was likely her limit, while it was just a starting point for those around Bai Xiaofei…</p> 
 <p>“Can you tell me why?” Revelation seemed curious. Asking this question, he carefully examined Rui Mengqi’s expression for any changes.</p> 
 <p>“If it wasn’t for him, I would have been sold again. He gave me a chance to live free, made me a puppet master, taught me a lot of things, and even brought me into a group where no one looks down on me. Although I often make mistakes, they never complain. Before this, the word ‘future’ was only a far-fetched dream for me, but now, I can even choose my own future. I want to repay this kindness with my whole life.”</p> 
 <p>This was the first time Rui Mengqi said so many things in a clear order. This idea was not improvised, but only finalized after a long time. This was her truest self. Being Bai Xiaofei’s companion was already her greatest happiness.</p> 
 <p>“I see.” Revelation smiled as he seemed to have gotten a satisfactory answer, but he quickly turned serious. “What if this old man tells you that you may die because of your choice?”</p> 
 <p>The topic instantly became heavy. However, Rui Mengqi laughed.</p> 
 <p>“If I can die for him, it may just be the happiest thing in my life, because then he will remember me all his life.”</p> 
 <p>Death, for Rui Mengqi, had never been something to be scared of. She even looked forward to it!</p> 
 <p>“Hahaha! Happiest thing, huh? Very good!”</p> 
 <p>Revelation threw back his head and laughed loudly. For the first time, he was approving of a girl of her age.</p> 
 <p>“Since this is what you have chosen, I will show you a way. Should you decide to embark on it, you will have to part with the smelly boy for a while, but when you return to him, you will become an indispensable person!” Having said that, Revelation paused before asking slowly, “Are you willing to believe in this old man?”</p> 
 <p>“If what you said is true, grandpa, I am willing to take that road!” This was Rui Mengi’s answer after some consideration, full of determination and expectation. For the first time, she felt that there was hope for the future. She had not felt this so strongly even when Bai Xiaofei had promised to take her away.</p> 
 <p>Moreover, she felt quite clearly that Bai Xiaofei did not want too many people around him at present, and it might be the case in the future as well. Therefore, what really tempted her was the word ‘indispensable.’</p> 
 <p>“Bird that cannot win the king’s heart, cannot become a phoenix. From loyalty to madly in love, desiring to fly with the dragon,” Revelation’s voice echoed after he disappeared from Rui Mengqi’s consciousness.</p> 
 <p>Listening to her divination, tears fell from Rui Mengqi’s eyes…</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Revelation had entered Tan Xin’s consciousness, after which a long silence ensued.</p> 
 <p>What Revelation saw was entirely beyond his imagination and left him speechless, while Tan Xin was still questioning whether she made the right decision letting Revelation in… because this place held all of her secrets…</p> 
 <p>“Old man, surely you’re not going to keep quiet like this? I unblocked everything to let you in.” Breaking the silence, Tan Xin pursed her lips in displeasure.</p> 
 <p>“These people are…” Revelation hesitated.</p> 
 <p>Standing next to Tan Xin in her sea of consciousness were seven people. However, these people had no independent consciousness. It was only their bodies with their abilities and energy.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I am not the evil kind who plunders the ability of others. These people are friends and comrades who fought alongside me in life-and-death battles. I was their captain. My ability lets me accept others’ voluntary transfers and so they gave everything to me before they died,” Tan Xin paused a little before moving aside. “If you don’t believe it, feel it yourself. There would be grievances if they were forced.”</p> 
 <p>Facing Tan Xin’s generous act, Revelation did not intend to feel it for himself. Doubting was not what he needed to do. Whether Tan Xin was reliable should be left for Bai Xiaofei’s judgment.</p> 
 <p>“That’s not necessary. This old man just didn’t expect that there would be someone from that world around my foolish disciple, one so powerful at that,” commented Revelation with a sigh as he recalled a horrible memory that he never wanted to mention.</p> 
 <p>“He knows that I’m not from this world, so you can rest easy about that. You should also be able to tell that I’m trying to integrate myself into this world. I don’t want to go back to that world,” said Tan Xin plainly, the wisdom on her face finally corresponding to her identity as the lord of Windlove City.</p> 
 <p>“So for that, you chose the smelly boy.”</p> 
 <p>“Isn’t he your choice as well?” Tan Xin retorted.</p> 
 <p>“Even now, this old man does not know whether my choice is right or wrong. My Heavenly Secret Disk is just rarely that chaotic.”</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know whether my choice is right or wrong, but I believe in my experience and intuition.”</p> 
 <p>After another back and forth, the two smiled at one another.</p> 
 <p>“Well, let’s talk about your divination.”</p> 
 <p>Letting the topic slide, Revelation got down to business.</p>
