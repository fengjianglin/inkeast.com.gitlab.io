 <p>Chapter 451: Plans and Unexpected Gain!</p> 
 <p>“How did you wake up?!” As Bai Xiaofei was still feeling fuzzy, an excited Bai Ye almost pounced at him, stupefying him.</p> 
 <p>“Eh, I… shouldn’t wake up?” Puzzled by Bai Ye, Bai Xiaofei scratched his head awkwardly with a silly expression.</p> 
 <p>“No, no! You just have been in a coma for too long! I didn’t expect you to suddenly wake up. I’ll call them all over. Everyone has been worried sick!” Bai Ye excitedly got up, about to go out.</p> 
 <p>“Wait!” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly stopped him. Regaining his senses, Bai Xiaofei’s brain started processing quickly again. “How long have I been unconscious?”</p> 
 <p>“More than half a month…” Bai Ye stopped and replied.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be in such a hurry. Tell me what happened when I was unconscious. And, who came to see me?” Bai Xiaofei’s eyes shone hopefully when asking the last question.</p> 
 <p>Although a little confused, Bai Ye answered Bai Xiaofei’s question truthfully, telling him in detail what had happened since he had fallen unconscious until now. He even remembered who had come to see Bai Xiaofei in exact order.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Bai Xiaofei only sighed at the answer.</p> 
 <p><em>She didn’t come…</em></p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter? Is something wrong?” Bai Ye tensed up. He recalled Qin Lingyan always saying she had a bad feeling but she just didn’t know what was wrong. When Bai Xiaofei sighed, he immediately thought that maybe Qin Lingyan wasn’t overly nervous, maybe something was really off!</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be anxious, it’s nothing. I’m just tired, tired…” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly explained. What he earned in return was Bai Ye’s contempt.</p> 
 <p><em>You have been lying in bed for half a month, and you are still tired? Lingyan and I are the ones who are tired, okay?! We even helped you turn your body!!!</em></p> 
 <p>“If you don’t want to say it, nevermind. I’m going to call Lingyan. What’s so good about you that there are so many people caring about you…?” Bai Ye snorted.</p> 
 <p>This reaction stunned Bai Xiaofei for a long while. At the same time, goosebumps spread all over him. <em>That action is cute when girls do it but on a boy… Yucky!</em></p> 
 <p>The face of someone he hadn’t seen in a long time flashed in his mind, and Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but gulp. At the same time, he felt like he had figured out something. <em>No wonder Big Sis Lingyan has always refused to accept him. It’s actually because of this…</em></p> 
 <p>Thinking of Qin Lingyan, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but remember that night when she had been drunk and his head hurt. That quest of his had been really a little too ‘fruitful’!</p> 
 <p>“Don’t tell them that I’ve woken up yet!” As weirded out as he was, there were still some things to be done.</p> 
 <p>Bai Ye, who was stopped again, looked back in bewilderment. “Everyone is worried about you, yet you want to hide from them?”</p> 
 <p>Looking at the frowning Bai Ye, Bai Xiaofei revealed a mysterious smile. He didn’t just want to hide from them!</p> 
 <p>“I have someone I need to see. This is my last chance before leaving this place so, senior, you have to do me a favor!” Bai Xiaofei said seriously. Bai Ye’s furrowed brows also relaxed.</p> 
 <p>Then, he got to experience Bai Xiaofei’s shamelessness…</p> 
 <p>It didn’t take long for Bai Ye to finally leave Bai Xiaofei’s room, but it wasn’t the news that Bai Xiaofei had awakened that he brought out. The content was just the opposite: Bai Xiaofei was in bad shape!</p> 
 <p>This horrid news spread out at the fastest speed. Immediately after, Bai Xiaofei’s room once again ushered in a new level of visitors.</p> 
 <p>One batch of people after another came to inquire about his situation, and all kinds of great ‘doctors’ came to the door, but in the end, they all shook their heads in helplessness.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s state looked more than just bad. At this kind of time, no one dared to carry the blame. After all, Bai Xiaofei was the benefactor of the current emperor!</p> 
 <p>At last, a conclusion was drawn: Bai Xiaofei was dying…</p> 
 <p>Finally, a haggard Qin Lingyan drove everyone away, then sat silently beside Bai Xiaofei’s bed. Her tragic appearance was totally different from her usual frost goddess image.</p> 
 <p>“Although you may not be able to hear this, I’m afraid that I will have no chance if I don’t say it now.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, who was in a fake coma, felt his heart tense. He put on this show to see Nie Qing, but he actually forgot about Qin Lingyan…</p> 
 <p>“In fact, when I first met you, I didn’t have any good feelings about you at all. You gave me the impression of arrogance and stubbornness. I thought you would encounter a nail that would injure you all over sooner or later, but it turned out that I was wrong.”</p> 
 <p>“You did encounter nails, but you turned into a hammer and smashed them all down.”</p> 
 <p>“The change in my opinion of you began with that fight between us. At first, I just wanted to teach you a lesson, but then I heard that you actually ran into the Infinite Mountain Range because of our agreement. Do you know how surprised I was at that time?”</p> 
 <p>“Later, your group came back. Although I inconspicuously went easy, the others didn’t. But even so, you still beat us in your way. Since then, I have been observing you.”</p> 
 <p>Qin Lingyan smiled, seemingly thinking of something interesting.</p> 
 <p>“Then, I watched you do one shocking thing after another. Every time I was nervous for you then ended up admiring you. At the same time, you also renewed my understanding of you again and again.”</p> 
 <p>“Gradually, I admitted one thing. I have been attracted to you, a junior one year younger.”</p> 
 <p>Confessing this, Qin Lingyan blushed.</p> 
 <p>“Isn’t it kind of ridiculous? At least I think so, so I could only hide this feeling. Moreover, there are so many beautiful girls around you that I have to think twice about getting near you. So, I thought of creating an opportunity to be close to you alone. Figuring that you don’t enjoy life in the academy very much, I took this mission.”</p> 
 <p>When mentioning the mission, there was pain in Qin Lingyan’s expression.</p> 
 <p>“I really didn’t think the result would be like this. If I knew this would happen, I would rather hide my feelings for the rest of my life than invite you!”</p> 
 <p>Saying this, Qin Lingyan’s face showed a little more regret as two clear lines of tears uncontrollably flowed.</p> 
 <p>“Wake up! You wake up! Aren’t you always making miracles happen?! Why can’t you do it this time?! Do you want me to regret this for a lifetime?!”</p> 
 <p>Crying and shouting, Qin Lingyan fell on Bai Xiaofei’s chest. Feeling a soft body and cold tears on his chest, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but quiver a little.</p> 
 <p>“You are awake?!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s reaction didn’t escape Qin Lingyan’s sense. However, there was no other response in the face of her hope.</p> 
 <p>He really could not wake up now…</p> 
 <p>Looking at Bai Xiaofei with his eyes still closed, the pleasant surprise on Qin Ling’s face gradually turned into loss, but soon the loss turned into resolution.</p> 
 <p>“You just wait, I will save you!”</p>
