 <p>Chapter 1016: Lure and Kill!</p> 
 <p>“Depart!”</p> 
 <p>At dawn the next day, the Sacks army resumed on their way. Although the destination was their hometown, no one was happy as it was not a triumphant return…</p> 
 <p>Per Bai Xiaofei’s decision, before setting out, Lan Shuang announced a piece of good news for the Sacks soldiers – When they passed through the tribes along the way, anyone could choose to leave the army. As a consequence, half of the troops were gone and the majority of the remaining also had plans to leave.</p> 
 <p>In the end, there were only less than 70,000 people left.</p> 
 <p>Lan Shuang couldn’t understand why Bai Xiaofei wanted to make such a move, but since Qiu Muxue was no longer with them, she had no other choice but to listen to him.</p> 
 <p>The slimming army was twice as fast as the previously huge one. Qiu Muxue, who had been following them at a distance, inwardly cursed Bai Xiaofei for being so crafty. If the number of troops continued to decrease like this, they would arrive much earlier.</p> 
 <p>However, even if it was only one person, it would still be impossible to get to Barbaric Godism in just one day!</p> 
 <p>With this doubt, Qiu Muxue continued to tail them, while Lan Shuang watched as the remaining soldiers leave one by one…</p> 
 <p>“Stop immediately and state your purpose!”</p> 
 <p>Not long after the army sped up, they were stopped by a small unit. Although the latter fell far behind in numbers, their faces didn’t show the slightest fear. On the contrary, they were especially overbearing.</p> 
 <p>“I’m asking you a question, you deaf?!” From the small unit, a man walked out domineeringly.</p> 
 <p>Upon seeing this man clearly, the soldiers at the front of the army immediately trembled.</p> 
 <p>“My… my lord, we are…” The person who replied was shaking like a leaf.</p> 
 <p>His reaction drew a snort from the domineering man. “Go and report to the Saintess that Master Mamba of the Guard Team has come to receive her, and tell her to come here at once!”</p> 
 <p>From these words, it was clear that the domineering man was a member of Barbaric Godism’s Guard Team!</p> 
 <p>For the Sacks clan, this identity represented a high and mighty position that could decide their life and death at will!</p> 
 <p>Moreover, judging from the tone and words of this member, the Saintess really meant nothing to Barbaric Godism.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, we’re on it, my lord!” the soldier replied and scrambled toward the Saintess’s carriage at the rear.</p> 
 <p>After the decision to let the soldiers leave, basically no one in the army still harbored hostility toward the Saintess, so Bai Xiaofei, who was disguised as her, had been quite safe. However, it wouldn’t be the case with the Guard Team!</p> 
 <p>When the news reached Bai Xiaofei’s ears, he sneered.</p> 
 <p>“Tell Mamba that I have considered what he told me and if he still wants to, come to see me alone. I have something to say to him,” he said and got off the carriage, then walked away from the army, quickly disappearing into the distance.</p> 
 <p>The messenger was anxious to hear this, but had no choice but to deliver these words while preparing to lose his life for it.</p> 
 <p>“You’re seeking death! Did you not hear what I said?! How dare she make Master Mamba go to her?!”</p> 
 <p>The domineering guard lifted up the messenger with one hand, full of murderous intent. However, before he could do anything, a big hand pressed down on his shoulder.</p> 
 <p>“What did I tell you? You must be polite to the Saintess!”</p> 
 <p>A cold voice rang out, and the next second, a sharp glint sliced off the domineering guard’s head before he could explain himself.</p> 
 <p>None of the people present saw what had just happened, but they all knew that it was Mamba who killed the guard!</p> 
 <p>“Alright, little brother, what did the Saintess say specifically?” Mamba’s tone softened and he looked at the messenger expectantly.</p> 
 <p>Mamba, who had been doing nothing back in Barbaric Godism, had left as soon as he heard the news of the Sacks army’s defeat. He had no interest in the war, but the defeat of the Sacks meant his opportunity had come because he knew that only he could keep Qiu Muxue safe. In other words, this was the best time for him to fish in troubled waters. At the thought that he was finally able to have the Saintess, he could not wait even a moment more and simply rushed out with his people to see her as soon as possible.</p> 
 <p>It could be said that his thoughts and actions had been guessed by Bai Xiaofei right down to a tee. Even heroes had a weakness for beautiful women, not to mention a hungry ‘hero’ like Mamba!</p> 
 <p>“Hahaha! Very good, Qiu Muxue!” Mamba could not be happier after hearing the messenger relay Bai Xiaofei’s words. He told the messenger, “Since the Guard Team just so happens to lack one person, from now on, you are one of us!”</p> 
 <p>Then, walking past the shocked and thrilled messenger, Mamba got on his horse and rode in the direction Bai Xiaofei had gone. After ten minutes, he finally found the Qiu Muxue that he had been longing for under an old tree.</p> 
 <p>“You’ve arrived. Come and sit down.”</p> 
 <p>Looking at her graceful posture as she made tea, Mamba’s heart drummed rapidly.</p> 
 <p>“You walked quite far away!”</p> 
 <p>Mamba excitedly dismounted and went straight to the small tea table. Sitting down opposite Bai Xiaofei, his eyes unscrupulously scanned the latter up and down.</p> 
 <p>“Have a taste, I especially learned to brew tea at Starnet. The tea is a trophy from Moonlight, very rarely seen in our clan,” Bai Xiaofei introduced as if he didn’t notice Mamba’s piercing gaze.</p> 
 <p>This kind of ‘teasing’ made Mamba’s heart itch more and more. “I didn’t know you could be so… romantically interesting. Anyway, now that you’re back, you should have made your choice.” Mamba received the teacup and got straight to the point.</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t know I still had a choice. There is obviously only one option in front of me.” Bai Xiaofei smiled, his every movement vividly displaying a woman’s charm. As far as his experience with women was concerned, it was a piece of cake for him to imitate any type of woman.</p> 
 <p>Not to mention that the one sitting opposite him was already blinded by lust.</p> 
 <p>“Hahaha! Well said!” Mamba smugly laughed and drained the teacup in one go. “I can’t understand why anyone likes to drink this kind of stuff. It can’t compare to our wine at all.” Putting it down, he commented with a hint of disgust and moved his chair next to Bai Xiaofei. “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely have it covered. With my father’s connections…”</p> 
 <p>“Do you feel a little thirsty?” Bai Xiaofei suddenly interrupted Mamba just as the latter’s hand was about to touch his waist.</p> 
 <p>The irrelevant question stunned Mamba before a bad feeling welled up in his heart. The moment he realized that something was wrong, his eyes returned to Bai Xiaofei, only to see that the beauty of his dreams had turned into a ferocious monster with two horns!</p> 
 <p>Mamba instinctively punched out. However, when his fist landed, Bai Xiaofei’s body burst into flower petals and the surrounding scene rapidly changed.</p> 
 <p>“You are not Qiu Muxue!!!” Mamba roared as his iron fists started to wildly swing at everything around, but whatever he hit only burst into flower petals.</p> 
 <p>In the blink of an eye, the surroundings became a sea of petals. Deeply enveloped in it, Mamba’s breathing kept getting faster and shallower.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t struggle, you are already a fish in a net. Struggling will only make your death more ugly,” Bai Xiaofei’s voice echoed from all directions.</p> 
 <p>No matter how hard Mamba tried to mobilize his ability, everything around him remained unaffected. Then, space began to distort and the petals drowned him. In his struggle, a sharp pain hit his chest, and the surrounding scene dramatically changed again – back to what it had looked like when he had first arrived. The only difference was that he had been stabbed through the chest by Mind Sunder and his vitality was rapidly leaving his body.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t struggle. Neurotoxin, no solution,” said Bai Xiaofei slowly as he pulled out the blade from Mamba’s chest. “Thank you for being so talkative, or else I wouldn’t have gotten the information I wanted so quickly. Next life, remember to stay away from women, especially the beautiful ones.”</p> 
 <p>As Mamba fell in a pool of blood, Bai Xiaofei’s appearance changed into his.</p> 
 <p>The reason why he chose a slower poison instead of Nightcharm’s fatal insta-kill one was to learn Mamba’s voice, tone, and personality, so as to pave the way for the next plan.</p> 
 <p>Pitifully, Mamba would not see Bai Xiaofei’s ensuing excellent operation.</p> 
 <p>“How long are you going to peek? Come and help,” Bai Xiaofei called out.</p> 
 <p>The next second, Qiu Muxue came out from behind the old tree.</p> 
 <p>“I really didn’t expect him to die so easily,” she sincerely exclaimed as she looked at Mamba’s corpse.</p> 
 <p>“Easy? Not at all. I had to study for a long time to develop this hallucinogenic poison. Besides, who said that you have to fight a hard battle to kill someone?” Bai Xiaofei’s lips curled up.</p> 
 <p><em>Come, Barbaric Godism! Let me teach you a good lesson!</em></p>
