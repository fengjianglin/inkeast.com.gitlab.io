 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>

 <p>First round of the New Student Tournament: Survival games!</p>
 <p>Everyone from the hundred classes who qualified would enter a unique space after the match began. Everyone could attack one another at will inside that space. Those killed would be eliminated from this round while the classes with no survivor would be eliminated from the tournament. Only ten classes would be allowed to advance to the next round where the top ten would be selected.</p>
 <p>The rules might seem simple, but it was enough to drive people nuts. Before the round even started, everyone could already see foresee what would happen. Among all this, what everyone hated most was the fact that they would have to face the nine classes with Newcomer Kings.</p>
 <p>Only the top ten classes would be able to advance from this round. If nothing unexpected happened, this round would be equivalent to ninety classes fighting over a single spot. On the other hand, Bai Xiaofei was worried about something else altogether. Since he couldn’t use his puppets, the Savage Class would suffer grave consequences if they were mobbed by the other classes.</p>
 <p>A survival game might seem like a straightforward form of competition, yet it pushed the uncertainties of this round to the limits.</p>
 <p>“Stop worrying. This might turn out to be a great chance for us.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had been visibly worried about it for half a day. A delighted look suddenly appeared on his face. He seemed to have figured something out.</p>
 <p>“Opportunity?”</p>
 <p>Xue Ying was stunned.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. An opportunity!”</p>
 <p>“We have been worrying about being mobbed all along. Looking at it from a different perspective, why don’t we work with the other classes instead? If we become the hunter, we won’t have to be the prey anymore, right?”</p>
 <p>Everyone was hit by this epiphany. The moment Bai Xiaofei spoke out, the delighted expression spread from his face to everyone’s faces as well.</p>
 <p>“Who should we work with then?”</p>
 <p>Fang Ye asked mindlessly. Bai Xiaofei immediately sank into silence and began sneaking glances at Xue Ying.</p>
 <p>“Don’t look at me like that. I know who you have in mind. At times like this, I am just a teacher. Do you think I’m stupid enough to dig my own grave?”</p>
 <p>Xue Ying’s meaning was clear.</p>
 <p><em>This is no time for me to be jealous. Go look for that little seductress!</em></p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei laughed, immediately regaining his confidence.</p>
 <p>“I knew Big Sister Xue is a magnanimous person. I’ll go contact them immediately. You guys just wait for my good news.”</p>
 <p>With that, Bai Xiaofei ran out and left his confused classmates behind. The sole person who wasn’t confused was Xue Ying. However, she merely hugged herself and started sulking.</p>
 <p>She might have said that she wouldn’t be jealous, yet when Bai Xiaofei really ran out she still felt uncomfortable inwardly.</p>
 <p><em>Did you have to be so happy?</em></p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was not the only person to think of this idea. While he was excitedly running towards class 21, someone else had arrived before him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I already said all I have to say. It would be good if fellow student Xian'er would give my suggestion some consideration. If our classes work together, we will definitely be able to distinguish ourselves during the tournament.”</p>
 <p>Fang Yuesheng looked expectantly at Hu Xian’er who was wearing the academy’s student uniform. Despite Fang Yuesheng’s efforts at controlling his desire, the instinctive yearning he had toward Hu Xian’er was something he couldn’t hide.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, there was no change in Hu Xian’er’s expression after listening to Fang Yuesheng’s long explanation. She did not even spare him a look, emanating an ice-cold aura that gave one an urge to look up to her.</p>
 <p>“Fellow student, you may leave now. Our class monitor is not interested in working with you.”</p>
 <p>Bai Kai came out and blocked Fang Yuesheng who was about to take a step forward. His expression remained stiff as he spoke. This guy had been blocking their door for over ten minutes. His endless pestering truly made Bai Kai feel like beating him up. However, Bai Kai still had to hold himself back. After all, in class 21, Hu Xian’er was probably the only one who was a match for Fang Yuesheng.</p>
 <p>“I am speaking with your class monitor. Who do you think you are to interrupt me? Piss off. Otherwise, you might not get a chance to participate in the survival games anymore.”</p>
 <p>Fang Yuesheng warned coldly. He could no longer be bothered with keeping up pretenses. Although such forceful methods of dealing with things might invite disdain, one couldn’t deny that they worked very well at times.</p>
 <p>“Don’t push it!”</p>
 <p>Bai Kai snorted coldly. They were instantly surrounded by the students of class 21. However, Fang Yuesheng didn’t come alone. When class 21 made their move, his classmates, or to be precise, his underlings stepped forth from behind him and started exerting pressure toward Bai Kai and the others as well.</p>
 <p>Even in such a situation, Hu Xian’er still appeared unmoved. Just like that, she serenely sat and looked out the window, as if what was going on had nothing to do with her.</p>
 <p>“I don’t intend to make things awkward between us. However, if you guys continue blocking my way, don't blame me for whatever happens next!”</p>
 <p>Fang Yuesheng said with a condescending smile on his face while rubbing the ring on his left hand.</p>
 <p>“It is pointless to say more. If you want to fight, bring it on. So long as I, Bai Kai, am still here, you can only dream about stepping through this door!”</p>
 <p>Bai Kai started pouring his origin energy into his puppet. The other students of class 21 readied themselves for battle as well.</p>
 <p>“Since that is the case, I will have to see for myself what class 21 is made of.”</p>
 <p>A ruthless glint flashed in Fang Yuesheng’s eyes as his origin energy started roiling within him. However, before he could even complete his transformation, a merry voice rang in the air.</p>
 <p>“Oh, it’s quite happening here, huh?”</p>
 <p>Hu Xian’er was already prepared to personally make a move. Yet when she heard this voice, she stopped. On her face, a blissful smile appeared.</p>
 <p>Both parties ended their activated abilities and looked at Bai Xiaofei. Under the gazes of over thirty people, Bai Xiaofei walked straight towards the door.</p>
 <p>“Now now, excuse me, would you? Don’t be so rude.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei commented as he squeezed through Fang Yuesheng’s classmates and walked straight towards Bai Kai.</p>
 <p>“Hey, you’re Little Kai, right? Why are you looking so serious? I might have been rather ruthless in the past but you don’t have to hold a grudge over it, right?”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s appearance caused Fang Yuesheng to frown. The seemingly carefree manner in which Bai Xiaofei was conducting himself made him hesitate. Nowadays, most people in the academy knew who Bai Xiaofei was. Naturally, Fang Yuesheng was no exception to this. Bai Xiaofei was capable of mobilizing an impressive number of people to his aid, making everyone who faced him think twice. Therefore, everyone would think twice when facing him.</p>
 <p>“Class Monitor Bai must be kidding. It’s not like I am in a standoff against you right now.”</p>
 <p>Bai Kai forced a smile onto his face. He was no fool. He could see that Bai Xiaofei was obviously here to relieve them of their current predicament.</p>
 <p>“Oh? If it’s not me, then it must be this guy over here, then?”</p>
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei spoke, he turned around. Instantly, his expression went through a complete shift. The vicious and sinister expression he had on now sent a chill up the spines of everyone in Fang Yuesheng’s class.</p>
 <p>“Who gave you guys the guts to challenge my friends?”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, his origin energy roiled out. Instantly, he started emanating the aura of a Master Rank puppet master. His strength was the source of his confidence!</p>
 <p>“So what if you’re a Master Rank? I am here for Hu Xian’er, not you, Bai Xiaofei. Mind your own business!”</p>
 <p>Fang Yuesheng’s aura started rising as well. He had no intention of backing off at all.</p>
 <p>“You’re looking for Xian’er, you say?”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei sneered.</p>
 <p>“I see. That makes things easier. I can give you a chance, but first, I need to ask you a question.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s sudden change of attitude stunned everyone, Fang Yuesheng included.</p>
 <p>“Have you paid up yet?”</p>
