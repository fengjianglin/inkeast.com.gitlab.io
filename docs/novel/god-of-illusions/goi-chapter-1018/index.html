 <p>Chapter 1018: Awakened!</p> 
 <p>“He who strikes first prevails, he who strikes late suffers. Instead of waiting for them to get together and condemn us, we can cut them off!”</p> 
 <p>In the face of the Third Elder’s horror, Bai Xiaofei’s reply was resolute.</p> 
 <p>“Ridiculous! You are seeking death!” The Third Elder smacked the table as he trembled with anger. The force turned the stone table into powder.</p> 
 <p>“You know very well if I’m seeking death or trying to survive, Father. Do you really think we will be safe by doing nothing? You know better than me what they think. Unless I resign from my position, they won’t stop!” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>The Third Elder’s mouth twitched, but from his expression, it was obvious that he agreed with Bai Xiaofei. After a long silence…</p> 
 <p>“How sure are you?” asked the Third Elder after he had calmed down.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately smiled in excitement. “As long as you’re in this with me, I’m one hundred percent sure! But this can’t be delayed. We need to move now, or we will miss the best opportunity when they react!” Bai Xiaofei struck while the iron was hot for fear that the Third Elder would back out.</p> 
 <p>“The First Elder is the strongest among them. I can’t be sure that I can win against him. Have you considered what to do if the other elders come when we fight him?” questioned the Third Elder coldly as his careful character finally prevailed.</p> 
 <p><em>Dang, this old guy is not easy to fool!</em></p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, no one will intervene, I will hold them off!” Bai Xiaofei declared.</p> 
 <p>“And how are you going to do that?” The Third Elder frowned in confusion. He knew very well what his son was capable of. Let alone three elders together, it was already difficult for Mamba to be able to fend off one.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I’m not going to fight them, but I can guarantee that no one will be able to interfere before the First Elder falls,” Bai Xiaofei vowed. He looked so certain that the Third Elder sank into thought.</p> 
 <p>In the end, the Third Elder said stubbornly, “I won’t agree unless you tell me what you are going to do.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei just wanted to strangle him. <em>If I could just tell you, I wouldn’t have to be this evasive!</em></p> 
 <p>“I have awakened,” Qiu Muxue stepped in and declared.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the Third Elder’s eyes widened in utter disbelief. “You have awakened?!” And almost immediately, his hesitation became resolution and his attitude took a U-turn. “If so, it’s time we overturned this place!”</p> 
 <p>The sudden turn of events startled Bai Xiaofei, but he was wise not to show it on his face. He encouraged the Third Elder, “Just let everything go and do it however you like, Father. This Barbaric Godism is going to be all yours in the future!”</p> 
 <p>Then, Bai Xiaofei briefly explained his plan to the Third Elder. While the latter kept nodding and letting out sounds to indicate that he was listening, his eyes darted to Qiu Muxue from time to time. Obviously, he was still occupied by her announcement earlier.</p> 
 <p>After the Third Elder set out, Bai Xiaofei immediately went up to Qiu Muxue. “What is this awakening thing? Why did he change his mind as soon as you said you had awakened?”</p> 
 <p>It was impossible not to be curious about something that could abruptly change the attitude of the stubborn old man.</p> 
 <p>“The special ability of the Sacks comes from the Barbaric God stone idol. Besides this special ability, we’ve also gained the potential to awaken once certain conditions are met. Once the awakening is successful, not only will the physical quality be strengthened further – to the extreme, but one will also gain something that far exceeds that,” Qiu Muxue explained.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei immediately looked envious. “Is it difficult to awaken?” He gulped.</p> 
 <p>“It’s not just difficult, it’s one in a million. From the emergence of the stone idol till now, only two clansmen have ever awakened. It’s a pity that those two killed each other during a power struggle, otherwise, the Sacks wouldn’t be in this state.” Qiu Muxue sighed.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei’s eyes lit up. “If so, aren’t you invincible?!”</p> 
 <p>Qiu Muxue rolled her eyes. “If I had really awakened, why would I bother seeking your help? I would have just directly uprooted Barbaric Godism. I was only selling him a lie just now, or else he’d never be so agreeable to your plan.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei sighed. He thought the next part of the plan could go much more smoothly, but it turned out it still needed to rely on lying and tricking people…</p> 
 <p>“Alright, how are you going to hold off the other three elders? Let me tell you, regarding close combat ability, any of them can instantly take you down,” Qiu Muxue stated what she knew to be a fact.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei laughed. “How about this?” he asked as his appearance changed into the Third Elder as did his voice. “Presumably, they also know that it’s impossible for the Guard Team to beat the First Elder without the Third Elder’s help. Therefore, as long as they see me, they naturally won’t think much. I’ll at most waste some saliva stalling them.”</p> 
 <p>“No wonder you always gave the teachers a headache. Your brain works really fast, and your Mimicry is pretty much invincible anywhere,” Qiu Muxue sincerely praised.</p> 
 <p>“Come on, time won’t wait for anyone,” said Bai Xiaofei as he headed out.</p> 
 <p>The two went straight to the meeting hall of Barbaric Godism. Not long after, the Second, Fourth, and Fifth Elder also showed up there. Upon seeing Bai Xiaofei and Qiu Muxue, the atmosphere obviously became hostile.</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, the elders’ relationship had yet to reach the degree where they’d fight on sight, so Bai Xiaofei’s disguise was successfully maintained, which let him heave a sigh of relief. Otherwise, his plan would burst like a bubble no matter how outstanding it was.</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t they say the First Elder wanted to discuss something with us? Why isn’t he here, but you came instead?” The first to speak was the Second Elder, who looked even younger compared to the Third Elder.</p> 
 <p>“I was called here just like you. If you ask me, then who should I ask? Maybe the First Elder is still preparing something.” Bai Xiaofei kicked the ball away and swept a glance at the three elders. “Everyone, I wonder if you have heard a rumor recently.”</p> 
 <p>This immediately gathered the attention of the three elders.</p> 
 <p>“Since it’s a rumor, it naturally can’t be trusted. What’s the point of bringing it up?”</p> 
 <p>The Second Elder wasn’t half bad when it came kicking the ball away. This remark made Bai Xiaofei sit up at his renewed perception of the Sacks’ IQ. <em>I really underestimated these people!</em></p> 
 <p>“As you all know, I don’t usually believe in rumors, but this one has to do with me and so is hard to ignore.” Bai Xiaofei sighed deeply.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the three elders inwardly grew nervous.</p> 
 <p>“Then let’s talk about it. What is it to be able to bug you like this?” The Fourth Elder took the bait.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei took back his praise. <em>There is something wrong with this one’s brain…</em></p> 
 <p>“Some people say that you want to use our defeat to condemn me and my son,” he replied.</p> 
 <p>The expressions of the three elders instantly changed. Everyone knew about this, but they didn’t expect him to just directly say it on this occasion.</p> 
 <p>“Someone’s been too bored and making unfound rumors!” The Fifth Elder was like a cat whose tail got stepped on, but he instantly regretted it. <em>Damn mouth, if you deny it now, how are you going to act when you want to condemn them later?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Fifth Elder is right. We have all been working hard to run Barbaric Godism together for so long, of course we cannot do that kind of thing to each other, you can rest assured, Third Elder. However, the clan suffered too heavy a loss this time and many promising talents died in the war. No matter what, you need to give the public an explanation,” the Second Elder intervened and saved the situation.</p> 
 <p>In just a few exchanges, Bai Xiaofei had roughly weighed the IQs of the elders and came to a conclusion: The Second Elder must die!</p> 
 <p>“Of course there will be a public statement now that the Saintess is here,” Bai Xiaofei said and stepped aside, revealing Qiu Muxue who had been standing behind him.</p> 
 <p><em>What statement?!</em></p> 
 <p>Qiu Muxue was caught off guard, but since Bai Xiaofei had pushed her into the spotlight, she had to make up an explanation. As she brooded it over, Bai Xiaofei’s voice suddenly rang out directly in her mind and she immediately revealed a confident smile.</p> 
 <p>“Respected Elders, if I remember correctly, a long time ago, our Barbaric Godism made a vow to abide by an agreement,” she said and raised her right hand.</p> 
 <p>When everyone focused on her hand, Bai Xiaofei quietly launched Spiritualization.</p> 
 <p>“My statement is, I have awakened!”</p> 
 <p>As soon as her voice dropped, the surroundings distorted. The hard stone floor and walls suddenly came to life and turned into various forms under Qiu Muxue’s ‘manipulation.’</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, the elders’ eyes widened in shock.</p> 
 <p><em>She’s really awakened?!!!</em></p>
