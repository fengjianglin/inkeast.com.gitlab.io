 <p>Chapter 672: Are You Kidding Me?!</p> 
 <p>Seeing Cang Lan’s right arm again, Bai Xiaofei had completely different feelings from last time. He had been afraid and nervous then, now he was simply thrilled.</p> 
 <p>So much effort, just for this moment!</p> 
 <p>“In addition to tough meridians and fine control over energy, there is also a very important premise for practicing God Control. It is implanting God Control silk into your body!” Cang Lan raised his right hand and four purple-gold energy threads appeared on his palm.</p> 
 <p>Although they looked like energy entities, the four juniors could feel their physical mass using their spirits. To sum up, those threads were beyond their cognition of common sense.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t guess, I made this silk with hundreds of materials and the unique energy of God Control. You can’t have seen anything like it at all except here. Do you really think that I’ve been idle all this past month?” said Cang Lan lightly.</p> 
 <p>The juniors’ eyes shone, even Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p><em>Who knew this smelly old man had such a reliable side to him? And here I thought he only knew how to eat and drink.</em></p> 
 <p>“So, we can practice God Control if we implant this thing?” Such a question could only come from Leng Liuying, and she was also the only one who could make Cang Lan answer truthfully.</p> 
 <p>“As I have said, this is only the premise. If God Control was so easy to learn, I would have had disciples all over the world.” Cang Lan raised his right hand and looked at the four seriously. “Now, let go of your mind, or the God Control silk won’t be able to fuse into your body.”</p> 
 <p>The four juniors immediately did what he said.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei wasn’t worried about Cang Lan’s revenge at a time like this. He was not so stupid, and he also believed that Cang Lan was not either.</p> 
 <p>After the four seemingly entered a trance, Cang Lan took a deep breath, and the four silk threads in his hand flew out one after another, slowly feeling their way in from the top of their heads.</p> 
 <p>This was why Cang Lan wanted them to let go of their consciousness. The fusion of the God Control silk started from the spiritual level. If they resisted, this fusion would become an attack!</p> 
 <p>For the triplets, the fusion could be said to be smooth sailing. The moment the silk sank into their heads, their faces immediately showed pain.</p> 
 <p>“Endure, it will be over soon,” Cang Lan reminded right away.</p> 
 <p>However, Bai Xiaofei was stunned for half a day upon hearing it. <em>Endure? Endure what? Why don’t I feel anything?</em></p> 
 <p>Unable to control his curiosity, Bai Xiaofei opened his eyes and took a peek. What he saw shocked him.</p> 
 <p>Not a millimeter of the silk above his head had melded in as the thread wiggled in a struggle. Not only that, but the end near Bai Xiaofei’s head had gradually lost its brilliance and seemed like it was going to dissipate soon.</p> 
 <p><em>Holy sh*t! What the hell is going on here?!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was horrified. Meanwhile, Cang Lan was very clear about the answer, but there was nothing he could do to help.</p> 
 <p>It was the Endless State!</p> 
 <p>To a certain extent, the silk trying to fuse was regarded as an energy attack, and this ‘attack’ was not very strong, so the Endless State would stop it and absorb its energy. In other words, after a while, the silk on Bai Xiaofei’s head would be absorbed…</p> 
 <p>However, Cang Lan was unable to do anything about it.</p> 
 <p>Firstly, he was controlling the fusion process of four people at the same time. Now that the triplets had entered a critical stage, he couldn’t be distracted.</p> 
 <p>Second, Cang Lan didn’t dare to increase the energy input of the silk. With his Legend Rank power, he indeed could break through Bai Xiaofei’s defense and force it into Bai Xiaofei’s body, but in that case, Bai Xiaofei would likely become an idiot…</p> 
 <p>“Brat, control your Endless State, or all your efforts will go down the drain!” Although Cang Lan couldn’t help, a reminder wasn’t a problem.</p> 
 <p>However, this reminder was of little significance to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>As early as when he had first activated the Endless State, Gu Xing had told him that the biggest drawback was how uncontrollable it was. It was already not easy for Bai Xiaofei to be able to change its frequency, it was simply a wild dream to turn it off.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, Bai Xiaofei could only watch as the thread above his head darkened bit by bit…</p> 
 <p>Bit by bit…</p> 
 <p>Before long, Cang Lan retracted his origin energy and heaved a sigh of relief. The sweat on his forehead showed that he didn’t have it easy either. However, the silk of Bai Xiaofei had turned into a useless thin thread…</p> 
 <p>“Is it over?” Leng Liuying asked in surprise and her big eyes fell upon Cang Lan. The other two had the same reaction.</p> 
 <p>“Mhm, it’s done,” Cang Lan replied.</p> 
 <p>The surprise on the three girls’ faces became full of joy. They then looked at Bai Xiaofei in unison, full of expectation, which quickly dissipated when they saw his long face.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter?” Leng Liuli hesitantly asked for all three.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei smiled wryly and helplessly looked at Cang Lan.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know, but I believe the old man didn’t mean it,” Bai Xiaofei probed.</p> 
 <p>The triplets turned to look at Cang Lan, three pairs of beautiful eyes full of doubt. Seeing this, Cang Lan snorted.</p> 
 <p>Although Bai Xiaofei said it tactfully, the suspicion in his voice couldn’t be more obvious. If it weren’t that Cang Lan wanted to take the triplets’ feelings into consideration, he would have just flung his sleeves and walked away.</p> 
 <p>“I definitely did what I promised, but I didn’t think that the Endless State would resist the fusion of God Control,” he said coldly.</p> 
 <p>The four juniors immediately understood. Bai Xiaofei bitterly looked at his hands with a helpless sigh.</p> 
 <p>The triplets quickly exchanged glances, and the next second, they surrounded Cang Lan.</p> 
 <p>“Grandpa, you must be tired. Come and sit down, and Liuying will massage your shoulders.”</p> 
 <p>“Grandpa, which wine would you like? I’ll pour it for you.“</p> 
 <p>“Oh, it’s time to prepare dinner, I’m going!”</p> 
 <p>Everyone was diligent to please Cang Lan.</p> 
 <p>“Okay, stop that. Don’t think I don’t know your intent.”</p> 
 <p>Cang Lan rolled his eyes at the triplets, earning their cute tongue-sticking faces, then looked coldly at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“In fact, you are not without any chance.”</p>
