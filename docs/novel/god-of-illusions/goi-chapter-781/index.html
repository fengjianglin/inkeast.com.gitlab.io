 <p>Chapter 781: I Have My Rules!</p> 
 <p>“Inform those who have not yet begun their mission to come and wait outside the auction house. As for Fang Ye, tell him to come straight to me,” Bai Xiaofei told Rui Mengqi after successfully making Dragon King stay.</p> 
 <p>No one else in the whole room knew what he was talking about. However, they speculated that the people he was contacting were definitely not simple – at least Exquisite Rank!</p> 
 <p>They really thought too much…</p> 
 <p>The last break of the auction ended not long after Rui Mengqi left. Outside, the sky was already dark.</p> 
 <p>“That felt like a long wait, didn’t it? Up next is the last round of today’s auction. I won’t talk much, so let us welcome our first item!”</p> 
 <p>Qing Han returned to the stage. Unlike the previous rounds, he did not worry about this one at all. Unify Business’ slave auctions had never once failed to sell an ‘item’ even with the worst auctioneer, let alone him who was the former chief auctioneer.</p> 
 <p>As soon as Qing Han finished speaking, the first slave was brought up: a tall and burly man!</p> 
 <p>The man was over two meters tall. His bulging, granite-like muscles were barely covered under the shabby clothes on his body. His eyes sharply scanned all the auction guests as if wanting to kill them all.</p> 
 <p>“Our first item is a Grandmaster Rank martial artist who was once the general of a dukedom. After the collapse of said dukedom, he volunteered to sell himself as a slave in order to protect his princess. However, as you can see, ‘volunteered’ is probably misjudging the situation, but I believe that you all have a way to resolve this. Starting price: one million amethyst coins!”</p> 
 <p>By the end of the introduction, some people had already placed their hands on the bid buttons.</p> 
 <p>A Grandmaster Rank martial artist who could compare with an Exquisite Rank puppet master would make a great bodyguard. Even if he fell short to an Exquisite Rank puppet master, bullying a Grandmaster Rank puppet master was not a problem.</p> 
 <p>Before long, the price was raised to eight million and was still rising steadily. Bai Xiaofei gave a long sigh.</p> 
 <p>“Young Master, why the sigh?” Qing Ya asked in confusion. As he would be her future boss, it was necessary that she had a deep understanding of him.</p> 
 <p>“A mighty Grandmaster Rank martial artist who used his whole life to cultivate to this level, but is now a commodity on an auction stage for such a low price. Isn’t it absurd?” Bai Xiaofei shook his head. He found it hard to adapt to the slave auction.</p> 
 <p>“The law of the jungle and the survival of the fittest are the unchanging laws of this continent.” Qing Ya looked at Bai Xiaofei, obviously ready to engage in a debate.</p> 
 <p>“This is the world of mankind, not beasts. There is nothing wrong with the law of the jungle, but what is the reason for this kind of meaningless killing and abuse?” Bai Xiaofei asked back.</p> 
 <p>However, his question did not stump her.</p> 
 <p>“Starnet Continent is divided into two by the Infinite Mountain Range. Setting aside the relationship between the Southern and Northern regions for the time being, even within the Northern Borders alone, there are already endless conflicts between the various countries and dukedoms following the major empires they are under. People will never stop fighting each other as long as there are benefits.”</p> 
 <p>“To stop this situation, the continent has to be unified under one legal system, or else this will only continue!” Qing Ya solemnly pointed out the only way to Bai Xiaofei. Unfortunately, this way was a bit too far out of reach.</p> 
 <p>“Believe me, even without that, things that should not exist like these will still disappear slowly.” Bai Xiaofei chuckled and stopped the argument there as his focus returned to the auction.</p> 
 <p>By that time, the auction for the burly man was over. The bidder who won took him away for eighteen million amethyst coins. The second item was quickly brought up after: a pair of 13 to 14-year-old young girls who looked almost identical.</p> 
 <p>“Southern Borders twin girls, starting price of five million amethyst coins,” Qing Han only announced the price.</p> 
 <p>Hearing that, Bai Xiaofei was stupefied. He blurted out in disbelief, “Two girls without any fighting capacity have a starting price higher than a Grandmaster Rank martial artist?! What is this madness?!”</p> 
 <p>However, when his eyes fell on Luo and Xia, Bai Xiaofei was struck with realization. Seething with anger, he placed his hand on the button.</p> 
 <p>“Young Master, I don’t suggest being impulsive. According to my understanding of slave auctions, there will be more than just a few girls like this tonight. If you save them all, you may be powerless when the ones you really want appear,” Shaman King interrupted before Bai Xiaofei could call a bid.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hesitated. Then, he glared at Qing Ya, his voice as cold as ice, “Tell me, how many like these two are there tonight?!”</p> 
 <p>“If… if you want to save them all, it will roughly take 200 billion…” Qing Ya hesitantly stated a shocking number.</p> 
 <p>“Very good! Unify Business, huh?! Good job!” Laughing out of fury, Bai Xiaofei put his hand on the button again.</p> 
 <p><em>This lord doesn’t give a sh*t about rules and whatnot! I only ask for a clear conscience! Since I’m here, don’t even think of doing bad things in front of me!</em></p> 
 <p>“Fifty million!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s domineering voice echoed around the hall and sent everyone into silence. Deeming it worthless to compete for a pair of twins with the idiotic young master, all the bidders chose to give up after some thought. In their opinion, he had the same intention as them. Therefore, they thought that he would stop if they satisfied him this one time.</p> 
 <p>However, they soon realized that they were wrong!</p> 
 <p>For the next six slaves in a row, whether it was a former noble lady or goddess of some small organization, or a princess of a small dukedom, as long as they could be used as pretty decorations, Bai Xiaofei took them all. In a short time, he had slapped everyone with over two hundred million Amethyst Coins, more than the price of a peak-grade Blood Diamond!</p> 
 <p>“Brat, are you not afraid of dying in bed?!” Someone finally couldn’t help it, and stood up and shouted at Bai Xiaofei’s private room.</p> 
 <p>“Worry not, this young master is in great health. Let alone these few, I can handle all that this auction has, and all at once. Who told me to have such a hobby, right?” Bai Xiaofei burst out laughing.</p> 
 <p>However, the women he bought did not panic at all. As soon as they were brought to the private room, Qing Ya helped them remove their collars and explained to them carefully…</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was not a lecher, but a savior…</p>
