 <p>Chapter 454: You Don’t Know Me?</p> 
 <p>“Said everything you need to say?” After they left Bai Xiaofei, Qing Shuang broke the silence on the way back.</p> 
 <p>“Yeah.” Nie Qing nodded with a relaxed expression.</p> 
 <p>“No regrets? In fact, if you want to follow him, big bro will let you go,” tempted Qing Shuang.</p> 
 <p>“No regrets. Sometimes, it’s not necessarily a good thing to be together all the time. Distance will make things seem more beautiful, right?” replied Nie Qing.</p> 
 <p>Hearing the resolution in her voice, Qing Shuang’s heart settled.</p> 
 <p>“It’s good that you’ve thought it through. Don’t be all upset again after we get back. We don’t have time to comfort you every day.” Qing Shuang started teasing now that everything was normal again. The atmosphere between them instantly turned into a playful one between BFFs.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei lay quietly in bed. All the things that happened between him and Nie Qing ever since they had met flashed through his mind.</p> 
 <p><em>The outside world is really interesting!</em></p> 
 <p>The next day, news of Bai Xiaofei’s recovery spread. After dealing with a series of visitors, Bai Xiaofei hurriedly asked someone to help him send a letter.</p> 
 <p>He hoped that the letter could catch up with Qin Lingyan, or else he might have to live in regret for the rest of his life.</p> 
 <p>Counting from the arrival at the Bright Road Merchant House, they had been here for nearly half a year, and Bai Xiaofei’s freshman year was coming to an end. After paying Shang Youdao and Gu Heng one last visit, Bai Xiaofei told the group it was time to leave.</p> 
 <p>It was time. If he didn’t go back, his home would really explode.</p> 
 <p>Catching wind of this, Gu Heng found Bai Xiaofei again. Since the Thunderstorm Bandits also had to leave, Gu Heng planned to hold a farewell ceremony for both parties with insistence.</p> 
 <p>Because Bai Xiaofei wanted to see the Thunderstorm Bandits again, he agreed.</p> 
 <p>His plan of leaving was postponed for two days. During this, Gu Heng mobilized over half of the people in the palace for the preparation, which showed how seriously he regarded this ceremony.</p> 
 <p>It was worth mentioning that the Thunderstorm Bandits had also agreed, so the meeting that Bai Xiaofei was looking forward to had become a sure thing.</p> 
 <p>Two days passed in intense preparation and expectation. On the third night, in the hall where Bai Xiaofei and Nie Qing met for the first time, the farewell banquet was in full swing.</p> 
 <p>Gu Heng only invited people who Bai Xiaofei knew, including Commander Kang, Garrison Commander Wang, Hou Jin, and Shen Qiandong, along with their family members.</p> 
 <p>They were all people who risked their lives for Gu Heng.</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei’s group arrived, Gu Heng was already greeting the Thunderstorm Bandits, proposing one toast after another. He didn’t act like the king of a country at all in front of them, even the clothes he wore were ordinary. This made the Thunderstorm Bandits feel very comfortable.</p> 
 <p>Even though they weren’t confronting the people of the Globe Merchant House for Gu Heng’s sake, it was an indisputable fact that they had helped him. There was no one who didn’t want due returns for their efforts, even if the return was only respect.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai, you’re finally here! If you didn’t come soon I might have passed out from the wine!” Gu Heng immediately walked over with a cup and a wine flask as soon as he saw Bai Xiaofei. The Thunderstorm Bandits also looked over with friendly eyes.</p> 
 <p>“It’s better to drink less alcohol. Your identity is different now. You need to stay sober all the time, or they will say that you are a fatuous ruler.” Bai Xiaofei suddenly acted serious and threw everyone off… “But not this time!”</p> 
 <p>His rare serious expression instantly collapsed as he accepted the cup Gu Heng handed him and drained it.</p> 
 <p>The sudden change once again stunned everyone.</p> 
 <p>“Can’t let you off for fooling around, Brother Bai. You won’t be forgiven without three cups!” Gu Heng soon adjusted and shook the flask in front of Bai Xiaofei, smiling like they were good friends.</p> 
 <p>“That’s not a problem, but don’t you suppose it’s kind of boring to drink alone?”</p> 
 <p>“I’ll accompany you!” A crisp, familiar voice rang out from the direction of the Thunderstorm Bandits. Looking over, everyone saw Nie Qing looking at Bai Xiaofei domineeringly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei actually wanted to trick Gu Heng big time, but now…</p> 
 <p>His embarrassed face made everyone laugh. The atmosphere of the banquet picked up with him and Gu Heng starting a drinking competition.</p> 
 <p>One cup after another was raised and the aroma of the wine filled the hall. From the beginning when they were in high spirits till drinking silly, the quantity of wine kept decreasing and their understanding of one another increased.</p> 
 <p>However, only one person was a special case – Chu Yue.</p> 
 <p>“Huh? Why do you seem completely normal? Confess, are you cheating?!” A drunk Zhao Tiantian grabbed Chu Yue’s shoulder. Unknown if it was due to the alcohol or embarrassment, her face had an added attractive blush.</p> 
 <p>“Guess?” Sneering, Chu Yue revealed an expression that Zhao Tiantian was extremely unfamiliar with. In an instant, she sobered up.</p> 
 <p>“What’s wrong with you?!” cried Zhao Tiantian, drawing the glances of the surrounding people.</p> 
 <p>“Nothing wrong. I’m great, great like never before!”</p> 
 <p>With a cold smile, Chu Yue stood up slowly and walked straight towards Bai Xiaofei who was chatting gleefully with Fang Lei and Yun Mo.</p> 
 <p>“Meow!!!” Just as Chu Yue was about to approach, Blackie, who was sneaking food from somewhere, jumped out and blocked him, all of the fur on its body standing on end.</p> 
 <p>As their minds were linked, Bai Xiaofei was jolted sober. Looking at Chu Yue coming closer, his face was full of tension and confusion.</p> 
 <p>“Senior, are you okay?” Bai Xiaofei asked gently, but the origin energy in his body started to mobilize.</p> 
 <p>Just now, Blackie told him that Chu Yue radiated murderous intent! However, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t find anything wrong, and even Blackie was sure that the person in front of them was the real Chu Yue.</p> 
 <p>Then, how could Chu Yue have killing intent towards him?</p> 
 <p>“You know what my puppet is.” Ignoring everyone’s reaction, Chu Yue slowly asked a confusing question.</p> 
 <p>“Senior, you…”</p> 
 <p>“Don’t call me senior, I don’t have such good luck to be a student of Starnet. Heh, this puppet ability is a good one though!”</p> 
 <p>‘Chu Yue’ spoke again. No sooner than he finished his words did Bai Xiaofei suddenly find himself losing the ability to control his body!</p> 
 <p>Fair Replacement!</p> 
 <p>“You are Tang Bing?!” cried Bai Xiaofei as he suddenly felt a familiar ominous feeling that gave him goosebumps all over.</p> 
 <p>“Why, you don’t know me anymore now that I’ve changed bodies?” ‘Chu Yue’s’ lips curled up into a cold-blooded, insane smile…</p>
