 <p>Chapter 471: Chu Liuyun’s Background!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei slowly returned to his human form and a worn-out and dispirited Huskie broke away from his body. Bai Xiaofei extended his hand to Zhu Guang in a friendly manner with a smile.</p> 
 <p>“Senior, pardon my offense.”</p> 
 <p>Looking at Bai Xiaofei, Zhu Guang hesitantly extended his hand as well.</p> 
 <p>“My strength is inferior. I concede defeat!”</p> 
 <p>Zhu Guang was straightforward, but he was now without the confidence at the beginning. In this duel, he had been completely beaten by Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“There is something I don’t understand. Aren’t you a puppet master of the Illusion Stream? How…” His brows slightly creased, Zhu Guang still asked in the end. He just wanted a clear reason for his defeat.</p> 
 <p>“It’s an ability I just got. This is my first time using it.” Bai Xiaofei didn’t explain in detail and Zhu Guang didn’t probe.</p> 
 <p>“With your current combat ability, you can already strive for the top ten.” This sentence was heartfelt. Zhu Guang knew the level of the Combat rankers. Several of those in the top ten were no match for Bai Xiaofei at all.</p> 
 <p>“Actually, the rankings are meaningless. After all, I can’t beat the first place.” Bai Xiaofei revealed an embarrassed smile as Hu Xian’er’s figure appeared in his mind. Although he had become stronger, he still couldn’t think of any way to counter her Permanence.</p> 
 <p>As long as one failed to stop this blow from her, there was no possibility of victory…</p> 
 <p>“Oh… okay.” Stunned, Zhu Guang replied somewhat dully.</p> 
 <p>“Since you are fine, I will leave first. I still have something to do.” Bai Xiaofei pulled a random excuse to run away.</p> 
 <p>Zhu Guang really didn’t want to face him either. The two tacitly agreed on this, and the crowd of onlookers dispersed as they both left.</p> 
 <p>“Just what was that just now? Huskie’s new ability?” Chu Liuyun’s curiosity made an appearance after they left God Amongst Men. Meanwhile, she was feeling proud and happy from the bottom of her heart. She was even happier than Bai Xiaofei himself about his improvement in strength…</p> 
 <p>“It’s a long story, but you kinda got it right. I learned a secret art. It allows me to temporarily gain the abilities of an animated puppet when it was still a magical beast, hence the transformation,” Bai Xiaofei said and looked at Huskie, who was being held in Chu Liuyun’s arms. As compensation for the hard work, he didn’t drive it out from this warm position.</p> 
 <p>“A secret art? Then, isn’t it impossible to use it often?” cried Chu Liuyun in surprise.</p> 
 <p>“The puppet will have a weakened period of seven days. During this, its skills can’t be used.” Bai Xiaofei didn’t hide anything from Chu Liuyun.</p> 
 <p>“But there are still many challengers! This is only the first one, and there are also the followers of Lin Li, Xian’er, and the Leng sisters…” Chu Liuyun counted with her fingers, her face full of worry. With his remaining puppet, Bai Xiaofei could only fight one more!</p> 
 <p>“With Zhu Guang beaten like that, do you think many people will still dare to challenge me?” Bai Xiaofei smiled.</p> 
 <p>Chu Liuyun was stunned. Indeed, Zhu Guang had beaten a little too badly! Bai Xiaofei was right. Unless it was someone who far exceeded Zhu Guang in strength, no one would try to seek death…</p> 
 <p>“It turns out that you have it all thought out. No wonder you tormented Zhu Guang like that.” During the duel, Chu Liuyun had wondered why Bai Xiaofei didn’t make it a quick victory. It turned out that he had a purpose.</p> 
 <p>“No, at first I just wanted to try how strong this secret art is. After all, it was the first time I used it. I was thinking about exploring my own limit using Zhu Guang, but I didn’t expect him to be so weak…” Bai Xiaofei even sighed when he said this. His expression was really asking for a beating.</p> 
 <p>“Well, you can just plan another one…” Embarrassed, Chu Liuyun laughed. Since Bai Xiaofei could solve every problem coming his way, why would she even worry for nothing?</p> 
 <p>“Big Sister Liuyun, you are going to graduate, right…?” Bai Xiaofei suddenly stopped and asked a question that made Chu Liuyun’s expression freeze.</p> 
 <p>If she could, she really didn’t want to go.</p> 
 <p>But…</p> 
 <p>“That’s right, I have to go back. It hadn’t been easy to get my family to agree to let me out for four years,” Chu Liuyun said with a hint of struggle. She got a headache at the mention of her family alone. Everyone had their own difficult family experience, and Chu Liuyun was no exception. Her helplessness about herself was her greatest sorrow.</p> 
 <p>“I’ve never heard you mention your situation at home. Since you’re leaving soon, can’t you tell me? Otherwise, how will I find you in the future?” Bai Xiaofei stroked Chu Liuyun’s head. The intimate action made her blush red.</p> 
 <p>“Will you really come look for me?” Chu Liuyun looked up at Bai Xiaofei. She was now without that temperament of the big sister of the Demon of Illusions. Her expression was frail and invoked pity.</p> 
 <p>“Or else? Watch you marry someone else? I can’t do it!” declared Bai Xiaofei. His tone of regarding Chu Liuyun as something of his possession pleased her.</p> 
 <p>“You must know the Multihouse Business…” said Chu Liuyun weakly, her face uneasy.</p> 
 <p>Although she knew that Bai Xiaofei would not be afraid of anyone, she somehow worried that he didn’t want to take such a big risk. All people in the merchant group were very practical. If Bai Xiaofei didn’t have an equal standing to her, her love for him would likely be a disaster to his life…</p> 
 <p>“Multihouse?! You are the young lady of the Multihouse Business?!” Bai Xiaofei exclaimed as he felt like he had discovered something unimaginable.</p> 
 <p><em>How come all the girls around me are so complicated!?</em></p> 
 <p>“No, no, no. You’re not wrong, but it’s different from what you think.” Chu Liuyun hurriedly waved her arms with a contradictory sentence. Then, she slowly explained, “All of the nine major merchant groups don’t belong to one person or clan, but consist of large families or consortia. Our Chu clan is one of the six major families of Multihouse, sharing some of its businesses.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was enlightened. <em>So they work like this…</em></p> 
 <p>“Where is the Chu family? Don’t tell me the six families you mentioned all live together.”</p> 
 <p>As the saying went, there couldn’t be two tigers in one mountain. Even allies didn’t necessarily need to stay close.</p> 
 <p>“In Cloud City of the Violethorn Empire,” Chu Liuyun answered with expectation in her eyes. She was already picturing the scene of two people meeting when Bai Xiaofei went to find her. If he really stood in front of her then, she would promise anything, even if he wanted her to elope with him!</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I will find you!”</p> 
 <p>A gentleman’s promise was priceless. Although Bai Xiaofei wasn’t a gentleman, his promise was much more expensive than that of one!</p>
