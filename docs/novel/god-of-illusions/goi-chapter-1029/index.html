 <p>Chapter 1029: Awake</p> 
 <p>“Finally!”</p> 
 <p>On the Windsurfing Ship, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but feel excited when he saw Moonlight’s imperial capital in the distance.</p> 
 <p><em>Qing’er, I’ve kept you waiting!</em></p> 
 <p>“Boss, you’re finally back!”</p> 
 <p>A familiar voice rang out when Bai Xiaofei’s group had just arrived at the city gate. They looked over to see Zhuang Shuo scrambling toward them.</p> 
 <p>“Boss!!” Zhuang Shuo pounced on Bai Xiaofei with a bear hug, rubbing his snot and tears on Bai Xiaofei’s clothes.</p> 
 <p>“Why are you crying like someone’s bullying you?!” Bai Xiaofei tried to break free. The hug was so tight that he felt like he would be crushed to death.</p> 
 <p>“No no no! Boss! We are having a great time here! No one in the whole imperial city dares to underestimate our Fickle Army, even the nobles have to be polite when they see us! Our stories have been made into books!” Zhuang Shuo was eager to talk about his current situation, his arms dancing animatedly.</p> 
 <p>“That’s great. Go and inform our brothers, I’ll come to see you guys in two days. Right now I have something to do.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s tone was indifferent, but Zhuang Shuo had been around him long enough to know that this was his attitude when he was serious.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry and go handle your things, Boss. Our brothers are all in the capital and can assemble at any time. If you need us to run any errands, just call. Right now, there should be nothing that the Fickle Army can’t do in the capital,” Zhuang Shuo assured and stepped aside.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei turned to look at Tan Xin and the Demonic God of Pain. “You two go with him.”</p> 
 <p>For once, the two didn’t defy him. They knew what he was going to do, and they also knew that he did not want to be disturbed by anyone.</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei headed straight to the palace, and at the entrance, he saw Ye Tong already waiting for him.</p> 
 <p>“I really don’t know what’s wrong with my sister, telling me to wait here as soon as you returned. If it weren’t that Sister Qingtong stopped her, she would have come herself,” complained Ye Tong with a jealous expression for the attention Ye Qingcheng gave Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Lead the way, I don’t want to waste time talking nonsense with you today.” The closer Bai Xiaofei got, the more nervous he was. There was no sign of his usual smile at all.</p> 
 <p>“You!”</p> 
 <p>Ye Tong wanted to go on a rampage, but Bai Xiaofei ignored her and walked in. Seeing him acting so unusual, she quieted down.</p> 
 <p>The two people didn’t say a single word along the way. Ye Tong was secretly observing Bai Xiaofei, while his mind was fully occupied by only one thing…</p> 
 <p>“Sister, I brought the annoying brat!” shouted Ye Tong upon arriving at Ye Qingcheng’s new sleeping quarters.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you, Tong’er, go and do your thing.” Ye Qingcheng smiled faintly.</p> 
 <p>Ye Tong was upset, but for once, she didn’t throw her temper around as both Bai Xiaofei and Ye Qingcheng gave her a strange feeling.</p> 
 <p>After Ye Tong left, Ye Qingcheng spoke, “You don’t have to be so nervous. She’s all right. What you’re worried about won’t happen.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei relaxed a little. He forced out a smile and followed Ye Qingcheng inside. After passing through the secret passage he saw Nie Qing lying quietly on the ice bed.</p> 
 <p>His heart beating uncontrollably, Bai Xiaofei half-knelt beside the bed. After gazing at Nie Qing for a while, he took out the Revival Grass.</p> 
 <p>“What should I do?” He turned to look at Ye Qingcheng, careful with his every little movement for fear that he would make an irreparable mistake.</p> 
 <p>“Melt it with your origin energy and feed it to her,” replied Ye Qingcheng. At this moment, she finally understood what Ye Qingtong had said to her before.</p> 
 <p>Maybe in his eyes, I’m really just a friend…</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t pay attention to Ye Qingcheng’s reaction. His origin energy flowed and slowly melted the Revival Grass into a light-green essence ball, which he guided into Nie Qing’s mouth. Then, his eyes fixated on her face.</p> 
 <p>Looking at this scene that was like a still picture, Ye Qingcheng shook her head and retreated from the room.</p> 
 <p>“Qing’er, when you wake up, I’ll tell you my story of the past few years. I believe you will be very interested…”</p> 
 <p>“Qing’er, do know that your brothers and sisters almost beat me to death…”</p> 
 <p>“Qing’er, when you wake up, I will go to your brothers and sisters… No matter what, I won’t allow you to leave this time…”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was in a trance as he talked foolishly to the unconscious Nie Qing, at times laughing and at times sighing. This lasted for the whole morning.</p> 
 <p>“You are so annoying…”</p> 
 <p>A sudden weak voice interrupted Bai Xiaofei’s mumbling. He looked up in shock to see Nie Qing rolling her eyes at him.</p> 
 <p>“You’re awake!!” He excitedly lifted her up in a big hug.</p> 
 <p>Although Nie Qing didn’t know what was going on, she rested her head on Bai Xiaofei’s shoulder happily. Trying to hold back her laughter, she complained, “You wanna strangle me to death or what? How about being a little more subtle when you try to murder your own wife? You are being too obvious.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hurriedly loosened his hug and switched to holding her shoulder, then scanned her worriedly.</p> 
 <p>“Do you feel uncomfortable? Can you move? Is your origin energy circulating smoothly?”</p> 
 <p>At the series of questions, Nie Qing fell silent with a thoughtful expression. A while later, she looked at Bai Xiaofei with her big eyes and nodded seriously.</p> 
 <p>“I do feel a bit uncomfortable.”</p> 
 <p>“What’s wrong?! What’s the matter?!” Bai Xiaofei immediately started his origin energy, but before he could start to check, Nie Qing stopped him.</p> 
 <p>“First, my butt is freezing, and second, I’m hungry,” she aggrievedly complained.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei gawked in shock. His anxious expression then relaxed as he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry after his mood went on a rollercoaster ride.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, let’s have a delicious meal!”</p> 
 <p>Picking Nie Qing up in a princess carry, Bai Xiaofei laughed as though he had just gained a new life, with nothing but pure happiness filling up his heart.</p>
