 <p>Chapter 278: And the Winner is?</p> 
 <p>Hearing Shangguan Fan’s bid, even Yin Jing who was in the safe zone couldn't help but gasp. Luckily for her, Bai Xiaofei’s condition for her group was the lesser of the bids, otherwise she might have to be mortgaged to Starnet.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, this price successfully silenced everyone.</p> 
 <p>It wasn’t that they didn’t have so much money, but they knew that even if they increased the price, Shangguan Fan was likely to raise it straight to 200 trillion, and then the result would be the same. So, they had to think of some other ways!</p> 
 <p>“Mr. Bai, your Starnet shouldn’t be short of money, right?” Although Master Zhang was easily excitable, his brain worked well. When he opened his mouth, he directly diverted Bai Xiaofei's attention.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Chu Qingtian, who was sitting next to Bai Xiaofei, was delighted. This was what he really wanted.</p> 
 <p>“The academy doesn’t lack money, but I do,” replied Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Chu Qingtian, who was beaming a second ago, wished he could just strangle him.</p> 
 <p>“But I know that Master Zhang’s offer will certainly satisfy both me and the academy.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing Bai Xiaofei talk sometimes felt like riding a roller coaster… At least that was how Chu Qingtian felt right now.</p> 
 <p>“Of course!” With a slight smile, Master Zhang took out two small dark wooden boxes from his storage ring. Although they were still closed, a thick medicinal fragrance already penetrated everyone's nose.</p> 
 <p><em>Deep-sea ebony boxes! At least grade eight pills!</em></p> 
 <p>From grade five onward, the price of pills increased at an exponential rate for every grade. Grade seven pills couldn’t even be found in the market and grade eight ones could only come by once in a blue moon. Any alchemist capable of refining grade eight pills would be hailed a precious treasure anywhere.</p> 
 <p>“These are Concentration Pills – I don’t think I need to explain further – and this is only part of our sincerity. We are willing to invest 50 trillion Amethyst Coins, plus provide Starnet 500 grade six, 100 grade seven, and 10 grade eight pills in the next year!” The way Master Zhang said it gave people the impression that pills were just candy.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was even about to drool. He had eaten a grade seven pill before and it was really good! He didn’t know what these Concentration Pills were and he was very curious. Lin Lang had once told him that no pills could be garbage once they reached grade seven and above. Then, these grade eight pills…</p> 
 <p>“Can you explain? About the Concentration Pills I mean,” asked Bai Xiaofei, having no intention to hide his curiosity.</p> 
 <p>Chu Qingtian suddenly had an urge to find a hole and bury Bai Xiaofei in it.</p> 
 <p><em>Damn brat, will you die if you wait a little before asking?! Oh well, he would…</em></p> 
 <p>“Oh? Since Mr. Bai is interested, I’ll talk more about it.”</p> 
 <p>Master Zhang's attitude towards Bai Xiaofei could be said to have taken a complete turn compared to when Bai Xiaofei had first set foot in the room. No matter what he thought in his heart, he certainly wouldn’t do anything to displease Bai Xiaofei now. This was the sad thing about having a favor to ask…</p> 
 <p>“The six basic abilities – essence, energy, body, spirit, mind, and origin energy – determine a person's power. Among them, spirit is the one that is extremely difficult to train. The Concentration Pill is exactly to nourish and help puppet masters fortify their spirit without any side effects!” Master Zhang explained.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei's eyes immediately lit up. He didn’t care about all that, but he had thought of something else.</p> 
 <p>“What if a martial artist uses it?”</p> 
 <p>“Mr. Bai is very smart to instantly notice the most precious aspect of this pill. Martial artists are unable to link to puppets due to weak spirits, but Concentration Pills can fix this. More than 80% of martial artists can become puppet masters if they use this pill!” said Master Zhang with a proud expression. If the other side was interested, that meant he was halfway to success!</p> 
 <p>Or so he hoped…</p> 
 <p>“Fortunately I am not a martial artist, or else I’d have to spend a fortune to get this thing.” Bai Xiaofei heaved a long sigh of relief, his scared look stunned Master Zhang.</p> 
 <p><em>What the?! Then what did you ask that for?! Fun?</em></p> 
 <p>Of course not, Bai Xiaofei didn’t have the leisure. He just couldn’t show that he cared, otherwise all this would be for naught if his Achilles' heel was exposed.</p> 
 <p>“While this pill is of no use to me, Master Zhang's conditions are quite attractive. I'm sorry, Master Shangguan, simply adding money is meaningless.” Bai Xiaofei already found Shangguan Fan annoying, so he seized the opportunity to strike a critical blow.</p> 
 <p><em>Go home and sleep, Young Master who’s so poor that you only have money left!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei's purpose was achieved. Shangguan Fan's face immediately grew ugly upon hearing those words. However, he couldn’t find anything to refute. Indeed, when money reached a certain amount, it wouldn’t be so meaningful, because sometimes money couldn’t be exchanged for certain things.</p> 
 <p>“Is there anyone else who wants to say something? If not, the last…”</p> 
 <p>“No need to be in such a hurry, Mr. Bai. Perhaps you’d be more interested in my offer,” Feng Wuxin of the Ethereal Merchant Group cut in as he looked at Bai Xiaofei with a smile.</p> 
 <p>If relying on rare items to satisfy Starnet, possibly the only one that could compete with the Devpath Merchant Group was the Ethereal Merchant Group. Pills and puppets had always been the mainstream consumables on the continent.</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei glanced at Feng Wuxin, an uncomfortable feeling arose. It couldn’t be helped, he just looked too much like Feng Wuhen. If anyone told Bai Xiaofei they weren’t brothers, he wouldn’t believe it.</p> 
 <p>The information from Zhuang Ming also indicated the same. As Bai Xiaofei and his friends initially suspected, Feng Wuhen was no simple character, he was just too lazy to compete for any position…</p> 
 <p>“Vice President Wuxin, I’ve been waiting for your proposal.” Bai Xiaofei smiled and added a hint of expectation to his face.</p> 
 <p>“500 violet cores, 10 gold cores, and in the next year we will provide Starnet 100 peak-grade violet puppets, 10 gold puppets, and a violetgold core, plus 30 trillion Amethyst Coins!”</p> 
 <p>When he voiced his offer, everyone was dumbstruck.</p> 
 <p>Everything else didn’t matter, what rendered them unable to remain calm was the violetgold core!</p> 
 <p>Violetgold level… There were not many people with that level of puppets anymore. If a violetgold core was used well, it could create a violetgold puppet!</p> 
 <p>In other words, Feng Wuxin was offering everything he could.</p> 
 <p>“That sounds quite tempting, but Starnet doesn't have so many demands for puppets. Those who really need puppets are the students, and for now, Starnet already has enough puppets for them.” Unexpectedly, Bai Xiaofei refused.</p> 
 <p>“Are you sure you don't want to think twice?” His brows slightly wrinkled, Feng Wuxin asked somewhat in disbelief.</p> 
 <p>“I'm sure.” Bai Xiaofei smiled again, then his expression suddenly turned serious. “Vice President Feng, if I’m informed correctly, Brother Feng Wuhen is your younger brother. It seems you haven't come to see him since you came to Starnet!”</p> 
 <p>Feng Wuxin’s face instantly grew ugly.</p> 
 <p>“That is my family affair, Mr. Bai. You'd better pay attention to whether what you say is appropriate!” Feng Wuxin’s voice clearly contained a trace of anger.</p>
