 <p>Chapter 1026: Fulfilled?</p> 
 <p>“All done.”</p> 
 <p>At dawn, Bai Xiaofei stood in front of Qiu Muxue, who had been waiting for him the whole night, and presented her with a small ball.</p> 
 <p>“What is this thing?” she asked.</p> 
 <p>“I refined the soul of that Barbaric God into this ball. You can eat it to strengthen your spirit and inherit all of its powers. Since you’re going to watch over the Sacks, it’s appropriate that you have control of it.” Bai Xiaofei smiled.</p> 
 <p>However, Qiu Muxue didn’t take the ball. She pushed his hand back. “You have helped us a lot. I can’t take this.”</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be like that. I’ve got what I want, this is of no use to me at all. However, I’ll have to tell you that if you use this, the Sacks will no longer be what it is now.” Bai Xiaofei’s eyes glinted strangely.</p> 
 <p>“What… do you mean?” Qiu Muxue was startled. <em>Is it not over yet?</em></p> 
 <p>“The special abilities the Sacks have gained come entirely from the temptation of the Barbaric God. Once you consume this thing, the last remnant of the Barbaric God will disappear from this world and everyone else will lose the ability to seal origin energy. You will be the last person to have this ability, but it can still be passed to others during life-and-death fights.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei explained before presenting the little ball to Qiu Muxue again.</p> 
 <p>“So, it’s entirely up to you to bear this curse of an ability alone, or to let the Sacks continue as they are now.”</p> 
 <p>Finishing his speech, Bai Xiaofei looked quietly at Qiu Muxue. The latter fell silent for a long time, before firmly accepting the ball.</p> 
 <p>“This is what I want. If anyone wants this ability, then they’ll have to come to me and get it!” She declared before stuffing it into her mouth. After a while, the ball melted into pure energy that rapidly permeated every part of her body.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, from the bodies of all the Sacks as well as Moonlight warriors who bore the same ability, light spots drifted out, converging into a starry river as they streamed toward Qiu Muxue!</p> 
 <p>“How nice of you, giving away hundreds of years of accumulated energy just like that,” the voice of the Demonic God of Pain rang out in Bai Xiaofei’s sea of consciousness.</p> 
 <p>“That’s the strength of this whole clan. Wouldn’t it be better for it to remain and continue to protect this clan?” Bai Xiaofei chortled, having no regrets at all.</p> 
 <p>As Qiu Muxue was immersed in the starry river, he headed out. <em>Time to leave…</em></p> 
 <p>When Qiu Muxue had absorbed the starry river and slowly opened her eyes a long time later, her aura had climbed to a whole new height.</p> 
 <p>“He left?” she asked indifferently.</p> 
 <p>“He left. He also told me to pass you a message: He hopes that we can get along well with Moonlight,” replied Lan Shuang.</p> 
 <p>This was the last problem of the Sacks. Whether the grasslands would recover or not, the Sacks needed to establish trade with the outside world to change their situation, and the Moonlight Empire was its only choice at present.</p> 
 <p>As for whether Moonlight would agree, Bai Xiaofei believed that they would give him face.</p> 
 <p>“The takeover ceremony is about to begin. Get ready. Time to do what I should do,” said Qiu Muxue with a smile that Lan Shuang could not understand.</p> 
 <p>She had never seen Qiu Muxue like this before.</p> 
 <p>“It’s all prepared, but are you sure you are alright?” Wanting to make sure, Lan Shuang hesitantly asked.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I’m better than ever.” Qiu Muxue inhaled deeply and declared, “I’m not yet qualified to stand by his side now, but I believe that one day I will be!”</p> 
 <p>Seeing a matchless seriousness in her eyes, Lan Shuang’s heart was set at ease. Her friend was not desperate, she had thought it through!</p> 
 <p><em>However, that road won’t be a smooth one…</em></p> 
 <p>Lan Shuang helplessly shook her head, but then she said, “I believe you, and I will accompany you to that day!”</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>“Hey, hey! Smelly boy! Are you going to play dumb again? Now that we have left the Sacks, where is the puppet you promised me?!”</p> 
 <p>The Demonic God of Pain was bugging Bai Xiaofei, who was flying toward Moonlight using Purple Luan.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, do I look like the kind of person who goes back on his word?” Bai Xiaofei questioned.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, it sounded too perfunctory…</p> 
 <p>“You don’t ‘look like,’ because you are! Hurry up and give it to me, or I’ll turn against you!!” the Demonic God of Pain roared.</p> 
 <p>Stopping with a wry smile, Bai Xiaofei said, “This is your decision. Don’t blame me if you regret it!”</p> 
 <p>At his sudden U-turn in attitude, the Demonic God of Pain panicked.</p> 
 <p><em>There’s definitely something fishy… but… that’s my dream vessel!!</em></p> 
 <p>“No matter what you’re trying to do, I want my body now!” The Demonic God of Pain finally decided to stick to his decision. Nothing mattered more than putting an end to his half-dead state.</p> 
 <p>“Alright then, I’ll fulfill your wish,” Bai Xiaofei said and landed on a deserted field. Then, his hands shone, and the puppet core as well as the human puppet he had secretly captured in Ethereal appeared.</p> 
 <p>Seeing these two things, the Demonic God of Pain immediately emerged from Bai Xiaofei’s sea of consciousness. However, after pouncing close to them, he stopped.</p> 
 <p>“What are you scheming now? You are never this agreeable!” he suspiciously looked at Bai Xiaofei as his rationality returned.</p> 
 <p>“I’m only responsible for providing you with the puppet core and the puppet. As for what I’m ‘scheming,’ it’s my freedom. If you regret it already, I can help you store these two.” Bai Xiaofei smirked. </p> 
 <p>Seeing his sleazy smirk, the Demonic God of Pain, without hesitation, merged himself into the puppet core. Under his control, the core quickly integrated into the human puppet…</p> 
 <p>“Hahahaha! This lord is free!! You all will die!!!”</p>
