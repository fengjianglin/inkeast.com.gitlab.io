 <p><span style>“The content for this morning’s training is very simple, but only half of all of you can become the lucky party.” Everyone instinctively gulped down a mouthful of saliva as soon as Xue Ying spoke because this was a reflex that came from the depths of their souls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fear….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only did Xue Ying have a variety of methods, all of them were torturous, and they tortured one to the point one wanted to cry yet had no tears!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean by half?” As he asked weakly, Mo Ka felt that this was another morning that wasn’t very kind to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The training method this morning is group battles. Besides Lin Li, the remaining 15 people will be divided into two groups, and you’ll go against each other. The rules are similar to when we were in the academy, you’re not allowed to utilize puppets but may utilize Origin Energy. The battles will be divided into three rounds, and the group that’s beaten to submission first is the loser.” Xue Ying paused for a moment and revealed a devilish smile. “The losing group will run an extra two rounds this afternoon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as she finished speaking, all of them stared at each other while the boats of friendship that were formed last night were instantly overturned because every single one of them stared at the others as if they were enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Start drawing lots.” As soon as she finished speaking, Xue Ying took out numerous paper strips, and all of them swarmed over and cleared them out in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the grouping ended, some were happy while some were sad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei, Mo Ka, Wu Chi, Zhu Si’si, Fang Ye, Zhu Nuo, and Duan Yi’yi were in the first group, and the remaining eight were in the second group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was merely based upon numbers and strength, then Bai Xiaofei’s group was practically in a completely disadvantageous position because besides Wu Chi, Zhu Si’si, and Zhu Nuo, the rest were basically inferior in ability, whereas, numerous experts were gathered in the other group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not to mention Wang Hang and Xu Chen who were two close quarter combat experts, merely Ming One, Ming Two, and Shi Kui were too much for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, there were ways to turn the situation around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Next, all speak about some minor Origin Energy utilization technique in close quarter combat, and your ability to use it proficiently will determine who will laugh and who will cry this afternoon. So, you must pay attention!” Xue Ying called Lin Li over as she spoke. Both of them fought as she explained, and she slowly repeated everything Lin Li had already grasped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was unknown how much each of them had remembered, but every single one of them had their own gains. After a short period of training by themselves, all of them felt they’d reached a new height.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was precisely amidst this sort of situation where everyone was comparatively confident that the battles began!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both groups got ready for battle. Even though Bai Xiaofei had the weakest combat strength in his group, he still stood at the center position because it was convenient for him to see the entire battlefield, whereas, the person from the opposite group that stood facing him was the leader they chose, Xu Chen!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Along with Xue Ying’s command, both groups instantly made a move. But, the difference was Xu Chen’s side was pursuing, whereas, Bai Xiaofei’s side was running!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what everyone didn’t notice was that as they ran, some of the members on Bai Xiaofei’s side were intentionally converging together, whereas, Xu Chen’s group were entirely pursuing whoever they wanted to pursue!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Wu Chi and Zhu Si’si from Bai Xiaofei’s side who’d suddenly run to the point of being comparatively close had stopped at the same time, and they turned around to directly greet Shi Kui and Duan Yi’yi who were behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like a hungry tiger pouncing on its prey, Wu Chi directly pressed Shi Kui down. He who was a Martial Artist was extremely skilled in utilizing Origin Energy, whereas, the half-baked Shi Kui wasn’t even able to persist for half a second.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, Duan Yi’yi and Zhu Si’si on the other side were locked in battle. No one had expected that just in that short moment from before, this little girl that was shy to the point of not speaking much would have actually grasped so many things!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, even though she’d grasped them, Duan Yi’yi was still restrained by Zhu Si’si in the end because her reaction speed was inferior to Zhu Si’si.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them won a swift victory, yet the situation of Mo Ka and Fang Ye who were being chased on the other side wasn’t promising. Ming One and Ming Two didn’t exhaust much strength before capturing the two of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly and out of everyone’s expectations, Xue Ying suddenly roared at this moment. “Are all of you playing?! Are all of you going to fight like this if your mortal enemy is standing before you?! Why don’t the boys dare to make a move against the girls?! Could it be that if the person that wants to kill you is a girl, then you should let her kill you?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her roaring voice instantly caused everyone to stop. In the next second, Xue Ying had charged directly towards Bai Xiaofei, and she didn’t say a single word before swinging her fist right over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Bai Xiaofei’s reaction was exceedingly swift. He bent down slightly to barely dodge Xue Ying’s fist before sweeping out a kick towards Xue Ying’s leg at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, Bai Xiaofei had overestimated his strength. Xue Ying’s right leg that was covered in Origin Energy moved to greet Bai Xiaofei’s kick, and a clear sound resounded out as Bai Xiaofei directly started rolling about in pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop acting. I know how much strength I used, and it won’t break.” As she spoke coldly, Bai Xiaofei instantly stood up sensibly, but his hobbling movement was faked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the type of scene I want. If all of you aren’t capable of recreating such an effect, then everyone will have 10 rounds added to them, and all of you can run until you commit it to memory!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The right methods were needed to get the job done. If she wanted their training to have some effect within a month, then it was utterly impossible without being slightly ruthless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Xue Ying’s readjustment, both groups took their places once more, and both sides bowed to the other side at the same time before they started.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry!” As soon as they finished speaking, both sides charged towards the person that stood in front of them. Unlike the first time, those with stronger strengths looked for those with weak strengths as their first target, and they intended to squash the ‘ripe persimmons’ first before gathering their firepower against the strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, after the battle erupted, all of them noticed something to their shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those that they publicly acknowledge were weak weren’t so weak, whereas, those they thought were very strong weren’t that strong, and it was so much so that when the first round ended, every single one of them had injuries on their bodies!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, Xu Chen’s side had strength in numbers in the end, and they occupied the advantageous position in the first round.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, after they experienced the probing of the first round, the targets each side targeted had changed. Moreover, Bai Xiaofei’s side corrected their mistaken decision to fight head on, and a new set of tactics were formulated by Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the second round started, Xu Chen’s group suffered three or four losses repeatedly. In the end, they were struck by a wave of Bai Xiaofei’s counterattacks to the point of being beaten to the ground, and it was so much so that the second round ended almost an entire 10mins quicker than the first round!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a short period of rest, the third round of the battles erupted. This time, the eyed of everyone had gone red with bloodlust, and it seemed as if the people standing in front of them were really their enemies. Vital point or not, they struck ruthlessly so long as they got the chance!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The time the third round continued on was the longest. In the end, along with Wu Chi being struck down, it announced the loss of Bai Xiaofei’s group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, after the chaotic battle during the entire morning, all of them had a new understanding of the rankings of their classmates in terms of close quarter battle!</span></p>
