 <p>Chapter 383: Massacre!</p> 
 <p>“Go call your people, we three are going to get prepared.” With his wits back, Bai Xiaofei re-entered his acting mode as he coughed and put on a calm front.</p> 
 <p>The procuress was even more delighted upon seeing Bai Xiaofei’s reaction. She agreed and left.</p> 
 <p>“Inside are three naïve wastrels. When Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter come in a while, extort them as hard as you can. Show no mercy!” The gleam in the procuress’s eyes was ruthless as she ordered the errand boy at the door after exiting the room.</p> 
 <p>Little did she know that the ‘wastrels’ were here to cause her trouble.</p> 
 <p>“Huskie, find someone with this smell.” Bai Xiaofei let Huskie smell the handkerchief that Baogen provided, then let it jump out through the window.</p> 
 <p>“What are you going to do when the girls come in? You’re not really going to do something, right?” Sitting at the table full of dishes, Bai Ye coldly stared at Bai Xiaofei, his tone murderous.</p> 
 <p>“Hey hey! What do you mean I’m really going to do? Aren’t you a man, senior? You were dazed when you first came in too!” Bai Xiaofei threw a glance at Bai Ye, not noticing that a light blush crept onto the latter’s face at his words.</p> 
 <p>“What do you know?! I’m different from you!” Bai Ye immediately retorted. As he got emotional, his face grew visibly red.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t get too excited, senior, you’re blushing. Don’t worry, even if you do something, I won’t tell Sister Lingyan. I vow to maintain your glorious image to the end.” Laughing, Bai Xiaofei kept teasing Bai Ye. At this point, Bai Ye didn’t know how to refute him anymore.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, I’m not going to argue with you over this petty thing. But I warn you, you must not ruin Starnet’s reputation!” Bai Ye coldly stated his bottom line.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I have seen my fair share of beautiful women. How can I let myself fall in a place like this? I’m not that stupid.” Bai Xiaofei packed up his fancy for jokes. Then, he slowly walked to Baogen. “Don’t worry, I will definitely get your sister out of here.”</p> 
 <p>Listening to Bai Xiaofei’s gentle voice, the stupefied Baogen was jolted awake. He only wanted to save his sister, but he never knew that inside this tea house would actually be this kind of place. If it wasn’t for Bai Xiaofei, he might never see his sister again in his life.</p> 
 <p>“Master, as long as you save my sister, I will repay you even if I die!” The first thing Baogen said upon returning to his senses gave Bai Xiaofei a headache. He just wanted to do this for his own happiness, what was there to repay and whatnot…</p> 
 <p>After all, whether they could even meet again in the future was uncertain.</p> 
 <p>“Incoming!”</p> 
 <p>“Got it!”</p> 
 <p>After a while, Bai Ye and Bai Xiaofei cried out one after another with the same surprise in their voices but the different expressions on their faces – The former was worry while the latter was excitement!</p> 
 <p>Just as Bai Xiaofei summoned Huskie to him, there was a knock on the door.</p> 
 <p>“Young masters, the girls have arrived. Can they come in now?”</p> 
 <p>When the voice of the errand boy rang out from outside, Bai Xiaofei froze a little as Bai Ye threw him a look of contempt.</p> 
 <p>“Come in,” ignoring Bai Ye, Bai Xiaofei calmly replied.</p> 
 <p>The door then opened, and a group of pretty girls poured in. As if for convenience, they were dressed in only thin gauze, under which their beautiful bodies were half-seen-through. Bai Xiaofei felt his throat becoming dry.</p> 
 <p><em>And you say you’re used to beautiful women. What are you going to do now?</em></p> 
 <p>Next to Bai Xiaofei, Bai Ye seemed to have no interest in the beauties right before him and just stared fixedly at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Just this level?!”</p> 
 <p><em>Bang!</em> Smacking the table, Bai Xiaofei shot up from his chair.</p> 
 <p>“Motherf<em>cker, this lord came such a long way and waited for so long, and you give me this kind of goods?! Do you want me to tear down this stupid place?! Get the f</em>ck out of here! If you don’t send better ones, I swear I will never be done with you!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s sudden rage caught everyone off guard, even Bai Ye.</p> 
 <p>“What the hell are you still standing around for? Don’t understand what I said?! Still not going to scram?!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei roared again, and the girls who had turned pale with fear immediately ran out. Even the errand boy was scared witless.</p> 
 <p><em>Mother! Who said they were naïve wastrels? There are actually naïve wastrels with such a high taste?!</em></p> 
 <p>Complaining in his heart, the errand boy hurriedly ran to the procuress. He had seen many dissatisfied guests, and there was nothing that they could not do. He didn’t want to die so young…</p> 
 <p>“Senior, if they come back before I return, find a way to stop them outside. I’ll try to be as quick as possible,” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly said to Bai Ye after getting rid of everyone. Not waiting for him to respond, he jumped out of the window with Huskie and Blackie.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, because Blackie left, Baogen resumed his original appearance.</p> 
 <p>Jumping out from the window, Bai Xiaofei assumed the appearance of the procuress and made his way to the backyard unimpeded.</p> 
 <p>“Mother, why are you here?” The backyard gatekeepers were surprised to see Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Two Master Rank puppet masters are causing trouble at the front, saying that they want to save the people here. Help me transfer people over, or else we will be in trouble!”</p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei said anxiously, the two burly gatekeepers panicked.</p> 
 <p>Entering the backyard where the girl was supposedly held, Bai Xiaofei was shocked by what he saw.</p> 
 <p><em>Why are there so many people here?!</em></p> 
 <p>Looking around, there were over 20 injured girls of all ages, and they all looked at Bai Xiaofei with horror. Meanwhile, the ten-odd guards immediately showed respect.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t hit me! I’ll listen! I’ll do anything you tell me to!” said a girl whose last defense crumbled as her fear reached her limit. If it weren’t Bai Xiaofei who was here at this moment, her future might have been rewritten…</p> 
 <p>“Take them out. The carriage is ready!” Bai Xiaofei ordered the big guards around him with a frown.</p> 
 <p>The guards immediately acted. They tied up the girls and headed for the door to the back lane. A guard pushed open the door and poked his head out to check, then shrank back.</p> 
 <p>“Mother, where’s the carriage? There is nothing outside!” There was a hint of nervousness on the big fellow’s face.</p> 
 <p>“It has arrived, you just didn’t see it.” With a smile, Bai Xiaofei already came between the two big men without their notice. Abruptly and violently, he cracked their necks.</p> 
 <p>The sudden scene scared everyone. The leader of the guards pointed to Bai Xiaofei and shouted, “You are not Mother…”</p> 
 <p>But before he could finish his last words, Bai Xiaofei had begun a massacre!</p>
