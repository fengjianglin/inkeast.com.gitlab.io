<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>The sudden change stunned everyone, and even Fang Ye who knew Bai Xiaofei’s plan was no exception.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s he planning?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“According to my knowledge, so long as we don’t go against the principles of the academy, the academy doesn’t restrain the competition between students and even encourages it. You’re only a teacher and your assignment ought to be teaching your students to become strong and how to bully others, not be bullied themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But, you’ve come to look for trouble with my head teacher now. So can I take it as you admitting your inferiority? </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sister Xue can make our Savage Class that everyone looked down upon on to surround your students and beat them, yet you are only capable of shouting at a student here. Should I say that you’re responsible to your students, or should I ask you why you’re so useless as a teacher?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke this string of words, Bai Xiaofei’s train of thought was clear to a terrifying degree, and it was even to the extent that Teacher Chu was actually unable to find a single word to refute him with when he was done.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The office gradually fell into a long period of silence. Teacher Chu stared at Bai Xiaofei with a livid expression while her entire body trembled, yet she could only ceaselessly suppress her rage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a kid! You win!!!” Teacher Chu left as soon as she finished speaking, and she left this place that she’d defined as a place of trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher Wei, what about you?” After Teacher Chu left, Bai Xiaofei met Teacher Wei’s gaze and didn’t have the slightest intention of shrinking back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since the ancient times, great heroes were extraordinary since a young age. I can be considered to have had my horizons broadened today. Teacher Xue Ying, I apologize for my actions today.” Unlike Teacher Chu, Teacher Wei who’d similarly been cursed at the point of speechlessness actually apologized to Xue Ying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t, please don’t. Teacher Wei, it’s I who didn’t teach them to restrain themselves, you’re being too kind.” The facts proved that Teacher Wei’s actions were right because at the very least, he had a very good way out of the predicament when leaving Xue Ying’s office.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sister Xue.” After the two teachers that came looking for trouble had left, Bai Xiaofei once again became the happy and sly fellow he was, and flattery was even written all over his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The nearby Fang Ye sighed helplessly when he saw this change.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>When will Big Brother Fei ever be serious for a while!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You did well! Act just like this if anyone else comes looking for trouble in the future!” Behind every single bold and careful child was surely a senior that wished to see the world burn! As soon as Xue Ying spoke, Fang Ye once again firmed believed that they couldn’t be relied on….</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ll surely be led astray if I continue staying in the class!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry Big Sister Xue, just leave it to me.” Bai Xiaofei grinned slyly as he patted his chest and guaranteed. But, for some unknown reason, Fang Ye who stood at the side kept having the feeling that both of them acted slightly unnaturally, and it felt as if they were acting….</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, Fang Ye was unable to figure out exactly what they were acting for….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go on, what did you come looking for me so anxiously for?” Xue Ying’s face turned serious as she spoke. Even though Bai Xiaofei was usually never serious, Bai Xiaofei was very capable when he was serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sister Xue, do you know about the Blossom Rankings?” Bai Xiaofei’s voice carried a trace of anticipation as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course I do. Supposedly, there are many teachers on the rankings, and a third year crossdresser came to inspect me today. He said he’s the inspector for the Blossom Rankings now, and he praised me a great deal before saying I would surely enter the rankings.” Xue Ying spoke a long string of words while the complacency on her face grew deeper as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like no woman didn’t care about her age, their beauty obtaining the acknowledgment of others was one of the resources they could use to boast with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, Bai Xiaofei didn’t care about all this, and only a single sentence entered his ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person in-charge of the Blossom Rankings had come to look for Xue Ying!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really!? How does he look like!? What’s his name!? Did he leave any method to contact him!?” The excited Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but press his hands down onto Xue Ying’s slender shoulders because he’d forgotten where he was and who was beside him in his pleasant surprise….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re going too far! I’m your teacher!” At an angle that Fang Ye was unable to notice, Xue Ying who sat on the chair glared fiercely at Bai Xiaofei, shocking him to the point of hurriedly withdrawing his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, luckily, Fang Ye didn’t think too much of it and felt Bai Xiaofei was about to suffer….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, sorry! Big Sister Xue, I was just slightly overexcited!” As he explained himself, Bai Xiaofei continued to look at Xue Ying with a gaze of anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, take this, it was left behind by that crossdresser. He said I should go drink tea with him if I had the chance because there were many more superb beauties at his place, and he said we would surely be able to find a common topic.” Xue Ying tossed a strip of paper on the table to Bai Xiaofei as she spoke, but in the next second, her expression became serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’re you looking for him for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe! This is the secrets of the heavens and can’t be revealed!” As soon as he finished speaking, Bai Xiaofei shoved the strip of paper in his pocket as if he was storing a valuable treasure, and then pulled Fang Ye along and ran out without giving Xue Ying the chance to pursue an answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After looking for a long time according to the directions written on the paper that Xue Ying gave him, Bai Xiaofei and Fang Ye found the place the crossdresser spoke of within the Light of Protection.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before they could even arrive at their destination, both of them had already seen countless high grade beauties moving up and down all along the way!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Besides the young big sisters that belonged to the Light of Protection, there weren’t just a few beauties from the other streams, causing Bai Xiaofei and Fang Ye to be unable to help but speed up while feeling delighted in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, under the guidance of a kind young big sister from the Support Stream, both of them arrived before a building that had the words ‘Blossom Pavilion’ hanging on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A strand of faint refreshing fragrance entered into their nose, causing both their imaginations to run wild before they entered the building.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, what are the both of you doing? Don’t you know that men and dogs aren’t allowed near the Blossom Pavilion!?” Before both of them could enter, an overbearing voice resounded out, and accompanying this voice was a young big sister that had pigtails and wore the uniform of second years that was embroidered with the symbol of the Light of Protection obstructing their path.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for the second year uniform she wore, Bai Xiaofei and Fang Ye would absolutely go over and rub this big sister’s head. Don’t wonder why they would do that because such an impulse was impossible to resist when facing a girl that was like a little loli!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, I’m talking to both of you. Are both of you deaf!?” As she looked at Bai Xiaofei and Fang Ye who didn’t react in the slightest, Han Qianye was even more infuriated, and her rolled up sleeves didn’t conform at all with her identity as a student from the Light of Protection.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Sister, don’t get worked up. We didn’t know there was such a rule here. We came here just to see Senior Yun Jingshuang.” Bai Xiaofei who resolutely gave in instantly made the reason for his arrival clear because offending this sort of beautiful senior sister at a place like this was absolutely an unwise decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to see Big Brother Yun?! Why do both of you want to see him? Is it because you want to detailed information of the sister on the Blossom Rankings? You’re even wearing the uniform of new students? Both of you are posing as new students to act inexperienced, right!?” Han Qianye placed her hands on her waist, and she’d already judged the both of them as having ill intent….</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the first time in his life, Fang Ye saw cold sweat roll down Bai Xiaofei’s forehead, and at this moment, Bai Xiaofei was sighing emotionally in his heart instead. </span><i><span style>This little girl isn’t easy to deal with!</span></i></p>
