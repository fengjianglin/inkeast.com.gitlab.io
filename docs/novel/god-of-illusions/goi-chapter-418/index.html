 <p>Chapter 418: Clearing Up!</p> 
 <p>“If I remember correctly, someone once theorized that if the Skypatch Pill strengthens elemental affinity to the fullest, it must have a strong remedial effect and may even reform the spirit!” the crown prince said as he looked askance at Bai Xiaofei. “Is that what you want to know?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t answer as he was too busy being delighted. This was the answer he wanted!</p> 
 <p>In the last notebook, the latest act of the Thunderstorm Bandits was recorded and it was their only passive experience so far – a siege from the Globe Merchant Group! As old rivals, the Globe Merchant Group somehow found one of the Thunderstorm Bandits’ footholds and secretly organized a huge siege.</p> 
 <p>At that time, the Globe Merchant Group dispatched five Grandmaster Rank and dozens of Master Rank puppet masters, but the final result was rather unsatisfactory. Over half of the Master Rank puppet masters were killed or injured and one Grandmaster Rank puppet master was seriously injured. In the end, every single one of the Thunderstorm Bandits escaped.</p> 
 <p>It wasn’t without a price, however. Qing Shuang, who was known as the pillar of the team, had been heavily injured by a Spirit Stream puppet master and ended up in a coma.</p> 
 <p>An injury caused by a puppet master of the Spirit Stream was most certainly one to the spirit. Therefore, why the Thunderstorm Bandits eyed the Skypatch Pill wasn’t its elemental affinity boost, but its spirit reform effect. And the Globe Merchant Group specifically targeted this, releasing the Skypatch Pill as bait. They knew for sure that as long as this opportunity was placed in front of the Thunderstorm Bandits, the latter would desperately jump in!</p> 
 <p>With another question answered, Bai Xiaofei had a feeling of sudden enlightenment. He was able to string together many other clues.</p> 
 <p>The puppet master behind the event at the banquet was of the Spirit Stream. Nie Qing denied that the person was from her group. At the same time, that person really wanted to kill Nie Qing. Without any surprise, they should be the same puppet master who seriously injured Qing Shuang.</p> 
 <p>The Spirit Stream was one of the rarest branches of the Energy Stream. There were so few people from this stream that there shouldn’t be two appearing in the same event. That was to say, while the Globe Merchant Group wanted the Ancient Yue royal family to come forward, they had never given up on making moves on their own in the first place. Not to mention, they certainly had to retrieve the Skypatch Pill.</p> 
 <p>The fact that the puppet master was able to attend the banquet meant that they had successfully infiltrated a higher-up of Nabu City, and the higher-up was probably a royal. Guessing boldly, the person might be helping a prince!</p> 
 <p>No one would be willing to take in such a fierce tiger as support unless there was great enough interest. <em>So, is it the second prince or the third prince?!</em></p> 
 <p>Thinking this, Bai Xiaofei looked up at the crown prince, his eyes so sharp that the latter secretly tensed up.</p> 
 <p>“What… what’s the matter?” asked the crown prince weakly as his heart started to palpitate.</p> 
 <p>“Be careful of your two younger brothers. If my guess is correct, one of them is probably supported by the Globe Merchant Group.”</p> 
 <p>At the same time, the crown prince who was just in a good mood was immediately doused by cold water.</p> 
 <p>The Globe Merchant Group…</p> 
 <p>These four words weren’t just pressure for him, Crown Prince Gu Heng. Even the entire Ancient Yue Kingdom couldn’t compete with such a monster! If so, his throne…</p> 
 <p>“You don’t have to worry too much. The Globe Merchant Group shouldn’t dare to be too blatant, otherwise, they will evoke public anger. If many small countries join hands and act against them, it would be a big blow to their business.”</p> 
 <p>Indeed, it was taboo for business groups to intervene in politics in the continent, especially in the usurpation of royal power.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s comforting words made Gu Heng feel a little better, but he was still uneasy. He felt powerless even if it was only secret support!</p> 
 <p>“If what you said is true, what should I do?” Gulping, the prince followed Shang Youdao’s path and regarded Bai Xiaofei as his last lifeline.</p> 
 <p>“What else can you do? Find that person, capture them, and kill them. Don’t worry, the Globe Merchant Group won’t even dare to let out a fart, or they’d be seeking death. They can only bitterly eat this loss,” said Bai Xiaofei nonchalantly with complete disregard for the Globe Merchant Group. What was the saying again? Strategically despise the enemy but tactically attach importance to them!</p> 
 <p>Now that Bai Xiaofei had taken the first step, the next depended on the situation.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, I believe you!” The crown prince gritted his teeth. After all, there was no other way out even if he didn’t believe him…</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I won’t let you down. It’s just the Globe Merchant Group, not that I haven’t dealt with them before.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s relaxed manner heightened his image in Gu Heng’s heart because Gu Heng believed this sentence. He had investigated Bai Xiaofei, and the records of the Blossom Ranking competition had already proved that there was cooperation between Bai Xiaofei and some top merchant groups.</p> 
 <p>“Again, I’ll wait for your good news.” Gu Heng stared intently at Bai Xiaofei with expectation.</p> 
 <p>“By the way, there is one small favor I need from Your Royal Highness.” After talking for so long, Bai Xiaofei finally remembered the poor Shang Youdao.</p> 
 <p>“Just say it.”</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaofei exited the palace, it was already dark, but his mood was exceptionally good as this meeting had brought him huge gains.</p> 
 <p>Now there was only one issue that Bai Xiaofei couldn’t figure out, that was, why the Globe Merchant Group chose Ancient Yue out of so many small countries. Bai Xiaofei for the life of him refused to believe that it was a random choice. There was something shady about this.</p> 
 <p>However, in his view, this wasn't a very important point. He felt that the answer to this would automatically surface.</p> 
 <p>Returning to the Bright Road Merchant House, Bai Xiaofei saw Shang Youdao waiting at the door. His old figure made Bai Xiaofei feel bitter.</p> 
 <p>No one had it easy. If Shang Youdao could, he wouldn’t have wanted to get involved in this muddied water, but he had no other way at all. His body was running out of time, so he could only choose to gamble when the opportunity came.</p> 
 <p>Thinking about it like this, he was also a poor man…</p> 
 <p>“Brother Bai! You are back!” The moment he saw Bai Xiaofei, Shang Youdao’s face was immediately filled with delight. He hurriedly ran up to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“What did the crown prince say?” There was a hint of anxiety in Shang Youdao’s voice. He looked like a student who was asking his teacher about his exam results.</p> 
 <p>“We can send them away tomorrow. As for the Skypatch Pill, I have a plan, but this is going to be the last gamble. If you lose, you may lose everything else,” perhaps touched by Shang Youdao’s figure just now, Bai Xiaofei said more than he meant to.</p> 
 <p>And it ignited Shang Youdao’s dejected heart!</p>
