 <p>The carriage dashed madly all the way, and the Blackscale Horses that pushed forward in full speed galloped madly for 30 minutes, causing the hearts of the young men and women that were about to participate in the test to sink.</p>
 <p><i>Even a Blackscale Horse had to run for an entire 30minutes, so if we want to return in an hour….</i></p>
 <p>“Alright! Everyone, get off the carriage!” After the carriage stopped, all the candidates were driven out of the carriage, and no one dared go against the intentions of the seniors.</p>
 <p>Starnet Academy was famous for its system of hierarchy!</p>
 <p>“The test has already begun from this moment onward. Use every method you have to rush back!” As soon as the senior that led the group finished speaking, the young men and women who were at rock bottom just a second ago instantly seemed as if they’d taken stimulants, and they rushed out madly.</p>
 <p>A variety of puppets were withdrawn, and the distance between each of them was drawn out along with this.</p>
 <p>The puppets of some people were utterly useless towards the content of this test, so relying on their legs was their only choice.</p>
 <p>Of course, some chose to work as a team. They were given so much time yesterday, so most of the people had used it to gain allies.</p>
 <p>After all, this wasn’t the only test, so some that had good physical strength or possessed puppets that were of assistance in long-distance travel might not be skilled in passing through the next two tests.</p>
 <p>Coupled with there was no competition between all the candidates. So, cooperation had become one of the best choices.</p>
 <p>But, there was always an exception, and this exception was Bai Xiaofei!</p>
 <p>Everyone else had ran off to the point that even a shadow of them couldn’t be seen yet only Bai Xiaofei was standing leisurely on the spot.</p>
 <p>“You’ve given up?” Surprise was written all over Bai Ye’s face, and he was even extremely anxious in his heart.</p>
 <p>If Bai Xiaofei was unable to enter the academy, then his hopes of having a meal with Qin Lingyan would be dashed to pieces….</p>
 <p>“Senior, I heard the entrance test of Starnet Academy is different every year.” The unhurried Bai Xiaofei directly started a conversation with Bai Ye, and he seemed to utterly not know what the word ‘anxiousness’ meant.</p>
 <p>“Right, what about it?” His brows were still knit together, and Bai Ye didn’t understand what this had to do with the test at hand.</p>
 <p>“I expended a great deal of effort all afternoon yesterday to inquire about the content of the tests in the past years, and then I found a similarity.” Bai Xiaofei grinned, and what he said caused Bai Ye to be slightly stunned.</p>
 <p>“What similarity?”</p>
 <p>“No matter how the form of the test changes, at the bottom of it all, the academy actually wants to test the ability of students.” As Bai Xiaofei spoke, Bai Ye who was full of interest a moment ago couldn’t help but roll his eyes at Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“Isn’t that a given? What test isn’t testing the ability of students?!”</p>
 <p>“Senior, don’t be impatient, I haven’t gotten to the main point.” Bai Xiaofei spoke once more with a sedate expression.</p>
 <p>“There’re many types of abilities that the academy wants to test. Just like those people that have just started running, there’re roughly three types of ability that they’re being tested for — physical constitution, puppet ability, and team cooperation abilities.”</p>
 <p>Once again, Bai Xiaofei had aroused Bai Ye’s interest.</p>
 <p>“And then? Is this related to why you’ve stayed back here?”</p>
 <p>“Of course, how could such an outstanding person like me do the same as them. I’m relying on this.” Bai Xiaofei pointed to his head as he spoke, and then he walked towards the nearby carriage under Bai Ye’s astounded gaze.</p>
 <p>“We can utilize any method to return, then why wouldn’t I use a mode of transport that’s present here!?” As he spoke, Bai Xiaofei had already released the Blackscale Horse from the carriage, and Bai Ye was already utterly stunned when he saw this scene.</p>
 <p>Bai Ye tried hard to recall what the teacher said when he was sent over here. <i>There seems to really be no restriction against students using the Blackscale Horse, and a tamed Blackscale Horse is indeed easy to ride.</i></p>
 <p>“Senior, are you not coming with me?” As he walked to Bai Ye’s side, Bai Xiaofei sent him a questioning gaze.</p>
 <p>“Both of us on one horse?” Bai Ye was slightly shocked, and he instinctively took a step back.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need! There’s no need! I’m not accustomed to such a thing!” For some unknown reason, Bai Ye seemed to be extremely against it, even though he was really interested towards Bai Xiaofei.</p>
 <p>“Are you sure? The other seniors have already left, so you’ll have to run back yourself if you don’t get on this horse. It isn’t a short distance, and Senior Sister Lingyan is still waiting there!” Bai Xiaofei placed the cruel facts before Bai Ye, and the latter was obviously hesitant.</p>
 <p>“We can use the carriage, there’s no need to insist on riding the horse, right!?” As his brows knit together once more, Bai Ye’s face was covered in an expression of aversion.</p>
 <p>“We’re both men, so why fuss about it so much? Moreover, there aren’t many chances for us to ride this thing, right? Not to mention the faster we return, the better my results would be.” Bai Xiaofei pulled Bai Ye over as he spoke, and he pushed Bai Ye up the back of the horse amidst Bai Ye’s exclaims of shock before he leaped up and squeezed himself onto the back of the horse as well.</p>
 <p>“Get further away from me, I’m a clean freak!!”</p>
 <p>“What’re you afraid of? Both layers of clothes are yours, you wouldn’t feel aversion towards yourself, right?” Bai Xiaofei hadn’t finished speaking when he jerked the reins, causing the Blackscale Horse to instantly shoot out like a bolt of lightning, and its speed was even slightly faster than when it ran over here!</p>
 <p>“Hold on tighter! This is the first time I’m riding a horse!” His voice carried a trace of excitement as Bai Xiaofei spoke a string of words that caused Bai Ye’s scalp to go numb.</p>
 <p>“F*ck! Then slow down a bit!!!” A sharp cry reverberated in the forest yet it seemed to have utterly not made a difference….</p>
 <p>Just like this, Bai Xiaofei who was the last to depart had overtaken countless astounded people all along the way because no matter how swift a puppet was, it was unable to compare with a Blackscale Horse in terms of speed.</p>
 <p>In the end, Bai Xiaofei even overtook the carriages of the other seniors!</p>
 <p>From the beginning until the end, including the time both of them were chatting, Bai Xiaofei had only used less than 20 minutes of time when he arrived at the entrance of Starnet Academy!</p>
 <p>When both of them got off the horse, Bai Xiaofei was delighted to the point of beaming with joy, whereas, even Bai Ye’s legs were trembling wildly.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t that Bai Ye hadn’t ridden a horse before, but it was the first time Bai Ye had experienced such a horrifying ride like the one Bai Xiaofei took him on….</p>
 <p>The seniors that stood on guard outside the entrance were extremely shocked as well because they’d never thought of such a method as well. But, this wasn’t in the scope of what they had to consider.</p>
 <p>What they had to do was guard the entrance properly.</p>
 <p>But, Bai Xiaofei seemed to be utterly disinterested with the people that were guarding the entrance, and he looked around endlessly on the spot and seemed to be waiting for something.</p>
 <p>“Lingyan!” Along with Bai Ye’s shout that was filled with pleasant surprise, the person Bai Xiaofei was waiting for had finally arrived.</p>
 <p>Just like the first time she made an appearance, Qin Lingyan was still so noble and cold. Her face didn’t carry the slightest expression, and it was precisely this icy disposition that had subdued countless outstanding talents of Starnet Academy.</p>
 <p>Qin Lingyan directly ignored Bai Ye who charged over and walked straight towards Bai Xiaofei, causing Bai Ye to feel a moment of embarrassment.</p>
 <p>“Senior Sister Lingyan!” After Qin Lingyan walked over to his side, Bai Xiaofei greeted her respectfully, and at the same time, the seniors that guarded the entrance had suddenly become extremely warm.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Lingyan, what’re you doing here!?” All the students in charge of monitoring the entire process of the entrance tests were first year students, and this was something that Bai Xiaofei had found out yesterday, whereas, Qin Lingyan just happened to possess extremely high popularity amongst the first years.</p>
 <p>Qin Lingyan who had a cold expression still didn’t speak, and she turned around to stretch out her slender hand and point towards Bai Xiaofei who followed by her side.</p>
 <p>“Don’t all of you understand? What are all of you standing there for? Let them through! He can use any method to go through, so can’t Lingyan bring a person through!?” Bai Ye who’d just been given the cold-shoulder by Qin Lingyan had charged over and fought for this opportunity to make a display.</p>
 <p>The students guarding the entrance that were originally slightly hesitant spoke for a moment, and then they instantly made room that a single person could pass through.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Lingyan, please go ahead.”</p>
 <p>The second test, passed!</p>
