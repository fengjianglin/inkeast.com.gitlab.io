<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>There were a total of 500 classes amongst the new students of Starnet Academy, and they were differentiated by their numbers from one to 500. The first 150 classes were internally recruited, and it was considered the ‘rich man’s area’ by the other students. The following 350 classes were publicly recruited in the form of a test that was open to people in the entire continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every single class had a varying total of 10 to 20 people, and the new students recruited every single year amounted to around 8,000 people. But, not everyone was capable smoothly graduation to become an official student of Starnet Academy, and around 30% of all the new students in every batch would be eliminated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The method of elimination was the matches between classes at the end of the study period for new students!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, whether one was eliminated or not wasn’t decided by one’s victories, but one’s display during all the matches. Moreover, so long as any teacher from a stream one wanted to choose accepts the person, then congratulations, that person would have been enrolled!</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, practically everyone wanted to try their best to make a good display of themselves during the matches between classes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, students weren’t completely without a chance to make a show of their skill before the matches, and the Collective Classes were a good method to this end!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Collective Classes merged every 10 classes into a group and were allocated teachers from the various streams in the academy. The content of the classes was sparring between students of the various classes, and those that make an outstanding display would be recommended to the various streams by the teacher in charge of the class at that time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Basically, so long as one obtained a recommendation, then it wasn’t a problem for one to become a student of Starnet Academy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, the competition in Collective Classes was extraordinarily intense!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Especially in the ‘commoners district’, they had to practically fight to the death during every single class!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to them taking leave during the past month, the members of the Savage Class had missed an entire 10 collective classes, and there were only 15 of them in total….</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, there wasn’t much time for the students of the Savage Class to take advantage of this additional pathway!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good morning fellow students, I’m an Onslaught Stream teacher from the Sword of Assault. All of you may call me Teacher Feng, and I’ll be leading all of you in this class today.” The teacher for the Collective Class was different every single time, and this was for the sake of guaranteeing that every single stream was able to unearth those with potential. After all, some teachers only paid attention to students of their own streams.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was good news to the members of the Savage Class. Otherwise, no matter how good the temper of a teacher was, the teacher would probably explode with rage from their absence of 10 out of 15 classes….</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, even though the teachers were changing, the students didn’t, and the classes that were tied together with the Savage Class was classes number 450 to 459. At this moment, they were looking at the members of the Savage Class with strange expressions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I presume it isn’t the first time everyone is taking a Collective Class, so I won’t waste time with any nonsense. I hope everyone will try their best in the following period of the entire morning!” Teacher Feng took a step back as he spoke and watched the students from the 10 classes silently. As for their head teachers, they’d been ‘separated’ for the sake of avoiding any suspicion of favoritism, so at the very least, they couldn’t be seen during this class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as Teacher Feng finished speaking, two students instantly stood out from class 450, and because all of them wore the same uniform, it was impossible to discern the stream they leaned towards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re Wang Ye and Zhang Hao from class 450, and we wish to challenge the fellow students from class 456.” The two students that stood out seemed extremely kind, yet it wasn’t difficult to discern that this ‘kindness’ they showed concealed deep ridicule within it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, the Savage Class had a reputation of its own!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Its reputation of being the last amongst all the new students in the entire academy hadn’t just been spread for a day or two, and the Savage Class being rebuilt had raised public indignation in the entire ‘commoner’s district’. So, at this moment, all the other classes were extremely ‘excited’; when facing their ‘fellow students’ that had just returned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the meaning… of this?” All the members of the Savage Class were stunned and revealed puzzled expressions. Even though Xue Ying had gathered all of them together before the class started, besides correcting their attitudes, she didn’t tell them anything about the rules of the Collective Class, causing them to be slightly muddled at this moment….</span></p>
 <p><span style>When faced with Bai Xiaofei’s question, the members of the remaining classes were finally unable to restrain themselves and instantly burst out with laughter, whereas, the two of them that had stood out couldn’t help but laugh with ridicule.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fellow students, I heard all of you went for some sort of ‘special training’. Did it spoil your brain in the process?” A thin and tall student within the spectating crowd asked, and it caused the entire crowd to roar once more with laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your class should send two people forward to spar with these two students that have come forward, and I’ll make some judgments according to your displays.” Teacher Feng’s voice sounded out once more, and his explanation could be considered to be attentive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Must it be two people?” Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but frown as he looked at Wang Ye and Zhang Hao, and he asked once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fellow student, couldn’t it be that all of you want to send four people over?” A ridiculing question sounded out from within the crowd once again, and then someone continued right after. “Show some understanding. After all, it’s the first time they’re coming to class, and you’ve heard of the Savage Class, so two or four might not make a difference.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The words the second person spoke instantly obtained the agreement of the others in the form of loud laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Student, for the sake of fairness, your class can’t send over more people.” Teacher Feng was still trying his best to control his tone. But, he had a bad impression of the entire Savage Class because what sort of good seedlings would there be amongst a class that didn’t even dare to come forward….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher, you’ve….” Mo Ka wanted to explain yet was restrained by Bai Xiaofei, and then Bai Xiaofei revealed a slight grin as he looked at the two of them that stood there with ceaseless laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who wants to do it?” As soon as Bai Xiaofei finished speaking, the entire Savage Class took a step forward in unison, and their orderly footsteps couldn’t help but slightly stun the other classes present here.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who wants to do it?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What does that mean?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it be that they’re only sending a single person?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The guesses of everyone were quickly proven because Xing Nan had become the lucky fellow chosen by Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xing Nan, Ranged Stream puppet master.” Xing Nan took out his verdant bow as he spoke, and the remaining members of the Savage Class couldn’t help but uniformly display their display towards Xing Nan when they saw this scene.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This fellow is actually acting!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Do you even need to use your puppet? Bastard!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Only you?” The two of them were slightly unable to believe their eyes because as far as they were concerned, a Ranged Stream puppet master all alone was nothing more than ‘food’….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It can’t be helped, all of them don’t dare to stand forward. Don’t believe their acts, they’re actually all pussies, and only I am able to bear the responsibility and stand forward.” Xing Nan revealed a helpless expression while everyone in the Savage Class remembered what he’d said.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yes, kid, you spoke very well. Let’s see if you can bear the responsibility when you get back here!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Please don’t kneel down because you sound terrible when you sing about being subjugated!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“If it’s like that, then we won’t hold back.” Both of them glanced at each other and smiled. At the same time, both of them revealed their puppets. One was a large chopper, and the other was a rod!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both of them were from the Onslaught Stream and had intentionally come forward for the sake of Teacher Feng who was in charge of the class!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! My bowstring snapped!!!” At the instant both of them charged forward, Xing Nan instantly revealed a ‘terrified expression’, and he swung the bow that lacked a bowstring in panic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, Wang Ye and Zhang Hao didn’t have the slightest intention of stopping.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, subsequently, at the instant they entered into Xing Nan’s range of attack, they saw a sly smile of success, and that smile was so brilliant….</span></p>
