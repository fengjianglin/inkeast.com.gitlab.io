 <p><span style>At the instant the beautiful box was opened, a dazzling glow flashed before everyone, and when they looked over along the towards the source of the glow, it seemed like a river of stars was laying in the beautiful box. The tiny grain sized thing flickered with a bright glow that filled the entire box.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gold-grade puppet, Thousand Star. This is a puppet specially created to be used alongside the Divine Phoenix Feather Dress, and others are utterly unable to utilize it because every single starry radiance within this has to be controlled individually. The Divine Phoenix Feather Dress itself was created by Master Qian Xing, so it’s absolutely the most suitable second puppet for Young Miss Lin.” As Feng Wuhen spoke, a trace of anticipation appeared in his eyes as he looked forward to Lin Li receiving this puppet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The nearby Fang Ye heaved a long sigh of relief instead when he heard this. His heart had constricted when he heard it was a gold-grade puppet because the money in his possession wasn’t sufficient to purchase it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, now it would seem that it didn’t require any money….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Big Brother Feng, I’ll take it on behalf of Lin Li.” Lin Li was still stunned when Bai Xiaofei had already taken a step forward to receive the beautiful box, and his level of consciousness caused Feng Wuhen to be unable to help but be slightly stunned.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s going on?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it be that his relationship with Young Miss Lin is really as the rumors say?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After being bewildered for a short moment, a trace of a smile appeared once more on Feng Wuhen’s face.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So what! It’s fine so long as I’ve given it away!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought I wouldn’t be able to return this favor for my entire lifetime. But, now it would seem like the heavens are benevolent, and I’ve finally taken this load off my mind.” Feng Wuhen wasn’t feigning any of his words, and it allowed Bai Xiaofei to get to know this Big Brother that possessed extraordinary marketing capabilities once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, Little Brother, only you remain now. But, you didn’t notify me beforehand, so the highest grade Illusion Stream puppet I have at this moment is only at the red-grade. Do you want to have a look?” With the thought of seeing the matter to the end, Feng Wuhen looked at the last person, Bai Xiaofei. But, Bai Xiaofei shook his head lightly instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I might have taken a look if Lin Li was after me. But, I won’t now because you aren’t a businessman anymore. On the other hand, even though I like gaining small advantages, but I don’t have the habit of gaining an advantage because of a woman.” Bai Xiaofei grinned as he refused Feng Wuhen, and his reason caused Feng Wuhen to be unable to help but see Bai Xiaofei in a different light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Brother, you’ll absolutely be extraordinary in the future. If we have the opportunity to meet again in the future, then feel free to ask if you need any help from me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The character of a person could be noticed since a young age, and it would already be fixed around the age of 16. So, Feng Wuhen who’d met countless people would absolutely not be wrong in this aspect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll remember what you said. At that time, Big Brother Feng better not act like you don’t know me!” They roared with laughter while their relationship seemed to have instantly improved greatly, and this sight caused everyone from the Savage Class to reveal puzzled expressions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, everyone quickly came to an understanding because anything strange that occurred on Bai Xiaofei couldn’t be considered to be strange….</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they left the Ethereal Pavilion, the excited members of the Savage Class directly snuck to the place they snuck out of the academy from in the past under Bai Xiaofei’s lead, and they returned to the Infinite Mountain Range that they’d stayed in for a month.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There wasn’t a place more suitable than this to test new puppets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the door to the principal’s office had been knocked lightly before a lazy voice sounded out along &nbsp;with the knock. “Brother Lei, an old friend has come. Do you have any more of that fine wine of yours?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lei Shan who sat on his chair while drinking tea was slightly stunned, and then he revealed an extremely complicated bitter smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Revelations, since when did you have to knock the door before entering my room?” As soon as his voice finished resounding out in the air, the door was instantly pushed open while Revelations whose old face was covered in a sly smile walked in sneakily, and he didn’t forget to lock the door at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If outsiders were to find out that the dignified Master of the Heavenly Secret Pavilion is actually like this, then do you think there would still be people lining up every single day outside the Heavenly Secret Pavilion for the sake of meeting you?” Lei Shan derided, and then he stood up while his storage ring flash before he tossed a jade jug to Revelations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if I go mad, there won’t be a person less than comes to the Heavenly Secret Pavilion.” Revelations paused for a moment to taste and enjoy a mouthful of the wine in the jade jug, and then he smacked his lips with extreme satisfaction. “Tsk… tsk…. I really do have to come looking for you to get good wine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cut the crap, the fine wine in your Heavenly Secret Pavilion has probably piled up into a mountain. Just be frank about what you came looking for me for. Beating around the bust isn’t like you.” Lei Shan seemed as if he’d seen through Revelations, and he didn’t have the slightest intention of being polite.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could you say that. I missed my old friend that I hadn’t seen for a long time, and I just happened to pass by, so I naturally had to pay you a visit.” Revelations laughed slyly before pouring another mouthful of wine down his throat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it really like that? If it is, then I’ll take it seriously, and I won’t agree to anything you request of me.” When dealing with Revelations, Lei Shan was deeply aware of his weak spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t, don’t, please don’t. We’re both old friends, so I might suddenly think of something that I need your help with! It’s really hurtful to our relationship if you decide on it just like that.” Revelations who couldn’t restrain himself any longer moved over to Lei Shan’s side while flattery was written all over his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I knew you’d have gone to look for women if you had the time, how could you have possibly thought of an old fellow like me? Tell me, what is it?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Revelations’ expression suddenly became serious when he was asked a second time, and the speed it changed was comparable to Bai Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No wonder they were master and disciple!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was really destined by fate….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You still remember that kid, Longfei, right?” Revelations’ tone carried an indescribable feeling of sorrow, and even Lei Shan’s expression sank slightly when Revelations finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could it be that you came this time because you have information about him? Didn’t you say even the Heavenly Secret Disk is unable to determine anything?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s dead.” A faint three words caused Lei Shan to instantly go silent. After a long time, Lei Shan’s gaze turned from sorrow into rage, and then he looked straight at Revelations in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How do you know? How did he die?! Was he set up?!” Lei Shan held onto Revelations’ shoulder and got more agitated the more he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His son told me. As for how he died, his son doesn’t know as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His son?!” His rage instantly transformed into surprise, and Lei Shan’s mouth gaped to the point it would be easy to stuff a fist in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Exactly, his son, and if nothing unexpected has happened, then you’ve already met him. He’s surnamed Bai.” The last few words Revelations said could be said to be useless nonsense. But, it reminded the surprised Lei Shan and caused a grinning face to instantly float into appearance within Lei Shan’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai Xiaofei?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Exactly, my good disciple.” Revelations chuckled, and his grief from before vanished instantaneously when Bai Xiaofei was mentioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your disciple?!” As if he was deeply afraid of being unable to surprise Lei Shan, Revelations ceaselessly provided Lei Shan with shocking details.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right, fate was on our side. He suffered an accident in the Infinite Mountain Range and I just happened to rescue him. Coincidentally, I casually asked a few questions and noticed he was the son of that kid Bai Longfei. After that, I decisively took him as my disciple. You didn’t see the deeply grateful expression he had at the time.” Revelations was like a chatterbox. Unfortunately, not a single word of his was true….</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Bai Xiaofei who was far away in the Infinite Mountain Range sneezed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Motherf*cker! Which bastard is f*cking cursing me!?”</span></p>
