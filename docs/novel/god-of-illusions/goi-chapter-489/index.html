 <p>Chapter 489: Issuing a Challenge!</p> 
 <p>“Although I’m happy with this result, I still want to ask why…” Bai Xiaofei voiced his doubts after he accepted the Purple Luan.</p> 
 <p>“In fact, the so-called third condition is just a test set by the puppetsmith, it’s to test the moral character of the buyer. If you had just agreed without hesitation, this puppet wouldn’t have been yours,” said Wei Feng with an expression of clear approval.</p> 
 <p>“This can really test someone’s character?” Yun Sheng’s voice was full of disbelief. He thought that it was a bit far-fetched.</p> 
 <p>“It’s called understanding from a little. Sometimes, a simple decision can reflect a lot of things, and I have a certain understanding of Lil’ Brother Bai, so this is enough,” Wei Feng explained.</p> 
 <p>Yun Sheng shook his head. <em>Aiii, but this fellow’s character can’t be trusted!</em></p> 
 <p>“Thank you, Big Brother Wei. However, I still want to know who is the divine smith that forged this Purple Luan? If I have the opportunity to visit the Ethereal Merchant Group, I would like to thank them in person.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei asked this question again, and Wei Feng smiled.</p> 
 <p>“Bai Hua, the only female puppetsmith among the divine. I think she’d like to see you too.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Hua, a name that was no stranger to Bai Xiaofei. Feng Wuhen had mentioned her when he came here to buy his second puppet. Unexpectedly, he also became her beneficiary.</p> 
 <p>“If there is a chance, Big Brother Wei, please tell her that although this was just a test, I still promise to help her do one thing within my power. I hope she will not decline,” said Bai Xiaofei with a serious expression. He didn’t intend to take this advantage.</p> 
 <p>That’s right, in Bai Xiaofei’s view, he was taking advantage.</p> 
 <p>However, he was wrong this time. It wasn’t him who took the advantage this time…</p> 
 <p>“I will deliver your words. I hope this puppet can shine bright in your hand. Don’t let it go to waste,” Wei Feng said with a hint of envy. This kind of top-tier puppet could be used by anyone, but unfortunately, he wasn’t qualified…</p> 
 <p>After saying goodbye to Wei Feng, Bai Xiaofei and Yun Sheng returned to the Demon of Illusions. Today, the usually deserted training field welcomed two rare guests.</p> 
 <p>“You want to link the puppet now?” Yun Sheng was incredulous. <em>Don’t people usually prepare themselves thoroughly first before linking a puppet? Isn’t Xiaofei a bit too hasty?! If he fails, he will really become an idiot!</em></p> 
 <p>“Or else? Do I have to bathe and change clothes and burn incense and worship the gods first?” Bai Xiaofei, who couldn’t understand the bitter hardships of normal people, already used his spirit to probe the Purple Luan during his speech.</p> 
 <p>The next second, a light flashed. The palm-sized wings turned into two lights and flew into Bai Xiaofei’s body. Moments later, there was a tearing sound as a pair of purple wings grew out from his back.</p> 
 <p>“Damn it! Why is it so painful!” Bai Xiaofei screamed when the pain finally hit.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Yun Sheng was already shocked silly.</p> 
 <p><em>How can he do it so fast?! Don’t they all say that the pain from growing wings the first time is so bad that people will faint? What is this reaction then?!</em></p> 
 <p>Yun Sheng repeatedly swallowed, feeling that his worldview had been overturned.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei had already started flying with his newly acquired wings, wobbling like a drunk person… However, that didn’t last long as he soon mastered the skill and successfully changed from a novice to a big humanoid bird.</p> 
 <p>If anything, Bai Xiaofei had flown once. Although the landing had failed at that time, he still accumulated quite some experience!</p> 
 <p>“Hahaha! This is so cool!!” Bai Xiaofei’s excited shouts echoed in the air as he flew wantonly around the training field.</p> 
 <p>Flying was the dream of every human being and many people became puppet masters with the dream of being able to tread in the sky one day. At this moment, Bai Xiaofei had realized this dream.</p> 
 <p>Slowly descending to the ground, he returned to Yun Sheng with an evil smile.</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother Yun, I suddenly want to test my level right now.” Bai Xiaofei shook his fist excitedly, and Yun Sheng panicked.</p> 
 <p>“What do you want?! I will never duel you. If I don’t win, I will be abused. If I win, Big Sis Liuyun won’t let me off either!” Yun Sheng knew full well his position in the Demon of Illusions. If it wasn’t that they needed an errand boy, he might have no reason to exist at all…</p> 
 <p>Although this sounded a bit bleak, it was a painful fact!</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother Yun, you think too much. I want to try not only the Purple Luan but also something even more formidable. Please tell Big Brother Jingshuang to send all those who have passed the first two requirements come over. Tell them that they can all fight me together. If they win, I’ll consider them all passed,” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Yun Sheng’s eyes widened. He looked at Bai Xiaofei as if he was looking at an idiot.</p> 
 <p>“Are you crazy?! Do you know how many people are qualified to challenge you now? If you hadn’t battered Zhu Guang, the number of people looking to fight you could line up all the way to the academy entrance!”</p> 
 <p>Yun Sheng was emotional, but Bai Xiaofei was calm.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I’m aware of my own ability. I can’t try out my true limits unless I do this. Just do as I say!” Bai Xiaofei gave Yun Sheng a reassuring look and then sat down cross-legged, his face serious.</p> 
 <p><em>Endless State, here I come!</em></p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei simultaneously activated accumulation and self-cannibalism, a fluctuation spread. Yun Sheng, who was close to him, felt a terrifying force that sucked away his own origin energy bit by bit!</p> 
 <p>Hurriedly moving away, the emotional expression on Yun Sheng’s face turned into shock. In the end, looking at Bai Xiaofei sitting in the middle of the training field, he gulped and chose to believe.</p> 
 <p><em>This is what you asked me to do. If something happens… Peh! Peh! How can anything happen?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>No, let’s talk to Big Sister Liuyun first!</em></p> 
 <p>Hesitating for a while, Yun Sheng made several decisions and ran out.</p> 
 <p>After he delivered Bai Xiaofei’s words, the people who were informed reacted differently. Chu Liuyun and the girls were mainly puzzled while Yun Jingshuang inwardly cursed. He felt that Bai Xiaofei was going to stir things up again.</p> 
 <p>But no matter who it was, their response was the same: Nobody wanted to stop Bai Xiaofei. Then, when the news was released, the public erupted.</p> 
 <p><em>This is an opportunity!</em></p> 
 <p>Very quickly, all the people who had the qualifications to challenge Bai Xiaofei rushed to the Demon of Illusions!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei had been overcome by surprise.</p>
