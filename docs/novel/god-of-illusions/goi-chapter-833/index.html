 <p>Chapter 833: Outside the Pavilion!</p> 
 <p>“We have to disembark. The area a hundred miles around the Revelation Pavilion forbids flying. We will fall to death if we do.” Approaching the territory of Revelation Pavilion, Tan Xin controlled the cruise ship to descend.</p> 
 <p>“How do you know that?!” Bai Xiaofei exclaimed in disbelief. As far as Tan Xin’s understanding of the continent was concerned, one could not imagine that she had spent so many years holed up in Windlove City.</p> 
 <p>“Collecting intel is my strong point. Those before us who could not do this well died miserably,” Tan Xin said with pride.</p> 
 <p>However, at the thought of the one hundred-mile walk ahead, everyone couldn’t help but sigh. They would have to walk for several days!</p> 
 <p>“My lords, do you need a carriage? It can get you to the Revelation Pavilion in one day!” a man came up to the group before they could complain further, as diligent as if he was looking at a mobile money machine.</p> 
 <p>“Sure enough, the land raises the people. This business opportunity is well exploited.” Bai Xiaofei smiled wryly and chose to pay. Although he was not in a hurry, walking for several days was not a comfortable choice.</p> 
 <p>Instantly after paying, the four enjoyed the highest standard treatment. The carriage was pulled by four Blackscale Horses and the interior was particularly luxurious.</p> 
 <p>‘Money makes the mare go,’ this was applicable everywhere.</p> 
 <p>The distance did not even take half a day to travel with the speed of the Blackscale Horses. It was just a nap for Bai Xiaofei’s group.</p> 
 <p>“My lords, we have arrived at the Revelation Pavilion. The rest of the road can only be traveled by yourselves,” the driver lifted the curtain and announced.</p> 
 <p>Getting off the carriage, the group could not hold back a collective gasp.</p> 
 <p><em>What the!? Are they holding a fair?! Why are there so many people?!</em></p> 
 <p>The narrow official road was so tightly packed that it gave the illusion that the stream of people was not moving forward at all. Even more frighteningly, Bai Xiaofei saw campers on the roadside who looked like they had been waiting for more than just one or two days.</p> 
 <p>“What is going on?!” Gulping, Bai Xiaofei looked at the driver.</p> 
 <p>“My lord, it must be your first time coming here. This is a normal situation. Countless people from every corner of the continent come to seek divination every day. The Revelation Pavilion respects fate and affinity. If you are lucky, you may be chosen as soon as you arrive. If you are unlucky, it’s possible you will have to wait for days or even weeks,” the driver patiently explained everything he could to his God of Wealth.</p> 
 <p>“Is there a back door?” Bai Xiaofei took out an Amethyst Coin.</p> 
 <p>The driver’s eyes immediately shone and he took out a piece of gold foil from his pocket. “One hundred Amethyst Coins! Though it’s not guaranteed to work 100%, this thing can raise your probability of being selected to at least 60%!”</p> 
 <p><em>Damn you! If it’s not 100%, why would this lord spend so much money? 60% or 90%, it all depends on your mouth!</em> Decisively rejecting the driver’s offer, Bai Xiaofei decided to find his own way. It was not his style to rely on luck.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter?” Rui Mengqi looked foolishly at Bai Xiaofei. Contrary to Tan Xin, she and Gu Lingyue knew nothing about the outside situation.</p> 
 <p>“We need to find a way to get in, or we will have to wait for the lucky draw,” replied Bai Xiaofei as the gears in his brain started to turn.</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t you say Revelation is your teacher? Didn’t he give you anything to prove it? Just take it out.” Tan Xin blinked.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei froze in place. <em>F*ck! How did I forget about that?!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei slapped his own head and hurriedly sorted through his storage ring. It was not long before a palm-sized token was found.</p> 
 <p>If Bai Xiaofei hadn’t come here, he might never have used this token in his whole life. After all, he had completely forgotten about it. Speaking of which, he had Heartseer to thank for delivering him this token, or else he would not have anything to prove his identity.</p> 
 <p>“The door’s open!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had just taken out the token when a loud shout rang out from the crowd. Everyone started to push forward like crazy.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei jumped as hard as he could and saw three young diviners dressed in the Revelation Pavilion’s disciple outfit coming out from the gate. The one leading at the front was holding a disc.</p> 
 <p>“Today, the 12th grand disciple will do divination. There are a total of thirty-six slots, for which we will draw now,” announced the leading disciple expressionlessly.</p> 
 <p>The crowd boiled. <em>The 12th grand disciple!!!</em></p> 
 <p>“The 12th grand disciple is very formidable?” Bai Xiaofei’s brows creased.</p> 
 <p>Before Tan Xin could answer, the people around shot Bai Xiaofei contemptuous looks.</p> 
 <p>“Formidable? Do you know how rare it is for disciples above the fifteen generations to do divination even once? I have been waiting here for three months, but the highest one doing divination during this entire time is only the 13th!”</p> 
 <p>Being bitterly whined to, Bai Xiaofei sighed.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the leading disciple rotated the disc in his hands. Thirty-six lights shot out from the disc and shone upon thirty-six people. The whole process ended quickly.</p> 
 <p>“Today’s draw is over, those who are chosen please follow us,” said the leading disciple.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin frowned. “That draw is not right.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei coldly snorted. The trick was not too clever. It was not difficult for him to notice it with his vast spirit.</p> 
 <p>“Does your master know that you manipulate the draws?” Bai Xiaofei’s indifferent voice echoed.</p> 
 <p>The three disciples were stunned. Then, they collectively turned around and glared angrily at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“My friend, what do you mean? Revelation Pavilion’s draw has always adhered to the principle of fairness. You are slandering us!” The leading disciple was agitated like a cat whose tail was stepped on.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t talk big, do you really think everyone is blind? You are tainting the reputation of the Revelation Pavilion with your dirty trick.” Bai Xiaofei’s tone did not change at all, but his remark severely triggered the leading disciple who was in charge of drawing lots.</p> 
 <p>“My friend, you’d better give us an explanation for this. Otherwise, no one here will give you face. Don’t think that our Revelation Pavilion is easy to bully!”</p> 
 <p>As soon as the disciple declared this, the thirty-six chosen people stared at Bai Xiaofei like they wanted to eat him alive. Bai Xiaofei was spoiling their chances!</p> 
 <p>“Go and call Heartseer. When he comes, you will know if I’m here to bully you.” Bai Xiaofei sneered. He had lost all patience.</p> 
 <p>Who knew that he’d have to help clean up the old man’s mess as soon as he arrived? It was time to fix the management of the Revelation Pavilion!</p>
