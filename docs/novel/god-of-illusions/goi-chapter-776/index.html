 <p>Chapter 776: Pissing You Off!</p> 
 <p>Except for Qing Ya due to being a staff member, who had to greet Zhu Wuxin with a polite smile, the rest of the people in the room were expressionless as if they were looking at an insignificant person.</p> 
 <p>“Just stand right there and say what you want to say,” Bai Xiaofei suddenly said.</p> 
 <p>Zhu Wuxin, who wanted to take the seat across Bai Xiaofei, froze on the spot. <em>You asked for my sincerity and got it, but now you’re doing this to me?!</em></p> 
 <p>Zhu Wuxin’s face turned livid in an instant, but he suppressed his anger, knowing that he’d give them a reason to handle him if he initiated a fight. Despite also being Exquisite Rank, he did not have the confidence to survive against the three famous experts by himself.</p> 
 <p>As for Bai Xiaofei, Zhu Wuxin ignored him. He had already deemed Bai Xiaofei to be a useless young master who did nothing but bully people, especially after Bai Xiaofei treated him so arrogantly!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei could not be blamed. Zhu Wuxin really came at a bad time for him. Originally, he wanted Lin Li’s group to try their best to have friendly contact with Devil Forest and strive for the opportunity to have a business talk with them.</p> 
 <p>However, here where Bai Xiaofei had to maintain his ‘arrogant young master’ act, their relationship was doomed to be bad. After all, his three new underlings were watching, looking forward to him teaching Zhu Wuxin a lesson just like Bai Xiaofei had done to them!</p> 
 <p>“Sir…”</p> 
 <p>“Call him Young Master Bai,” Rui Mengqi, who was massaging Bai Xiaofei’s shoulders, quickly and coldly interrupted Zhu Wuxin.</p> 
 <p>Once again suppressing the impulse to explode in fury, Zhu Wuxin took a brief while to calm himself and took a deep breath.</p> 
 <p>“Young Master Bai, I would like to discuss with you…”</p> 
 <p>“Use <em>you</em><span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>!” Rui Mengqi once again crudely cut Zhu Wuxin off.</p> 
 <p>Intolerable! No big boss would be able to endure such treatment!</p> 
 <p>Pitifully, however, Zhu Wuxin was not the big boss in the room, Bai Xiaofei was…</p> 
 <p>“Young Master Bai, I would like to discuss with you about the Blood Diamonds. If you could, please let us have those three Blood Diamonds and we’ll agree to any conditions <em>you</em> have!”</p> 
 <p>Every time Zhu Wuxin said ‘<em>you</em>,’ he felt like his heart was struck by a hammer. If it weren’t for his excellent health, he might have vomited blood.</p> 
 <p>“Hahaha! Very interesting, any conditions I have?” Bai Xiaofei burst out laughing as if he had heard the biggest joke in the world. He turned around to Rui Mengqi. “Did you hear that, Mengqi? He asked me to put forward any conditions. I am not very good at making conditions, so I’ll leave it to you. You make a wish, and if he can satisfy it, I’ll give him these stones.”</p> 
 <p>Seeing Bai Xiaofei laughing so hard that there were tears in his eyes, Zhu Wuxin was on the verge of exploding. The most apparent proof was his tightly clenched and trembling fists. Noticing his reaction, the three experts behind Bai Xiaofei stepped forward and pressured Zhu Wuxin with threatening glares.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you, Young Master, but Mengqi’s only wish is to stay by your side forever. I ask for nothing else.”</p> 
 <p>Although Rui Mengqi was only speaking from her heart, her reply was actually very suitable for the occasion. At least, Zhu Wuxin just wanted to rush up to kill the shameless ‘couple.’ Too bad he dared not…</p> 
 <p>“Aiiii… It’s not that I don’t want to help you, I just really don’t know what to ask for. But I’m quite curious. I heard that your Devil Forest Mercenary Group is collecting Blood Diamonds in big quantities. I know that these things can enhance the physique of puppet masters, but they also have a limit and shouldn’t be worth such an effort. If you tell me what other uses they have, I’ll give you one for free.” Keeping up his act aside, Bai Xiaofei did not forget his main aim.</p> 
 <p>However, Zhu Wuxin was actually silent in the face of such a rare opportunity.</p> 
 <p>He could agree to anything but this, otherwise, his group would not be the only mercenary group in Windlove City as a great deal of people would be happy to compete with him or just to ruin his affairs.</p> 
 <p>“Young Master Bai, our group still has a certain status in Windlove. As long as…”</p> 
 <p>Zhu Wuxin tried to struggle, but before he could finish, Bai Xiaofei waved his hand and lightly uttered, “Send our guest off.”</p> 
 <p>The three experts immediately came between Bai Xiaofei and Zhu Wuxin.</p> 
 <p>“Captain, there is the door. Our young master does not like people who don’t cooperate,” Shaman King said icily.</p> 
 <p>His body trembling in anger, Zhu Wuxin clenched his teeth and glared intensely at Bai Xiaofei, as if wanting to bypass the three human obstacles to shoot a hole through him. Then, under the watchful eyes of the three experts, he left with a cold snort.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei looked as if nothing had happened, but he inwardly sighed. <em>It’s already at such a point, yet he still refused to say his purpose. It seems Lin Li’s task is much more difficult than I thought…</em></p> 
 <p>“When you have time, contact Lin Li. Tell her that there’s a change in the mission: attract their attention by damaging them. No need to communicate, it’s impossible,” Bai Xiaofei said.</p> 
 <p>Only Rui Mengqi understood what he meant.</p> 
 <p>“Yes,” she assented softly and continued her massage…</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Zhu Wuxin had returned to his room with a clouded expression.</p> 
 <p>“Head, how did it go?”</p> 
 <p>The moment Zhu Wuxin walked in, a subordinate immediately came up and greeted him with anticipation, but regretted it as soon as he finished speaking. <em>From Boss’ expression, it obviously did not go smoothly!</em></p> 
 <p>“Go and inform our people to get ready. I want that Young Master Bai to ‘stay’ in Windlove forever!” His teeth nearly cracking from all the gritting, Zhu Wuxin stressed every word.</p> 
 <p>A collective sound of gulping was instantly heard in the room. <em>Wow! What happened that made him so angry?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Head, although our main personnel are all here, those three guys are tough…”</p> 
 <p>The others did not know what Zhu Wuxin had gone through, so they considered the matter from an objective standpoint. However, Zhu Wuxin was in no mood to care about that. Getting revenge on Bai Xiaofei was the only thought in his mind!</p> 
 <p>“We have even ambushed even a Timeless Rank puppet master, what’s there to be afraid of those three?!” Zhu Wuxin, who had started to lose his calm, did not listen to a word. Seeing his people standing still, his voice grew icy, “Why are you still hesitating? Go get prepared!”</p> 
 <p>“Understood, Head,” replied Chen Tian, the subordinate who had spoken earlier, before taking a few people to leave with him.</p> 
 <p>In the room, the rest of the underlings were left with a frosty-looking Zhu Wuxin. The atmosphere was so scary that they did not dare to breathe.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Tian, what do you think happened? Why is Boss so angry?” Outside, an underling was curious.</p> 
 <p>Chen Tian’s expression instantly sank. “Don’t ask what you don’t need to know. There is no harm in knowing less. Our mission now is to follow Captain’s orders only!”</p> 
 <p>After settling the underling’s unnecessary thoughts, Chen Tian sighed. <em>Perhaps I made the wrong choice back then…</em></p>
