 <p>Chapter 997: Lion’s Appetite!</p> 
 <p>“Waiting is not enough. If the Sacks are so desperate that they throw all care out the window and just come at us, do we just sit back and wait to die?” Ye Qingcheng immediately voiced her doubt.</p> 
 <p>“No, but that’s not something I need to consider. As I already said, commanding the main troops is your responsibility,” Bai Xiaofei replied nonchalantly.</p> 
 <p>Looking at his face that was asking for a beating, Ye Qingcheng suddenly regretted having wasted so much effort to enlighten him.</p> 
 <p>“Very well! I’ll remember this!” She gritted her teeth, her glare vicious. If looks could kill, Bai Xiaofei would have been dead a thousand times over.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be so angry, you’ll get wrinkles. If the Sacks are giving you a headache, I can always give you some advice.” Bai Xiaofei cleared his throat and rubbed his fingers.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t forget that your little girl’s life is hanging on only because of me!” Ye Qingcheng decisively used her killer move.</p> 
 <p>“It’s Ye Xi who is helping to preserve Qing’er’s life at the moment. And moreover, you agreed to help in exchange for the Thunderstorm Bandits’ labor. However, if you want to be an emperor who goes back on her word, I don’t mind helping you make it known to the whole world,” Bai Xiaofei chortled as he completely triumphed over the argument.</p> 
 <p>“Very good! Consider yourself formidable! Just say what you want then!” Ye Qingcheng said coldly, trying to intimidate him from going too far.</p> 
 <p>“Status and titles!” immediately replied Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Ye Qingcheng paused briefly before a look of obvious contempt appeared on her face.</p> 
 <p>“So that’s it, huh? In the end, you’re no different,” Ye Qingcheng commented as her contempt turned into disappointment. From just a few words, her view of Bai Xiaofei plummeted.</p> 
 <p>“It’s not for me, it’s for those who returned with me. Such things have no meaning to me, but they are what those people have pursued their whole life,” Bai Xiaofei elaborated.</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingcheng once again paused as her disappointment became disbelief.</p> 
 <p>“Are you dreaming?! How do you want me to explain to others about giving status and titles to over 600 people at once?! Even if you guys did create a miracle…”</p> 
 <p>“That’s right! It is exactly because we have created a miracle that no one in the entire Moonlight could, a miracle that helped you stabilize the morale of your army. I’m only responsible for presenting our demands. Implementing them is your business, not mine,” said Bai Xiaofei flatly.</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingcheng didn’t know what to say to this. In the end, she clenched her jaw and said, “I want to hear your so-called advice before I make a decision.”</p> 
 <p>“Station troops close to each other, press the enemy slowly, lock down all routes, eliminate all possible troubles!”</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingcheng was ready to listen to a long speech, but Bai Xiaofei only gave her these words.</p> 
 <p>“That’s it?!” she asked with a glare.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t answer and only looked at her quietly.</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingcheng calmed down and carefully thought about those words. As she did, the expression on her face changed again and again. At first glance, Bai Xiaofei’s answer seemed perfunctory, but when looking into it closer, the meaning behind it was quite deep.</p> 
 <p>Moreover, while accomplishing these would take a long time, once achieved, Moonlight would be able to defend its border even if the Sacks doubled in strength!</p> 
 <p>“Did you predict that I would ask you this?” After returning to her senses, Ye Qingcheng looked at Bai Xiaofei seriously.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t have the time to predict your thoughts. You asked, I pondered and answered, that’s all,” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Ye Qingcheng’s heart was filled with horror. <em>Is this fellow still human?! This is even scarier than guessing beforehand, alright?</em></p> 
 <p>Having no idea what was going on in Ye Qingcheng’s mind, Bai Xiaofei concluded the matter with an evil smile.</p> 
 <p>“From your expression, I take it that you’re taking my advice. Then, I’ll wait for your good news.”</p> 
 <p>“Do you know how hard it is to do all that?!” Ye Qingcheng shot him a glare, but was obviously giving in.</p> 
 <p>“That’s great, actually, otherwise, how can it meet Your Majesty’s standard, right?” Bai Xiaofei retorted. Then, he took a deep breath. “Alright, let’s move on to the next topic – what my people and I need.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Ye Qingcheng once again widened her eyes in shock. They stared at each other for a while as her expression changed more times than it had during the past year.</p> 
 <p>“Did I hear wrong? Didn’t you just already state what you wanted?!” Ye Qingcheng raised her voice as she finally understood what a bottomless pit of greed looked like.</p> 
 <p>“Aii! Don’t talk nonsense, that’s what you promised because of my advice. We beautifully stopped the Sacks, don’t tell me you won’t give us any reward for it?” said Bai Xiaofei righteously.</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingcheng had no way to refute that, so she could only let him go on.</p> 
 <p>“First, build a monument of heroes inscribed with the names of those who lost their lives in that battle.”</p> 
 <p>“Second, I need a batch of good equipment, some of which I need to customize.”</p> 
 <p>“Third, my group needs to be free to enter and leave any fortress city in Moonlight, and have the right to meet the supreme commander of any army at any time during wartime.”</p> 
 <p>“Fourth, a formal title that will be announced to the whole empire! I want everyone in Moonlight to know that their men are no longer the trash that they’ve been known as!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei listed four demands in one breath. Compared with his advice that was as curt as possible, his conditions couldn’t be more detailed.</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingcheng once again deeply felt the meaning of ‘a lion’s appetite.’</p> 
 <p>“Do you want Moonlight? I can give you my place.” Her face sullen, Ye Qingcheng had the urge to beat him up.</p> 
 <p>“No need, I can’t spare the effort to do it well. What’s more, I’m fine being a man,” replied Bai Xiaofei with a serious face.</p> 
 <p>Ye Qingcheng clenched her fists. “I can agree to all that, but you have to promise me one thing!”</p>
