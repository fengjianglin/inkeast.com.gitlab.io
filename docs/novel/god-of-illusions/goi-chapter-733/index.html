 <p>Chapter 733: As Long As You’re Back!</p> 
 <p>The moment Bai Xiaofei’s eyes fell on Hu Xian’er, her expression froze.</p> 
 <p><em>This feeling is absolutely infallible!</em></p> 
 <p><em>He’s back!</em></p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er instantly stopped her lecture and quickly searched the crowd. Soon, she saw the face she had been thinking about day and night for the past six months. A layer of mist clouded her eyes as she revealed a smile at Bai Xiaofei, she felt all the grievances in her heart flood out.</p> 
 <p>While he had been away, she had taken nearly all of his duties upon herself without complaining or feeling tired. She took care of the Student Community with all her heart like it was her clan, she dealt with the Infinite Mountain Range on her own, and she helped clean up the aftermath of the previous incident in Starnet. She did it all without hesitation because she knew that Bai Xiaofei would do the same if he were to stay.</p> 
 <p>However, upon seeing Bai Xiaofei, Hu Xian’er understood. It was not that she was tired nor that she couldn’t complain. She only suppressed her emotions until she could tell them all to the only person she wanted to confide in.</p> 
 <p>And now, that man was back!</p> 
 <p>Like a baby bird flying back to its nest, Hu Xian’er appeared in front of Bai Xiaofei in a flash. As they locked gazes, her tears silently fell.</p> 
 <p>“You look thin…” said Bai Xiaofei as he wiped away her tears.</p> 
 <p>Without a word, Hu Xian’er plunged into his arms.</p> 
 <p>The scene shocked all the students around. Who was Hu Xian’er? She was the well-deserved number one big sister of the Starnet Academy students, and her influence exceeded even that of many teachers. Yet, such a character jumped into a man’s arms?!</p> 
 <p>At that moment, countless young men’s dreams were shattered. The feeling of watching their goddess fall into someone else’s arms was more painful than heartbreak.</p> 
 <p>“You didn’t say you would be gone for so long.”</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er’s gentle statement made Bai Xiaofei’s heart ache. He had missed his girls when he had been away as well, but he really didn’t expect that his absence for so long would hurt Hu Xian’er so much.</p> 
 <p><em>Moreover, if Xian’er is already like this, then Lin Li…</em> Bai Xiaofei didn’t dare to think further.</p> 
 <p>“Something happened and I had to be responsible for some people. But I’m back now,” he said softly as he stroked Hu Xian’er’s long hair.</p> 
 <p>“Mhm, it’s all good as long as you’re back!” Hu Xian’er looked up at Bai Xiaofei with happiness in her teary eyes. Seeing and touching him in the flesh was already her greatest happiness.</p> 
 <p>Once, Hu Xian’er had thought of leaving Bai Xiaofei to handle her clan affairs and even wanted to push him to Chu Liuyun and the others. Now, she knew that she could not do it at all. The pain of missing him was simply beyond her capacity. No matter how long she had been living, she was still a helpless girl regarding the matter of love.</p> 
 <p>“Whatever are you looking at?! Go back to class!”</p> 
 <p>Just when everyone was in shock, a booming voice rang out. Looking in that direction, everyone saw Wu Chi approaching. It was clear from his sweaty hair and bare upper body that he had just been intensely training in the Body of Steel.</p> 
 <p>Of course, Wu Chi’s training was exclusive to himself. It was not special treatment, it was because no one could keep up with his borderline cruel training.</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother Fei, I know I might be killed for disturbing you two, but I can’t help it! I miss you too!” sang Wu Chi after driving away the students.</p> 
 <p>His words made Bai Xiaofei sweat.</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er had already left Bai Xiaofei’s arms as early as when Wu Chi appeared. Her previous weak expression had been replaced by lofty superiority.</p> 
 <p>Her swift change stunned Bai Xiaofei. Staring at the girl in front of him, a strange feeling welled up. <em>Goodness, what happened while I was away?!</em></p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was unable to find an answer, especially with a big third wheel present. He turned to look at the approaching Wu Chi and the latter’s manner kicked up a storm in his heart.</p> 
 <p><em>What the hell?! If it wasn’t that I know there’s nothing between us, I would think we’re having an affair!</em></p> 
 <p>Shooting a grumpy eye-roll at Wu Chi, he walked to the guy.</p> 
 <p>“If you talk nonsense again, believe that I will castrate you!” Bai Xiaofei made a cutting gesture.</p> 
 <p>Wu Chi didn’t speak. The two looked at each other in silence. A while later, they burst out laughing and hugged each other while patting each other’s backs. Friendship between men was hard to express in words!</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother Fei, I also want a hug!”</p> 
 <p>“Me too!!”</p> 
 <p>Several figures appeared right after Bai Xiaofei let go of Wu Chi. Mo Ka, Shi Kui, Ming One, Ming Two… All the members of the Savage Class, except Fang Ye, came running with excitement all over their faces like they were seeing a family member.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei hugged them one by one. After comforting Lin Li, who was crying like a baby, his brows creased.</p> 
 <p>“Where is Fang Ye?” He was surprised that Fang Ye wasn’t present.</p> 
 <p>“See, I told you. Old Fang and Brother Fei are true loves. You’re no longer it.” Mo Ka patted Wang Hang’s shoulder with a smirk.</p> 
 <p>“You seem to be too comfortable recently. Why don’t we spar a little?” retorted Wang Hang coldly.</p> 
 <p>Mo Ka immediately jumped away from him and hid behind Shi Kui.</p> 
 <p>“Protect me, this maniac is about to erupt!” exclaimed Mo Ka with an earnest appearance, making everyone laugh.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei felt his heart warm. Although everyone looked mature, they were still the same when they got together. Mo Ka was still so sleazy, Wu Chi still so silly, and Wang Hang still so inarticulate…</p> 
 <p>Everything didn’t seem to have changed.</p> 
 <p>“Fang Ye is rarely in the academy now. Big Brother Feng needs help with Illusion Demon, so you can say that he has moved over there. The academy affairs are handled by Big Sister Xian’er,” Xu Chen explained.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was embarrassed. Fang Ye was so busy because of his sudden decision…</p> 
 <p>“Cough… Will he be coming back soon?” Bai Xiaofei changed the topic and looked at Xu Chen.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know. Every time he came back he was in a hurry, but he always asked if you had returned. I’ve sent out news of your return. I think it won’t be long before he and Brother Feng will be back. After all, you haven’t dealt with Illusion Demon for more than half a year.” From Xu Chen’s reply, it was clear that his prudence had improved.</p> 
 <p>During the past half year, everyone had changed greatly. But, as Hu Xian’er had said, it was all good as long as he was back!</p>
