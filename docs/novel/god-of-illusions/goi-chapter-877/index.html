 <p>Chapter 877: Princess Ling Ge!</p> 
 <p>“Then you felt wrong, how can I do something to cheat my big brother? Let's go. I also want to see what kind of person Sister Mu is to make my big brother swoon for her.” Smiling, Bai Xiaofei walked ahead.</p> 
 <p>Without a comment, Yu Tianhe followed him despite sensing something strange about it. Along the way, the two chatted about everything else to get to know each other better. By the time they arrived at the Moon Beck Pavilion, the sky was getting dark and the performer competition was about to begin.</p> 
 <p>“You have come.” A woman leisurely walked out and greeted them at the entrance.</p> 
 <p>Even Bai Xiaofei was entranced. Just a glance told him that this was Sister Mu, and at the same time, he also understood why Yun Tianhe was so fascinated by her. Before even talking to her, he could already picture the scene of her tending to her husband and caring for her child if she ever got married. She exuded a kind of charm that made one feel truly comforted and at peace.</p> 
 <p>Mature, intellectual, generous, and elegant. Even if someone told Bai Xiaofei that she was a princess, he would believe them.</p> 
 <p>“Yun’er, this is my sworn little brother Bai, a legend of Starnet, exceptionally smart and formidable. Xiaofei, this is the Sister Mu you wanted to see. Her name is Mu Yun, a capable Grandmaster Rank puppet master of the Support Stream. She’s well-versed in music and great at singing and dancing.”</p> 
 <p>Yun Tianhe could be said to have racked his brains for the right praises. From his words alone, Bai Xiaofei and Mu Yun could more or less guess each other's position in his heart.</p> 
 <p>“Nice to meet you, Sister Mu. You are truly breathtaking.”</p> 
 <p>“You flatter me, Mister Bai. Since you are Tianhe’s brother, just call me Yun’er,” Mu Yun with a relaxed and gentle tone.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei noticed something strange from the way she addressed Yun Tianhe. Conventionally, it should have been ‘Mister Yun’ instead of just ‘Tianhe.’ Moreover, the phrase “You have come” when they first arrived was not right either!</p> 
 <p><em>Aiii… Aunt Lan’s request is too difficult. The relationship between these two is not what she said at all, alright? They’ve obviously already firmly taken each other as their future other half!</em></p> 
 <p>“I think I’d be beaten if I really call you that. Perhaps ‘sister-in-law’ is better?” he said.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Yun Tianhe giggled foolishly while Mu Yun immediately grew shy. Their reaction drew an inward sigh from Bai Xiaofei’s heart.</p> 
 <p>“As expected of my lil’ brother, what sharp eyes you have! If you take a liking to any sister today, tell me. Although I can't help you redeem her tonight, I promise you will win her heart within a month!” Yun Tianhe was so happy that even if Bai Xiaofei wanted a star, he would make the effort to pluck it for him.</p> 
 <p>“Big Bro, please don’t. I can touch anything but a woman. I really don’t dare!” Bai Xiaofei was not being polite. Just mentioning this matter already made him want to cry, he still had a whole army of women waiting for him!</p> 
 <p>“Let's go, it's starting in there. The sisters have put a lot of effort into today’s performances,” Mu Yun decisively interrupted the duo. This kind of pointless talk would be much more enjoyable sitting down inside.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, yes! It's cold outside, we can’t let ourselves catch a cold,” Yun Tianhe donned an ingratiating smile.</p> 
 <p>Following Mu Yun, they came to Yun Tianhe’s private VIP room where they could enjoy the performances from above. To Bai Xiaofei’s surprise, Mu Yun stayed.</p> 
 <p>“So, sister-in-law…?” he asked.</p> 
 <p>“Yun’er doesn’t need to show off in front of other people. It’s enough that she has me,” Yun Tianhe replied nonchalantly.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had to hand it to him. <em>That’s a rich man’s world for you!</em></p> 
 <p>Before long, the show officially started. A series of performances from the sisters of the upper three divisions graced the stage, each more marvelous than when Bai Xiaofei had organized the Blossom Competition.</p> 
 <p>The sisters also got their deserved rewards. Looking at the gratuities being given out, Bai Xiaofei drooled.</p> 
 <p><em>This is enough to support Illusion Demon’s operations for a whole month! Sure enough, this is the real money-collecting machine!</em></p> 
 <p>Halfway through the night, the performances ended and the show welcomed its climax – the last sprint for the Performer List!</p> 
 <p>“Distinguished guests, that was it for the performances. Our sixteen most popular performers will now enter the final competition. Please send your adoration to your favorite girl, and the girl with the highest amount of gratuities will become the top card of this month. I know I don’t have to tell you what this means,” the host made his final encouragement.</p> 
 <p>Fifteen said girls took the stage. Upon counting the number, the guests obviously did not buy it.</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t you say there are sixteen? Where’s the sixteenth? Taking it away from your guests? When did the Moon Beck Pavilion learn to scam their customers?!”</p> 
 <p>Troublemakers were everywhere, and were especially unscrupulous when they thought they were in the right.</p> 
 <p>“Please remain calm, distinguished guests. The sixteenth is Miss Mu, who cannot participate due to special reasons, but according to the rules, she does meet the conditions to be in the final round,” the host plainly explained. Any other business might fear troublemakers, but not the Moon Beck Pavilion.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, a voice that Bai Xiaofei and Yun Tianhe didn't want to hear rang out, “Oh? Why is she so special? Because she is sure victory is within her grasp?”</p> 
 <p>It was Hai Jun!</p> 
 <p>“Don't worry, I came prepared!” Yun Tianhe comforted Mu Yun, who was obviously anxious at the appearance of Hai Jun.</p> 
 <p>“I don't think so, Big Bro. Hai Jun may not be able to beat you, but your preparation might not be enough to compete with all the young nobles present combined,” Bai Xiaofei reminded.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Hai Jun in the opposite VIP room spoke again, “Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that none of us are short of money. This Mu Yun person is obviously playing us. If she really wins the top card position, that will be a slap to our faces! Since she is so fearless, shouldn’t we let her know if her backer is worthy of her trust?”</p> 
 <p>After finishing his speech, Hai Jun sat down and raised his sign. “10 million Amethyst Coins to Miss Yu Xin!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Yun Tianhe immediately raised his sign with an angry glare toward the opposite room.</p> 
 <p>“50 million Amethyst Coins to Miss Mu Yun!” Yun Tianhe had not exaggerated when he said he came prepared. Fifty million Amethyst Coins was enough to buy even a small merchant group!</p> 
 <p>And that was just the beginning!</p> 
 <p>As Yun Tianhe sent Mu Yun to first place, those who agreed with Hai Jun immediately stood up and hammered down their gratuities. Hai Jun did not even need to join to get Yu Xin to first place again.</p> 
 <p>“50 million Amethyst Coins to Miss Mu Yun!” Yun Tianhe spoke again, and one hundred million Amethyst Coins were gone.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s heart ached by just watching!</p> 
 <p>“30 million to Yu Xin!” Hai Jun stood up again. His followers quickly joined him.</p> 
 <p>It was obvious that Hai Jun only needed to take the lead, while Yun Tianhe had to fight all the young nobles by himself just as Bai Xiaofei had warned.</p> 
 <p>“100 million to Mu Yun!!” Yun Tianhe once again raised his sign with an amount that shocked everyone.</p> 
 <p><em>A total of 200 million… Is Yun Tianhe crazy?!</em></p> 
 <p>The hall buzzed as everyone started discussing. Even the other young nobles hesitated at this number.</p> 
 <p>“It’s only a few hundred million. Even I can afford it, don’t tell me you can’t! 100 million to Yu Xin! “</p> 
 <p>“30 million!”</p> 
 <p>“50 million!”</p> 
 <p>“20 million!!”</p> 
 <p>Incited by Hai Jun and driven crazy by the notion of maintaining face, the young nobles sent Yu Xin back to first place while pulling quite a big gap between her and Mu Yun.</p> 
 <p>“Mu Yun, 400 million!!!”</p> 
 <p>A pile of six hundred million Amethyst Coins could literally kill a bunch of people. This time, Bai Xiaofei witnessed for himself what was called ‘thoroughly prepared!’</p> 
 <p><em>So all the auctions I’ve been to before were only child’s play! How do these silk pants have so much pocket money?!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Big Bro, you…”</p> 
 <p>“Finally. I snuck this money out… You have to help me in front of my mother, or I’ll be dead when we return. Anyway, now no one should be able to…”</p> 
 <p>“Yu Xin, one billion!”</p> 
 <p>A faint voice interrupted Yun Tianhe. It came from a private room in the corner.</p> 
 <p>Furious, Yun Tianhe immediately turned to look and was about to curse the person. However, after seeing who that was, his eyes widened and his belly full of anger deflated.</p> 
 <p>“Yun Tianhe, as long as I'm alive, don’t even think of marrying anyone else!! Only I can be your wife!” The person’s voice echoed throughout the venue.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Yun Tianhe had given up completely. Not to mention if he had the money, the person alone was not someone he could afford to offend.</p> 
 <p>The youngest daughter of the Ethereal Emperor, Princess Ling Ge!</p> 
 <p>The sudden appearance of Princess Ling Ge stunned the whole audience, and her words struck them dumb.</p> 
 <p>The rumor had been personally confirmed! There was something between Yun Tianhe and Princess Ling Ge!</p>
