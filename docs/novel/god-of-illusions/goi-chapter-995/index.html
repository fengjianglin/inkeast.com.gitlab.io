 <p>Chapter 995: No Staying out at Night!</p> 
 <p>“Who dares to be outrageous?!!”</p> 
 <p>More soldiers suddenly poured out from the fortress and completely suppressed Bai Xiaofei’s group with numbers.</p> 
 <p>“So you are a deputy commander now,” Ye Qingtong suddenly commented. Hearing Ye Qingtong’s light words this time, the one leading the new group coming out of the fortress suddenly froze.</p> 
 <p>“Grand Commander Qingtong?!” Her voice was full of disbelief, the deputy commander immediately jumped down from her horse and knelt.</p> 
 <p>This sudden event shocked all the soldiers.</p> 
 <p>“No need to do that. I’m just a small captain now. However, I should be enough proof for the validity of his claim, right?” said Ye Qingtong.</p> 
 <p>The deputy commander immediately bowed her head. “With Your Highness’ testification, naturally not a word he said is false,” replied the deputy commander before looking around at the soldiers coldly. “What are you looking at? Make way!”</p> 
 <p>The soldiers immediately put away their weapons. The ones who had come out later didn’t know what Ye Qingtong was testifying, while the first group who knew couldn’t keep their calm at all.</p> 
 <p><em>That’s actually true?! These people stopped 300,000 enemy troops?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>When did this happen?! And how is it even possible?!!</em></p> 
 <p>Their doubts were destined to be unanswered. With their omnipotent pass Ye Qingtong, the group of men entered Divine Light Fortress unimpeded.</p> 
 <p>Inside the fortress city, traces of war were still fresh. Looking around, one would see soldiers clearing up the corpses of their comrades as well as of the enemies with the help of the citizens. When they saw Bai Xiaofei’s group passing by, their attention was grabbed.</p> 
 <p><em>New cannon fodder? There are much fewer this time…</em></p> 
 <p>This was the thought that came to everyone’s mind.</p> 
 <p>After recapturing Divine Light Fortress, those who had all been so anxious before had regained their confidence. No one knew what Ye Qingcheng would do next and what direction Moonlight would go, but as long as their emperor was at the frontier, this confidence would only grow.</p> 
 <p>“Grand General, I can only bring you this far. It’s not a problem for you to see Her Majesty, but they…” the deputy commander stopped after leading Ye Qingtong’s group to the main keep entrance and looked at Bai Xiaofei’s group with a troubled expression.</p> 
 <p>If this was not the frontier, a deputy commander like her wouldn’t even have the right to bring over 600 men here…</p> 
 <p>“Just have someone go and report to her that General Bai has completed his mission and has returned,” said Ye Qingtong.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei was curiously looking around at the surroundings. <em>The emperor is the emperor after all. I’m afraid that even a fly can’t get in with all these protective forces.</em></p> 
 <p>“Grand General, may I ask what they did?” the deputy commander looked at the raggedly dressed men doubtfully.</p> 
 <p>“With the strength of ten thousand, they stopped a 300,000-strong Sacks army and protected Crimson Moon Fortress from being invaded!” announced Ye Qingtong, stressing every word.</p> 
 <p>The deputy commander instantly looked shocked at this answer. She naturally wouldn’t question the authenticity of Ye Qingtong’s words. <em>So if that is true…</em></p> 
 <p>The thought made her look at Bai Xiaofei with complicated emotions. In the end, she bowed to Ye Qingtong.</p> 
 <p>“I will go to report to Her Majesty now!”</p> 
 <p>“No need.”</p> 
 <p>At that moment, Ye Qingcheng in a velvet uniform walked out of the main keep, her face beaming upon seeing Bai Xiaofei again.</p> 
 <p>“You’ve worked hard, my sister.” When her eyes fell upon Ye Qingtong, there was heartache and worry.</p> 
 <p>If it weren’t that she knew it was impossible to shake Ye Qingtong’s determination, she wouldn’t have let her follow Bai Xiaofei. Now it turned out that it was not necessarily a bad thing. The current Ye Qingtong was exuding an aura that she had lost before.</p> 
 <p>“Compared with our sacrificed comrades, what I have done is far from enough,” said Ye Qingtong as she made way for Bai Xioafei, the main character of the moment.</p> 
 <p>“Congratulations, you did it,” said Ye Qingcheng.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei couldn’t feel a shred of happiness about this. He never wanted a victory that cost over ten thousand lives.</p> 
 <p>However, even he couldn’t help it. This was war! A war in which victory had to be built on the bones of thousands!</p> 
 <p>“I did what I promised, so you should keep yours.” Bai Xiaofei’s tone was without any emotion. In just half a month, he seemed to have become a different person.</p> 
 <p>“I will keep my promise. However, there are things with which my belief alone isn’t enough, but don’t worry, I won’t keep you waiting too long.”</p> 
 <p>“As long as you can afford to wait, I can. Until then, we need a quiet place,” replied Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Of course. Rushuang, choose a place near the main keep and prepare food, clothing, housing, and transportation according to the highest standards,” Ye Qingcheng ordered.</p> 
 <p>The deputy commander instantly received her order and left.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you, Your Majesty. We won’t bother you then.” Bai Xiaofei turned to leave.</p> 
 <p>Before he had even taken three steps, Ye Qingcheng pursed her lips and suddenly cried out loudly, “You stay!”</p> 
 <p>Everyone was startled and they all stared at her strangely, even Bai Xiaofei. Ye Qingcheng realized she had made a gaffe.</p> 
 <p>“I have something to ask you about the Sacks. As for your people, they will be safe here.” Ye Qingcheng quickly recovered from her embarrassment.</p> 
 <p>However, some people were extremely sensitive. Tan Xin stared intently at Ye Qingcheng with hostility, while Ye Qingtong sighed and looked away.</p> 
 <p>“Xin’er, Sister Qingtong, please take them to rest,” said Bai Xiaofei. Although he was not a Moonlight person, he was currently Ye Qingcheng’s subordinate in a sense and therefore had no intention to disobey her, especially in front of many people.</p> 
 <p>A day when Nie Qing had not recovered would be a day that he had to listen to Ye Qingcheng.</p> 
 <p>“No staying out at night!” Tan Xin warned him in a voice that only the two could hear, and didn’t forget to shoot Ye Qingcheng a glare before she left.</p> 
 <p>The meaning in her eyes was obvious – <em>Don’t you dare hit on my man!</em></p>
