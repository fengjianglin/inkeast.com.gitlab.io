 <p>Chapter 1033: Cloudveil!</p> 
 <p>“Someone broke into the prison!!”</p> 
 <p>The warden shouted while desperately running away from the prison. However, after leaving that last cry, he turned into ashes.</p> 
 <p>After the warden fell, Bai Xiaofei came out with Chen Hui, who had barely recovered enough to walk. Greeting them was a group of approaching soldiers, tightly holding their weapons as they stared at the two in alarm. </p> 
 <p>“As the number one empire, Violethorn has actually done such a dirty deed. Today, I will take back some interest, and in the future, I shall have you pay your debt in full!” Bai Xiaofei declared coldly as he summoned Golden Feather. A flame emerged and enveloped the area. Under the Exquisite Rank, no one was a match for Bai Xiaofei!</p> 
 <p>After handling the entire camp, Bai Xiaofei returned to the Windsurfing Ship with Chen Hui. By this point, exactly three minutes had passed.</p> 
 <p>“Go,” said Bai Xiaofei curtly.</p> 
 <p>Seeing him like this, Tan Xin swallowed what she was about to say. Obviously, the knot in his heart could only be untied after he settled all of his accounts with Cloudveil…</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei had gone to hole up in his room and forgotten to introduce Chen Hui to everyone…</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, Chen Hui didn’t take long to get acquainted with everyone. That was when he found out why Bai Xiaofei was in such a bad mood. The news of Yun Jingshuang’s death was truly too hard to accept.</p> 
 <p>After learning about this matter, Chen Hui had become clear about his future direction. He refused the Starnet Brilliance that Bai Xiaofei got back, saying he’d come for it when he truly deserved it.</p> 
 <p>During the following journey, the Windsurfing Ship encountered many demands for inspections from Violethorn patrols, but unlike the first time at the border, they didn’t make it hard for Bai Xiaofei after confirming the authenticity of his Starnet Brilliance. </p> 
 <p>Despite the delay on the road, Tan Xin’s efforts were able to get them to Cloudveil border three days later, right just before the ship ran out of energy.</p> 
 <p>“Ultra-overused this time. It will take at least half a year to recharge.” Tan Xin sighed. Without the Windsurfing Ship, they had lost a means of rapid transfer, and it just happened that their next period in Cloudveil wouldn’t be short of running and escaping.</p> 
 <p>“A hundred miles up this main road is Stonedrum City where we agreed to meet up with Fang Ye. If we don’t rest, we should be able to get there by tonight,” said Fang Lei. As the leader of the Thunderstorm Bandits, he was a living map of the Northern Border.</p> 
 <p>With Nie Qing’s problem solved and him about to be promoted to ‘uncle,’ his attitude towards Bai Xiaofei had taken a 180-degree change. At least, he intended to fully assist Bai Xiaofei in Yun Jingshuang’s matter.</p> 
 <p>“There are still six days left before the meeting with Fang Ye. We will spread out and meet in Stonedrum City after six days. By then, I want to know all the situations about and around this city,” Bai Xiaofei said and then looked at Nie Qing. </p> 
 <p>Before he could say anything, Nie Qing already understood.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I will follow you obediently.” She stuck her tongue out and moved to stand behind Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Chen Hui, go with Brother Fang Lei. You will learn a lot,” Bai Xiaofei continued. </p> 
 <p>Chen Hui nodded.</p> 
 <p>The group then split up into five teams. Tan Xin, Xia He, and Qing Shuang formed one. Yun Mo and Lan Qu, He Rushi and Qiu Mumu were in pairs as usual, while Chen Hui followed Fang Lei.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei, Nie Qing, and the Demonic God of Pain, who had accepted his new identity as a puppet master of the Energy Stream named Moshen, headed straight to Stonedrum City using Purple Luan at full speed. Although it couldn’t compare to the Windsurfing Ship, it was enough for a short journey. </p> 
 <p>However, this experience also let Moshen know that at that time, Bai Xiaofei hadn’t brought him to fly with him on purpose…</p> 
 <p>“Where do we start?” asked Nie Qing, who was carried in Bai Xiaofei’s arms. No matter how it looked, Bai Xiaofei was not going to get along with this place, while Cloudveil was one of the four empires in the Northern Border. The power of an empire was nothing to look down on, and causing trouble here certainly would be extremely dangerous.</p> 
 <p>“I have no choice. I need to find them as quickly as possible and ensure their safety, so I have to be high-profile and use radical methods.” Bai Xiaofei had no intention to hide anything. After all, they were going to arrive at Stonedrum City very soon. </p> 
 <p>This was exactly what Nie Qing was worried about.</p> 
 <p>“No matter what, keep yourself safe,” she said with a tight frown. Knowing that nothing could change his mind, the only thing she could do was accompany him.</p> 
 <p>“Stop twittering, we’re arriving,” Moshen on Bai Xiaofei’s back interrupted with a cringe. </p> 
 <p>Seeing Stonedrum City in their line of sight, Bai Xiaofei landed and put the two people down. From there, they walked toward the city.</p> 
 <p>“Orders from the Fourth Prince: Anyone entering and exiting the city must be clearly inspected and identified. Also, we invite puppet masters of all ranks to work for rewarding pay. Puppet masters, please go through the left gate!”</p> 
 <p>As soon as the trio approached Stonedrum City, loud shouts from the entrance reached their ears.</p> 
 <p>Since the next heir to the throne of Cloudveil was still undecided, all the princes had started to fight their heads off, doing everything they could to win over any forces.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go. Let us see the power of the Cloudveil royal family.”</p> 
 <p>Although Bai Xiaofei’s tone was indifferent, both Nie Qing and Moshen felt the murderous intent in his words.</p> 
 <p>Showing their puppet master’s identity tokens, the three people entered the city and were guided by a guard to the city lord’s mansion, where at least a hundred puppet masters of all streams had gathered.</p> 
 <p>A chaotic empire was definitely a good place for ‘gold rushes.’ Recently, the number of puppet masters flooding into Cloudveil had reached at least ten times that of the past. They all wanted to fish in troubled waters, and if one was lucky enough to support the right person, they would be ensured prosperity and wealth for the rest of their life.</p> 
 <p>“My most sincere apologies for keeping you waiting, everyone. It has been busy lately, please forgive me.” A middle-aged man came out surrounded by a group of soldiers. Although he was only a small border city lord, the words ‘elegant’ and ‘luxurious’ were not too much to describe him.</p> 
 <p>Cloudveil’s wealth was not exaggerated at all. Any stone on the road could be an origin stone, which was the specialty mineral of Cloudveil!</p> 
 <p>“I am the city lord of Stonedrum, Shi He. Since you are here, I think you already know of my purpose, so I won’t beat around the bush. Would you like to lend your support to the Fourth Prince?”</p>
