 <p>“I’ve been waiting.” Tan Xin’s eyes flashed eagerly.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t expect too much, because this old man does not understand your divination. You will have to interpret it yourself. However, I think you have this ability.”</p> 
 <p>After a brief pause, Revelation slowly relayed the divination,</p> 
 <p>“Follow too many, none satisfied. Outside the heavenly law, within the local rules. Reunion with the old, do not tumble to pass. Where does the path change? Follow the phoenix, chase the dragon.”</p> 
 <p>With that, Revelation looked at Tan Xin with a wry smile.</p> 
 <p>“Just a piece of advice, if you keep your sea of consciousness divided like this, you may never return to the state you should have. In that case, you may not be able to realize your idea. After all, your little body…”</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin rolled her eyes. “Old geezer, do you know what they mean by ‘old but indecent’?”</p> 
 <p>Revelation laughed out loud. “I’m not old yet, but you…” His figure slowly faded away along with his voice without finishing.</p> 
 <p>Good at running away, Revelation was!</p> 
 <p>Having communicated with the three girls, Revelation got up and left the room, leaving them sitting there quietly. After all, opening one’s sea of consciousness to let others in was not so easy…</p> 
 <p>“What do you think, my Revelation Pavilion isn’t bad, is it?” Revelation was quick to find Bai Xiaofei, who was still following Heartseer around aimlessly.</p> 
 <p>Obviously, Bai Xiaofei’s mind was not on the scenery at all. Seeing Revelation, he immediately came up to the old man.</p> 
 <p>“Smelly old man, what did you say to them? You didn’t scheme against me, did you?!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s behavior made Heartseer sweat. He was probably the only one on this continent who dared to talk to Revelation like that, Heartseer was scared by just watching!</p> 
 <p>“Am I that kind of master who would trick his disciple?” Revelation shot Bai Xiaofei an eye-roll and smugly stroked his beard.</p> 
 <p>“Very much!” Bai Xiaofei immediately retorted.</p> 
 <p>Revelation nearly vomited blood. “You little sh*t! You have no conscience! If I had known, I would have let those two little girls stick to you until death,” he yelled.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei paused a little before ecstasy dawned on his face.</p> 
 <p>“Ahhh! My lovely master, what did you just say? My ears don’t work very well, I didn’t hear you clearly!” He instantly switched to flattery mode.</p> 
 <p>However, Revelation had no intention of buying it.</p> 
 <p>“Oh! By the way, before I left Starnet, I stole two jars of good wine from the principal. What was the wine called again? Dream Back something…” Bai Xiaofei decisively switched methods when he saw that flattery was of no use.</p> 
 <p>“Dream Back Through The Ages???!!!” Revelation took no time to attach himself to Bai Xiaofei, looking completely different from the unwavering person just now.</p> 
 <p>The last time he drank this wine from Lei Shan was decades ago. Recalling the taste, his saliva flowed uncontrollably. Revelation no longer had the heart to mind his image at the moment.</p> 
 <p>“Good wine needs a good occasion to celebrate!” Bai Xiaofei shamelessly declared after grasping Revelation’s vital point.</p> 
 <p>“Humph, smelly boy, don’t even think about it. Don’t you want to cure your broken body? If you can’t use your strength, the road to Ethereal won’t be easy.” After realizing that he was going to be bullied, Revelation also switched strategy.</p> 
 <p>Thus, the pair of old and young began to quibble in front of Heartseer, who gawked in shock and realization.</p> 
 <p><em>This is all valuable knowledge! So you can actually converse like this!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Smelly old man, don’t even think about tricking me!”</p> 
 <p>“Smelly boy, if you don’t have wine, believe it or not, you won’t be able to leave my Revelation Pavilion!”</p> 
 <p>The two continued to exchange tit-for-tat, then glared at each other for half a day before finally reaching a consensus.</p> 
 <p>“Master, we haven’t had a good drink in a long time!”</p> 
 <p>“Indeed, I actually kinda miss my good disciple!”</p> 
 <p>As the atmosphere took a U-turn, Heartseer’s worldview also crumbled. Before he could react, the duo of master and disciple had hugged each other’s shoulders as they walked away. Watching as they left, he gulped.</p> 
 <p>“Experts! So that’s what experts are!” Feeling like he had been struck with great knowledge, Heartseer firmly memorized the conversation he had just listened to. Compared to Bai Xiaofei, he felt like an ignorant novice!</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the unscrupulous duo had found a suitable place to ‘celebrate.’ As Bai Xiaofei took out the precious wine, the topic was also reopened.</p> 
 <p>“So, Master, what you just said…” Having conceded Dream Back Through The Ages, Bai Xiaofei was a sheep waiting for Revelation to handle.</p> 
 <p>“The two big girls won’t leave with you. I have convinced them and prepared for them a place to go. You don’t need to know where it is. Just know that when you see them again, you will be surprised.” Getting to taste the wine he’d been longing for, Revelation had no intention of making it hard on Bai Xiaofei, telling him what wanted to hear most.</p> 
 <p>“My great master, this disciple proposes a toast to you!” Overjoyed, Bai Xiaofei poured wine for Revelation. Then, he donned a big smile and probed, “But, Master, is that place reliable? Although it is inconvenient to take them with me, I brought them out after all. If…”</p> 
 <p>Despite looking anxious to get rid of the girls, Bai Xiaofei was actually worried about them. However, when reaching Revelation’s ears, this worry became distrust toward him…</p> 
 <p>“Humph! Smelly boy, you don’t even believe in this old man? At least your master is one of the three legends!!” With that, he ended the topic with a smack to Bai Xiaofei’s head.</p> 
 <p>Laughing innocently, Bai Xiaofei hurriedly poured another cup for Revelation and directed the topic to himself.</p> 
 <p>“My good teacher, do you really have a way to cure my body?” He looked at Revelation expectantly like looking at his lifeline.</p> 
 <p>This time, he did not have Hu Xian’er and the others around him, only Tan Xin. Moreover, he could not just rely on others. Therefore, it was very important for him to restore his strength before journeying to the Ethereal Empire.</p> 
 <p>“Ever heard of riding a donkey to find a donkey?” Revelation rolled his eyes.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei froze.</p> 
 <p>“You mean, the solution is on me?” His face was full of disbelief, Bai Xiaofei then mulled over it for a long time. However, he could not think of any way to solve his problem.</p> 
 <p>“Your cultivation technique is one of the very top-class skills, having the most terrifying recovery ability. Having such a good thing and you are still looking for something foreign? If that’s not riding a donkey to find a donkey, what is?” said Revelation smugly. After all, it was he who taught Bai Xiaofei the Lunisolar Brilliance technique.</p> 
 <p>“But Master, I tried it and it didn’t work at all.” Bai Xiaofei frowned with a hint of despair.</p> 
 <p>“You used it wrong. If you believe in your master, drink this and try the technique again,” said Revelation as he took out a small porcelain bottle and placed it in front of Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>For some reason, looking at the small porcelain bottle, Bai Xiaofei suddenly had a bad feeling…</p>
