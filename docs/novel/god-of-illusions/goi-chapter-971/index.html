 <p>Chapter 971: The Battlefield is a Man’s Destination!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s group quietly hid in a corner of the palace until dawn. When Bai Xiaofei was about to come out to find someone, Ye Tong arrived with a group of soldiers.</p> 
 <p>“Come out before I invite you out with violence!” Ye Tong’s angry voice resounded.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Bai Xiaofei wisely deactivated Blackie’s skill and came out in a friendly manner.</p> 
 <p>“I hope you are here to congratulate us for passing the test,” he chortled.</p> 
 <p>Ye Tong nearly couldn’t suppress the urge to beat him up. “I really can’t understand! Why are there so many people optimistic about a scoundrel like you?!” She snorted and said to the soldiers, “Bring them along, Her Majesty wants to see them.”</p> 
 <p>The soldiers immediately marched toward Bai Xiaofei. “Let’s go. Don’t play any tricks!”</p> 
 <p>Their attitude toward him wasn’t very friendly. If it weren’t for him, they wouldn’t have to be so exhausted last night. The more important thing was that he caused their dereliction of duty. If the emperor hadn’t told them where Bai Xiaofei was hiding, he could very well have penetrated deeper into the palace, the most sensitive place in the entire country!</p> 
 <p>Following the soldiers, Bai Xiaofei’s group passed through various passages where they were inspected again and again until they arrived at a huge courtyard. Besides them, there were more than a dozen contestants, among whom Zhu Chunyang was, impressively, present.</p> 
 <p>Seeing Bai Xiaofei, Zhu Chunyang immediately ran over to him.</p> 
 <p>“Did you miss me?” Zhu Chunyang whispered ingratiatingly. One could hardly imagine that he was so aggressive behind Bai Xiaofei’s back not long ago.</p> 
 <p>“You’re not a beautiful woman, why would I? Don’t tell me you got in here through the back door?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s careless remark instantly made Zhu Chunyang’s face red to his ears. Clearing his throat, Zhu Chunyang hurriedly changed the subject, “Do you know how those people got in?” He looked at the other contestants of interest with strange eyes, refusing to believe that they had connections like him that allowed them to enter the palace at will.</p> 
 <p>“Each has their own strengths. I don’t know and I don’t care as long as they don’t interfere with my business.” Although Bai Xiaofei was also curious, he knew that sometimes curiosity was useless. After all, he wasn’t familiar with everyone there.</p> 
 <p>“Her Majesty has arrived!” a slightly shrill voice suddenly rang out.</p> 
 <p>Shortly after, a finely dressed woman whose face was covered in a thin veil appeared, surrounded by a group of attendants.</p> 
 <p>Although her face couldn’t be seen clearly, many men already felt their hearts moved just by looking at her figure.</p> 
 <p>Very few people had seen her face, but every single one of them praised her beauty to the sky. There was even a rumor that Lin Nishang at her prime still came a little short of the Moonlight emperor.</p> 
 <p>“Putting aside everything else, her aura alone already outmatches the majority of people,” Zhu Chunyang whispered, his voice full of envy. The nobility in the temperament of the Moonlight emperor was unique and could not be copied as she was the only female monarch on the continent.</p> 
 <p>“Just talk less and watch more if you want to be like her.” Bai Xiaofei’s eyes didn’t leave the emperor for a moment. Lan Qiushuang only gave him a general direction and therefore he didn’t know who to look for after coming to Moonlight. However, he guessed that his father would have something to do with the royal family.</p> 
 <p>Not to mention that Nie Qing’s life depended entirely on the emperor. Bai Xiaofei was destined to have many contacts with this person. Only when he gained her trust could he achieve his purpose!</p> 
 <p>“Congratulations for standing out among thousands. Seeing your numbers, it can be said that you all automatically passed the test. However, I have some bad news,” the emperor spoke slowly, her voice cool and aloof.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the contestants grew nervous. In Moonlight, the emperor was their god, having their lives in her hand!</p> 
 <p>“I’m sure you should have guessed why I had you gathered from all over the empire,” she continued.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s eyes shone. <em>Finally!</em></p> 
 <p>“To celebrate the birthday of Your Majesty the Emperor and select the father for the next generation of the Moonlight emperor!” an excited voice suddenly rang out.</p> 
 <p>Looking over, Bai Xiaofei saw the image of what one could call a butterboy<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>. However, in contrast to his pretty face were a pair of unusually sharp eyes.</p> 
 <p>His answer was also the idea of most people, which was why so many servants had tried their best in the competition to get into the top 500. The emperor was a woman who wanted to pass on her royal blood. No matter how powerful she was, she could not birth a child without a man.</p> 
 <p>“It is true that I have gotten to that age, but this is not the only purpose of this competition.” The emperor was not angry, but obviously she was not very happy either. “The northern border is in a dangerous situation. For some reason, our soldiers have encountered a problem that requires men to solve. That is why.”</p> 
 <p>Except for Bai Xiaofei and Zhu Chunyang, the contestants all widened their eyes in disbelief. Seeing this reaction, the emperor couldn’t help but sigh in her heart. <em>Are men really reliable?</em></p> 
 <p>“Now, you all have the option to withdraw, and I will not blame you for it.” Her voice became cold.</p> 
 <p>The yard immediately quieted down.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Bai Xiaofei hesitated for a moment before stepping forward. “Your Majesty, I have something to say to the people who have been following me. May I?”</p> 
 <p>The emperor’s eyes fell on him. Then, her lips curled up and there was something strange in her gaze that Bai Xiaofei couldn’t understand.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, you can speak freely during this time,” she replied.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei then turned around and looked at his anxious group of muscular men.</p> 
 <p>“Remember what I said before? It’s not simple to earn people’s acceptance. Everyone knows that words can’t describe the dangers at the border. However, if you look at it from another angle, isn’t this a great chance to prove yourselves? After the past few days, you should have realized that there are things where men are more cut out for than women. The battlefield is a man’s ultimate destination! While Her Majesty said you are free to leave, I have something else to say.”</p> 
 <p>Pausing briefly, Bai Xiaofei’s expression grew solemn.</p> 
 <p>“Do it! Do it so that when you reach the end of your life and look back on it, you won’t look down on yourself!”</p>
