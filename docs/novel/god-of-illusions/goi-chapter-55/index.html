 <p><span style>After pursuing madly all along the way, it wasn’t long before the group of male students that were following closely behind Huskie’s footsteps had left the campsite, and they arrived at the place they fetched water from earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei was the first to catch up to Huskie. He originally intended to properly ‘educate’ Huskie, yet when he saw Huskie’s current state, he quieted down as well while looking towards the river bank.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long after, the other nine of them ran over successively, and their reactions were more or less than same as Bai Xiaofei. They originally intended to grumble yet noticed the atmosphere was off and quieted down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Fei….” Mo Ka silently crept over to Bai Xiaofei’s side. His panting this time wasn’t so severe because Xue Ying’s medicinal bath wasn’t just a simple bath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Barbaric Rank beasts, &nbsp;Roar Boars. They look like they ought to be a group, and I see a total of 16 now.” Bai Xiaofei spoke in a light voice, and then Mo Ka swiftly passed on what he said to the others. After that, all of them dispersed swiftly, and they saw the Roar Boars that were drinking water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Roar Boars were fierce beasts that lived in groups, and they could evolve into Brilliant Rank Magical Beasts upon maturing to the limit. A mature Roar Boar weighed 250kg at least, and they possessed their own unique skill that gave them their names, Roar!</span></p>
 <p><span style>So long as they encountered an enemy, the Roar Boars would emit a deafening roar in unison, and then they would seize the moment the enemy was affected by this roar to launch an attack or flee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amongst beasts of the Barbaric Rank, Roar Boars could be considered to be one of the most difficult to deal with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need for so many.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We just need to kill one!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ming One and Ming Two’s eyes glowed. Even though Roar Boars were difficult to deal with, they were famous for the supple texture of their meat!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can kill one, but I don’t have a way to escape safely.” Wang Hang had suddenly arrived by Bai Xiaofei’s side, and it was a rare moment where he took the initiative to speak. Moreover, his serious expression entirely didn’t seem as if he was boasting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A single one isn’t enough. I remember that the meat of Roar Boars can be kept for many days, right?!” As a wisp of a smile crept up his face, Bai Xiaofei’s eyes revealed a trace of sharpness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, right at this moment, Huskie barked softly twice, and it caused Bai Xiaofei’s face to sink immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, are you my dog or hers? You won’t transform just because she asked you not to?!” When faced with Bai Xiaofei’s raised right hand, Huskie let out a justified and confident bark, and it caused Bai Xiaofei to suppress the flames of rage that had arisen in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine! If I can’t rely on you then I can’t! I don’t f*cking believe that I can’t f*cking deal with over 10 Roar Boars!” Bai Xiaofei left Huskie behind and called everyone else together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to take down all these Roar Boars, all of you don’t have any objections, right?!” The group was already accustomed to facing Bai Xiaofei’s bold thoughts, and they only wanted to hear Bai Xiaofei’s method now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Firstly, I need to understand all of your abilities because this is the basic condition that determines if we’ll be able to take all of them down.” Bai Xiaofei swept everyone with his gaze as he spoke, and he started to ask once more after he obtained approving gazes from them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ming One, Ming Two, can the two of you resist the charge of the Roar Boars? Just twice is enough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three times!” The two brothers didn’t let Bai Xiaofei down, and they gave him an answer that exceeded his expectations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xing Nan, Fang Ye, what are your ranged puppets and what’s your accuracies?” Xing Nan and Fang Ye glanced at each other when their names were called out by Bai Xiaofei, and then they revealed their puppets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Nan’s puppet was a verdant little bow the size of a person’s forearm. However, there was no bowstring on it. He’d always had this thing hanging on his waist, and if he didn’t say anything, Bai Xiaofei and the others would always think that it was a type of accessory from the southern territory where Xing Nan was from….</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the wealthy Fang Ye withdrew an enormous fellow from his Spatial Ring, and its cool and dazzling outer appearance instantly captured the attention of everyone present here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because Fang Ye’s puppet was a gun, a heavy rifle!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gun puppets were a new type of puppets that had appeared in the last 30 years, and the first generation inventor had already been regarded as a godly craftsman because the impact of this type of puppets was truly too great!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone had once said with certainty that the appearance of gun puppets would very likely change the situation of wars on the continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, these words were mercilessly overruled in the end because the costs to construct a gun puppet was too great!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even an overlord level Empire like Violethorn was incapable of creating an army of gun puppets, and it was exactly because of their high cost of manufacturing that gun puppets were called the privilege of the rich.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For example, if this heavy rifle puppet of Fang Ye’s were to be placed on the market, it would absolutely be impossible to purchase without 10 million Amethyst Coins at least!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, what Fang Ye said next almost caused Bai Xiaofei to spit out a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve never hit a target 200 meters away from me….” As soon as he finished speaking, a sentence surged into appearance within the minds of everyone — </span><i><span style>A waste of God's given gifts!!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What about you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All hope was on Xing Nan now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Amongst 100 arrows, I might miss a single one” His voice that was filled with confidence resounded out, and Xing Nan’s pride as a master archer was vividly displayed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei nodded with satisfaction before turning around to look at Chen Hui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chen Hui, what’s your puppet?” Under the focused gazes of everyone present, Chen Hui withdrew a snow white pearl from his chest, and along with Chen Hui’s Origin Energy being poured into it, a strand of icy coldness stretched out. Moreover, the pearl surprisingly emitted a violet glow!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Snowfreeze Pearl, ice stream inheritance puppet. My mother left it to me.” Chen Hui’s tone carried a trace of nostalgia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though this wasn’t the right time for Chen Hui to reveal such a state, everyone still displayed due respect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To what extent can it attain if you utilize it with your entire strength now?” Bai Xiaofei’s question was rather direct, and Chen Hui pondered briefly before pointing towards the river below.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can freeze that river for five seconds at most!” Chen Hui was even more direct as there was nothing more direct than this description.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Chen Hui finished speaking, Bai Xiaofei glanced at the remaining people, yet he didn’t ask anymore, causing Wu Chi and the others to feel a sense of loss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, if they thought about it carefully, there really was nothing to ask about them, and it was even more so for Mo Ka….</span></p>
 <p><span style>While everyone waited nervously, Bai Xiaofei didn’t speak a single word for an entire five minutes, and he ceaselessly moved about in the surroundings while looking out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Bai Xiaofei finally returned to where the group was, Bai Xiaofei’s eyes carried a trace of a confident glow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you must remember what I’m about to tell all of you because we don’t have the ability to come to each other’s rescue, so if you make a mistake, then you must deal with it yourself!” Bai Xiaofei’s voice deepened as he distributed assignment after assignment to everyone, and when it was looked at separately, it seemed like every single person’s assignment was slightly simple. But, when they were integrated together, the entire group was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is something he just thought up?!</span></i></p>
