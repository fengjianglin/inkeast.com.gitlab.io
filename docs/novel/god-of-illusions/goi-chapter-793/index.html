 <p>Chapter 793: Demonized!</p> 
 <p>Dragon King’s injuries quickly recovered as he slowly drifted down toward Bai Xiaofei, who looked extremely miserable, lifeless even.</p> 
 <p>“So this is your true face? Starnet really deserves its reputation as the top academy.” Dragon King sighed from the bottom of his heart, and then couldn’t help but feel proud about himself. Slaying a genius was definitely something to be proud of, especially a genius that had grown.</p> 
 <p>However, before Dragon King could finish feeling good about himself, an abrupt change occurred in Bai Xiaofei. Black smoke gushed out from his body and became a thick black fog that tightly surrounded him.</p> 
 <p>“What the?!” Dragon King’s eyes widened in horror, but the horror quickly turned into ruthlessness. Whatever was happening, he had to interrupt it!</p> 
 <p>Dragon King raised his right foot and stomped down on Bai Xiaofei’s head. However, the latter suddenly moved and firmly blocked it with his hand. At the same time, the surrounding fog poured into his body and his eyes opened. Those eyes were emotionless and completely black. Bai Xiaofei no longer looked human!</p> 
 <p>Not giving Dragon King time to react, Bai Xiaofei swung his hand that was grasping the foot.</p> 
 <p>Being thrown into the air, Dragon King was horrified. He knew full well his current strength after nine reincarnations, yet Bai Xiaofei surpassed him. <em>Just how?!!</em></p> 
 <p>However, the surprise had only just begun!</p> 
 <p>With a loud thud, Bai Xiaofei sprang up from the ground like a bullet. Dragon King couldn’t even see clearly when a billow caused by extreme speed already hit his face, and then a sense of pain shot to his brain. This time, it was Dragon King’s turn to be smashed into the dirt.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, those who were going to come and help Bai Xiaofei froze in their tracks.</p> 
 <p><em>What is happening?!</em></p> 
 <p>Even for the Savage Class members, this was the first time they saw Bai Xiaofei in this state. Although they never knew exactly how strong he was, they still had a general understanding of his ability. At the very least, he had never exhibited such a gloomy and violent aura!</p> 
 <p>To be precise, Bai Xiaofei felt like a complete beast at the moment!</p> 
 <p>After smashing Dragon King into the ground, Bai Xiaofei pounced at him and began to throw a barrage of punches. The terrifying speed and the waves it created shook everyone present.</p> 
 <p>Even after Dragon King stopped breathing, Bai Xiaofei did not stop until he turned into meat paste. In the end, it seemed that the lack of resistance from the victim made him lose interest. Bai Xiaofei looked up and swept a glance around, his eyes still without any emotion at all.</p> 
 <p>Lin Li wanted to rush to him, but Fang Ye stopped her.</p> 
 <p>“Look at him! Do you think he is still our class monitor?”</p> 
 <p>Fang Ye’s question woke everyone up, and he was right to do so. When some uninformed members of the Devil Forest Mercenary Group foolishly sent bamboo to attack, the provoked Bai Xiaofei immediately rushed into the forest…</p> 
 <p>Speed and strength were now the only two things Bai Xiaofei had, but they had reached an extreme! He was so fast that no one could react, and so strong that every hit was an insta-kill!</p> 
 <p>From the moment Bai Xiaofei rushed into the bamboo forest, every second there would be a soul leaving this world forever. Amidst his killing spree, Bai Xiaofei’s expressionless face finally gained a hint of emotions – crazed pleasure!</p> 
 <p>The people of Devil Forest finally realized that they had provoked someone they could not afford to. Luckily, a signal made them give up resistance.</p> 
 <p>“Retreat!!!”</p> 
 <p>Upon the order coupled with that signal, the Devil Forest people withdrew like a wave. During this process, Bai Xiaofei pursued until the end and killed all of those he could catch up with. Then, after losing his targets again, he entered a mad rampage and began to destroy everything around him mindlessly.</p> 
 <p>Watching from a distance, Fang Ye’s face was covered in grave seriousness.</p> 
 <p>“Do we just do nothing??!” Xu Chen asked anxiously with a hint of complaint. It was already a consensus that Fang Ye was the brains of the group when Bai Xiaofei was unavailable.</p> 
 <p>At this moment, anyone could see that there was something extremely wrong with Bai Xiaofei. If this state continued, it would definitely damage him.</p> 
 <p>“We’ll risk it!” Gritting his teeth, Fang Ye struggled to utter his decision.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, everyone became serious. However, Hu Xian’er arrived.</p> 
 <p>“Leave it to me,” she said, her tone allowing no refusal. For her to appear intact, there was only one logical explanation: she had defeated Zhu Wuxin!</p> 
 <p>It was indeed the case. Three kilometers around their battlefield had been completely scorched, and the heat still remained in the air. However, Zhu Wuxin was alive. As an experienced expert, he decisively ran away as soon as he realized something was wrong.</p> 
 <p>“I’m going, too!”</p> 
 <p>“Me as well!”</p> 
 <p>Before Hu Xian’er took a step, Lin Li and Luo Han declared with the same determination.</p> 
 <p>The rest also wanted to join but were stopped by Fang Ye who shook his head slightly. <em>Can’t you see that this quest is exclusive to the harem?!</em></p> 
 <p>“You guys just protect yourselves,” said Hu Xian’er as her energy surged and sent her into her transformation state. Her three fox tails glowing with different colors according to the elements in them, she flew toward Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Lin Li floated up and closely followed, looking like a goddess in her Divine Phoenix Feather Dress and the sparkles of Thousand Star.</p> 
 <p>To everyone’s surprise, the quiet Luo Han did not fall behind. The Time Goddess’s Bracelet shone brilliantly and materialized a pair of ivory energy wings on her back. Under the light, the surrounding plants began to grow wildly. Obviously, the light was overflowing with the energy of life!</p> 
 <p>Looking at each of the three mighty girls, Fang Ye and others instinctively gulped. <em>Birds of a feather do flock together. Boss is already so perverse, who would have thought the women around him to be so perverse as well… Ahem, this definitely can’t be said out loud…</em></p> 
 <p>In any case, seeing how capable the three girls were, everyone’s heart was put at ease, thinking they were enough to save Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Hu Xian’er at the front had entered Bai Xiaofei’s range of awareness. Finally sensing a new target, his eyes fell upon her… and were still devoid of emotion!</p>
