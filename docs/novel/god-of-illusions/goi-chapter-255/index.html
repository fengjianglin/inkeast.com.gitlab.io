 <p>Chapter 255: Taboo – Something Very Stimulating!</p> 
 <p>“Mind if we talk?” Bai Xiaofei was walking when a familiar voice reached his ears. A little surprised, he turned around.</p> 
 <p>It was Xue Ying!</p> 
 <p>“You…”</p> 
 <p>“No need to be surprised. I watched you change, or else I wouldn't be able to recognize you. Seems like Huskie’s improved again.” With her usual playful smile, Xue Ying walked over to Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Open up that protective shield.” Bai Xiaofei was currently more cautious than ever.</p> 
 <p>“I did, from the moment you came out, otherwise someone would have already known that it’s you.” Xue Ying was just reassuring as ever. Bai Xiaofei couldn't help but take a deep breath.</p> 
 <p>“Don't thank me. If you say ‘thank you’ to me, I’ll want to kill you.” Just like a worm in Bai Xiaofei's heart, Xue Ying already stuffed what he wanted to say back down his throat before he even finished breathing in.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, no ‘thanks’ then.” Feeling warm in his heart, Bai Xiaofei revealed a rare smile.</p> 
 <p>“Why is your smile so ugly? You’re not a fake Bai Xiaofei, are you? What? Just a little setback suddenly let you become so mature? Then the loss of this continent might be far too great for you!” Frowning, Xue Ying was not satisfied with Xiaofei's response.</p> 
 <p>Different people liked different things about a person, and what Xue Ying liked was how Bai Xiaofei could laugh unbridledly no matter the situation.</p> 
 <p>“It's just that I have something on my mind and can't feel happy for the time being.” His face gradually relaxing into a real smile, Bai Xiaofei unconsciously felt a little better.</p> 
 <p>“That's good. I thought the Bai Xiaofei I knew was gone. Scared me to death.” Xue Ying patted her chest with an exaggerated worried look. Bai Xiaofei smiled again.</p> 
 <p>“You didn't come here just to enlighten me, did you?” Just as Xue Ying knew Bai Xiaofei, Bai Xiaofei also knew Xue Ying very well.</p> 
 <p>“You’re no fun. Can't you let me be mysterious for a while?” Xue Ying pouted, as if very upset.</p> 
 <p>“Well, I can't help that I’m so smart. Playing dumb is too difficult for me.” With a sigh, Bai Xiaofei helplessly shrugged, the look on his face so annoying that Xue Ying couldn't help but stare with scorn in her eyes.</p> 
 <p>“If you can't handle Di Jiang, I can help you!” After the scornful look, Xue Ying suddenly became serious. It didn't seem like she was joking at all.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, you'll be in danger if you even make just the slightest movement. I don't want you to disappear from Starnet.” Bai Xiaofei knew what Xue Ying was going to do, so he would refuse no matter what, not to mention that he already had a plan.</p> 
 <p>As for Xue Ying, she fell silent with a hint of painful loss.</p> 
 <p>Some things just couldn’t be hidden from Bai Xiaofei, only that Xue Ying chose to play dumb.</p> 
 <p>“If one day I say sorry to you, what will you do?” Raising her head to stare straight at Bai Xiaofei, Xue Ying gulped, her eyes flashing with complicated emotions.</p> 
 <p>“I might want to kill.”</p> 
 <p>Throwing Xue Xing’s words back at her, Bai Xiaofei smiled again.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s not get your head worried about all that. Who can tell what will happen in the future? Accompany me for a bit. I'd better be mysterious about my current whereabouts. Since you’ve come anyway, I’ll be counting on you,” Bai Xiaofei directly changed the topic and raised his arm. “You are not my headteacher now.”</p> 
 <p>At his action, the feeling of loss on Xue Ying's face disappeared instantly. She stepped forth and linked arms with Bai Xiaofei, returning to the position she had been thinking of for the past several days.</p> 
 <p>“’Teacher for a day, parent for a lifetime.’ You are flirting with your elders now!” Xue Ying’s eyes once again resumed her usual playfulness.</p> 
 <p>“I can't help it. This elder delivered herself to my door voluntarily, what can I do? Besides, someone seems to enjoy this taboo feeling.”</p> 
 <p>Xue Ying's face was instantly painted with a red blush that was more intoxicating than the setting sun.</p> 
 <p>“Tch, like some bad student isn’t enjoying this either!” Xue Ying ‘ferociously’ countered and assumed a murderous posture.</p> 
 <p>Looking at one another, the two burst out laughing in unison half a second later.</p> 
 <p><em>We are birds of a feather alright!</em></p> 
 <p>Along the way, Bai Xiaofei and Xue Ying were never quiet. The topic of their ramblings covered almost everything, letting them forget Bai Xiaofei’s current problem until he entered the Blossom Pavilion.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s stop here. That fellow Yun Jingshuang guaranteed that no one in Starnet could spy on this place.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei's expression instantly straightened, only that it wasn’t as heavy as before. Perhaps this was Xue Ying’s main purpose when she sought him!</p> 
 <p>“I'm going back to prepare lessons, too. It's not a good thing to get involved with a problematic student like you. What if I lose my job?” Xue Ying teased and loosened her hand.</p> 
 <p>“Then… see you again?”</p> 
 <p>“Mhmm, see you again!”</p> 
 <p>With a silly smile, Xue Ying moved back, while Bai Xiaofei scratched his head and turned away.</p> 
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei!”</p> 
 <p>He didn’t even take two steps when Xue Ying’s voice rang again. Instinctively turning around, he felt a gentle touch on his lips.</p> 
 <p>Looking at Xue Ying up-close, Bai Xiaofei’s eyes widened.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll be waiting for your good news!”</p> 
 <p>Lips separating as soon as they touched, Xue Ying's face reddened completely and she was about to run away, but Bai Xiaofei pulled her back.</p> 
 <p>“Take advantage of me?” Saying this, Bai Xiaofei quickly held Xue Ying’s head, and domineeringly got back at her!</p> 
 <p>This time, it lasted for more than thirty seconds. That was why Xue Ying was slightly lacking oxygen when Bai Xiaofei finally let go. The translucent silk thread connecting their lips was broken off. Bai Xiaofei looked at Xue Ying defiantly, while Xue Ying stared at him plaintively.</p> 
 <p>After looking at each other like that for more than ten seconds, Xue Ying finally snorted ‘angrily’ and stomped her feet.</p> 
 <p>“Just you wait!” Dropping malicious words, she turned to leave.</p> 
 <p>This time, she ran! After making sure she had disappeared from Bai Xiaofei's view, the panting Xue Ying stopped at once. The burning feeling once again crawled up on her flushed face. Her eyes open wide, she repeatedly gulped. Her mind was overrun with how her body had just reacted, and the unforgettable feeling when they had touched…</p> 
 <p><em>What's the matter with you?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Why did you just have to provoke him?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>What now?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Don’t I lose out being the forced one?</em></p> 
 <p><em>No, I'm older than him, he should be the one to lose out…</em></p> 
 <p><em>What if he thinks I came to find him just to do that?</em></p> 
 <p><em>But I really didn’t!</em></p> 
 <p><em>What to do… what to do …</em></p> 
 <p>All kinds of thoughts gushing into Xue Ying's head, so many so that the word ‘calm’ had nothing to do with her. However, what she didn’t know was that Bai Xiaofei wasn’t much better off right now.</p> 
 <p><em>Shit! What do I do?</em></p> 
 <p><em>I couldn’t hold back!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Is she really angry?</em></p> 
 <p><em>What if Xian’er knows?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Will those two fight when they meet?</em></p> 
 <p><em>It's over, it's over, I’m done for!</em></p> 
 <p>This might be the only difference between Bai Xiaofei and Xue Ying. Bai Xiaofei came to a conclusion -- He was done for.</p>
