 <p>Chapter 1012: Change of Plan…</p> 
 <p>The tension emitted from Bai Xiaofei startled the two women. They stared at him for a moment before bursting into laughter at the same time.</p> 
 <p>“The rumor is really accurate, you really are the kind of person with dirty thoughts but without the guts to carry them out!” Qiu Muxue commented.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s face immediately turned into a helpless scowl… <em>I’m not that kind of person, alright?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Okay, okay. Now that you have agreed, let’s discuss what to do next.” Qiu Muxue skipped the topic.</p> 
 <p>Feeling something was wrong, Bai Xiaofei thought for a moment before yelling, “Wait! When did I agree?!” Nearly being tricked, he was like a cat whose tail was stepped on.</p> 
 <p>“You said you wouldn’t agree without benefits, didn’t you? Aren’t the benefits we promised you good enough? Don’t you want to know what the two divine items of the Barbaric Godism are?” Qiu Muxue threw out the bait.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei gulped. He actually looked forward to this. At least, he must have the Revival Grass that Ye Qingcheng had said to be in the hands of the Sacks. As far as the situation was concerned, six months was not enough to win the grass by conquering the Sacks, so he had no other choice.</p> 
 <p>“What are they?”</p> 
 <p>His question was what Qiu Muxue wanted to hear, and she instantly looked smug.</p> 
 <p>Lan Shuang replied in her stead, “A pair of flower and grass: Dragon Saliva Flower, and Revival Grass.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s eyes lit up. He was not interested in whatever the Dragon Saliva Flower was, but the latter was a different story!</p> 
 <p>“I will do it!”</p> 
 <p>He was so quick and happy to agree that it shocked the two women. <em>Talk about greed!</em></p> 
 <p>“Then… next…” Qiu Muxue was stuck in the middle of her words as she still hadn’t recovered from Bai Xiaofei’s 180-degree change of attitude.</p> 
 <p>“Tell me about Barbaric Godism. Only by knowing your enemy thoroughly can you win every battle,” Bai Xiaofei guided.</p> 
 <p>Having a clear direction, Qiu Muxue got to the point, “You should know my title in the Sacks. In fact, Saintess is a position with no real power at all. The reason why I can lead all the tribes is that Barbaric Godism is just too lazy to take care of these things.”</p> 
 <p>Mentioning this, Qiu Muxue looked lost. Her biggest enemy was clearly Barbaric Godism, yet she needed this identity to carry out her plan.</p> 
 <p>“Barbaric Godism has five elders whose strength can only be described by one word: unfathomable. Without using puppet master abilities, I really don’t know how I could kill them.”</p> 
 <p>“In addition to the five elders, they have an exclusive guard team consisting only of top-notch Sacks warriors. Although they only have 500 members, they have never lost a battle. Their most terrifying record is slaughtering a 10,000-strong army head-on without any casualties!”</p> 
 <p>“After the guard team is their 3,000 personnel. Although they aren’t as strong as the elite guards, they are at least on the same level as Ahetu.”</p> 
 <p>“Most importantly, the whole clan obeys the command of Barbaric Godism, even I can’t turn them against it,” she concluded.</p> 
 <p>After listening to everything, Bai Xiaofei not only wasn’t nervous, but he even burst out laughing.</p> 
 <p>“Why are you laughing?” Qiu Muxue was stunned.</p> 
 <p>“What I was afraid of was not quality, but quantity. Now it looks to me that this so-called Godism is simply vulnerable,” Bai Xiaofei commented.</p> 
 <p>The two women were dumbfounded as this was the first time they had heard something like this.</p> 
 <p>“If those five elders are high-ranked puppet masters, I might be a little scared, but if they are only physically strong, then there is nothing to fear. Martial artists are just martial artists after all.” Bai Xiaofei’s eyes grew sharp. “They can just be worn out to death!”</p> 
 <p>After understanding the situation of Barbaric Godism, Bai Xiaofei immediately had a rough idea.</p> 
 <p>“Those five elders are much more cautious than you think. They seldom come out alone without absolute safety measures,” Qiu Muxue reminded.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t care. “That’s because no one has led them around by their noses before. Don’t worry, I guarantee that they will all die an ugly death,” he declared.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Qiu Muxue couldn’t help but look at him dubiously.</p> 
 <p>“If you decide to use me, put aside all your doubts and have some confidence. But before that, let’s deal with the situation at hand.” Bai Xiaofei looked at Qiu Muxue with a smile.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll do as you arrange.” Qiu Muxue decided to give him her unconditional trust.</p> 
 <p>“Open up.” Bai Xiaofei chuckled. “Before sending out the Fickle Army, I already told them about the next arrangements, which have become quite easy to execute considering that we are now allies. All you need to do is cooperate with them.”</p> 
 <p>“Don’t tell me you already have everything arranged until the end of this war.” Qiu Muxue’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p> 
 <p>“Not that far, only up until winning back the six fortresses.”</p> 
 <p>He chortled, not caring that his answer only shocked Qiu Muxue even more as he grabbed a piece of paper.</p> 
 <p>“This is Moonlight’s current military layout. The arrangements I’ve made are: Moonlight will besiege you after winning the temporary fortresses, with the aim of cutting off your food supplies and forcing you to deploy for a grand battle.”</p> 
 <p>“Once that happens, Moonlight’s main force will restrain you while the Fickle Army attacks from the rear to – one, continue to cut off your supplies, and two, look for opportunities to take over any fortress that may be won.”</p> 
 <p>“Should your troops choose to march back to the fortress to aid, the Moonlight army will chase and kill as many as possible. Should they choose to give up on the fortresses and put everything into the grand battle, Moonlight will drag it on until your troops no longer have any power to fight.”</p> 
 <p>“In fact, from the moment you gave up on those temporary fortresses, the war was as good as decided.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei concluded with a smile that sent a chill down Qiu Muxue’s spine. Sure enough, the person in front of her was the most terrifying terrible existence in this war!</p> 
 <p>“So, I should be glad that my ultimate goal is not to defeat Moonlight, huh?” She gulped with difficulty.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei nodded and continued, “But in order not to let those old foxes discover our plan, our acting needs to be realistic, which probably will result in heavy casualties on your side. Can you accept this?”</p> 
 <p>There was hesitation in Bai Xiaofei’s voice, but to his surprise, Qiu Muxue was very clear about this matter.</p> 
 <p>“If you’re not here, I’m afraid the number of survivors on my side will be counted with two hands. As for sacrifices and whatnot, do you think that’s something I, who originally planned to destroy the whole clan to rebuild it from the ground up, would care about?”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei smiled wryly. <em>Nothing can be crueler than when a woman decides to harden her heart!</em></p> 
 <p>“In that case, you can ‘cooperate’ with Moonlight.” Putting away the messily written on paper, Bai Xiaofei took a deep breath. “I hope everything goes well for the Sacks as you hope!”</p> 
 <p>……</p> 
 <p>While Bai Xiaofei was having the conversation with Qiu Muxue, the Fickle Army had returned to Divine Light Fortress and was currently standing in front of Ye Qingcheng.</p> 
 <p>According to the results, it was obvious that Bai Xiaofei had won the bet with the three generals. When comparing their visions with him, the generals couldn’t help but feel ashamed.</p> 
 <p>Moreover, in everyone’s opinion, the price of this huge achievement was Bai Xiaofei’s life…</p> 
 <p>“I don’t believe that he’s dead! As long as we take back Colorful Star, we will find him!” Tan Xin’s eyes were bloodshot on her expressionless face. No one could imagine how she had felt in the past few days.</p> 
 <p>“I also believe that he is not dead. Don’t worry, I won’t let him do all this for nothing!” Ye Qingcheng solemnly promised.</p> 
 <p>Zhu Chunyang immediately revealed a conflicted expression. “From what you guys are saying, you plan to deploy troops there? But he didn’t tell us to do that…”</p> 
 <p>At the reminder of Bai Xiaofei’s arrangements, everyone fell silent, until Ye Qingcheng spoke up.</p> 
 <p>“Moonlight has not gotten to the point where it has to listen to a man completely. No matter what, Colorful Star must be recaptured within five days!”</p> 
 <p>No one expected that the most radical among them was the one who most should not be. Ye Qingcheng’s declaration upset Tan Xin, but it was also a decision that she absolutely didn’t want to object to.</p> 
 <p>“I am willing to lead the Fickle Army to go at the front!” Zhuang Shuo immediately stepped forward. Like Tan Xin, his heart had been torn in the past several days. The Fickle Army had become everything that no one had dared to imagine before, all thanks to Bai Xiaofei. If Zhuang Shuo could, he was even willing to repay Bai Xiaofei with his own life.</p> 
 <p>“The Fickle army is not allowed to fight this time!” Ye Qingcheng doused cold water on Zhuang Shuo’s enthusiasm, her expression obviously saying there was no room for argument. “Alright, I don’t want to listen to anyone’s advice now. Go back and readjust. We will set out at dusk!”</p> 
 <p>With that, Ye Qingcheng coldly left, leaving a room full of people staring at each other.</p> 
 <p>“I haven’t seen her like this in a long time. Go back and have some rest. I’ll talk to her,” Ye Qingtong comforted the desperate Fickle Army, her voice low.</p> 
 <p>“Then we’ll leave it to you. You know that there is no way these people would just sit idly by.” Tan Xin lowered her head as her eyes watered up again.</p> 
 <p>Some people were just capable of touching the hearts of many…</p>
