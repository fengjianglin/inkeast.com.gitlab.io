 <p>Chapter 847: Perverse Tan Xin!</p> 
 <p>“This little one is Chu Liang, the house steward,” Chu Liang hurriedly said.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei nodded with satisfaction. Now that the lesson had been given, it was time for rehabilitation. Although it was not overboard to kill the fat pig a hundred times over, he was still a branch president of the Vivid Wing Chamber after all.</p> 
 <p>Naturally there would be no need to worry so much if Bai Xiaofei could stay here forever, but he was only a passer-by, so he had to handle this perfectly. At the very least, he needed to make it so that the Vivid Wing Chamber would not come after the Yun family.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, from now on, you will be in charge of this place. How to deal with this fat pig and arrange these people are your task. You have three hours to clean up this mess. The three of them will listen to your command.” Bai Xiaofei motioned at the three puppet masters before standing up and stretched his body. “Xin’er, we’ll have a rest.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Tan Xin stood still in shock for a good while.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter?” Bai Xiaofei asked her, confused.</p> 
 <p>“No! Nothing…” Tan Xin hurriedly said and closely followed him.</p> 
 <p>After entering the reception room down the hall, Bai Xiaofei flopped down on a chair. Huskie’s Mimicry was too real and having to use a woman’s body exhausted him.</p> 
 <p>“Can you… call me again?” With no one else in the room, Tan Xin suddenly became shy. Her girly appearance nearly blinded Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p><em>Damn, is this still the mighty Windlove lord? What am I seeing!?</em></p> 
 <p>“Ehh… Just now it was according to our identity, it wouldn’t be appropriate if I didn’t call you that,” Bai Xiaofei hurriedly explained as he sensed something dangerous.</p> 
 <p>“So you didn’t mean it…” Tan Xin immediately looked lost and sad.</p> 
 <p>“No, no, it’s not that!” Bai Xiaofei helplessly conceded. Then, he uttered in his smallest voice ever, “Xin’er…”</p> 
 <p>“I’m here!” Tan Xin’s expression took a 180-degree turn, so fast that Bai Xiaofei felt like he had been tricked…</p> 
 <p><em>A woman’s heart, a needle in the haystack!!</em></p> 
 <p>A smug Tan Xin used practical actions to demonstrate what was called ‘give someone an inch and they’ll take a mile.’ She drilled herself into Bai Xiaofei’s arms and sat on his lap.</p> 
 <p>“Go ahead, you have something to ask me, don’t you?” She took the initiative to lead into the topic. She had not been the lord of Windlove for so long in vain for so long. Despite having known Bai Xiaofei for only a short time, her experience and intelligence put her among the top in understanding him.</p> 
 <p>“Since you guessed that I had questions, guess what I want to ask.” Bai Xiaofei’s interest was piqued.</p> 
 <p>His hands had been properly resting on the arms of the char, but Tan Xin dragged them around her body and he was now holding her.</p> 
 <p><em>Cough, don’t let your imagination run wild. With Tan Xin’s current size…</em></p> 
 <p><em>Have you ever held a baby? Yes, that’s the feeling…</em></p> 
 <p>“What else? You’re curious why I can use Wang Hang’s ability.” Tan Xin hit the nail on the head.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei nodded. “Indeed, I remember your fighting wasn’t like this before. Why did you suddenly change styles?” he voiced his doubt and quietly waited for the answer.</p> 
 <p>“This is mainly because of your master. After having a conversation with him, I decided to make some changes, and such changes require me to give up some of my previous abilities. I will enter a weakened state due to this, so after this matter we’d better stop causing trouble for a while.” Tan Xin sighed, her face full of sorrow.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter?” Although Bai Xiaofei could not see Tan Xin’s expression in their current positions, he keenly felt the emotion she exuded.</p> 
 <p>“To explain this, I have to start from my ability,”</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin said faintly.</p> 
 <p>“In our world, we formed groups striving to survive, always surrounded by the threat of death. My team members collectively gave me a kind of ability that lets me accept the ability of the dead.”</p> 
 <p>“After that, we won more than we lost, yet my team members still died one after another, and accordingly I received one ability after another. However, this reception is not without a price. I have to separate a part of my soul to maintain an ability, and every time my soul is divided, it’s a very painful process. At the same time, I will look a few years younger. So, I’ve become what I am now.”</p> 
 <p>“Although I don’t like my current image, every ability in my body is the last connection I have to my teammates. That’s why I have not changed for so many years,” as she said this, Tan Xin hung her head.</p> 
 <p>“After talking to my master, you realized you were wrong, didn’t you?” Bai Xiaofei stroked her head with a smile. “They were willing to entrust their abilities to you, not to make you live in past memories, but to help you survive. At that time, their abilities were a great help, right? But they started dragging you down as you became stronger?”</p> 
 <p>Although Bai Xiaofei did not know much, he could guess Tan Xin’s situation.</p> 
 <p>People who valued relationships always got trapped by feelings in the end. This was not just about romantic love, but all the beautiful relationships between people in the world.</p> 
 <p>“So, now that I’ve figured it out, I’m going to take my ability back and carry their wishes to live happily!” Tan Xin laughed as she enjoyed Bai Xiaofei’s touch, looking like a contented kitten.</p> 
 <p>“So, your original ability is to replicate?” Bai Xiaofei asked.</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin proudly raised her right hand. “My ability is called the Hand of Invention and Creation, not something as simple as replicating!”</p> 
 <p>With that, Tan Xin waved her right hand and the calm room immediately picked up a burst of dust. Then, she waved her left hand and the dust gathered. In less than three seconds, the clump of dirt turned into a glittering diamond!</p> 
 <p>“The ability of my right hand is invention, used to generate all basic elements, while the ability of the left is creation, letting the elements form what I want.”</p> 
 <p>“On this basis, I trained to the point that I can copy the abilities of others and people would see that as my ability. Under normal circumstances, I can analyze any skill used within five kilometers around me.”</p> 
 <p>Tan Xin’s voice was nonchalant, but Bai Xiaofei completely froze.</p> 
 <p><em>Heaven!! She’s not just a BUG, she’s a pervert!!!</em></p>
