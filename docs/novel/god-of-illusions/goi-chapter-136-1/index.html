 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>It was a pleasant dinner. However, they still had to end it since they had to continue purchasing the Starnet Stones. Once again, the four bosses sent over a huge amount of money. After hearing Bai Xiaofei’s explanation, they now felt that whatever amount they lent to him would be worth it. When Fang Ye and the rest returned to the purchasing area, they all smiled bitterly.</p>
 <p>Although they knew they had a bright future ahead, they still couldn’t feel any joy when they looked at the long queue that had grown to a point where it now looked like a dragon.</p>
 <p>“Work hard, brothers. I have high expectations of you guys.”</p>
 <p>After saying this, Bai Xiaofei left straight away. He seemed to have no reservations in being an absentee leader…</p>
 <p>“Get to work then. What can we do when it’s his idea?”</p>
 <p>Fang Ye spoke, accepting his fate. After a last minute rearrangement of manpower, they &nbsp;focused on the “battle” once more. This time, Fang Ye’s respect towards Bai Xiaofei grew yet again. It was as if Bai Xiaofei was the merchant’s son instead of him.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had mentioned all his ideas were influenced by his upbringing, piquing the Savage Class’s interest in his home as well. <em>What type of place could train something like Bai Xiaofei? He's capable of everything!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Naturally, Bai Xiaofei would not casually reveal that he came from the Gorge of Heroes. After all, the Gorge of Heroes was too shocking of a place. It was as Revelations had warned him: until you are strong enough, revealing this would only bring you countless troubles…</p>
 <p>After leaving Fang Ye, Bai Xiaofei did not go looking for girls. It was quite rare for him to be this obedient. Instead, he went directly to his room and collapsed onto his bed. He was completely exhausted after spending an entire day socializing around. The night passed peacefully. Bai Xiaofei woke up early the next morning after sleeping to his heart’s content. Mo Ka and the others stared in amazement when they saw that Bai Xiaofei had woken up all by himself.</p>
 <p>“Mo Ka, did the sun rise from the west today?” Shi Kui poked Mo Ka and asked. He looked at Bai Xiaofei as if he was a stranger, an odd expression on his face.</p>
 <p>“I guess he had a wet dream? That’s why he was forced to wake up?”</p>
 <p>Wu Chi offered a lousy explanation, yet it sounded rather plausible…</p>
 <p>“Not so loud! What if Big Brother Fei is actually sleep walking? If you wake him up, do you think the three of us can beat him?”</p>
 <p>Ma Ka maintained his vigilance, sizing up Bai Xiaofei the same way one would size up a thief.</p>
 <p>“What the f*ck? I only woke up slightly earlier than usual. Is there a need to react like this?”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei couldn’t stand them anymore. The three were shocked when they heard him speaking.However, they were relieved to see him behaving like normal.</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Fei, how is this waking up slightly earlier? This is an act of increasing your life by half a day!”</p>
 <p>Wu Chi and Shi Kui frantically nodded in agreement with what Mo Ka said.</p>
 <p>“Piss off. There’s nothing else to do today. Let Fang Ye and the others know that they can have a break today. Tonight, I will bring you guys somewhere to expand your horizons.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei raised his eyebrow, intending to keep them guessing. However, he was surprised to see the three merely look at him with distrust.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Big Brother Fei, is it really to expand our experiences?”</p>
 <p>“Are you sure you are not using us as free labor again?”</p>
 <p>“Or maybe we will have to go around running errands or fight instead?”</p>
 <p>They each asked a question, carefully probing Bai Xiaofei. At this point, they all feared him greatly. After all, any random idea of this guy would cause them to work tirelessly for an entire day…</p>
 <p>“Come along if you want. I can’t be bothered with you guys anymore. Remember to buy some presentable clothing to wear if you are coming. Don’t embarrass yourself when the time comes.”</p>
 <p>After speaking, Bai Xiaofei rinsed his mouth before spitting the water out.</p>
 <p>“How about you, Big Brother Fei? Do you have anything to do today?”</p>
 <p>Mo Ka paused slightly before asking their real concern. They didn't feel as confident in themselves whenever Bai Xiaofei wasn't around.</p>
 <p>“You guys are always saying that I’m dawdling around. This time, I will be the vanguard. You guys can have a proper rest.”</p>
 <p>No one believed him. After dressing himself up neatly, Bai Xiaofei left the hostel in an energetic manner just like someone who was going off to see his secret lover. When Mo Ka and the rest saw how he was behaving, they were convinced that he was having an affair.</p>
 <p>“I think Big Brother Fei is meeting up with a girl…”</p>
 <p>“Yeah.”</p>
 <p>“I agree.”</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, Mo Ka’s group of three had already developed a certain level of coordination when speaking…&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But this time, Bai Xiaofei had been wrongly accused. He only had affairs at night...cough cough. Oops, anyway this time he's truly going out for proper business! It’s just that his place of business was rather “special”: the Blossom Pavilion…</p>
 <p>“Why are you still dressed like that?”</p>
 <p>Yun Jingshuang in his light pink clothing looked at Bai Xiaofei with disdain and asked grudgingly.</p>
 <p>“What is the rush? It’s not time yet anyway. I still have an entire day to change my clothes.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei answered without the slightest bit of concern. Unfortunately, Yun Jingshuang immediately reminded him of how young he truly was.</p>
 <p>“I doubt you will have the chance to change now.”</p>
 <p>The moment he finished speaking, over twenty seniors radiating elegance and poise walked over from behind him. It was obvious that none of these seniors were ordinary people.</p>
 <p>“These people are all on the Wealth Ranking. I don’t need to tell you their purpose here, right? Among them are Huo Long and Yang Fengnian, both famous playboys. Guard your girlfriends carefully.”</p>
 <p>Yun Jingshuang gave Bai Xiaofei a last minute reminder. Then he patted Bai Xiaofei’s shoulder before turning around with a smile on his face. He would never have bothered with these people in the past. However, after Bai Xiaofei’s “teachings”, he had come to love these people. After all, rich people were all lovable, right?</p>
 <p>“Let me make an introduction. This is Bai Xiaofei, the person you guys have been waiting for an entire morning for. You guys can proceed with your discussions without me. I still have other things to do.”</p>
 <p>After a simple introduction, Yun Jingshuang made up a random excuse and left. At the end of the day, he still disliked men. Bai Xiaofei was left behind to welcome his new challenge. To be precise, to welcome the Gods of Wealth.</p>
 <p>“Hello, junior brother. I am Huo Long. I would like to discuss with you about the Blossom Ranking. Naturally, the brothers behind me are here for the same reason as well.”</p>
 <p>Huo Long described these people as his brothers instead of senior or junior brothers. For them, age was of secondary importance. What mattered most was wealth. For these people, wealth was how they measure their friendships. Just like this, Bai Xiaofei got to know a new circle of people.</p>
 <p>“No problem. Let us sit down before we proceed. I believe what you guys would like to know isn’t something that can be summarized so easily, right?”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei replied with a slight smile. Inwardly, he was getting pumped up as well. Whether his plan will succeed will highly depend on these people's attitude!</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaofei could already see that he would have a “fierce battle” with these people. Even he was only half confident of emerging as the victor.</p>
 <p>“Senior brothers, I believe you have all seen the rules announced by Senior Brother Yun Jingshuang, right? Feel free to ask any questions. I will try my best to help.”</p>
 <p>They entered the room prepared by Yun Jingshuang and each took a seat. This was the start of Bai Xiaofei’s first clash with the Wealth Ranking. By the time he left this room, everything would have been decided.</p>
