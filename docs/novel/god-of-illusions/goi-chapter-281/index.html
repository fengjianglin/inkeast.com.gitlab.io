 <p>Chapter 281: Bai Xiaofei's Ambition!</p> 
 <p>Less than five minutes after the receptionist left, Bai Xiaofei, who sat in the hall waiting, saw a smiling Feng Wuhen quickly coming up to him.</p> 
 <p>“My brother Bai, I thought you shouldn't be here at this time?” greeted Feng Wuhen in a half-joking tone as he gave Bai Xiaofei a warm hug.</p> 
 <p>With such huge waves happening in Starnet, it was impossible for Feng Wuhen not to know of it, and he didn’t need to guess to know who started it – the only one who could do such a thing was none other than Bai Xiaofei. Therefore, Feng Wuhen thought Bai Xiaofei must be busy as a bee, and even if not, there was no reason for him to come here.</p> 
 <p>However, the reality was contrary to what he imagined. Not only did Bai Xiaofei come, but he also came at his busiest time.</p> 
 <p>“Why? I have to pick a time to see my brother now?” Bai Xiaofei chuckled, then looked at Feng Wuhen with a trace of hesitation that he didn’t try to hide.</p> 
 <p>“The Bai Xiaofei I know always says what he has to say. You can't be some puppet master posing as him, right?” Feng Wuhen wasn’t a simple person. He could see that Bai Xiaofei's expression was intentional, but he still asked aloud because he knew Bai Xiaofei was feeling him out, probing if he could accept some not-so-good things he was about to say.</p> 
 <p>Now, the answer was very clear.</p> 
 <p>“It’s always been me disguising as someone else. How could someone pretend to be me?” With a slight smile, Bai Xiaofei's face grew serious. “I met your brother, Feng Wuxin.”</p> 
 <p>The instant this was said, Feng Wuhen was stunned for a moment before there was a flash of sorrow and helplessness in his eyes. In the end, all emotions turned into a wry smile.</p> 
 <p>“I didn't expect the representative from the Ethereal Group would be him. No wonder no one came to me to ask about the situation,” said Feng Wuhen with a hint of sadness. Then, he looked at Bai Xiaofei with a bright light of wisdom in his eyes and a faint smile on his face. “You’re not here just to tell me about this, are you?”</p> 
 <p>Feng Wuhen might not be able to do it to the point of perfection like Bai Xiaofei regarding emotional control, but it was still no problem for him to manage his manners.</p> 
 <p>“I heard about the relationship between you two from other people, so during the negotiation, I made him leave by almost angering him to death,” said Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>Feng Wuhen was once again shocked for a few seconds, but the difference this time was that it showed on his face.</p> 
 <p><em>You pissed him off?! A freshman of Starnet drove the vice president of the Ethereal Group headquarters away out of anger?!</em> Although Feng Wuhen didn't say it aloud, this was exactly what his gawking face expressed.</p> 
 <p>“No need to be so surprised. After all, I needed a stepping stone.”</p> 
 <p>This again stunned Feng Wuhen.</p> 
 <p><em>What’s with your talking pace?! Did you especially come to test my heart?! Luckily my heart is good enough…</em> With what was going on in his mind, Feng Wuhen gulped.</p> 
 <p>“A stepping stone? To what?” Although it was already quite obvious, Feng Wuhen still asked, because he didn’t think he had anything to be desired by Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“To you,” Bai Xiaofei slowly stressed, confirming Feng Wuhen’s guess.</p> 
 <p>“Me? What do I have that interests you?” Question after question flooded into Feng Wuhen’s head.</p> 
 <p>“You! What I’m interested in is you, yourself! “</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei was truly astonishing when he opened his mouth to speak. For the fourth time, Feng Wuhen revealed a shocked expression. What Bai Xiaofei had just said was too much.</p> 
 <p>“What do you… want to do?” Feng Wuhen looked at Bai Xiaofei with hesitation like a little girl about to be bullied, all that was lacking was him covering his chest.</p> 
 <p>“The Ethereal Pavilion is no longer suitable for you, Brother Feng, so I think you should come and help me!”</p> 
 <p>That was straightforward enough, but Feng Wuhen was still on the road of being dumbstruck, going farther and farther…</p> 
 <p>“Help you?!” That was almost a roar that vented all the doubts in Feng Wuhen’s heart, and at the same time allowed him to gradually recover his wits. “Wait! Don't talk yet! “</p> 
 <p>Feng Wuhen learned his lesson this time, though. After recovering a little, he immediately stopped Bai Xiaofei from talking, or else he felt that he might just be kidnapped in this muddleheaded state.</p> 
 <p>Mentally combing through what Bai Xiaofei had said after meeting him from beginning to end, Feng Wuhen’s expression changed again and again, and finally, it still stopped at shock. It couldn’t be helped, this idea was a little too crazy!</p> 
 <p>“You… you want to establish your own merchant group?!” When Feng Wuhen said this, his voice was trembling, because the idea was too unbelievable.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Feng you’re so smart, you got the point right away!”</p> 
 <p>Oh well, now there was no choice but to believe it.</p> 
 <p>“You have the money?”</p> 
 <p>“Several tens of trillions, it should be enough for the start-up fund.”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s answer was indifferent. Feng Wuhen swallowed a few mouthfuls of saliva.</p> 
 <p><em>The heck!! Where did he get so much money?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Personnel?”</p> 
 <p>“If you agree, then there will be four.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Feng Wuhen gulped again.</p> 
 <p><em>Starting a merchant group with four people. Young man, I praise your courage!</em></p> 
 <p>“Then, your direction? Where do you plan to start and in what direction do you plan to develop?”</p> 
 <p>“I haven't decided yet because I have no experience, so this will depend on you business pros. As for the direction, it’s naturally to walk shoulder to shoulder with the nine big merchant groups,” spoke Bai Xiaofei as if setting up a hegemonic business was as simple as drinking water.</p> 
 <p>If it weren't that the one standing in front of him was Bai Xiaofei, Feng Wuhen would definitely think that the person talking to him was crazy.</p> 
 <p><em>This is not a fantasy, alright?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Don’t you think you’re thinking too simplistically? Do you know how deep the foundations of the nine big groups are? Moreover, the present market will not allow the emergence of a tenth. Even if there’s just a bud, the other nine will join hands to nip it off.” Feng Wuhen was experienced, he immediately grasped the key problem.</p> 
 <p>“Aren’t there many small merchant groups? They’re all doing well,” said Bai Xiaofei with a strange light in his eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Small groups are small, how can they…”</p> 
 <p>Feng Wuhen was trying to correct Bai Xiaofei's ‘incorrect’ idea, but as he was halfway through his lecture, he swallowed the rest of the contents. At the same time, his face showed pleasant surprise.</p> 
 <p>“Do you mean to scatter and develop separately, then integrate?!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei revealed a smile upon hearing this. He indeed didn’t choose the wrong person!</p> 
 <p>“So, Brother Feng, are you interested?” When he officially asked this question, Bai Xiaofei's eyes were full of expectation. This answer would decide many things!</p> 
 <p>For a moment, Feng Wuhen hesitated…</p> 
 <p><em>To be or not to be?</em></p>
