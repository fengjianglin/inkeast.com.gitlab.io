 <p>Chapter 681: Originated from The Ruins, Quality Promised!</p> 
 <p>“Nie Wei, don’t think that your ridiculous reputation can really scare us Jackdaw. If it weren’t that our head shows you some respect, I wouldn’t bother to tolerate your nonsense!”</p> 
 <p>The squad leader couldn’t keep his composure after Nie Wei’s retort. After all, his subordinates were present as well!</p> 
 <p>Also thanks to this, Bai Xiaofei found a chance to make an appearance.</p> 
 <p>“Deputy Head!” cried a small captain upon spotting Bai Xiaofei approaching.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the squad leader froze a little. Then, he turned around with an expression that had taken a 180-degree turn from when he had threatened Nie Wei. There were gaps even between people of the same rank. Qiu Feng could handle two of him with ease.</p> 
 <p>“So you know that <em>I</em> am the deputy head? It seemed like you were the boss of Jackdaw. Did we tell you before coming here that you can talk to Brother Nie like that?!” Bai Xiaofei icily scolded.</p> 
 <p>The squad leader immediately bowed his head.</p> 
 <p>With a cold snort, Bai Xiaofei walked to Nie Wei’s simple booth and extended his right hand.</p> 
 <p>“Qiu Feng, deputy head of the Jackdaw Mercenary Group. I’ve had the honor to hear about your great reputation.”</p> 
 <p>Looking at his amiable face, Nie Wei slightly relaxed and held out his hand to shake Bai Xiaofei’s hand before resuming his unshakable, nonchalant attitude.</p> 
 <p>Although there was no problem with Bai Xiaofei’s actions, there was still a suspicious point about him, which was caught by the squad leader.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Feng, why are you here alone?” asked the squad leader softly as he hesitantly looked at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“Why? Do I need to bring a big group of people when I go out like you? You’re not afraid to stain our Jackdaw’s reputation, are you?!” Bai Xiaofei sneered.</p> 
 <p>With this, he passed the test. The doubts of the squad leader were instantly dispelled after this lecture.</p> 
 <p>There were times that explanations wouldn’t work. People in different positions had different ways of perceiving things. The reason why Bai Xiaofei could fool most people is that he could adjust his mindset to the position he assumed as quickly as possible.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Nie, please wait a moment. We will continue our talk after I teach this group of reckless brats some manners.” Looking back, Bai Xiaofei’s expression was like heaven and earth from just one second ago, fully demonstrating the qualifications of a deputy head.</p> 
 <p>Taking the group of over twenty people to a corner, Bai Xiaofei started his ‘lecture.’</p> 
 <p>“How is the preparation you were instructed to do?” he asked coldly.</p> 
 <p>This question stunned the squad leader for a long time.</p> 
 <p>Seeing his reaction, Bai Xiaofei’s heart leaped. He was betting that Qiu Feng or Jackdaw had assigned a task to this squad leader. If there was, the next conversation would be very easy and his authenticity would not be doubted again.</p> 
 <p>But if that was not the case, then the bomb would explode.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t want to take risks, but he didn’t have time to go slowly either. Taking drastic measures was his only way!</p> 
 <p>The leader hesitated for a long time, and when Bai Xiaofei was ready to run, the guy slowly inched close to his ear.</p> 
 <p>“All prepared. We’re going in again this time. Those big monkeys won’t be a problem. Besides, I heard that the Puppet Master Alliance is going to take another path. Only the Martial Artist Alliance has not moved. As for those two strange organizations that have not revealed their identities, I have sent people to keep constant watch. Once there is any movement, I will report it to Brother Feng as soon as possible.”</p> 
 <p>The squad leader kept his volume to the minimum to the point that only Bai Xiaofei could hear. It seemed that he had only hesitated whether to discuss this matter in this situation.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaofei was inwardly astonished. He had thought that the Holy Snow Mountain could attract up to two or three major forces at most, but it turned out that he underestimated the allure of The Ruins.</p> 
 <p>And this was only the information that Jackdaw held. If some secretive people and latecomers arrived later, this mountain would not just be as simple as bustling.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei took a deep breath to keep the horror in his heart in check.</p> 
 <p>“It’s not only organizations comparable to ours that should be paid attention to. Those scattered people like Nie Wei should also be under surveillance. Even if they can’t be of use to us, at least make sure that they won’t become obstacles,” Bai Xiaofei instructed in a relaxed tone.</p> 
 <p>“Good, Brother Feng, I understand,” replied the leader of the First Squad.</p> 
 <p>“You guys go back first. I’m enough here. Using force is useless on people like Nie Wei.” Bai Xiaofei waved his hand, his tone laced with disappointment toward the squad leader’s earlier incompetent act.</p> 
 <p>Although he had never been a deputy head of a mercenary group, his acting was quite complete.</p> 
 <p>“That Nie Wei…” the squad leader hesitated, but Bai Xiaofei’s glare made him swallow the rest of his words.</p> 
 <p>“Since I’m here, I’ll make sure to bring it back. Or do you think you can really quietly steal from Nie Wei without damaging our reputation?”</p> 
 <p>The squad leader’s temper immediately flopped. He turned around and waved to his people. The group quickly disappeared into the crowded trading area.</p> 
 <p>After Bai Xiaofei was left alone, he heaved a long sigh of relief.</p> 
 <p>Initially, he only wanted to probe the situation of the Jackdaw Mercenary Group and pry out some useful information while he was at it, but he didn’t expect to get so many unexpected gains.</p> 
 <p>The most important thing was Nie Wei, who was still waiting for his ‘processing.’ Since he was targeted by the Jackdaw Mercenary Group, the thing in his hand must be the real deal, and a formidable one!</p> 
 <p>As for what it was, Bai Xiaofei had to ask.</p> 
 <p>“You are not Qiu Feng, are you?”</p> 
 <p>However, as soon as Bai Xiaofei came back, Nie Wei shocked him before he could say anything.</p> 
 <p>“Then who else can I be?” Bai Xiaofei smiled wryly and didn’t admit it but was frightened inside.</p> 
 <p><em>It can’t be? Even that squad leader couldn’t tell, but an outsider can see through me?! If this is true, that squad leader might as well kill himself!</em></p> 
 <p>“It doesn’t matter to me who you are. Five million Amethyst Coins and this thing is yours,” said Nie Wei as he pointed at the flat round ‘stone’ in front of him.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei had seen his fair share of good things, but he failed to see what was special about this one.</p> 
 <p>“Inject your energy into it and you’ll immediately know its worth.” Seeing Bai Xiaofei’s hesitation, Nie Way slowly said like a devil tempting its prey to their fall…</p>
