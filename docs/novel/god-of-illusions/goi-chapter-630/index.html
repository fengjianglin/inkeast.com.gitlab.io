 <p>Chapter 630: The Truth?</p> 
 <p>At An Bang Ting’s hospitality, a group of people with different ideas sat together for a meal again, except Liu Rushi and his disciple, who pulled out an excuse to leave. An Bang Ting did not keep them.</p> 
 <p>Even after dinner was finished, An Bang Ting had never mentioned them once. Most of the conversation was about An Yue, An Ye, and An Feng. An Yue was commented on the most, which made him secretly delighted for a long time.</p> 
 <p>“Liuli, you guys go back with An Yue first. Don’t forget to remind A’Tao to train according to schedule. A grade-seven pill can only improve quantity, not quality. If he doesn’t lay a good foundation now, the Violet Heartbarrier-Breaker Pill will only become a burden,” Bai Xiaofei said seriously.</p> 
 <p>What he got wasn’t Leng Liuli’s reassuring reply, but Leng Liuying’s impatient answer.</p> 
 <p>“We know, you have said this several times. Even if Lil’ A’Tao isn’t bothered, I am. Sisters, let’s go, just ignore him.”</p> 
 <p>Seeing the group quickly escape his line of sight, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help laughing. <em>Am I really so annoying? That’s no way…</em> He shook his head.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, Zheng Gong and Zhi Daoyuan had also taken their disciples and left, leaving only Bai Xiaofei and An Bang Ting.</p> 
 <p>“You had something on your mind when you first arrived. If I don’t guess wrong, it has to do with me.” An Bang Ting took the initiative to speak. Since there were only the two of them present, he chose to be straightforward.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei didn’t expect this directness. He thought it’d take some effort to lead to the topic he wanted, now it didn’t seem so troublesome.</p> 
 <p>“Indeed, I have a lot of doubts.” Bai Xiaofei nodded.</p> 
 <p>An Bang Ting instantly smiled. It was a smile that Bai Xiaofei couldn’t read.</p> 
 <p><em>What does this mean? Does he know what my doubts are? Is everyone in the outside world so smart?!</em></p> 
 <p>It was unknown if other people were smart, but An Bang Ting definitely didn’t disappoint. At least, he accurately guessed Bai Xiaofei’s doubts!</p> 
 <p>“Come with me.” Taking a deep breath, An Bang Ting stood up and led the way.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei followed despite his confusion. One’s strength fed their guts. Since the Spiritualization Art was still usable, Bai Xiaofei didn’t believe that there was a person in this Tranquil Kingdom who could beat him in his Spiritualization state.</p> 
 <p>After passing one courtyard after another, An Bang Ting stopped.</p> 
 <p>“This is it. Everything you want to ask, the answers are in here,” An Bang Ting took out a token. A red light flashed and the originally normal yard trembled. Moments later, the huge stone in the middle of the rockery moved, slowly revealing an entrance.</p> 
 <p>“Come in.”</p> 
 <p>An Bang Ting took the lead and entered. The dark secret path instantly lit up. Bai Xiaofei followed him through a long tunnel as the temperature became lower and lower.</p> 
 <p>When An Bang Ting stopped, they were in a stone room. On the huge ice bed in the center that emitted a biting cold, a woman dressed in palace attire lay quietly.</p> 
 <p>An Bang Ting slowly walked to the bed. The token at his waist gave off a red glow that protected him from the cold.</p> 
 <p>“She is Consort Fei, the most beloved woman of my life. Just two months ago, she suddenly fell ill. None of the imperial physicians and famous doctors summoned to the palace by me could tell what disease it is. In my rage, I killed them all!” An Bang Ting’s face suddenly became cruel, perfectly reproducing his mentality at that time.</p> 
 <p>Maybe this was what they meant by ‘disregarding everything for a beauty.’</p> 
 <p>He, a prestigious emperor who used half of his life to build up a good image, didn’t even consider the consequences of such a thing.</p> 
 <p>“Then, why did you say it is you who’s sick?” Bai Xiaofei frowned.</p> 
 <p>“After killing those doctors, I realized that it was a wrongful act that would attract a lot of condemnation. I didn’t want her to bear it, so I told the world that I killed those doctors because they couldn’t cure me,” said An Bang Ting as if it was a trivial matter.</p> 
 <p>It seemed that even until now, he didn’t think it was wrong to do so. The most absurd thing was that Bai Xiaofei didn’t think there was anything wrong about it either, because he would probably do the same.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, he actually sympathized with the guy…</p> 
 <p>“Coincidentally, Cao Hong and Xu Zhang came back from their travels at that time. When they left, they were only Mastery Rank, but when they returned, they were already Master Rank. In my desperation, I sought them out. They told me that they could treat her! It was also because they were sent out by me to travel that I blindly believed them. “</p> 
 <p>There was a trace of pleasant surprise in An Bang Ting’s voice, but it soon turned into madness.</p> 
 <p>“They told me that to cure her, I needed a pill called the Blood Pill. Refining it not only required many precious medicinal materials but also human blood quintessence!”</p> 
 <p>A chill ran down Bai Xiaofei’s back. An Bang Ting had told him that those hundreds of people lost their lives during the refining of the pill, but he really hadn’t the courage to even think that they were <em>part</em> of the materials…</p> 
 <p><em>How can that kind of pill really save people?!</em></p> 
 <p>“The pill was refined, but she did not wake up after using it. It was only then that I realized I was tricked. They did it just to improve their own strength during the refining process. When I reacted, they had already started their escape, but they couldn’t outrun the royal guards in the end. I threw them in jail.”</p> 
 <p>An Bang Ting slowly exhaled. His mood had calmed and guilt took over his face.</p> 
 <p>“The ice bed can only delay her death. Soon, she will leave forever. I don’t want her to go alone, so I intend to accompany her, but I must stabilize Tranquil before that. I owe my people hundreds of lives. I have betrayed their expectations, but I can’t just leave them.”</p> 
 <p>His guilt turned into repentance as An Bang Ting made his final statement.</p> 
 <p>“At the enthronement, I will personally behead those two demons and end my life as a sacrifice for the new beginning of Tranquil!”</p> 
 <p>An Bang Ting slowly looked up at Bai Xiaofei with determination in his eyes.</p> 
 <p>Once again, Bai Xiaofei was persuaded. An Bang Ting’s story was impeccable!</p>
