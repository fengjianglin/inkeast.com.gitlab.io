 <p>Chapter 794: Women Who Cannot be Provoked!</p> 
 <p>“Permanence!”</p> 
 <p>Without hesitation, Hu Xian’er launched her ultimate skill the moment Bai Xiaofei approached. The time flow in the area instantly slowed down and so did his movement.</p> 
 <p>However, this slowness was relative. The demonized Bai Xiaofei did not become stock-still like the others. His original speed was so terrifying that he only became as slow as a normal person. In other words, his speed eliminated the intended effect of Permanence, which was to freeze the opponent, to a certain extent!</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Hu Xian’er frowned. However, there was no delay in her action.</p> 
 <p>“Fox Flash!”</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei at the speed of a normal person naturally could not compare with Hu Xian’er. She appeared behind him in a flicker and her fox claw pressed on his shoulder. Without any mercy, the claw pierced his flesh and crushed the bones within.</p> 
 <p>With this successful blow, Permanence also reached its time limit. Hu Xian’er quickly retreated, while Bai Xiaofei roared in pain and set her as his first target. However, before he could act on it, Lin Li arrived.</p> 
 <p>“Chaotic Stars – A Thousand Sparkles!”</p> 
 <p>Thousand Star appeared and turned into energy threads that bound Bai Xiaofei up tightly. However, their radiance dimmed rapidly after coming into contact with his body. Although Bai Xiaofei had lost his rationality, the operation of the Endless State had nothing to do with his consciousness.</p> 
 <p>“Three seconds at most!” Lin Li informed.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Hu Xian’er immediately rushed forward and used her claw to sever Bai Xiaofei’s hand and foot tendons.</p> 
 <p>The audience who were watching from a distance collectively gasped. <em>Wow damn! Now I know why Brother Bai refuses to mess with these two no matter what!</em></p> 
 <p>Three seconds was enough for Hu Xian’er to cripple Bai Xiaofei but was not long. She wanted to dislocate all of his joints, but the energy of Thousand Star had been absorbed cleanly by the Endless State. Bai Xiaofei, who regained his freedom, instinctively wanted to fight back. However, he couldn’t muster any strength on all his limbs and collapsed helplessly.</p> 
 <p>However, this state did not last long as his already outrageous recovery speed was also enhanced! Before Hu Xian’er could lay hands on him again, Bai Xiaofei’s right arm had recovered and made a fist to meet her punch.</p> 
 <p>“Revival!” At the critical moment, Luo Han acted.</p> 
 <p>However, the target of her skill was not Hu Xian’er, but Bai Xiaofei! The ability was a great healing skill when used well, but when used even better, it could also be a control skill!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s right hand that had just recovered was immediately forced back to the disabled state by Revival. As the two fists were colliding, Hu Xian’er immediately went from being at a disadvantage to gaining the upper hand and conveniently dislocated his wrist.</p> 
 <p>“Buy me time!” shouted Lin Li as she floated into the air. The elements in the area began to frantically gather around her. At the same time, Thousand Star had returned and was shaping a dazzling crystal sword in front of her.</p> 
 <p>While Lin Li was preparing, Luo Han and Hu Xian’er cooperated perfectly against Bai Xiaofei, who could only roar while being beaten…</p> 
 <p>Looking at Bai Xiaofei being restrained by the three girls, the audience heaved a sigh of relief. However, a new problem was brought up. How would they wake Bai Xiaofei up from his madness?</p> 
 <p>All the people present were great fighters while the only healer, Luo Han, was not an expert in the mental and spiritual aspects. The three girls were obviously draining their energy, which had a finite duration no matter how strong they were. What would they do when they ran out of energy?!</p> 
 <p>Although this problem was obvious, the three had no time to consider it. Their priority was to completely disable Bai Xiaofei first!</p> 
 <p>“Dodge!” Lin Li had finally accumulated enough energy. By this point, all the elements within a one-kilometer radius had been extracted and the light that flowed along Thousand Star, which was in the shape of a longsword, had reached the point where it was impossible to look at.</p> 
 <p>“Meteor Sword!”</p> 
 <p>With a shout from Lin Li, the longsword pierced Bai Xiaofei’s body.</p> 
 <p>Although Bai Xiaofei was possessed, the power the sword radiated still drew an instinctive fear in his heart. However, the ultra-speed did not allow him to escape…</p> 
 <p>As the sword penetrated his body, although not a fatal spot, Bai Xiaofei roared in utter pain. Lin Li’s attack obviously exceeded the limit of what the Endless State could absorb. Violent elemental energy scattered from Thousand Star and started to destroy his body.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei’s self-healing and devouring ability of the Endless State was activated to resist this destructive energy, but in any case, Lin Li’s goal had been achieved. During this process, he would not be able to move.</p> 
 <p>Successfully and completely restraining Bai Xiaofei, the problem that Fang Ye’s group was thinking about was then placed in front of the three girls. The current hideous-looking Bai Xiaofei did not recognize them at all.</p> 
 <p><em>How do we wake him up?</em></p> 
 <p>“Can you let me try?” a soft voice rang out just as the three girls were at a loss.</p> 
 <p>Everyone was stunned. It was the Paraselene girl from the auction!</p> 
 <p>The shill-bidding group who won her were beaten and fled, so she was rescued. No one had the mind to pay attention to her after that, but she somehow learned the purpose of Bai Xiaofei’s operation and was grateful to him.</p> 
 <p>What she could not understand was that she was only trying to help, but the three girls in front of her seemed to emit… hostility?</p> 
 <p>“You can wake him up?” Hu Xian’er had her guard up against the Paraselene stunner, but she had no way to solve the problem, so she yielded, knowing that if it was fated to be, she would not be able to stop it even if she wanted to.</p> 
 <p>“I can enter other people’s consciousness. Although I can’t guarantee success, I want to do my part,” said the Paraselene with pure sincerity.</p> 
 <p>Hu Xian’er and Lin Li exchanged glances, and then made way for her.</p> 
 <p>Seeing their reaction, Luo Han followed. Even the two ‘legitimate wives’ did not have a problem, what could she say?</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the Paraselene girl carefully approached Bai Xiaofei. Despite having lost the ability to act, the aura he emanated alone was enough to suffocate her. Trying to calm herself down, she forcefully resisted the oppressive feeling and placed her hand on his forehead…</p>
