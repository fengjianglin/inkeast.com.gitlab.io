 <p><span style>“The third generation is the balanced generation!” Lei Shan deepened his voice as he finally spoke what Bai Xiaofei anticipated extremely, and he almost caused Bai Xiaofei to be stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Balanced?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right, balanced. Under the circumstances of ensuring that the ability of the first puppet is perfectly brought out, the remaining choice of puppets were those that were capable of allowing one to deal with various enemies and situations in battle so as to perfect one’s own survivability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The choices of the balanced generation are different from the mixed choices of the first generation and carries an extremely terrifying limiting effect towards the Extreme second generation at the same time, and it’s the method that most people choose now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Moreover, it’s not a problem for a normal puppet master to grow to the Master Rank, and the limit of the Master Rank is to possess five puppets. These five puppets are sufficient to supplement each other and allow you to become an outstanding puppet master.” Lei Shan’s attitude was extremely obvious as he spoke, and he wanted Bai Xiaofei to choose this path and not the extreme path Bai Xiaofei originally planned to take.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaofei fell into deep thought for a while because it was the first time that his resolution was shaken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to know why everyone doesn’t look favorably upon the Illusion Stream.” After staying silent for a long time, Bai Xiaofei squeezed out a question, and it was a question that he was unable to wrap his head around no matter how he wracked his brains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, as soon as he finished speaking, everyone besides Lin Li revealed an expression that said ‘you’re too young’, and it was even to the extent that Xu Chen was no exception as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think your fellow student can answer this question of yours.” Lei Shan looked at Xu Chen as he spoke, causing Xu Chen to be slightly stunned as a trace of panic from being paid attention to appear on her valiant face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be… because….” Xu Chen was unable to calm herself after being suddenly pointed out by Lei Shan, and this continued until Xue Ying lightly placed her hand on Xu Chen’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t panic, take it slow.” Xue Ying revealed a warm smile and successfully calmed Xu Chen down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because the effect of the Illusion Stream weakens in the later stages. Normal illusions mostly affect the mind of puppet masters, but the solidification of the soul is something every puppet master must learn. So along with their increase in strength, the mind of a puppet master became more and more stable and solid, so it would be extremely difficult for the Illusion Stream to affect those of the same rank.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as she finished speaking, all three of the seniors in the room nodded and displayed their agreement. Even though this was the Savage Class, but students of the class still possessed such basic knowledge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Bai Xiaofei was an exception….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I should give up just because it might be weakened?” Bai Xiaofei revealed a surprised expression as he originally thought it would be an extraordinary reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t this enough? Could it be that you want to die?” Feng Guangshi interjected and his exaggerated voice carried a trace of warning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it’s merely this reason, then I won’t give up on the Illusion Stream. According to what all of you have said, there are very few people in the Illusion Stream now, right? If the resolution of I who have always liked the Illusion Stream is shaken, then wouldn’t there be no one in the Illusion Stream in the future?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as these words were spoken, Lei Shan instantly revealed a shocked expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d heard these words before, and it was even spoken from someone that was fairly close to him. But, it didn’t end well for that person….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s good to have ideals. But, Little Fellow, you can’t waste your advantage! Mimicry Stream puppets are rare to come by in a hundred years. Do you know how many people will fight for you once you walk out of Starnet Academy?” Lei Shan was worked up. Perhaps it was because Bai Xiaofei was extremely alike a person he knew well, and he didn’t want Bai Xiaofei to walk down her path, or perhaps it was really like he had said, and he didn’t want a seeding that might become a legend to take the wrong path….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa, you’re overthinking things. I, Bai Xiaofei, have never thought of relying on anyone, and I won’t become a blade in the hands of another. I only want freedom, and I won’t do a single thing that won’t allow me this freedom.” Bai Xiaofei’s attitude was exceptionally firm, and his persistence for over 10 years was vividly displayed by him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, as far as Lei Shan was concerned, this persistence was only immaturity from having not experienced enough….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, you….” Fei Guangshi stretched pointed out his finger at Bai Xiaofei yet before he could flare up, he was directly driven back by Lei Shan with a single glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Fellow, don’t get agitated.” When he noticed that normal methods were unable to convince Bai Xiaofei, Lei Shan’s tone instantly turned around as he changed to a different tactic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After all, you only have a single puppet now, and there’s still a very long time, so you might change your mind when the time comes. If you have anything you don’t understand during this period or perhaps have some new thoughts, you can come look for me at any time. My door is always open to you.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The battle was concluded with a single sentence. Both Fei Guangshi and Xue Ying were deeply aware of the weight of these words, and Fei Guangshi who wanted to teach Bai Xiaofei a lesson earlier instantly became slightly dejected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Grandpa. Mmm…. Grandpa sounds better, Grandpa Lei sounds too girly.” Bai Xiaofei chucked, and he finally revealed his true nature with these words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“HAHA! As long as you like it. I’m tired of listening to all those various methods of address and being called grandpa is rather comfortable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the most difficult to find someone that shared the same rotten tastes in life, and it was even with a big boss….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa, are we considered to be friends now?” Bai Xiaofei raised his brows at Lei Shan as he spoke a sentence that almost caused everyone else to be choked to death on the spot. Xue Ying even stared her eyes wide open at Bai Xiaofei, and her expression seemed as if she wanted to strangle him to death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Lei Shan himself was slightly stunned, but after being stunned for half a second, Lei Shan suddenly started roaring with laughter as he replied, whereas, Bai Xiaofei rolled up his sleeves and narrated his ‘heroic deeds’ once more, and Lei Shan who sat there roared with laughter from time to time and clapped his hands joyfully for Bai Xiaofei’s resourcefulness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can help you deal with this matter. But, I’m unable to influence the Bounty Rankings that you spoke of. What I can do is help you change the method. What do you think?” After pondering for a moment, Lei Shan looked at Bai Xiaofei with a slightly unpredictable smile, and he gave Bai Xiaofei uncertainty and hope at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course. At any rate, it’s much better than being beaten up.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>He was easily content, and it came from Bai Xiaofei’s own confidence towards himself and his light-hearted nature.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you going to ask me what method it is?” He originally intended to keep Bai Xiaofei in suspense but Lei Shan threw himself into the trap instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is there to ask? I believe Grandpa’s method is the most suitable. After all, you’re already so old, and if you’re unable to think of a good method, then you would be unworthy of that white hair that covers your head.” Bai Xiaofei’s words were shocking to the extreme, and he who had released his nature seemed as if he didn’t know what fear was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha!! Alright, I’ll wait and see. You better not disappoint me when the time comes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stinking kid, hmm…. It feels better to call you like this. Just be frank. You don’t have to beat around the bush with me because I’ve experienced little tricks like yours on numerous occasions.” Lei Shan returned similar words to what Bai Xiaofei said to him earlier, and his attitude had already clearly displayed everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa, since you said that, then I’ll be frank.”</span></p>
