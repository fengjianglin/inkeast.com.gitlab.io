 <p>Chapter 305: Old Man Illusionary!</p> 
 <p>“Brother Yun, I'm leaving with Senior Sima to run some errands and won't be back tonight. If anyone is looking for me, just tell them I’m very busy and have no time to deal with them. If there are any problems, let Brother Feng and Brother Lu handle them,” said Bai Xiaofei to Yun Sheng who he bumped into as he walked out with Sima Ye.</p> 
 <p>At the moment, Yun Sheng was probably the only idle person in the whole Demon of Illusions because he was really of little help. Despite this, Bai Xiaofei still gave him the nominal role of patrol captain.</p> 
 <p>And he was the only one in the patrol squad…</p> 
 <p>“You’re going out when it’s getting dark? That’s so not like you! Are you going to do something bad?!”</p> 
 <p>Yun Sheng questioned with an odd face, rendering Bai Xiaofei embarrassed.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Yun, don't tell me you don't know Senior Brother Sima.” Bai Xiaofei leaned to the side, while Yun Sheng didn’t take his words to heart and casually craned his head over to see.</p> 
 <p>“Senior Sima who? Why would I know him… What the heck! Sima Ye?!” Jolted awake in an instant, Yun Sheng felt as if he had seen a ghost.</p> 
 <p><em>What the hell? Didn’t they say this fellow rarely goes out? How does Xiaofei know him?!</em></p> 
 <p><em>This is not a guy to provoke!</em></p> 
 <p>Thinking this, Yun Sheng looked at Bai Xiaofei with a hint of worry. He knew it wasn’t necessarily a good thing to be involved with the likes of Sima Ye.</p> 
 <p>In Starnet, Sima Ye had a nickname – the bearer of bad luck. To find people to duel with him, he had done his fair share of scheming and tricking others, and the final result was pretty much one-sided abuse in his favor. The other nine in the top ten on the Command Ranking had all been tormented this way, but there was nothing they could do, this fellow was too strong in the Illusionary Sandboard.</p> 
 <p>“It's okay, we’re just having a friendly discussion. I'll be back by tomorrow afternoon at the latest.” Smiling slightly, Bai Xiaofei made a ‘rest assured’ expression before heading out with Sima Ye.</p> 
 <p>Behind, Yun Sheng watched Bai Xiaofei, as he stood there sighing for a long time. However, deep down somewhere, he actually held a faint expectation.</p> 
 <p><em>If Bai Xiaofei can beat Sima Ye, it would be a huge wave of popularity for him!</em></p> 
 <p>Although Bai Xiaofei didn’t really lack popularity right now…</p> 
 <p>The Illusionary Sandboard was stored in the Gods Amongst Men as it was made by the former head of the faculty in conjunction with a large group of teachers. Each entry required a fee of 100 Amethyst Coins, so its existence had made a lot of money for the Gods Amongst Men.</p> 
 <p>Because many people were very curious about what it was, plus the point reward for making the top 100 was considerable, it never lacked challengers. When Bai Xiaofei and Sima Ye arrived, there were 89 people waiting outside.</p> 
 <p>Only one person could enter at a time, which was probably the most stupid thing about the Illusionary Sandboard.</p> 
 <p>“There are people still queuing, why don't we take a rain check? I promise I won't hide. I'm a man of honor!” Bai Xiaofei earnestly promised, but Sima Ye simply ignored it.</p> 
 <p><em>If you can claim you have credibility, this world would have no more thick-skinned people!</em></p> 
 <p>“You don't have to wait,” said Sima Ye softly as he then walked to the entrance of the Illusionary Sandboard. Upon his appearance, the students waiting first revealed a shocked expression, then everyone respectfully stood neatly in a row.</p> 
 <p>“Good afternoon, Senior!”</p> 
 <p>This wasn’t flattery, it was awe. And Sima Ye seemed to be used to this kind of awe. Having no intention to react to the students, he looked up at the big screen at the entrance where everyone could watch how the challenger was faring. At the moment, the person on the screen was leading a team of 200 people to combat the opponent, but the situation didn’t look good.</p> 
 <p>“He will be out in three minutes at most. I’ve brought someone to rush up the ranking. You guys don’t mind giving up a seat, do you?” Sima Ye looked at his junior students with a cold expression like he’d erupt into a storm at any time.</p> 
 <p>“Not at all! Not at all!”</p> 
 <p>“Yes, yes, that’s right! It’s our honor to see the person you bring rushing up the ranking! We’re more than happy!”</p> 
 <p>As words of agreement resounded one after another, Bai Xiaofei could only gawk.</p> 
 <p><em>The heck! This fellow is really something!</em></p> 
 <p>As Bai Xiaofei kept cursing inside, less than three minutes later, the challenger from earlier exited sadly, looking crestfallen. Yet the moment he saw Sima Ye, the surprise chased away all other emotions.</p> 
 <p>“Senior!”</p> 
 <p>Sima Ye ignored as usual and turned to look at Bai Xiaofei.</p> 
 <p>“You can enter. There will be explanations of the specific rules inside. Don't let me down.” Sima Ye gazed coldly at Bai Xiaofei, his mouth slightly curved as excitement and expectation were written on his bizarre-looking face.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaofei sighed. It seemed like he couldn’t dodge this knife after all…</p> 
 <p>Despite how he reacted though, Bai Xiaofei wasn’t so against it in his heart. He had always thought of the Illusionary Sandboard as a must to have a try, just that he hadn’t expected it to be so early, and moreover, that he was forced to.</p> 
 <p><em>Forget it, let’s just consider it ahead of schedule! It doesn’t affect anything anyway!</em></p> 
 <p>With this thought, Bai Xiaofei adjusted his mood and took a deep breath, then strode towards the Illusionary Sandboard.</p> 
 <p>“Welcome, student of Starnet.”</p> 
 <p>After entering the gate of the Illusionary Sandboard, Bai Xiaofei found himself in a dark space. Just as he was wondering where he was, an old voice spoke. At the same time, numerous brilliant light spots converged in mid-air, turning into a white-bearded grandfather holding a cane.</p> 
 <p>“Grandpa, you are…?”</p> 
 <p>“I am the guardian of the Illusionary Sandboard, and they all call me Old Man Illusionary,” replied the old man, to which Bai Xiaofei smiled politely.</p> 
 <p>“Old Man Illusionary doesn’t sound very good, I’ll just call you grandpa.” Bai Xiaofei laughed. Old Man Illusionary also laughed along.</p> 
 <p>“As long as you want to, you can call me whatever you want, it’s but a title.” The old man then waved the cane in his hand, and a scroll full of names began to unfold in front of him. “Child who is here for the first time, state your name.”</p> 
 <p>As the old voice rang with a sense of ceremony, Bai Xiaofei couldn’t help but grow solemn as well.</p> 
 <p>“Bai Xiaofei.” Once the name was said, it was added to the scroll in front of the old man. With a content smile, the old man folded the scroll.</p> 
 <p>“Polite child, do you require me to explain the rules of the Illusionary Sandboard for you?” The old man’s face was full of kindness as he looked down and asked Bai Xiaofei. This old man and Bai Xiaofei's master, who he couldn’t see even on a blue moon, were really two extremes.</p> 
 <p>“There’s no rush. Before that, I have a question for you, grandpa.” With a hint of curiosity in his eyes, Bai Xiaofei stared at the old man seriously.</p> 
 <p>“Ask away. As long as I know, I will answer,” the old man whispered softly. He looked like the type who never refused people.</p> 
 <p>“Are you an illusion?”</p> 
 <p>When the question was asked, Old Man Illusionary froze in astonishment.</p>
