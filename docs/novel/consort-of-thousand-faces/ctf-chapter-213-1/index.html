 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>Su Xi-er looked at his lips and said, “If that’s the case, then this servant is not curious anymore.” She then moved to the other side of the horse carriage, watching the crowd in the streets below through the gap between the window’s curtains.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s face darkened. <em>What is there to see on the streets, some handsome men?&nbsp;</em>He couldn’t help but follow her gaze at the thought of it.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>What he saw was Su Xi-er staring at a man wearing a blue veil and robes!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The horse carriage soon passed, and the man in blue disappeared from their sight. Su Xi-er, however, didn’t let her guard down. <em>It’s too much of a coincidence for me to see that man here of all places. My intuition has never been wrong, this man isn’t simple. And if I’ve guessed correctly...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just as she became lost in thought, Pei Qianhao’s low rumble suddenly appeared in her ears. “A big man wearing a blue veil. Is it because he is ugly, or because he has some dark secret that he needs to hide his face?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er turned around and looked at him. “Prince Hao, you are talking so much today. What do you think this servant was looking at though? I was just looking at the streets. What man were you talking about?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Wasn’t she looking at the man in blue?&nbsp;</em>Pei Qianhao looked at her and found that her gaze was clear. <em>Did I make a mistake?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, why didn’t this servant see the man in blue that you were just talking about? This servant just saw a shop selling sugar people<span id="footnote-ref-cc56"><a href="#footnote-cc56">[1]</a></span>.” Su Xi-er purposely lied, knowing that if she acknowledged Pei Qianhao’s statement, he would definitely not let the man in blue go.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She realised that every time she focused on another man, Pei Qianhao would… <em>This feeling, he...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Confusion entered Su Xi-er’s eyes. <em>Someone as arrogant as him would normally never fall for anyone. However, he’s already abandoned any sense of a normal servant-master relationship.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er was suddenly filled with the desire to test him. <em>If he really feels that way, then how should I handle it? Can I even trust someone in this lifetime, much less a man?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Pei Qianhao saw Su Xi-er’s expression, his eyes also became darker. He felt that something wasn’t right, but couldn’t tell what.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, what kind of woman do you like?” Su Xi-er asked directly. <em>Some things need to be said directly.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Like?” Pei Qianhao looked at her up and down. “This Prince likes beauties.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Everyone knows that.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er shook her head and looked at him carefully. “Prince Hao, you aren’t someone who only values beauty. What I mean is someone who you love. A person that you can engrave in your heart and never forget in this lifetime. Someone who makes you think only about them when you see them.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Someone who I can never forget? Someone who makes me think only about them when I see them? Someone who means the world to me, but causes the world to lose its radiance when they’re gone?” His voice was deep and calm, but he completely understood her meaning, and had even provided an explanation of love.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s body stiffened upon hearing this, her expression freezing. <em>That’s right, it’s precisely that kind of feeling. But how could a man like him experience such a feeling?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>However, it’s impossible for him to say such words unless he’s experienced such feelings before.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao suddenly chuckled. “The only person like that was this Prince’s biological mother, but she passed away a long time ago.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She hadn’t expected that her question would make him think of his mother. <em>This… can I still continue the conversation?</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s gaze changed a bit. <em>If Su Xi-er suddenly disappeared, would I feel that the world had lost its radiance?&nbsp;</em>When he thought of this, his eyes became even deeper.</p>
