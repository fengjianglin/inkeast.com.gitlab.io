 <p style="margin-left: 20px;"><em>Ji Yunshu was an outstanding anthropologist who was transmigrated into the body of a mistreated young girl. To survive in her new circumstances, she could only rely on her wits and the knowledge she had accumulated in her...</em></p>

<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>When she reached the doorstep, Su Xi-er advised her, “Lower your head. Don’t let Prince Hao see your face.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shui Yinglian nodded. Her heart pounded increasingly harder as her footsteps became heavy.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er extinguished the fire under the stove and sat on the wooden stool, gazing at the night scenery in the courtyard through the window.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The bright moonlight shone on Su Xi-er’s face. Coupled with a light yellow dress, she was like a beautiful illusion. If there had been anyone around, they would definitely have been stunned by this unforgettable sight.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er raised the corner of her lips. <em>Pei Qianhao, I wonder if you will like the pleasant surprise I sent you? Shameless man.&nbsp;</em>When she recalled what he had done to her, her expression became ghastly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shui Yinglian carried the basin of hot water as she walked to Pei Qianhao’s room. After taking a deep breath, she pushed open the door to enter.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A deep and low voice sounded, enabling her to imagine the way those thin lips were moving. <em>Even his voice is so enchanting.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Carry the water in and put away the dishes on the table.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shui Yinglian didn’t dare to make a sound, fearing that he would recognise her voice. She lowered her head as she walked into the inner chamber step by step.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As she slowly raised her head, she saw Prince Hao...undressing!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The upper garment was hanging on Pei Qianhao’s shoulders, his powerful figure causing Shui Yinglian to stare at him in rapture.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Place the wooden basin down and go out.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing that Prince Hao was still going to continue removing his clothes, Shui Yinglian gulped nervously. She already heard the displeasure in his voice.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She lowered her head and placed the wooden basin to the side, a handkerchief hanging from the side of it.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As the night breeze blew, the body fragrance of the woman wafted into Pei Qianhao’s nose, causing his eyebrows to furrow as his expression became inexplicable.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He lifted his clothes back up and wore them properly before turning around to face the woman before him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Although he didn’t utter a single word, Shui Yinglian felt a strong sense of intimidation.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You are not her.” The words were spoken with a deep intonation, a confident tone, and a threatening oppression.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shui Yinglian felt that this man was very dangerous, even more so than he had been earlier that day!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You wore the same clothes and used the same hairstyle as her.” Pei Qianhao narrowed his eyes slightly. <em>It’s just that...the smell is different.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shui Yinglian didn’t dare to raise her head, trembling uncontrollably as she laid prostrated on the ground. “Please forgive me, Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao snorted coldly. “Kneel in the courtyard and carry the water basin on your head for a night. If you take it down, your life will be gone tomorrow.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shui Yinglian was fearful to the point that she became speechless and froze on the spot.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Scram.” The deep and low voice sounded again. Shui Yinglian’s whole body trembled as she immediately rose to leave.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao stood up and walked outside the room. <em>Based on the fact that they have even swapped clothing, this must be her idea. Otherwise, I don’t believe that there is someone in this world who could have forced her to go along with such a thing.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When he arrived at the courtyard, Pei Qianhao briefly swept his gaze across the woman holding up a water basin.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The expression in his eyes was like a sword coated in ice, causing Shui Yinglian to feel like freezing blades had pierced through all her body.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She recalled the day she had first met Prince Hao. She had pointed her finger at him and announced, <em>“Dad, I want to marry this man.”</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At that time, she didn’t know that the person in question was the illustrious Prince Hao. Only after her father chided her did she find out about his identity.</p>
