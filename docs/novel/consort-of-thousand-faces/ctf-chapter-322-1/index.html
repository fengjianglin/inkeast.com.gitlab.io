 <p>Tan Ge had seen the Lan Script before. <em>I’ve tried to practice it in the past, but it was so difficult that I gave up. However, Su Xi-er is able to imitate it so well that I can’t tell the difference from the original.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I totally admit my thorough defeat. What kind of man wouldn’t like someone like this; a woman with both beauty and brains? It’s no surprise that Prince Hao likes her. How can I compete with Su Xi-er?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>The so-called ‘Tan Residence’s hope’? What a ridiculous joke.&nbsp;</em>Tan Ge’s gaze was revealed her admiration for Su Xi-er as she gave a self-deprecating chuckle. “I have lost. I feel the same kind of regret as Grand Tutor Kong; your talents have been buried for so long.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yet, right at this moment, a eunuch from the Imperial Library entered. “Grand Tutor Kong, Commandery Prince Xie has arrived, and is waiting for you in the main hall.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Grand Tutor Kong replied with an affirmative before turning to look at Su Xi-er and Tan Ge. “The two of you, follow me to the main hall.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er and Tan Ge immediately followed. Tan Ge knew that she might need to return to the Tan Residence once again. <em>At that time, dad will definitely despise me further, and even allow my younger sister to seize my room again.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Yun was waiting in the main hall, standing ramrod straight until he saw Grand Tutor Kong and gently greeted, “You have worked hard, Grand Tutor Kong.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Grand Tutor Kong bowed in response. “This humble official pays his respects to Commandery Prince Xie. It’s just that the Imperial Library can only pick one court lady. Su Xi-er has won the match, so the Young Miss Tan can only…” At this moment, Grand Tutor Kong stopped and looked up at Commandery Prince Xie.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Yun looked at Su Xi-er. “I didn’t know that a maidservant from the Palace Side Quarters could be so talented. To think that the eldest official daughter of the Tan Residence, a family of scholars, would lose against you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er bowed to pay her respects and slowly replied, “It was merely luck that this servant won. The Young Miss Tan is very talented, and this servant is impressed by her.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Oh?” Xie Yun’s tone became higher as he took a few steps forward, giving Su Xi-er a once over. “You just said that Young Miss Tan is talented, but she lost to you. Doesn’t that mean that you’re even more talented than her?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant hopes that you won’t continue to split hairs and harp on something meaningless like this, Commandery Prince Xie.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Grand Tutor Kong and Tan Ge were both stunned. <em>Commandery Prince Xie has significant military influence, and has stretched his hand into court politics in recent times. His authority is similar to Prince Hao’s, but Su Xi-er dares to tell him to not split hairs!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Yun laughed, his voice clear and gentle. “A woman with beauty and talent like you has made a large impression on this Prince.” Then, he turned around and looked at the Grand Tutor. “This Prince doesn’t have a problem with you picking Su Xi-er, but Young Miss Tan can’t leave the palace.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Grand Tutor Kong didn’t understand his intentions. <em>The Imperial Library only needs one court lady. I have selected Su Xi-er, so I can’t keep Tan Ge. What does Commandery Prince Xie mean?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Only one palace maid is needed to organise the books in the Imperial Library, but this Prince found a lot of leaves on the paths leading here. Have Young Miss Tan stay as a palace maid to sweep the place; she can even help Su Xi-er in her free time.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After Commandery Prince Xie had gone as far as to say so much, Grand Tutor Kong couldn’t deny him. “This humble official obeys the order.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Tan Ge couldn’t help but lament her fate after hearing that. <em>I can’t be a court lady, but I still have to stay as a palace maid to clean the place. I didn’t think that I would still end up staying in the imperial palace after all this.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Yun’s gaze landed on Tan Ge. “There are some words that your father has asked this Prince to pass on to you.” After that, he cast a meaningful look at Su Xi-er and walked out of the main hall.</p>
