 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Su Xi-er wouldn’t know about Beimin’s last few state banquets, so she replied, “How could this servant have the time to gossip?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The state banquet is very important, and Beimin is the most powerful nation. You have never discussed such an important thing? This Prince doesn’t know if I should call you silly or responsible for being so dedicated to scrubbing all the chamber pots.” Pei Qianhao’s expression and words were full of playfulness.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, this servant was still sweeping the palace path back then. I didn’t scrub chamber pots.” Su Xi-er knew she had only started to scrub the chamber pots after the original owner of this body took the blame for He Xiangyu.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao glanced at her after she placidly pointed out the flaw in his words. “Glib tongue.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The buzz of the commoner’s conversation cut into the lull that then permeated the air, pulling their thoughts away.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Do you know that the Crown Prince from Dongling and the Monarch from Xiliu have both arrived at the capital city? They are currently resting at a posthouse in the capital.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Who hasn’t heard of this news in this capital!?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“That’s right, that’s right. I also heard that the Crown Prince from Dongling is very beautiful, and looks like a woman. He doesn’t have the robust aura of a man at all, but instead an enchanting femininity. Shouldn’t a man like that be a male lover<span id="footnote-ref-508f"><a href="#footnote-508f">[1]</a></span>?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was clear from their conversations that the hot topic was Nanzhao’s state banquet.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er had seen the Crown Prince from Dongling when she was Ning Rulan. <em>He was indeed enchanting, and more beautiful than most women. He was tall and thin with slender and long eyebrows. His pale skin was only highlighted even more by his nails dyed purple with cardamon.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>If he were a woman, he would definitely be a heart-breaker with a beautiful face like that.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao gave a cold snort when he saw Su Xi-er’s expression. “Su Xi-er, did your soul just leave your body after hearing how beautiful the Crown Prince from Dongling is?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er reacted quickly this time, speaking right after Pei Qianhao had finished talking. “Prince Hao, no one is as handsome as you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao didn’t reply. <em>Why did Su Xi-er’s words sound so awkward? We were talking about the Crown Prince from Dongling, and now she is saying that I am the most handsome. She’s comparing me with the Crown Prince of Dongling?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When he thought of this, Pei Qianhao’s expression became unpleasant. <em>Chu Linglong is a feminine man; how can he compare with me?&nbsp;</em>Although he was unhappy, he didn’t scold Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The horse carriage suddenly became quiet. It was fifteen minutes later when they reached the posthouse, and Su Xi-er followed Pei Qianhao into his room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As Pei Qianhao’s personal maidservant, she had to tidy the bed and the room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When she had finished taking care of the cleaning, Pei Qianhao called out to her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Immediately after that, Pei Qianhao threw a piece of clothing at Su Xi-er from somewhere.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er grabbed it out of the air and felt the fabric with both hands. <em>The silk is very soft and smooth; it is different than the other clothes that Pei Qianhao has gifted to me.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The cloth was dyed purple, and embroidered with Purple Fragrance flowers. It was the perfect combination of pureness and enchantment.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Try this on, and let this Prince see you in this. When Nanzhao’s state banquet begins, you will be going with this Prince.” He affirmatively said without asking for Su Xi-er’s opinion.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er held the clothing with both hands and raised her head to look at Pei Qianhao. “Prince Hao, why do you want to bring this servant?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’m taking you out to see the world. Otherwise, what if you run off when you see a better man in the future?”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s heart skipped a beat. <em>He is scared of me running off with others. Who can I run off with…? At most, I would be leaving by myself.</em></p>
