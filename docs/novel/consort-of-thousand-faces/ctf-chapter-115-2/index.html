 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>Su Xi-er raised both of her hands up and pushed on his chest heavily. “This servant broke the rules and sneaked out of the posthouse. I am ready to accept any punishment, Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao stepped away from her. “This prince has heard this sentence many times. If I really wanted to punish you ruthlessly, you would have long lost your life.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“So that means that you are a &nbsp;warm person underneath your cold expression, and have a kind heart, Prince Hao.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before Prince Hao could respond the capital’s County Magistrate, Lord Zhang, arrived at the front door of the teahouse with the bailiff runners. He didn’t look inside, but bowed. “The County Magistrate of the capital pays respects to Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao sat down again. His face was calm, as if he had known that the County Magistrate would come. “Come in.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Lord Zhang entered the teahouse with a few bailiff runners. “Prince Hao, the coroner has found the cause of death; the two Miss’ from the Wei family were forced to inhale a type of medicinal powder which stops people from breathing, and they ultimately died from suffocation. After interrogating a few waiters, we found that the only person who entered their room was the waiter that Prince Hao has kept behind in the teahouse.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao shook his hand. “Just go and find him. There’s no need to ask this prince about this matter.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao is wise.” Lord Zhang bowed to pay respects again, then instructed his subordinates to go to the rear kitchen of the teahouse to look for the manager and the waiter.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao remained unruffled, and lightly knocked the table with his fingers<span id="footnote-ref-fa82"><a href="#footnote-fa82">[1]</a></span>. “Pour the wine.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er walked forward, picked up the pot and poured a cup of wine. “Prince Hao, you already have a lot of wine from the palace. You can’t drink anymore.” She then put the pot of wine onto another table on the side.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I’m not worried about him, but afraid that he will get drunk. I won’t forget what happened in the woods beside the Palace Side Quarters. It was that night that he stepped into the Palace Side Quarters after drinking too much and bumped into me.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The wine from Nanzhao is very different from Beimin’s; it’s like nectar dew, with a trace of floral scent. The wine from this teahouse is strong, but the taste has a trace of osmanthus flower.” Pei Qianhao didn’t say whether he would continue to drink or not, but instead began recounting the taste of each wine.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Lord Zhang thought Pei Qianhao was talking to him, and replied respectfully. “There is a county in Nanzhao called Flower County. When brewing wine, nectar from Flower County is always added. Not to mention other things, Nanzhao’s wine is definitely the best in the world.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao looked at Lord Zhang. “This wine is indeed the best in the world.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, the bailiff runner who went to the rear kitchen returned with an anxious look. “Your Excellency, this subordinate has checked the whole place once, but couldn’t find anyone.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Lord Zhang’s eyes widened before he personally went to the rear kitchen. After he was done with the rear kitchen, he went to the backyard to look through each and every room, but he was still unable to find anyone.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It looks like the manager and waiter murdered the Miss’ from the Wei Family, now having escaped in fear of punishment. All bailiff runners, chase after them immediately.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After Lord Zhang gave his instructions, he turned to bow to Pei Qianhao. “Prince Hao, please take your time to enjoy. This humble official will be leaving to catch the criminals.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao waved his hand. “Handling the case is important. You should hurry.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Lord Zhang nodded and walked out of the teahouse, all the bailiff runners quickly following suit.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er knew that it wasn’t the manager and waiter who murdered the Wei Miss’. <em>But why did they decide to escape?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Drink with this prince.” Pei Qianhao pointed to the pot of wine on the other table. “Bring it over.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er shook her head. “Prince Hao, you shouldn’t have any more drinks tonight.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Bring it over.” Pei Qianhao’s voice was cold, but Su Xi-er didn’t respond.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At last, Pei Qianhao glanced at her before standing up to get the pot of wine himself. He didn’t expect to be blocked by Su Xi-er when he was halfway there.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er held the pot of wine in her hand tightly. “Prince Hao, you are not allowed to drink more wine tonight.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>How do I know if he will get drunk or not? If he does anything unexpected, I will be the ‘unlucky’ one.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’m not allowed to just because you say so?” Pei Qianhao looked at her with narrowed eyes, raising his right hand to grip the hand that she held the wine with.</p>
