 <p>“Thank you.” Su Xi-er thanked him as she passed the hairpin to him, taking a step back to size him up carefully.</p>

 <p>His skin was fair to the point that it was a little abnormal. His slender and long eyes tilted upwards slightly. There was no lustre in them at all and they were calm with no ripples of emotion.&nbsp;<em>Who exactly is this person? He suddenly appeared, saved me, then asked me for the hairpin.</em></p>

 <p>“Which palace are you from?” The man sat down on a chair at the side, his gaze sweeping over the dinner on the table.</p>

 <p>“This servant is from the Palace Side Quarters.”</p>

 <p>“Why would a palace maid from the Palace Side Quarters be here?” The man spoke slowly with an air of indifference.&nbsp;</p>

 <p>“Prince Hao is investigating the matter of a palace maid who had ambushed him in the woods beside the Palace Side Quarters. This servant, and another who has already been killed, were brought here as suspects.”</p>

 <p>Her words caused the man to chuckle. “I see, so that’s how it is. The grand Prince Hao was actually ambushed by a woman. That’s an odd affair.”</p>

 <p>“Do you know who the man in black just now was?” Su Xi-er raised her head to look at him. With how he and the man in black were poised for battle just now, it seemed that they were at least acquaintances from their expressions.</p>

 <p>“I have never known that there was such a person in the imperial palace.”</p>

 <p>The man’s answer caused Su Xi-er to be disappointed.&nbsp;<em>He also doesn’t know who the man in black was.</em></p>

 <p>“You still plan to stay here? Are you not afraid of the former Empress’ ghost?”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er smiled faintly.&nbsp;<em>Speaking of ghost, my body is already long gone. Isn’t the one dwelling in this body a soul? However, from the looks of this man, he is definitely related to the former Empress.&nbsp;</em>When she was still Ning Rulan, she had heard that Beimin’s former Empress gave birth to one son who was ranked number three among his siblings.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p><em>Could it be that the man before me is the former Empress’ sole child? His face is so pale. Is he ill?</em></p>

 <p>“You’re the first one who dares to stare at me like this. Why? Are you not scared?”</p>

 <p>Su Xi-er shook her head. “You saved me so why should I be scared of you?”</p>

 <p>“Interesting.” The man then stood up from the chair and casually walked about in the hall, pausing from time to time to touch the old objects.</p>

 <p>As he walked around, Su Xi-er noticed a pendant suspended from his waist. Three words were written on it. At the top was ‘Situ’ while at the bottom was ‘three’.&nbsp;<em>‘Situ’ is the surname of Beimin’s imperial clan. ‘Three’ means he is ranked third among his siblings.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p><em>The young Empress Dowager dominates the imperial harem while the Pei Family and the Xie Family control the affairs of the state. Generally speaking, the imperial princes should be banished far away. Why would this man appear in the imperial palace?</em></p>

 <p>“On the account that I saved you, take a cloth and wipe the dust here away.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er nodded. The Third Imperial Prince was missing his Mother Empress. She understood that feeling.</p>

 <p>Su Xi-er held a cloth in her hand and wiped the dust as she answered, “This servant is called Su Xi-er.”</p>

 <p>“Su Xi-er. Palace maid from the Palace Side Quarters…” He mumbled to himself. Then, he looked at the moon outside the window.</p>

 <p>The night was especially quiet now, with the wind having died down. All there was to provide light was the brightly shining moon.</p>

 <p>“Su Xi-er, no matter where you are, as long as you are in the imperial palace, you will only have one end&nbsp;ー&nbsp;death. Are you scared?”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>When faced with his sudden question, she became dazed for a split second.&nbsp;<em>Death. Am I scared? I am already someone who has died once. It’s just that compared to my previous lifetime, I treasure this one even more.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Just now, when you and the man in black were facing each other, I’m positive that I caught a glint of fierceness in your eyes. However, you have since changed to a gentle and weak appearance,” the man continued.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“This servant is naturally scared of death. The reason I was fierce just now is because I recognised I didn’t have long to live. When a person is on the verge of death, they will always be a little different.” Su Xi-er lowered her head and slowly justified.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Always be a little different…” His voice trailed off. In the end, his expression became distant, as if he was immersed in his memories.</p>
