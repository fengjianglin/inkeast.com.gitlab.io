 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>The three soft words from Su Xi-er’s mouth smashed into Ning Lianchen’s heart with the weight of a mountain. His eyes were filled with incredulity. He hadn’t expected much when asking the question as he was afraid that the higher the expectations, the greater the disappointment... <em>But who would have known that she would reply to me with ‘just like Lan’!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Only Imperial Elder Sister would answer me like this. She is definitely Imperial Elder Sister! Last night’s Jinghong Dance, this morning’s Bending Branch Dance on the floating stage, and the words ‘just like Lan’; all this suggests that she is none other than Imperial Elder Sister!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fearing that he would be overwhelmed, Ning Lianchen tried to suppress all the emotions that were gushing out, desperately making himself calm down. <em>I didn’t expect that Imperial Elder Sister would be able to live again. I don’t believe in the occult, but my Imperial Elder Sister is standing right before me! Even though she now has a different appearance, the soul is still the same.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao frowned slightly. He looked at Su Xi-er’s calm appearance before turning his eyes to Ning Lianchen. <em>What’s wrong with Nanzhao’s little Emperor? Why is he suddenly so agitated?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He asked, “Your Majesty, why are you so agitated? Prince Yun will lecture you again if he sees you in such a state.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hearing the words ‘Prince Yun,’ Ning Lianchen smiled. “This Emperor is happy. No, not just happy, I am <em>extremely&nbsp;</em>happy, so much so that I can’t describe it in words.” He completely expressed his elated feelings. <em>I want to let Imperial Elder Sister know that I have recognised her! Although it seems unbelievable, I can‘t help but think about the first time I met Imperial Elder Sister in the Yun Palace; she asked me, “Do you believe in a soul reincarnating in someone else’s body?”</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At that time, he had found it strange that she would ask such a question. Now though, he understood why. <em>Imperial Elder Sister wanted me to recognise her from the moment that we met.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s delight was also indescribable by words, but she was able to control her emotions well, preventing Pei Qianhao from discovering them. Still, the atmosphere became strange, when Pei Qianhao’s gaze kept alternating between Su Xi-er and Ning Lianchen.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The more he looked, the more he felt that something was amiss. Finally, he pulled Su Xi-er behind him and said, “Your Majesty, you can go back now. This Prince can stroll around with just my maidservant.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Lianchen directly waved his hand. “How can that be acceptable? This Emperor has already said that I will personally take you all around for a tour. I have to mean what I say. Am I right, Miss Xi-er?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He directly bypassed Pei Qianhao and asked Su Xi-er, intending to talk to his Imperial Elder Sister. No one would understand the feeling of regaining something one thought was lost.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“That sounds logical.” She pointedly ignored Pei Qianhao as she spoke, before then turning to face him directly. “Prince Hao, Nanzhao’s Emperor is so polite. You wouldn’t be giving face to Nanzhao if you were to reject him. You are now in Nanzhao, and not Beimin.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Does this Prince need you to remind me?” Prince Hao coldly responded before holding Su Xi-er’s hand as he walked forward.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince will take you to see the sea of Lingrui flowers.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing Su Xi-er being led away by Pei Qianhao, Ning Lianchen immediately followed. <em>That’s my Imperial Elder Sister, but I definitely can’t expose her identity in front of others.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>As soon as the cat is out of the bag, the consequences will be unimaginable. Even those who didn’t know Imperial Elder sister would treat her as a demon if they knew about her reincarnation, much less Yun Ruofeng.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao walked extremely quickly, planning to get rid of Ning Lianchen as soon as possible. However, when he reached the sea of Lingrui flowers with Su Xi-er, Ning Lianchen was still closely following behind.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He impolitely remarked to Su Xi-er, “Nanzhao’s little Emperor seems to be closely pursuing you. Why are you so dazzling as to effortlessly attract so many men?”</p>
