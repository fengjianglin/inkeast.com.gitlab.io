 <p>People once said that the most powerful male was Prince Hao of Beimin, and the most powerful female, the Eldest Imperial Princess of Nanzhao. To put it nicely, they were exceptionally smart; but to be more blunt, they were extremely crafty. How could Xie Yun not suffer defeat when under siege from these two people?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This was also the reason Pei Qianhao could be so arrogantly confident. <em>Xie Yun's general just passed away, yet he immediately went to Willow Village after returning. It looks like we can’t be so light-handed with our lessons anymore.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er instantly understood his intentions and teased, "Prince Hao, even you are making use of women now."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"This Prince didn't threaten anyone. If Xie Yun hadn't looked for Su Miao, this Prince wouldn't have borrowed this opportunity to make use of her. I'm simply trying to beat him at his own game; however, I won’t let him off the hook so easily this time around."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er inwardly pondered. <em>So that woman is called Su Miao. She looks very pure on the surface.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"When I went to the Imperial Library the other day, I met Tan Ge. She said that she was threatened by Xie Yun, and asked me to let her enter the Prince Hao Residence since it is currently the safest place for her." Su Xi-er changed the topic to another woman that Xie Yun was also making use of.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Tan Ge isn't like Su Miao; she has her own independent ideas." Pei Qianhao slowly remarked, and continued embracing her. "We can't help her with this."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"I have already refused her. She will have to choose her own path from now on. Prince Hao, this time, I want Xie Yun to be severely injured and lie in bed in his residence for several months." There was a sly look in Su Xi-er's eyes, a plan having long since formed in her mind.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao lowered his head and poked her nose. "Little fox, we'll do as you wish."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"You said I'm a little bewitching fairy, and now I’m a little fox. So what exactly am I?" Su Xi-er mischievously giggled, raising her hand to playfully smack him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"You are everything in this Prince's eyes. Are you satisfied with this answer?" The corners of Pei Qianhao's mouth were curved up as he bantered with her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Shameless." Su Xi-er glanced at him. <em>This appearance of his really feels like he is feigning anger in a coquettish manner.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao didn't think much of it, having long gotten used to her appraising him in such a manner. <em>We're already married, if I'm still not shameless, doesn't it mean that I have some problems with that aspect?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er turned her head to look at the streets bustling with people. <em>We spent last night going over every clause of Nanzhao’s new policy in detail. It won’t be much longer before Beimin undergoes sweeping changes, and welcomes a brand new system.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, a familiar garish figure appeared on the streets, and Su Xi-er immediately pulled on Pei Qianhao’s sleeve. “Isn’t that the Second Imperial Prince?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao replied in a deep voice, “He just accepted his position today, and he will be helping the Chief Minister of Justice in handling cases. Judging from his appearance though, he must have snuck out.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er pointed to a horse carriage on the streets. “Horse carriage from the Mu Residence.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Mu Residence was none other than the one belonging to the Minister of the Court of Judicial Review. In front of the carriage with the ‘Mu’ character carved on the side, they saw a woman dressed in a bright yellow dress alighting before heading into a nearby tavern in a dignified manner.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Which young miss of the Mu Residence is she?” Su Xi-er asked Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, the expected reply didn’t come, and she instead saw a harsh glint flash across Pei Qianhao’s eyes. Following his gaze, it was unclear when Xie Yun had appeared, but he was currently having a conversation with Situ Rong.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A moment later, the two of them walked into the tavern that the young miss from the Mu Residence had entered.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xie Yun indeed has impressive methods.” Pei Qianhao softly chuckled, the coldness in his eyes gradually dissipating.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er pondered for a moment. “My guess is that he will definitely help the Second Imperial Prince come up with ideas to leave the capital. If I’m correct, your intentions in assigning him to the Ministry of Justice is not just for the purpose of restraining his personality.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao laughed. “Nothing can escape your eyes. Xie Yun wants to plant someone in the Ministry of Justice, but this Prince insists on not letting him succeed.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xie Yun happens to be away from his residence now, so I’ll go back to the Prince Hao Residence and take Elder Cousin out for a tour.” Su Xi-er then pulled on his hand as they walked out of the private room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao understood that Su Xi-er was about to make her move.</p>
