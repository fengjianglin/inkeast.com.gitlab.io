<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Su Xi-er knelt on the ground, completely unable to feel the pain on her back. She raised her head as a smile slowly formed on her countenance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Clouds had begun forming until a light drizzle could be felt. Paying it no attention, she remained frozen in place as the rain slowly soaked every inch of her drop by drop.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The rain seemed to be gradually getting stronger, with the distant echo of thunder slowly approaching.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A tall and oppressive male figure appeared, revealing a solemn look on his face. The slight crease in his brow gave away his current mood.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Su Xi-er, do you not want your life anymore? Wasn’t it painful to be beaten? And now you’re allowing yourself to be drenched by the rain? Why are you not begging this prince?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Perhaps, if she opens her mouth to beg me, I will let her off.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, this servant is already used to such treatment. Instead of worrying about me, you should quickly return to your room. With your noble and fragile body, how can you allow yourself to be drenched in rain here?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao didn’t know if he should fly into a rage or laugh. <em>My body is fragile? Has she gone silly from being rained on?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Obstinate temper!” Pei Qianhao suddenly felt helpless. <em>I can see a reflection of my own temperament in this woman. Isn’t that completely ridiculous?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not paying any attention to Pei Qianhao, Su Xi-er only noticed him when the heavy weight of his robes was placed over her shoulders. Both her arms were then lifted up; in fact, it wasn’t long before her entire body was in his spacious embrace.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Walk forward. Why are you still in a daze!” His words were filled with reproach, Pei Qianhao then forcefully walked Su Xi-er in the direction of his room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The rain grew increasingly intense, to the point that both of them were completely soaked through by the time they arrived at Pei Qianhao’s room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The only light in the otherwise dark room was a small candle. Each flicker of the flame would reflect off the raindrops sliding from Pei Qianhao’s cheeks, causing him to possess a distinct look of relaxed arrogance.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao opened the cupboard and randomly tossed a piece of men’s clothing to her. “Take off your clothes and wear this.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Thud!&nbsp;</em>Su Xi-er slowly removed and examined the clothes that had landed on her head. <em>These are… his clothes. I am going to wear his clothes? The size isn’t even correct.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Pei Qianhao saw the fresh blood on her back, he involuntarily knitted his brow and pointed at the bedside. “Remove your clothes and lie there.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He felt that he simply was finding things to do because he had nothing better to do. <em>Su Xi-er had said this to me before. “Prince Hao, you are idle with nothing to do.”</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, do you plan to help this servant apply medicine? It isn’t necessary for you to do so. After all, you were the one who ordered this servant to be flogged in the first place. This is what I deserve.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Su Xi-er, you have no choice but to listen to this prince’s orders. If you continue to be stubborn, do you believe that this prince will throw you to the desolate countryside and feed you to the wolves?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing the fierceness in his eyes, the pain on her back became increasingly obvious. <em>If I don’t apply his medicinal powder, I’m afraid that I will collapse before I even reach Nanzhao.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Didn’t I agree to come to Nanzhao because I wanted to see the people I’m concerned about and the people I resent, and find out how they’re doing? Only with sufficient knowledge of the situation can I protect my loved ones and destroy my enemies.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hence, she didn’t resist and obediently revealed her back as she laid on the side of the bed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Afterwards, Pei Qianhao ordered someone to send warm water over. Holding onto a handkerchief, he began helping her clean up the blood that covered her injuries.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>It’s my first time waiting upon someone, much less a woman. Moreover, it’s this woman. The reason she’s even injured is because I...</em></p>
