 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>Su Xi-er turned her head away and shook off his hand. “This servant does not understand your thoughts, Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A chuckle could be heard. “Others will pretend to understand when they don’t, but you are the opposite. However, this Prince doesn’t mind telling you directly: anybody who betrays this Prince will be directly executed instead of tortured. No matter who it is, this Prince’s subordinates must remain loyal. Do you understand?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>His words were for me. I am Prince Hao’s maidservant, and will be for the rest of my life. As his servant, even if he doesn’t want me, I must stay loyal to him.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>This man is so vicious.&nbsp;</em>However, Su Xi-er knew that the only way to protect oneself was to be vicious to others. <em>After all, the reason for my tragic death in my previous lifetime was because I wasn’t ruthless enough and was too trusting of others.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, this servant understands your intentions. This servant will continue to wipe your body.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing that Su Xi-er’s expression was blank even as she wiped his body, Pei Qianhao smirked slightly before asking, “How is this Prince’s skin?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This sentence broke Su Xi-er away from her stupor. <em>He’s not wearing anything on his upper body! I am leaning on his skin...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She immediately recoiled, but was trapped by Pei Qianhao’s grasp. “Is it comfortable leaning on this Prince’s body?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er silently admitted that he was outstanding in both his military and governing ability, something that was made clear by his position today. <em>Logically, his skin shouldn’t be so good. Leaning on his body feels cool, and if I have to say it, smooth and comfortable...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Su Xi-er saw his serious expression, she replied, “Prince Hao, your skin is better than any palace maid. Do you rub medicinal powder on yourself every day? More than silk…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before she could finish, Pei Qianhao’s eyes became cold. <em>How can she compare my skin to a woman’s?! It would have been better if she hadn’t opened her mouth!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao let her go with a cold expression, picking up the clothes on the rack next to him and starting to dress. He no longer tried to have Su Xi-er assist him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er stood on one side quietly, then walked quietly to the wooden table and poured a cup of green tea. “Prince Hao, the fragrance of this tea is light, it smells great.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao tied up his robe belt and ignored her, causing Su Xi-er to stop talking.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Once he finished dressing, Pei Qianhao made his way over to the table, picked up the cup of tea, and tested the temperature before downing the entire cup.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Tea needed to be enjoyed slowly for it to be fragrant. It was impossible to taste the flavour of the tea by drinking it so quickly, and the cup of tea was wasted.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao saw that Su Xi-er didn’t realise her mistake, so he furrowed his eyebrows and coldly instructed, “Leave.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er noticed that he wasn’t happy and followed his instructions to withdraw. “Prince Hao, enjoy your tea.” With that, she walked out of the room, leaving Pei Qianhao with a sombre expression.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the imperial guard saw that Su Xi-er had come back downstairs, he asked worriedly. “Did you make Prince Hao angry?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao is always grey-faced; is it always because of me? Brother imperial guard, you are thinking too much.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard’s heart skipped a beat when he heard this. “What exactly did you say?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Nothing much. I just said Prince Hao’s skin was better than a palace maid’s. Now that I think about it, I should’ve said that it was similar to the skin of those noble daughters.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard’s body completely stiffened. <em>Prince Hao will be happy to hear that, my ass! She should say that his skin is sturdy, muscular, and manly! Anything would have been better than saying that it was similar to a woman’s!</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><em>Sigh. Does Su Xi-er not know how to talk?&nbsp;</em>The imperial guard was a bit speechless. <em>How could she say something like that?!</em></p>
