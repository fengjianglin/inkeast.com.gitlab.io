<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>The imperial guard set aside the doubts in his heart and nodded before swiftly following Yu Xiao, watching over the latter from the darkness.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao looked at one of the drug stores to the side. <em>She needs ginseng to keep her breathing, and I recall that there was a thousand-year ginseng root amongst the gifts that Beimin prepared for Nanzhao. Fortunately, the guards had forgotten to bring it along, leaving it lying in the posthouse.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao immediately turned and headed back to the posthouse. Not long after, he was ordering a carriage driver to hurry up as they travelled towards the Literary Association with the ginseng in his hands.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>To avoid detection, Pei Qianhao ordered the carriage driver to stop at a nearby street instead of heading straight to the Literary Association. Even if he was worried, he was still able to keep a level head.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard’s voice sounded softly from outside the carriage, “Prince Hao, every street is filled with imperial guards. The closer we get to the Literary Association, the more there are. From the looks of their clothes, they are from the Prince Yun Residence.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao nodded. <em>The vicinity of the Literary Association has been cordoned off by Yun Ruofeng.&nbsp;</em>He lifted the carriage curtain and saw that the imperial guards had set up barricades at the street’s entrance and checked every commoner.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The whole street was full of guards from the Prince Yun Residence, as well as the Imperial Army guards from the palace. <em>It seems like Yun Ruofeng is certain that Wei Mohai’s killer had something to do with the Literary Association. Perhaps he has even begun to suspect Su Xi-er.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A sharp glint flickered across Pei Qianhao’s eyes. <em>If you hadn’t sent Wei Mohai to kill this Prince’s maidservant, he wouldn’t have died.&nbsp;</em>Although Pei Qianhao wasn’t sure if Su Xi-er killed Wei Mohai, he knew that she was definitely involved in some way.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, what should we do now?” The imperial guard’s voice sounded again.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao replied in a low voice, “Head back first. This Prince shall alight.” Pei Qianhao then placed the thousand-year ginseng into his sleeves, lifted the curtains, and stepped off the carriage.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Return to the posthouse as soon as possible.” Pei Qianhao gave an order before he turned towards the Literary Association. <em>Rather than sneaking into the Literary Association, it would be better for me to walk straight in.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard watched as Prince Hao disappeared into the distance before he raised his horsewhip and cracked it, driving the horse carriage back to the posthouse.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao was discovered by an imperial guard from the Prince Yun Residence not long after. Knowing that he was speaking to Prince Hao, the guard greeted him with deference, but made sure to convey Prince Yun’s orders as well. “Prince Hao, Nanzhao’s state banquet has ended, and the guests from the various countries have also departed. If you wish to continue to enjoy Nanzhao’s beautiful sceneries, why not let Prince Yun personally guide you around?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao dismissed the guard with a wave of his hand, “There’s no need for that. This Prince hates it the most when others follow me around while I’m enjoying the scenery.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard understood Pei Qianhao’s words, but he still couldn’t let Prince Hao near the Literary Association. “Prince Hao, to tell you the truth, Prince Yun has ordered that outsiders are not to be allowed into the vicinity of the Literary Association. Only the commoners who live within the area can enter and exit. Please take a look; this subordinate has to do a strict check on them every day. This subordinate hopes that you can understand that Nanzhao...”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before the imperial guard could finish, he was interrupted by Pei Qianhao in a seemingly casual but imposing tone. “This Prince has admired the courage of the people from the Literary Association after they stood out in protest at the Water Caltrop River. Today, this Prince came specifically to visit the Literary Association.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao bluntly expressed his intention. <em>This Prince is determined to go to the Literary Association today. What can you do about it?</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The imperial guard could feel the might of Pei Qianhao. <em>This has put me in a quandary. What should I do?</em></p>
