 <p>Su Xi-er replied, “This servant accidentally killed Wei Mohai, so Prince Yun naturally wants to take revenge for him by getting rid of me.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao coldly sneered. “If that’s really the case, Yun Ruofeng wouldn’t need to go to the trouble of repeatedly coming to the posthouse. Be more careful these few days.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant obeys the order.” Su Xi-er began breaking free of him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Have you finished resting? Why did you suddenly come to the main hall to look for this Prince?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, a few pots of Lingrui we bought from Moon County have wilted.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s expression darkened a little. <em>A few pots have already died before we even began researching. If this goes on, wouldn’t all of them be dead by the time we reach Beimin?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, you should bring back a flower grower from Nanzhao. Otherwise, all of them would have wilted by the time we return to Beimin.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao nodded. “You’re right, we should bring an experienced flower grower back. Tell me, how should this Prince reward you for having such a clever little brain?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant wants to leave the posthouse and get back the dangling hair ornament from the pawnshop. Then…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao interrupted her. “You can only choose one thing. Don’t go overboard.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing his solemn expression, an idea popped into her head. She slowly approached him on her tiptoes, hooking her arms around his neck and planting a kiss on his lips. Although she didn’t have much experience, she had still learned a little bit of technique from the few times that she had kissed Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao froze for a moment, astonished by the situation. <em>I haven’t even said anything yet, but she is already kissing me.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Unfortunately for Su Xi-er, Pei Qianhao’s lips remained shut, leaving her only able to peck his lips a few times. Once he could finally react, a chuckle escaped from his lips; he then hooked his arms around her waist before pushing her against a pillar.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His kiss was eager and fierce, hungrily kissing her as if he was intent on eating her up. By the time he released her, his expression had completely changed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His hands wandered around Su Xi-er’s waist as he slowly tested. “What do you think of following this Prince back to the Prince Hao Residence and becoming my Room Concubine Servant? You will truly become my woman.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s heart sank when she heard that. With how much she worried about Lianchen, she had only planned on staying in Beimin temporarily. <em>Furthermore, Pei Qianhao doesn’t know my true identity. He doesn’t like women who are too opinionated and overbearing either. If he finds out that I am Ning Rulan, he would probably treat me in a completely different manner.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After not receiving her response for a while, Pei Qianhao could guess her thoughts. He raised his hand to comb her hair. “This Prince never forces people, but there’s a limit to this Prince’s patience. Su Xi-er, this Prince allows you some time to consider.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I suppose that I can only stall for time for now.&nbsp;</em>Su Xi-er nodded. “Prince Hao, after this servant retrieves the dangling ornament, I want to go to the original Fortune Apricot House. This servant believes that it has reopened under new management, and would like to go eat something.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao could tell that she didn’t wish for him to accompany her, so he didn’t make things difficult for her. “This Prince is happy today, so I will permit you to go. However, you are only allowed a maximum of six hours. If you’re not back by then, this Prince will send someone to carry you back for a beating.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant will definitely be back in six hours,” Su Xi-er assured.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao released her and instructed two imperial guards to follow her out of the posthouse.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The two felt that Su Xi-er had long surpassed a mere maidservant, having obtained Prince Hao’s favour as if she had become his woman. <em>The women in the Beauty Palace can’t compare to Su Xi-er at all!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>With Su Xi-er around, I’m afraid that the Beauty Palace will only exist in name. There’s even a possibility that the Beauty Palace will be abolished as long as Su Xi-er continues to gain Prince Hao’s affection.</em></p>
