<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Pei Qianhao sat in the main seat of the posthouse with a pot of tea on the table. He had originally wanted to drink wine, but had suddenly remembered Su Xi-er’s words. <em>“Prince Hao, drink less.”</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As a result, he was stuck drinking tea. <em>Su Xi-er will be coming back at 5 pm today, the deadline I have given her.</em>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Noticing the frigid aura around Prince Hao, the imperial guards retreated from the main hall, not daring to make the slightest noise; suddenly, the posthouse was eerily quiet.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao remained in his seat, fiddling with his teacup and tapping his fingers against the tabletop. More than anything though, he was watching the entrance of the main hall.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yet, even when the imperial guards came to deliver his meal at 5pm, Su Xi-er had yet to show herself.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>This woman is actually audacious enough to be late. She’s probably leading such a carefree life outside that she has forgotten about me.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, an imperial guard walked into the main hall with a letter and bowed deferentially. “Prince Hao, Commander Wu’s pigeon letter.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao took the letter and skimmed through it briefly. Wu Ling mentioned that Lord Pei and the Empress Dowager had hindered his attempts to capture Pei Yong. He hoped that Prince Hao would quickly return to Beimin in order to deal with the situation.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao folded the letter and instructed the imperial guard standing to his side. “Burn it.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The guard took the letter and gingerly asked, “Prince Hao, with Nanzhao’s state banquet already over, are we returning to Beimin today?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s tone was placid. “Su Xi-er isn’t back.” He glanced at the entrance of the main hall. <em>I’ll give her an extension of an hour. If she still doesn’t come back by then, she’s in for a beating!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard carefully observed Prince Hao’s expression before mulling over his words. <em>We can’t return to Beimin yet because Su Xi-er hasn’t returned. How daring of her to make Prince Hao of all people wait for her. Just where has she gone?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not daring to say this out loud, the guard hastily took the letter and exited the hall, preparing to burn the letter as ordered. Just as he stepped outside, he saw one of his colleagues heading in with a sense of urgency surrounding him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After the other imperial guard entered, he bowed and reported, “Prince Hao, Nanzhao’s Imperial Eldest Princess is unconscious. Based on the imperial physicians’ diagnosis, she’s either deranged or will become a lifeless vegetable. Nanzhao’s Commander Wei also mysteriously died yesterday.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao was initially indifferent, but furrowed his brows at the second piece of news. “When did Commander Wei die? Where was his body found?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard respectfully replied. “I heard that he died last night in an abandoned alley in the capital. As for the specific time of death, this subordinate is unaware.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A harsh glint flickered across Pei Qianhao’s eyes. <em>When the scholars from the Literary Association denounced Prince Yun, Su Xi-er was in the crowd of civilians. Did Yun Ruofeng misunderstand that she was part of the riot and dispatch Wei Mohai to kill her? Yet, the one to end up dead was Wei Mohai himself instead.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao followed this train of thought for a while longer before dismissing it. Upon reflecting upon the situation a bit more, he was able to organise his thoughts. <em>Su Xi-er’s death would be tantamount to the deal being called off. Nanzhao’s Imperial Eldest Princess wouldn’t need to go to the Imperial Mausoleum.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Wow, what a great plan, Yun Ruofeng. You even dared to make a move on this Prince’s maidservant.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao waved his hand. “Quickly go and investigate if Nanzhao’s Imperial Eldest Princess is really unconscious or feigning it. Spread this news amongst the populace as well. The more people who know, the better.”</p>
