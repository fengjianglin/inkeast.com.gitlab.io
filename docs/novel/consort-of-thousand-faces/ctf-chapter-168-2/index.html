 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>She said all this for the sake of Mei Jinxiu. <em>I have waited on Prince Hao for so long. I understand that this man is powerful enough that if he wants something he will get it. At the same time, if he doesn’t want something, nobody can force it on him.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>These words had greatly pleased Pei Qianhao, but he wouldn't let Su Xi-er off the hook that easily. He intentionally said, "Who said this Prince disregarded her? It's just that if you want this Prince to take you in, you will have to get past this Prince's Room Concubine Servant."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard’s eyes couldn’t help but widen as even the sword in his hand shook slightly. <em>This Prince's Room Concubine Servant?! Su Xi-er! Prince Hao has indeed laid his hands on Su Xi-er!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>But if that’s the case, why didn't he order someone to brew the contraception soup for Su Xi-er?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After listening to his words, Su Xi-er grew speechless, and no longer had the patience to continue with this farce. Pretending as if she hadn’t heard anything, she simply turned on her heel and headed for the second floor.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She had only taken a few steps when Pei Qianhao pulled her back.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er stated, "The love debts that Prince Hao has incurred have nothing to do with this servant."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Love debt?" Pei Qianhao asked in reply, but there wasn't any coldness on his face.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Isn't it a love debt?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mei Jinxiu couldn't stand the pandering between the pair and raised her voice even louder. "Prince Hao's maidservant, shall we compete in fighting skills, or something else? Just say it."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er threw a glance at her. "I am not going to compete with you. You have directly passed."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mei Jinxiu slightly knitted her thick eyebrows which was overflowing with masculinity. <em>Since I have passed, then I don't have to bother with this any longer.&nbsp;</em>She then raised her head and spoke to Pei Qianhao. "Prince Hao, when will you be returning to Beimin? I will get my matters in order and then return with you."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard could not take it any longer and lashed out harshly. "Prince Hao doesn't want you. Why are you so thick-skinned? Moreover, Prince Hao only has one room concubine servant, and doesn't need a second one."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Just one? Didn’t that maidservant say that there are many just now?" Mei Jinxiu cried shrilly, her voice sharp and piercing.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao looked at Su Xi-er before he spoke slowly. "When did this Prince said he has many room concubines? There's only one now."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mei Jinxiu could see how much Pei Qianhao doted on the maidservant beside him, but no matter how much he liked her, she was just that: a maidservant. She laughed arrogantly. "Prince Hao, I have my ways to make you accept me. As for your room concubine servant, I’ll just think of that as being in the past."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her tone then changed drastically as she looked at Su Xi-er. "Stay far away from him. That's all for today. I will settle my matters at the medicine shop before coming back."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mei Jinxiu wasn’t dumb, and realised that she would be at a disadvantage if they were to leave now. <em>Why not formulate a good plan? After all, the Mei Family's ancestral teachings can’t be violated.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As she was about to exit the Inn, Su Xi-er suddenly called out to her. "Miss Mei, go back and think it through. Teachings are dead, but people are alive. Is it worth it to ruin your whole life for the ancestral teachings? Furthermore, there are already72 beauties in the Beauty Palace; do you really not mind?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mei Jinxiu halted in place and turned around. "What do you mean by this?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er flung Pei Qianhao's hand away and approached Mei Jinxiu. "The Beauty Palace in the capital of Beimin gathers beauties from all around the world. There are currently 72 of them. All of the women inside are all dressed up to the details."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mei Jinxiu understood Su Xi-er’s point without any further explanation. Her eyes fell on Pei Qianhao. <em>Does this man really love beauties that much?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Haha, regardless of the truth, anyone with eyes can see how he treats this maidservant before me. How much he dotes on her…</em> Mei Jinxiu was still unresigned to let it go.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Why did my body have to be seen by Prince Hao!? How much effort must I put in to marry him!?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Miss Mei, even if you were to follow us, you would at most be sent to the Beauty Palace. It’s no different than the Cold Palace, and that’s not even considering whether you can enter or not. Looking at you…" Su Xi-er clicked her tongue and approached Mei Jinxiu before she parted her lips and enunciated her words slowly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Well, it's still better for people to have a bit more shame."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mei Jinxiu's face immediately paled.</p>
