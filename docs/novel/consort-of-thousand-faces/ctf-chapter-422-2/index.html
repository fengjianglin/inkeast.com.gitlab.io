 <p>It was Su Xi-er’s first time asking for Mei Jinxiu’s help, and the latter naturally agreed. Mei Jinxiu immediately felt Su Xi-er’s pulse, and was left furrowing her brows while trying to make a judgement.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was at this moment that Yu Xiao came over while holding a stalk of grass from his mouth and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jd.com/chanpin/473886.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gourd-shaped wine bottle</a> hanging at his waist. When he saw a woman taking Su Xi-er’s pulse, he immediately approached them. “Princess Consort, do you feel unwell?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mei Jinxiu instantly shot him a glare. “Shut up!” She loudly hollered in a cold voice.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yu Xiao never had someone shout at him in such a manner, and the stalk of withered grass in his mouth almost fell to the ground. However, he was not to be outdone, and coldly snorted. “The Princess Consort’s complexion looks rather good; there shouldn’t be any problems with her.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Miss Mei, is anything wrong?” Su Xi-er could tell from Mei Jinxiu’s expression that the latter had noticed something.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Did you smell any strange fragrance before drinking the sweet red date soup?” Mei Jinxiu retracted her hand and gravely asked.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er carefully pondered about it. <em>A strange fragrance...I didn’t smell anything before drinking the soup last night, did I?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“My specialty is dealing with strange plants. Let me take the Princess Consort’s pulse.” Yu Xiao swiftly reached out his hand to feel Su Xi-er’s pulse.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Aware of his knowledge in strange plants, Su Xi-er didn’t stop him. However, it was just unfortunate that Pei Qianhao happened to come by to witness this scene, causing his eyes to deepen.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Although Yu Xiao has yet to come of age, he is still a man!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yu Xiao blinked, having yet to detect the frigid gaze that had locked onto him. “This can’t be; Beimin shouldn’t have this kind of tree. This scent is from a tree that originates from the nation of Xiliu.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With his reminder, realisation dawned upon Mei Jinxiu. “I know! Did you smell a kind of plant fragrance? It should be something similar to the scent of tree leaves.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er immediately understood the reason for Situ Li consulting her on the Lan Script the other day. <em>There was indeed the scent of something similar to tree leaves after opening the copybook.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yu Xiao’s expression turned grave. “Who was so bold as to let you smell such fragrance? Although it’s harmless by itself, it can cause someone to lose their strength in 10 hours when combined with red date. Such a person is too horrible; how can you spend the nuptial night with Prince Hao if you have no strength?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao chose this moment to stop right behind Yu Xiao and say, “Instead of going to the flower pergola, you came here to discuss the matter of this Prince’s nuptial night.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yu Xiao shuddered when Pei Qianhao’s low and deep voice streamed into his ears. His expression was guilty when he turned around, as if he had been caught red-handed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er looked at Pei Qianhao before asking, “Has the Third Imperial Prince been to Xiliu?” She knew that Xiliu had multifarious strange plants with unique scents.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>The Third Imperial Prince must have added the scent to the Lan Script copybook. He knew of its effects when combined with the sweet red date soup. For it to not harm a person’s life and quickly wear off, it’s clear that this was planned out to assist Yun Ruofeng in abducting me.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hearing Su Xi-er’s question, all the puzzle pieces came together for Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>If that’s the case, Situ Li can’t remain in the capital. Regardless of who it is, as long as someone offends me, I won’t let them off! Furthermore, they even offended my woman!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the end, he said in a deep voice. “This Prince will handle this matter.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mei Jinxiu looked at Pei Qianhao. <em>Open and righteous with a tough and unyielding aura. All the excellent qualities of a man can be found on him.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, I lack a female healer to attend to me. Why not allow Miss Mei to take the position?” Su Xi-er suggested.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao grasped her hand, his voice instantly becoming gentler. “Whatever you say.” He then looked towards Mei Jinxiu. “This Prince will bestow you a luxurious sum of silvers to be the Princess Consort’s exclusive female healer. Are you willing?”</p>
