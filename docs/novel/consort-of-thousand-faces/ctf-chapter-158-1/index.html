 <p>On the other side of Moon County, the evening sunset had dyed the sky fiery red. The air was filled with the fragrance of flowers, and the peddlers had started to close their stalls with smiles and a rosy glow on their faces.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao carefully observed this and felt that the outskirts of the capital were much better than the city itself. <em>At least the commoners here lead happy and healthy lives, and the children laugh as they play.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Of course, he hadn’t seen Widow Liu’s farce on the other street.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, whenever a pedestrian saw Pei Qianhao, they couldn’t help but stop to look and wonder who this gentleman was. <em>We’ve already seen Prince Yun today, and now there is a handsome man here. What happened in Moon County today? Is he also an important figure?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everyone who saw Pei Qianhao had countless questions in their heads. Even after they had walked away, the questions in their minds remained.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao entered Flowers Arrive Inn to looked around, but didn’t see Su Xi-er. At this moment, a shop assistant with a smile on his face walked in front of him. “Sir, you look unfamiliar. Is this your first time here in Moon County? I’m not bragging, but my eyes can remember anyone’s face if I see them once.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao looked at him. “You can remember with one look? Then let me test you, have you seen a beauty visiting Flowers Arrive Inn?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The shop assistant immediately laughed. “Beauty? Of course, I have seen one. Sir, I’m afraid you’re being too vague. Moon County is full of beauties. Could you provide any detailed characteristics?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Detailed characteristics?&nbsp;</em>Pei Qianhao knew that her bright eyes were more expressive than any words. At the same time, they could hide more deeply than anything else. <em>The employee definitely won’t understand if I tell him that.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>So instead of that, Pei Qianhao directly said, “It’s the kind of beauty that will make an impression on you. If what you said was true, you would have definitely remembered that person. So, do you remember anything?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The shop assistant thought Pei Qianhao didn’t believe that he could remember faces with one look and was testing him. Hence, he thought carefully and smiled in the end. “Sir, an hour ago, there was indeed a woman who was beautiful enough to leave an impression on everyone. She is currently resting in a private room on the second floor, and said that she would pay us once the person she was waiting for arrived. But do you know her? If you don’t, this lowly one can’t let you in.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>A person who can make an impression can only be Su Xi-er.&nbsp;</em>To Pei Qianhao, this was the only logical conclusion. After all, none of the other countless women who he had seen could receive such praise from him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The reason for that wasn’t anything like her looks or background, but the unique aura that she always exuded. Everything she did made it feel like she was different than all the others.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao followed the direction that the shop assistant pointed him in and went to the second floor to find the room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Once he arrived at the correct room, he pushed the door open without another word. It just so happened that this was the moment when the woman inside was pulling up her sleeves, and her bare shoulders were left exposed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>But, the figure of this woman…&nbsp;</em>Although she wore the same goose yellow dress as Su Xi-er, Pei Qianhao immediately noticed that they weren’t the same person.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As she turned around, her hair swung in front of her chest, her sword-like eyes giving a sharp glare towards the man who had just barged in.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Instead of being stunned by Pei Qianhao’s looks, the woman’s gaze only changed slightly before she smiled sarcastically. “This Miss has not seen someone who enters a woman’s room without knocking. Are you blind, or was it on purpose?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao had heard the first sentence before from Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You can decide for yourself. I don’t have time to explain it to you. Miss, continue to rest.”Pei Qianhao exited the room and closed the door with both hands.</p>

 <p>The woman was donned in a goose yellow coloured dress, the same as what Su Xi-er wore. She immediately pulled her dress back properly and turned around quickly.</p>
 <p><strong>Sangria</strong>: how did she get the same dress as Su Xi-er? Did Prince Yun plant her there to fool Prince Hao?</p>
