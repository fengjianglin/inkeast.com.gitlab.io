 <p>Su Xi-er felt a throbbing pain from her chin as her head was forced upwards. Although she hated being controlled by people the most, she didn’t have much choice in the matter right now</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“You hate being treated like this by others?” Pei Qianhao chuckled softly. Then, he released her chin. His right hand hooked her slender waist while he slowly lowered his head.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A handsome face exuding a demonic aura was slowly approaching hers, his scalding breath brushing against the side of her face. The scenes from the woods beside the Palace Side Quarters instantly engulfed her mind.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When she saw that he was getting increasingly closer, Su Xi-er turned her head away and raised her hands, wanting to push him away fiercely.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, the more she wanted to break away, the closer he got to her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Su Xi-er, you’re scared of this prince?” His words were full of a demonic aura. Pei Qianhao’s left hand securely held her arms in place as he forced her to the corner.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just as Pei Qianhao kneaded her left wrist, he knew that something was wrong.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er was completely unable to retaliate with the thin and weak state of her body. Not long after, her left hand was raised and pressed against the wall by him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This type of medicinal powder…” Pei Qianhao moved closer to have a sniff and the refreshing smell wafted into his nose.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, he raised the corner of his lips and smiled unrestrainedly in a devilish manner. “Your wrist had sustained an injury before. Moreover, it’s not a light one. This type of medicinal powder is specialised for treating sprains, especially bone displacement.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er pursed her lips tightly and lowered her head. When she raised her head again, there were already tears in her eyes. “Old Maidservant Zhao secretly punished this servant by flogging. This led to my bones dislocating.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Oh?” His intonation rose, obviously not believing her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, if you don’t believe it, you can go and ask Old Maidservant Zhao.” Su Xi-er was already starting to weep in a low voice, appearing very delicate and pitiful.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s brow was creased. <em>Why did she instantly become like this?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He released her, but continued to fix his gaze upon her. “This prince is asking you, who set your bones in your wrist for you after they were dislocated?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er bit her lips as teardrops trickled down her cheeks. She was currently the most adept in acting. “Old Maidservant Zhao meted out punishment privately. However, the palace rules dictate that when an old maidservant punishes a palace maid under her administration, there must be a reason. In order to prevent others from noticing, Old Maidservant Zhao instructed a palace maid who has some medical skills to set my bones.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Who bestowed the medicinal powder on your hand to you?” Pei Qianhao asked again.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The Third Imperial Prince.” <em>This is the truth. As for how Situ Li and Pei Qianhao contend, that doesn’t concern me.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her words resulted in Pei Qianhao chuckling. “This medicinal powder is not an ordinary medication. Only people of a noble status can use it. Since he cares so much about you, could it be that he wants to marry you as his imperial princess consort?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er purposely pretended to panic. “This servant doesn’t dare.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao glanced at her and walked towards the room door without saying anything.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, if you directly go out from this servant’s room, that’s not too good, right…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“When it comes to something this prince wants to do, I never consider others. Even if I walk out, which palace maid would dare to speak about this prince?” His words were full of domineering arrogance and nobility that seeped into his bones.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er didn’t speak and watched him walk out.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Pei Qianhao didn’t leave, instead summoning Old Maidservant Zhao to the courtyard of the Palace Side Quarters.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>All of the palace maids held their breaths and watched with rapt attention. <em>Beimin’s number one handsome man, the incomparably respectable Prince Hao, is standing right in the courtyard of the Palace Side Quarters!</em> They were all very excited and wanted very much to raise their heads to have a glimpse of him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, as soon as they mustered up their courage to glance at him, they forcibly lowered their heads again, not daring to look at him at all.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Old Maidservant Zhao was punished to kneel on the ground. The atmosphere was heavy and Prince Hao’s overbearing might seeped out, weighing down on everyone and fiercely frightening every one of them.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You meted out punishment in private and hurt Su Xi-er?” Pei Qianhao’s voice was cold and stern.</p>
