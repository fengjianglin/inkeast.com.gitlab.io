 <p>After leaving the Imperial Household Department, Su Xi-er didn’t walk towards the Palace Side Quarters but instead headed towards the northeast corner. She decided that she would take a look at the Laundry Service Bureau tonight. As for the chamber pots, Old Maidservant Liu would arrange for someone else to wash them.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After walking for approximately two to three hundred metres, she still hadn’t found the entrance of the Laundry Service Bureau but after arriving at a crossroad.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Hm? Eunuch Zhang clearly said that I just have to walk towards the northeast end of the palace. He didn’t mention anything about a crossroad.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The road ahead split in two. <em>Which should I take?&nbsp;</em>While she was hesitating, a tender boy’s voice sounded, “I was thinking that it was a kitten or puppy, but it turned out to be a person. Not just any person either, but even a beautiful woman.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The boy clicked his tongue. He was clad in a small cyan long gown and wore small black shoes. When he spoke, his cheeks bobbed up and down, appearing extremely adorable.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er looked at this boy who had suddenly appeared in the middle of the night. <em>He doesn’t look like a little eunuch. Who could he be?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Beauty, which palace are you from?” The boy’s eyes observed her as his hands grabbed onto the hem of Su Xi-er’s sleeves, swaying them left and right.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>He’s already casually calling ‘beauty’ at such a young age. I wonder who taught him.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er removed his small fair hands. “I should be the one asking you. Which palace are you from? Why are you running around in the middle of the night instead of resting?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The boy furrowed his eyebrows slightly. He leaned close to sniff Su Xi-er carefully and a look of disdain appeared on his face. “What is that smell on you? There’s the scent of medicinal herbs and a terrible stench alternating with one another.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I scrub chamber pots in the Palace Side Quarters, so of course I will stink. Stay further away from me and quickly go back to your repose palace.” Su Xi-er immediately turned around. <em>I suppose I won’t be able to go to the Laundry Service Bureau today.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, she had just taken two steps when the boy caught up with her again. Like a sweet, he stuck to her and didn’t let go. He continued to speak in his tender voice, “If your body smells, you just have to wash it. It’s fine as long as you are beautiful. Some people are ugly, and will remain so no matter how much rouge and powder they apply.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er stopped in her tracks and observed him carefully. <em>Did he come to such conclusions on his own, or did someone else tell him? Just based on his adorable looks, I didn’t expect him to be so mature.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Who exactly is this boy?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why are you looking at me like this? Do I look very handsome? You want to promise yourself to me?” The boy grinned. He pouted with his tiny mouth and held his head up high.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“How old are you? You’re only at this age, yet you are already thinking about young ladies. Are you following me like this because you want to return to the Palace Side Quarters with me? Exactly which palace are you from?” Su Xi-er simply hastened her footsteps and tried hard to shake him off.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, this boy was nimble on his feet. He caught up to her and continued to grab onto her sleeves. “How do I answer you in time if you ask so many questions at once. I’m not going back to the Palace Side Quarters with you, nor do I belong to any palace.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er stopped again and watched him fixedly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the boy was stared at in such a manner, he seemed to feel a little embarrassed. He lowered his head and said in a small voice, “I am a...little eunuch.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Really?” Su Xi-er continued to size him up with her eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The boy nodded repeatedly. “Why would I lie to you?”</p>
