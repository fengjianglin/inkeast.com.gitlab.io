 <p>Chapter 327: Wardrobe-don <span id="footnote-ref-0510"><a href="#footnote-0510">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao lowered his head so that his eyes were level with Su Xi-er’s. “Did you just ask this Prince to leave?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I will definitely punish her if she dares to say yes! It looks like nobody has been keeping her in check.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er raised her head to look at him. “Prince Hao, you are too close. This servant’s wound has yet to recover, and may be torn open again...” She deliberately paused.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As expected, Pei Qianhao moved backwards slightly, giving Su Xi-er a bit of breathing room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Roll up your sleeve for this Prince to check your wound.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er did as she was told. Having just washed herself, her body was currently suffused with a refreshing feminine scent.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A new scab was still growing over the now bandaged wound.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao nodded in approval. “Be careful to stay out of trouble before your wound fully recovers.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant understands.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Although Pei Qianhao wouldn’t press her against the wardrobe anymore, he did not plan on letting her off easily. He raised his hands and set them on both side of Su Xi-er’s head, trapping her between them.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He lowered his head, making Su Xi-er think that he was trying to kiss her as he inched closer. Before she could turn away however, he moved towards her neck instead. He proceeded to plant a trail of kisses going down, until he rested his head against her collar.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>One of Pei Qianhao’s hands was pressed against the wardrobe door, while the other was holding her waist, preventing her from resisting.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The waves of fiery kisses caused Su Xi-er’s mind to go blank as she stood there and allowed him to do as he pleased.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, this went on for so long that a sudden movement from Su Xi-er was enough to accidentally pull off Pei Qianhao’s sash. His faint scent suddenly assaulted Su Xi-er’s nose, and she couldn’t help but notice the toned body and abs that military life had given him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Sensing the heightened danger, Su Xi-er pushed him away.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Noticing that his robes were open, Pei Qianhao laughed jovially. “Su Xi-er, I didn’t know that you were so good at removing people’s clothes.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant didn’t mean to; it was an accident.” Su Xi-er tried to explain, but when she saw the teasing look in his eyes, she didn’t know how to go on.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince is in a good mood today, but this problem can only be solved by the person who created it. Help this Prince wear my robes properly.” Pei Qianhao stretched out his arms, all prepared for her to attend to him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The tips of Su Xi-er’s ears were flushed red as she walked forward to help Pei Qianhao tidy up his clothes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing the tinge of red on her ears, Pei Qianhao was very pleased. <em>Not bad, she finally knows how to be embarrassed.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After Pei Qianhao’s clothes were back on, Su Xi-er immediately backed away. <em>The current Pei Qianhao is very ‘dangerous’, so I mustn’t get close to him. What if he pins me against the wardrobe door again...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Su Xi-er, what else have you been hiding from me besides your good handwriting?” Pei Qianhao gently tapped the table as he sat on a wooden stool.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I naturally can’t reveal all my cards to Pei Qianhao.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er replied, “Prince Hao, this servant just knows how to imitate, but if you are really intent on getting an answer, then you can just say that this servant is good at learning.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Playfulness flickered across Pei Qianhao’s eyes, and his lips curled into a smile. “There are some things that can be easily learnt; needlework and the four arts ー zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting are some examples. On the other hand, things like medical skill, military acumen, and political ability aren’t so simple.”</p>

  <p>1. This is a reference made to ‘kabe-don’, where the ‘kabe’ means ‘wall’, and ‘don’ refers to the sound made when slapping the wall. It often portrays an image of a guy trapping a girl against a wall. Other versions include ‘yuka-don’, where the ‘yuka’ means ‘floor’, and the guy pins the girl on the ground instead of the wall.</p>
  <p>In this case, it’s ‘wardrobe’ and ‘don’ combined together. <a href="#footnote-ref-0510"><i class="far fa-hand-point-left"></i></a></p>
