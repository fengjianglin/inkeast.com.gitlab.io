 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>Yun Ruofeng smiled to himself at this thought. <em>How could it be possible for her to be like Née Li? Someone as prideful as Ning Rulan would definitely be filled with hatred towards me. She would surely use all of her abilities to ensure that my life becomes a living hell.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Moreover, she is already dead. I’m not superstitious, and the dead should remain dead. How is it possible for her to live again?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er noticed him immediately, but purposely ignored him as she turned to head towards the back kitchen to prepare a pot of tea for Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before she could make much headway, however, Yun Ruofeng’s voice sounded out from behind her. "Turning on your heel the moment you see this Prince; what is it about this Prince that frightens you?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng was already standing behind Su Xi-er, staring at her back.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er turned around and deferentially greeted. "This servant pays her respects to Prince Yun."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng reached out in an attempt to help Su Xi-er, but the latter had already gotten up on her own, leaving the former’s hand awkwardly hanging in midair.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"You are not this Prince's maidservant, so there's no need to be so restrained. This Prince has mentioned this before." Yun Ruofeng cooed, his gentle gaze falling onto Su Xi-er as though he wanted to look deep into her inner thoughts.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"This servant is Prince Hao's maidservant, and I must go brew some tea for Prince Hao." Su Xi-er responded in a practised manner.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Your martial arts are pretty good, beating Head Constable Liu and Widow Liu to such a state early in the morning. This Prince never thought that you would concern yourself with-"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before he could finish his sentence, he was interrupted by Su Xi-er. "Should I not concern myself with it? A married man hooking up with a widow and abandoning his wife and son because he coveted money. Someone like that should be beaten to death. He came running back as soon as he saw that Liu Family has fallen. He does not deserve to be called a human."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng's expression remained unchanged as he listened to Su Xi-er’s words, but his heart was jolting up and down. <em>Abandoning his wife and son; should have been beaten to death...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Prince Yun, don't you think that man should die?" Su Xi-er stared at him for a long time, but couldn't detect any sort of fluctuation in his gaze.<em>&nbsp;I can't help but admit that his acting skills have gotten better, or perhaps, he wasn't reminded of anything at all.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Even if that's the case, Née Li still saved that heartless man at the most crucial moment. Sometimes, you should look at both sides of the coin. You haven’t experienced it, and wouldn’t understand."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er sneered to herself. <em>I haven’t experienced it, and wouldn't understand? What a joke. My understanding is even deeper than Née Li’s!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Prince Yun, you speak as though you have experience in this matter. But how could this be? You are not a woman; how would you be betrayed by a man?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her casual remarks were like a huge boulder pressing on Yun Ruofeng's heart, yet despite the suffocating feeling in his chest, his smile remained plastered to his face.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Feeling that Su Xi-er was speaking a little too much to Prince Yun, the imperial guard standing by the side reminded her, "Su Xi-er, Prince Hao's tea…"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er nodded, "I will go now." She then turned and headed for the kitchen without sparing Yun Ruofeng another glance, soon disappearing from sight.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Yun Ruofeng's eyes trailed after Su Xi-er. Even when her figure had completely disappeared, he was still looking in the direction that she had left in.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard from the Prince Hao Residence found it weird. <em>It can't be that this Prince Yun really fell for Su Xi-er, can it?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng retracted his gaze and looked at the imperial guard. "Is Su Xi-er so bold in the Prince Hao Residence too? And someone with Prince Hao’s personality tolerates it?"</p>
