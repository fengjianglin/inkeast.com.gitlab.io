<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Suddenly, a sharp woman’s voice could be heard. “How did Pei Yong raise you? This Empress Dowager has been looking all over for you, and here you are. Prince Hao is not someone that just any woman can get close to.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Yaran made herself known, walking towards Pei Anru and stopping in front of her. She had seen the sliver of mockery that flickered past the recesses of Pei Qianhao’s eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Yaran looked down at Pei Anru with a penetrating gaze, her eyes narrowing to slits when she saw that the latter had pulled her upper garment down. There was even a trace of contempt in her eyes. <em>She isn’t even an adult yet, and has already started using this kind of vile method. How did the Pei Family raise a person like this?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Pei Anru, stand up and tidy your clothes. A girl should look like a girl.” Pei Yaran ordered her sternly, then turned to Pei Qianhao and smiled apologetically. “Anru is still a girl who doesn’t know any better; don’t take it to heart.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao looked at Pei Yaran. “The Pei Residence didn’t raise her correctly. You must take care of her properly after she enters the Compassionate Peace Palace so that she doesn’t lose face for the Pei Family again.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Yaran’s face stiffened when she heard this unfamiliar tone. Shortly after, she replied, “This Empress Dowager will definitely teach her well. Servants, come and send Young Miss Anru back to the Compassionate Peace Palace. Don’t let her out without this Empress Dowager’s permission.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The palace maid who followed behind her immediately acknowledged the order and walked towards Pei Anru, pulling the latter up as she tidied her clothes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Anru didn’t want to leave just like that, but just as she was about to say something, Pei Yaran silenced her with a glare. But she thought about it again. <em>Empress Dowager is my paternal aunt; she surely has a way to save Daddy. I forgot myself in desperation just now.&nbsp;</em>After Pei Anru calmed down, she realised that she had been a bit too impulsive.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Young Miss Anru, please leave with this servant.” The palace maid requested deferentially. Pei Anru nodded and walked towards the Compassionate Peace Palace together with her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Soon, it was just Pei Yaran and Pei Qianhao left alone on the palace path.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Yaran walked up slowly and stopped about a metre in front of Pei Qianhao. When she spoke, her voice didn’t carry the authority of the Empress Dowager; instead, it sounded like that of an embarrassed young girl. “Elder Brother Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her voice was very soft and gentle; any ordinary man would’ve liked that and felt their heart skip a beat, even if they didn’t show it on their face.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Pei Qianhao wasn’t any ordinary man. There was no change on his countenance and the coldness in his gaze didn’t recede either. “Empress Dowager, with it being so late, you should return to the Compassionate Peace Palace soon.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Pei Yaran saw that he was going to leave, she immediately tried to stop him. “Elder Brother Hao, why do I feel that you have changed after returning from Nanzhao? Are the rumours true? Did you really meet a peerless beauty in Nanzhao and bring her back to Beimin?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She didn’t want to fall out with Pei Qianhao. Although she knew who the peerless beauty was, she didn’t point it out directly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Pei Qianhao’s reaction was a surprise to her. She didn’t think that he would ignore their past relationship, even if they were only siblings.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“So what if this Prince really did bring her back to Beimin? Do you want to see her, Empress Dowager?” Pei Qianhao’s voice was calm, and even his expression was nonchalant, as if it was a normal thing to bring the woman back to Beimin.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Yaran’s expression changed slightly, but she still kept an awkward smile on her face, pretending to be confused. “Elder Brother Hao, have you fallen for that woman? Did you dissolve the Beauty Palace because you were afraid that she wouldn’t be happy when she comes to Beimin?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When she asked that question, Pei Yaran’s heart was trembling. She was scared that he would nod and say yes.</p>

 <p>Well, I guess Pei Yaran is still somehow a little smarter than Ning Anlian, though I would say that whatever she's doing isn't very wise</p>
