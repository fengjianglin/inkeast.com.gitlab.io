 <p>“Stubborn.” Xie Yun gently mumbled as his left hand held her down, while his right hand massaged her abdomen. “Just treat me as a physician. A healer doesn’t discriminate between men or women. If you don’t want to look at me, you can just close your eyes.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Aware that the pain would’ve prevented her from getting up even without Xie Yun holding her down, Zhen Yu’s heart was filled with grievances.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>10 minutes later, footsteps could be heard outside the room, and Xie LIuli soon led an imperial physician in. When she saw Zhen Yu in the quilt, her eyes instantly widened!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>What happened?! Why is she under the quilt?!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Upon noticing that someone had come in, Zhen Yu was so shocked that she immediately wanted to get up, but Xie Yun’s hand held her down. “Don’t move. If you are shy, just close your eyes and pretend that you’re unconscious.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>He clearly can’t walk, yet his left hand is still so strong.&nbsp;</em>Out of options, Zhen Yu closed her eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Walking closer to the bed, Xie Liuli noticed that Zhen Yu was still unconscious. <em>Elder Brother tucked her in the quilt and took her into his arms.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There was a trace of reproach in Xie Liuli’s eyes as she spoke. “Elder Brother, Zhen Yu isn’t married; she’s still an innocent and chaste young lady.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Right as she finished admonishing him, she noticed the coldness in her brother’s eyes. “This Prince didn’t do anything to her. Imperial Physician, check her abdomen.” Xie Yun lifted the quilt and revealed the darkened bruise on her stomach.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial physician examined the area carefully, then reached for her wrist to take her pulse. A moment later, the imperial physician retracted his hand and bowed. “This young lady’s period is about to arrive; she would have already felt weaker, but it’s inevitable that her injury would be more severe during this period of time. However, it shouldn’t be a big problem. She should only need to spend some time recovering after drinking some medicinal soup and applying medicinal herbs.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Yun nodded. “Go and write the prescription right away. Liuli, follow the imperial physician to get the medicine.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial physician bowed and acknowledged the order, walking out of the room. Yet, Xie Liuli remained rooted to the spot while staring at Xie Yun. “Elder Brother, have you fallen in love with Zhen Yu? She’s not a young lady you can deceive; besides, there’s someone she likes! Even if you like her, I hope that you can let go and let her search for Brother Hu.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Yun furrowed his brow. <em>Zhen Yu is pretending to be unconscious; I can’t let her know my true feelings.&nbsp;</em>“Liuli, you’re thinking too much. She’s helping to treat me, so I’m extremely grateful to her; I simply treat her as a benefactor. I couldn’t possibly let her lie outside the quilt and catch a cold right?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Liuli meticulously analysed his words. <em>What he said makes sense too.&nbsp;</em>Hence, she dropped her suspicions and turned to leave the room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Right after the door closed with a creak, Zhen Yu opened her eyes and smacked Xie Yun’s hand. Disregarding the pain, she gritted her teeth and sat up.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Yun didn’t stop her. “I won’t do anything to you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Once I have finished Physician Mei’s task, I will return to the medical clinic.” Zhen Yu earnestly stated.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Yun nodded. “Alright, that’s fine if you return.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhen Yu stood up and walked out of the room, not returning to Xie Yun’s room even after night fell. She stayed in the small room in the backyard, her mind filled with Brother Hu, not knowing that her first kiss had already been stolen.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, at the Prince Hao Residence, Su Xi-er didn’t know that Zhen Yu had entered the Commandery Prince Residence.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Nested in Pei Qianhao’s embrace, her face was rosy, and her eyes were flickering with a charming look after having just done the deed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“A-Jing, have you sent people to search for Brother Hu yet?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao stroked her back. “I can only start investigating from Peach Blossom Village, but it was more than 10 years ago. After such a long time has passed, it will be challenging to track someone down.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“If they’re fated, Brother Hu and Zhen Yu will meet again.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao nodded. Looking at her delicate appearance, his heart involuntarily moved, and he planted a warm kiss on her forehead.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Wu Ling loudly reported from outside the room, “Prince Hao, there’s something important to report!”</p>
