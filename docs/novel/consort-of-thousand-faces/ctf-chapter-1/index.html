 <p>Ning Rulan sat on a mouldy straw mat in the prison, her legs shackled by thick iron chains. Her red gown and glittering pearl hairpin formed a stark contrast with the dingy prison. &nbsp;</p>

 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span>At this moment, the jailer’s ill-intentioned laughter could be heard. “Such delicate and tender skin. I wonder what it will taste like.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels.

Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span>“I usually see you in a lofty position with a cool and aloof demeanour. You never expected that you would land in the hands of this proud one today, right?” The jailer entered the prison cell and slowly walked towards Ning Rulan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm">She immediately stood up. The jailer was considerably displeased by the look of arrogance in her eyes.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm">“With both your legs bound by iron chains, you won’t be able to run away! Arrogant woman, feel free to shout as much as you want later. The louder your voice is, the more this proud one likes it.” The jailer was already starting to take off his pants.</p>

 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span>Ning Rulan narrowed her eyes. As the jailer tried to pounce on her, despite the heavy manacles around her ankles, she swept one of her legs towards the man in a kick, landing a heavy impact on his body.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm">The jailer yelped as he fell and consumed a mouthful of dust.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>

This proud one will have fun with you until you die. You still dare to act arrogantly as if you were the eldest imperial princess? You are nothing more than a doomed woman! Even General Yun himself has granted permission for us to fool around with you as we please!” The jailer immediately climbed up and closed the distance between them, lashing out at her with the whip in his hands.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>

 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span>Right afterwards, he threw himself at her.</p>

 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span><em>Rip!</em> Her shoulder was exposed, glimmering with a captivating lustre. The jailer’s improper thoughts surged forth as his saliva almost flowed out.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span>Ning Rulan forced herself to endure the feeling of disgust in her heart. Catching the jailer unprepared, she raised her hand to grip his neck and ferociously twisted it.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span>The jailer instantly stopped breathing, an expression of lust clear on his face even at his moment of demise. However, he was still lying prone on Ning Rulan when he died. Furthermore, with her rumpled clothes, it looked as if she had been bullied and humiliated.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span>Ning Rulan was just about to push the jailer’s body off herself when the sharp voice of a woman could be heard.&nbsp;</p>

 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span>“Who would have thought that Nanzhao’s eldest imperial princess is currently pressed under a jailer’s body? This feeling, tsk tsk, how is it?” Her tone was filled with disdain and detestation.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span>Ning Rulan didn’t even need to look up to know who it was. It was her younger sister born from a different mother, the Second Imperial Princess, Ning Anlian.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm">“You’ll find out what it feels like once you endure it once.” The next moment, she exerted her strength to push the jailer down. She sat back down on the straw mat again before tidying up her torn dress. &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>

Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span><em>The jailer has been killed by her!</em> Ning Anlian’s expression changed. She looked at her tussled hair again. <em>She’s already in such a plight yet she’s still so unruffled!</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span>Ning Anlian was inwardly upset. <em>This is the part I hate most about her!</em></p>

 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span><em>Arrogant and aloof. In her eyes, everyone is a nonentity!</em></p>

 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span>Ning Anlian suddenly smiled and took out something from her sleeve. “I suppose that you’re rather interested in this, right?”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm">There was finally a ripple in Ning Rulan’s emotionless eyes. <em>That’s the Lucky Knot! There’s a ‘Lan’ character embroidered on it!</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm">“Yun Ruofeng tossed this away. He told me that every time he sees this Lucky Knot, it causes discomfort in his heart!” Ning Anlian smiled wantonly. She threw the Lucky Knot onto the ground and stepped on it with her right foot, grinding it into the ground with her heel.&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm">Ning Rulan’s eyes widened. As she watched how the Lucky Knot was ruthlessly trampled and became a sordid lump, it felt as if her heart was enduring the same treatment.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span>“Ning Rulan, I hate you! You stole everything that should have originally been mine. The person Yun Ruofeng likes is me. We have long since been with one another!” Ning Anlian had an excited look. She walked into the prison cell step by step. <em>I want to tear Ning Rulan’s expression to shreds!</em>&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span>“Long since been with one another?” Ning Rulan clenched her fists tightly. <em>Perhaps he is not rescuing me due to the circumstances. No matter how much power he wields, it is still insufficient to overcome the threat of the officials dismissing themselves from court.&nbsp;</em></p>

Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span>Ning Anlian walked to Ning Rulan’s side before putting a hand under the latter’s chin and forcing their eyes to meet. “For the past two years, he would carry out the matters of husband and wife every few days. All because of you, I can’t be together with him openly and honourably! I induced an abortion three times! Can you understand that kind of pain?”</p>

 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span>“Induced an abortion three times.” The expression in Ning Rulan’s eyes became lax and all her strength left her body.

  <p><strong>Rakumon Corner:</strong></p>
  <p>Hello there! :) This is <strong>Rakumon</strong>, your translator for Consort of a Thousand Faces. There will be a mass release of 10 chapters on the first day, followed by daily release, and of course teasers to look out for! To share some background information about me, I started out as a newbie on Grace's team for <a href="https://www.volarenovels.com/novel/unruly-phoenix-xiaoyao" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Unruly Phoenix Xiaoyao</a> and subsequently joined littlebigwhale's team for <a href="https://www.volarenovels.com/novel/transmigration-of-mysteries-and-songs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Transmigration: Of Mysteries and Songs</a>. Grace has been an awesome mentor and littlebigwhale has offered me useful advice for translating. Check out those novels if you haven't!&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Up next, we have <strong>Lunarlark</strong>(username: Linker), our editor for this novel! He has edited <a href="https://www.volarenovels.com/novel/historys-strongest-senior-brother" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">History's Strongest Senior Brother</a> and <a href="https://www.volarenovels.com/novel/bone-painting-coroner" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bone Painting Coroner</a>, along with some other works. With his extensive editing experience, you can rest assured that you are in good hands. He is the one who saves the day by rescuing your eyes from my horrible translations.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If you haven't checked out the novel's main page, check it out now either at the top or bottom of your screen. There is a bunch of useful stuff, such as a <a href="https://www.volarenovels.com/novel/consort-of-thousand-faces/ctf-character-glossary" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">character glossary</a>, a <a href="https://www.volarenovels.com/novel/consort-of-thousand-faces/ctf-pronunciation-of-character-names" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pronunciation guide</a>, and <s>biased</s> <a href="https://www.volarenovels.com/novel/consort-of-thousand-faces/ctf-brief-review" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">brief</a> and <a href="https://www.volarenovels.com/novel/consort-of-thousand-faces/ctf-detailed-review" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">detailed</a> novel reviews, listed in the index.</p>
  <p>This is my first official project so do leave loads of comments and feel free to provide any feedback. If you haven't created a volare account yet, do create one as there are perks to it! You can get access to an automatic/manual bookmark system and get in touch with the latest updates. <s>The most important reason is that a comment amounts to at least a gallon of fuel for me and Lunarlark. :P</s> I will try to read through all the comments and reply if I can, but even if I don't, I will like your comment to show that I have read it!</p>
  <p>The novel's cover is brought to you by Guan who found a clearer image and inserted all the amazing fonts, Yuuko who added some effects to refine it, Lunarlark who has a sublime aesthetic sense, and me who awkwardly placed the calligraphy fonts. XD</p>
