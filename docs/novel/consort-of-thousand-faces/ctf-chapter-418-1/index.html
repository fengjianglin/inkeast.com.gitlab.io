 <p>Pei Qianhao understood what Yun Ruofeng was referring to, and turned around to look at Su Xi-er and held her hand before softly saying, “Close your eyes; don’t look.” He then raised another hand to cover her eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Receiving his signal, the guards aimed their arrows at Yun Ruofeng, their bowstrings taut. Before they could shoot, however, a figure fully dressed in black suddenly flashed past, throwing out a storm of needles from their hand. In the blink of an eye, the guards were all clutching their knees before eventually collapsing to the ground.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, at the end of the day, this is still Prince Yun. Isn’t it unacceptable to shoot him dead without a second thought?” The mysterious man’s voice was hoarse, and right after he finished speaking, he aimed his palm straight at Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He was quite skilled, causing Pei Qianhao to furrow his brow and push Su Xi-er away to battle him. The two of them kept exchanging blows, but no victor could be determined.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Su Xi-er looked at the man closely, her expression turned grave. <em>Half-faced man!</em> <em>Who on earth is he? He has appeared multiple times, targeting both me and Pei Qianhao!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not one to remain inactive, Yun Ruofeng grasped the opportunity to swiftly move to Su Xi-er’s side.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even though Su Xi-er’s skills were adequate, the combination of the medicinal powder and her injury made it hard for her to resist. After a few exchanges, she was forcibly pushed out the back door. Qin Ling’s horse carriage appeared with impeccable timing, and she unceremoniously pulled aboard.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao exuded a frosty aura as a murderous intent flickered in his eyes. <em>I must end this battle as soon as possible!&nbsp;</em>His attacks became more vicious as his irritation grew. As for Shi Mo himself, he hadn’t planned to linger; his only goal was delaying Pei Qianhao long enough for Yun Ruofeng to escape. Thus, he broke off the engagement and quickly disappeared at the first opportunity.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao stopped his attacks and whistled loudly, prompting his steed to come galloping over. He immediately leapt onto the horse and chased after the direction that the carriage had left in.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As for Shi Mo, he was currently walking through an isolated alley. He had only taken a few steps before he was forced to lean against the wall, coughing up a mouthful of fresh blood immediately after. A harsh glint flickered in his eyes as he raised an arm to swipe at his mouth. &nbsp;<em>Pei Qianhao is really quite skilled! To think that he managed to injure me!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shi Mo’s gaze deepened, and the corners of his mouth curled up to form a wicked smile. <em>Interesting. The stronger the opponent is, the more it can arouse my fighting spirit. Pei Zheng has really raised a good son. The Pei Residence may be at its peak right now, but it will eventually crumble and collapse!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qin Ling’s carriage quickly made its way through the capital, but was delayed by the guards when they reached the gates at the entrance. That being said, it only took a few swings of his sword to deal with them, allowing the carriage to continue madly rushing towards its destination.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yuchi Mo, who was in charge of guarding the capital’s gates, immediately gathered a group of troops and horses when he found the aftermath. Just as he was about to give the order to pursue, he felt a gust of wind blow past, followed by the sound of horse hooves furiously pounding against the ground.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Upon a closer look, he realised that it was Pei Qianhao! Yuchi Mo’s expression immediately became solemn. <em>Princess Consort Hao is in that horse carriage! She’s being abducted!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Armed with this knowledge, the sense of urgency in his heart only heightened as he urged his subordinates forward.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Yun, there are many people on horseback pursuing us.” Qin Ling loudly shouted as he drove the horse carriage.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng looked at Su Xi-er who was sitting in the corner. <em>She’s very composed. The woman who is bashful in front of Pei Qianhao has once again become strong-willed in front of me.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Why is she unwilling to show her soft side to me?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng’s eyes deepened as he instructed, “Head up the mountains.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Obeying his order, Qin Ling turned the carriage to head up the mountain path.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Lan-er, can’t you be more gentle towards me? My days are numbered.” Yun Ruofeng bitterly smiled, his gaze becoming more gentle.</p>
