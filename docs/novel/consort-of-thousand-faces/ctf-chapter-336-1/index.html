<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Everyone’s doors were tightly shut, and only a few brave souls cracked open their windows to observe what was going on outside. <em>What happened? There are so many people dispatched on the streets.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the person that everyone was searching for was currently in a civilian’s house. Su Xi-er quietly looked at the imperial guards from the Prince Yun Residence, all of whom wore civilian clothes as they surrounded her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Yun gave the order to take you away from Beimin today. Please forgive us if we had offended you just now.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With Su Xi-er’s skills, she would never have been taken by them so easily. <em>If I am here, it’s because I wanted to be. I want to know what game Yun Ruofeng is trying to play.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Yun sent you here, but are you so confident that I will return with you?” Su Xi-er’s tone was unfriendly as she coldly stared at the guards around her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the door opened, and Qin Ling walked in wearing the same civilian clothes as the rest of the guards.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s brows furrowed. <em>He’s supposed to have been sent to the borders, but now he’s in the capital of Beimin.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qin Ling walked up and paid his respects before taking a letter out from his sleeve. “Miss, this is a letter from Prince Yun; please read it.” He passed the letter to her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er took it and started reading; after a small amount of time, she chuckled and tightly grasped it.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong><em>Lan-er, the new policy has been reimplemented. This Prince has been sincerely assisting Lianchen. I hope you will return to this Prince’s side soon; let’s start over again.</em></strong></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>After hurting me, he’s trying to get me to go back with a few words? He doesn’t know that some wounds are permanent.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Commander Qin, even if Prince Yun personally comes here, I still wouldn’t return to Nanzhao.” Su Xi-er held the letter above a burning candle, letting it quickly turn to ashes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Miss, are you really so firm in your decision?” Qin Ling asked again, trying to sound her out.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er stood up. “Commander Qin, you should be at the borders. Yet you, as Nanzhao’s Imperial Guard Army Commander, as well as Prince Yun’s right-hand man, are suddenly here in Beimin. Aren’t you afraid that people will discover you here and think that Nanzhao wants to wage war with Beimin?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Miss, this subordinate must obey Prince Yun’s orders. Since you refuse to go back, please forgive me.” With a flash of his body, Qin Ling scattered the medicinal powder that he was hiding in his sleeve on Su Xi-er’s body.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>It’s a medicinal powder that will knock me out.&nbsp;</em>Su Xi-er immediately held her breath, but she had already inhaled some of the powder. Her whole body started to feel weak, but her eyes still glared intensely at her would-be kidnappers. “Commander Qin, I thought you were an honest person, but you’ve started to become despicable too. To put it nicely, you are too loyal. To say it unpleasantly, you are aiding the evil.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Miss, please forgive me. As an official, I have to serve my master for a lifetime.” Qin Ling walked up with a thick rope in his hand as he spoke, preparing to tie Su Xi-er up.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With the last bits of her consciousness, Su Xi-er looked at the door and tried to come up with a way out.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>All of a sudden... <em>Bang!&nbsp;</em>The door was forcefully opened by someone from the outside.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A group of men holding cudgels immediately barged into the room with a middle-aged woman who was dressed in a bewitching manner behind them. She waved the handkerchief in her hand and pointed at Su Xi-er. “That’s the young lady who I have chosen today. None of you can take her away!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qin Ling looked at the woman. <em>She clearly looks like a bawd.&nbsp;</em>He immediately waved his hand for his subordinates to take care of it, causing a scuffle to break out.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The woman smiled and used this chance to get closer to Su Xi-er. Noticing her, Qin Ling quickly obstructed her path.</p>
