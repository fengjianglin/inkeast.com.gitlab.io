 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>Pei Qianhao’s other hand was now at her waist, forcing her to the edge of the wooden barrel. Without warning, his body moved forward, his lips now covering hers as his hands moved along the curves of her waist.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The strong scent of a man rushed into Su Xi-er’s nose and she trembled. <em>I don’t like this feeling. I don’t like men being so close to me!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Added onto the fact that she had been forced into this, her feelings of dissatisfaction were overflowing from her countenance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er raised her legs and kicked him without any hesitation, then proceeding to open her mouth to bite his lips.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, no matter how hard she bit down, he did not let up, the taste of blood gradually filling her mouth.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His hands’ movements were even more daring, moving down to lift the hem of her skirt. Despite this, his eyes and expression remained ice cold.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A feeling of hate arose from Su Xi-er’s heart. <em>I don’t like this feeling.</em> <em>I want to escape</em>!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Thus, Su Xi-er raised her head to slam it into Pei Qianhao’s forehead, bringing her hand up to land a swift and fierce slap across his left cheek.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Pow!&nbsp;</em>The sound was especially loud and crisp on a quiet night like this, to the point that it was a little frightening.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The force used was enough to leave a small palm-print on Pei Qianhao’s face.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s eyes widened and looked straight at him as she tried to catch her breath.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She was never tired out while she was dancing, no matter how fast she spun. However, when she was forcefully kissed, she would simply be exhausted, all of her painful memories returning at once to torture her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s face darkened, his eyes now cold and eerie.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He stared at Su Xi-er for a few infinitely long seconds before he spoke. “Get out.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His voice was calm, and did not show his emotions. It was only from his expression that one would be able to discern his displeasure.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er placed the towel on the edge of the barrel and paid her respects, “This servant will take my leave.” After that, she rapidly left the room without looking back.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao stared at her retreating figure with an incomprehensible gaze. <em>If I don’t punish her, she will continue to test my bottom line over and over again.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er took a deep breath after she had left the room. <em>I became emotional and slapped him just. Based on his arrogant temper, he will definitely not let me off.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Since I was brave enough to slap him, I am brave enough to accept the punishment no matter what it is. No punishment will be as harsh as the Heart-Penetrating Arrow.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er raised the corner of her lips and laughed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, a clear voice could be heard, “Got chased out?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The voice was both familiar and unfamiliar. Su Xi-er stopped laughing and calmly turned around with respect on her visage. “This servant pays her respects to Prince Yun.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng stretched out both hands and tried to help her up, but she stepped back quickly, creating distance between them. He could tell that she was wary of him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What is Prince Yun doing here in the middle of the night instead of resting?” Su Xi-er asked. <em>Why did he happen to appear at the same time I left the room?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng smiled warmly, with a warm laugh reminiscent of a spring breeze blowing past the ears, he asked, “That dance, who taught it to you?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er was slightly stunned and unable to react. <em>Was he there when I performed that dance?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing the doubts in her eyes, Yun Ruofeng explained, “This prince was passing this spot and inadvertently saw you dancing under the moon. If Prince Hao wasn’t there, this prince would have revealed myself. I am just curious about who it was that taught you?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>So it turns out that he was watching. Was he monitoring Pei Qianhao, or her?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er replied slowly, “Why are you curious, Prince Yun? Have you seen this dance before?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng’s eyes were bright as he looked into the crescent moon hanging in the night sky, as if he had sunk into his memories.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Only after a long time did he reply. “You are right, this prince has seen this dance before.”</p>
