 <p>Su Xi-er tried to calm herself, but couldn’t help but chuckle as she spoke. “You don’t have to pay attention to them. It came straight from the horse’s mouth, so it’s fine having the commoners talk about it; it’ll just increase the liveliness.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling’s eyes widened in shock, completely forgetting about the maintaining the disposition of a commander. <em>I didn’t expect that Prince Hao said it himself! I have always thought that people in power value their reputations.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing Wu Ling’s expression, Pei Qianhao’s expression darkened. <em>Even if I lack experience, I was able to make yesterday a comfortable affair for Su Xi-er after studying the medical book. I have improved, which is why I’m fine with that news spreading.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Though it was true that he didn’t care about the matter, he was annoyed about Wu Ling barging into the main courtyard with a dazed expression early in the morning.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Get out.” Pei Qianhao waved his hand. He then picked up the white bowl from the table, scooping out a spoonful of porridge before feeding it to Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling shivered. <em>He behaved so coldly towards me, but as soon as he was facing the Princess Consort, his demeanour drastically changed. This change is really frightening!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>However, I still can’t leave. I still have something that I need to do.&nbsp;</em>Wu Ling took out the golden hairpin from his sleeve, the bloodstains having already been cleaned off by him. “Prince Hao, this subordinate found this golden hairpin in the grass in the backyard yesterday. It’s the Princess Consort’s jewellery.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s eyes darkened. Su Xi-er stood up from the chair and walked over to take the hairpin. “Some things happened yesterday, which resulted in me pulling out this golden hairpin and throwing it in the grass.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She had pulled out the hairpin to stab herself in order to remain conscious, throwing it on the ground so that Pei Qianhao would be able to find her. However, despite his diligent preparations, the man in black had managed to throw a wrench in their plans.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>However, the result is the same. The cliff was extremely high up, and the face of the mountain was extremely sheer. Yun Ruofeng is undoubtedly dead after falling from such a height.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao didn’t say anything as he walked closer to Su Xi-er. He would never forget the scene at the mountain summit last night. <em>She would have been pulled down by Yun Ruofeng if she had been weak, but she managed to hang on specifically because she is so strong and composed.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince will help you put it on.” Pei Qianhao took the golden hairpin from her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er slightly turned her head, and soon, the dazzling and exquisite hairpin was inserted in her hair bun. Beside the golden hairpin was the wooden hairpin carved with the characters ‘Xi’ and ‘Hao’.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The two very different hairpins looked strangely harmonious when worn together. The gentleness of the wooden hairpin and the gloriousness of the golden hairpin though in contradiction, merged to give off a sense of humble arrogance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What about the jade green dangling ornament? Are you not going to wear it as well?” Pei Qianhao asked when he realised that a piece of jewellery was missing.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er slowly smiled. “I have stowed it away. The dangling ornament is old, so I have to cherish it properly. I’ll wear it on important occasions in the future.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“As you wish.” Pei Qianhao poked her nose, and picked up the white bowl again to feed her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling could only quietly endure this scene before trying to slip away. However, Pei Qianhao called for him before he could leave. “Hold on, this Prince orders you to lead 20 elite soldiers from the army barracks to search for Prince Yun’s body under the cliff in the suburbs.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling’s expression immediately became grave. “This subordinate obeys the order.” He immediately turned around and strode off.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xi-er, here.” Pei Qianhao blew on the spoonful of porridge before moving it to her mouth.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er drank it before asking, “Could there have been a problem with the sweet red date soup? I doubt that there was an issue with the bowl that Wu Ling gave me, so could the problem have lied with the one given by Consort Dowager Guo?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xi-er, this Prince had ordered people to prepare the one sent by Consort Dowager Guo, so there shouldn’t be a problem. Both you and I have also been eating the same meals during this period of time as well, so nothing should be wrong with those either.” Pei Qianhao’s gaze turned cold. <em>She must have inhaled something.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just as he was thinking about this, another guard made his way into the main courtyard. “Prince Hao, a young lady outside the residence is requesting an audience with the Princess Consort.”</p>
