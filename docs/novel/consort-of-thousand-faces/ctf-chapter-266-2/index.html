<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>She wore a knowing smile on her face, acknowledging her mistake on her own. As such, Pei Qianhao didn’t pursue the matter any further, leading her towards the horse carriage by the hand.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A short time later, the carriage began to head back to the posthouse.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Feng Changqing watched the horse carriage disappear into the distance. <em>Seems like Prince Hao treats the Eldest Imperial Princess well. As long as she stays with him, she won’t be in danger for the time being. That being said, I never expected for Prince Yun to bring out Wei Mohai to lay his hands on the Eldest Imperial Princess so swiftly. Could it be that Prince Yun is aware of her true identity?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Feng Changqing’s eyes narrowed and filled with worry as his hands unconsciously clenched together. <em>If that’s really the case, the consequences would be unimaginable.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the meantime, the horse carriage had arrived at the posthouse. All the imperial guards from the Prince Hao Residence let out a sigh of relief when they saw Su Xi-er’s familiar figure trailing behind Pei Qianhao, but then did a double take. <em>A guard followed Prince Hao out yesterday, but why isn’t he back yet? Could it be that Prince Hao has sent him another mission?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Have a good rest in the posthouse. This Prince shall make a trip to Nanzhao’s imperial palace.” Pei Qianhao helped Su Xi-er off the carriage before getting back on himself.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>An imperial guard immediately came forward. “Prince Hao, the guard that followed you yesterday…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“He’s dead; this Prince is seeking justice for him. Bring Su Xi-er into the posthouse for a tight watch over her, and do not allow anyone to pass.” Pei Qianhao said in an icy tone before ordering the carriage driver to hurry up.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The carriage driver was a mere citizen in Nanzhao, and not a guard of the Prince Hao Residence. Startled upon learning the identity of his passenger, he started to drive the carriage even more carefully than he had before.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao knew that it was currently time for the morning assembly of Nanzhao’s court, and deliberately chose this time to meet the Emperor. His intentions were clear as day.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Yun Ruofeng had reported being ill, staying behind in his study instead of attending the morning court assembly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Yun, Commander Qin is seeking an audience.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng stopped midway through flipping the page of a book in his hand. “Let him in.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A moment later, Qin Ling had entered the study. “Prince Yun, Prince Hao and his maidservant have come out of the Literary Association. They looked normal aside from Miss Xi-er’s face being a little pale.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng clenched his fists, crumpling the book in his hand. “I understand; you may withdraw.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Yun, this subordinate saw Prince Hao heading towards the imperial palace on my way here. Would you need to head there immediately too?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hearing Qin Ling’s words, Yun Ruofeng narrowed his eyes. He placed the military book in his hands down on the table as his expression returned to normal. “No. Since Miss Xi-er is doing fine now, withdraw all the Prince Yun Residence imperial guards from the vicinity of the Literary Association.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qin Ling bowed and acknowledged the order before he turned and left.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng stood alone outside the study, his gaze falling on a pot of orchids by the side. Although it was summer, the orchids had yet to wither, and were instead in full bloom.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng slowly walked towards the pot of orchids and reached out his hand to break off a small orchid flower. Yun Ruofeng’s grip tightened around it slowly until the crushed petals began to flutter down in bits and pieces, the liquid that they had contained slowly dripping from his knuckles.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I know exactly why Pei Qianhao is heading to the imperial palace. I have made all the proper preparations, and I will lose half my power at most. It won’t be long before I can snatch it back again.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>But some things have to be solved as soon as possible. For example, this orchid flower</em><span id="footnote-ref-6c42"><a href="#footnote-6c42">[1]</a></span><em>...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A smile formed on Yun Ruofeng’s face. <em>When it comes to solving an issue, never drag it out.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hence, Yun Ruofeng exited the inner court and headed towards the stable to get a horse before riding towards the direction of the posthouse.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Su Xi-er was eating a bowl of plain porridge made by the female cook in the posthouse. She returned to her room to rest after she had finished.</p>
