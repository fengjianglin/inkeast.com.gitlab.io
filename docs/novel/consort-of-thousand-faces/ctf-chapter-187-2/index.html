 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>He was rejected again.<em>&nbsp;No matter what Yun Ruofeng says, I will not agree to it. He will not borrow my maidservant. It’s clear that he can’t find another person to dance at the state banquet, and even if he does, their figure will be very different than Ning Anlian’s.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Is he going to tell the rulers of other nations that the Eldest Imperial Princess suddenly became unwell, and that the dance is cancelled? If that happens, Nanzhao will become a laughing stock.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Right as the two of them were about to reach an impasse, the voice of a woman sounded out. “I will go.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was Su Xi-er. When she heard Pei Qianhao ordering people to put up a tent before moving all the Lingrui flowers in and locking himself inside, she had wondered what he was doing.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She had come over to take a look, but hadn’t expected to overhear the conversation between Pei Qianhao and Yun Ruofeng.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After thinking it over, she decided to go. When she walked in, a grim and cold look landed on her body. It was clear whose gaze that was.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er looked at Pei Qianhao directly. “This servant will go.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A glint of delight flickered across Yun Ruofeng’s eyes. Pei Qianhao became even more annoyed. <em>What are these two doing right in front of me!?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao stared at her and slowly demanded, “Reason.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“To prove that I am capable.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“To whom and why do you need to prove yourself?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s voice was calm. “To you, Prince Hao. You said that this servant does not have the ability to take on this huge responsibility.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao gave a cold snort. “Eavesdropping. Don’t you want your ears anymore?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“We can discuss this servant’s ears after the state banquet.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Taking the blame in front of an outsider!&nbsp;</em>A dark glint showed in Pei Qianhao’s eyes, but he chuckled. “Since you want to go, then go. Make sure to wear the purple dress, and a purple veil as well. After you finish the dance, return to the posthouse obediently and don’t stay in Nanzhao’s Imperial Palace for too long.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>These words meant that he had agreed. Prince Yun immediately said, “When it’s 5:45pm, a horse carriage from the imperial palace will secretly take you there. We will also send you back when the dance is finished.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng then turned to Pei Qianhao. “Many thanks, Prince Hao. This Prince will take my leave.” He walked out of the tent and immediately left.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Many thanks, Prince Hao.&nbsp;</em>Pei Qianhao was unhappy to hear these words. <em>It sounded like he was thanking me for allowing him and Su Xi-er to be together.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Only Su Xi-er and Pei Qianhao were left in the tent. The tension in the air was nearly tangible.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After a moment, Pei Qianhao lightly snorted. “You don’t have any explanation? Do you really think that this Prince believes you when you say it is to prove yourself?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant just wants to go. Many thanks for allowing me, Prince Hao.” <em>Of course I wanted to go for personal reasons. To dance at the state banquet was Ning Anlian’s wish; that was why I injured her ankle on purpose.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>However, I didn’t expect Yun Ruofeng to come to the posthouse and ask me to dance in her stead.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>This is no different than every other year that I danced at the state banquet. If Ning Anlian knew about this, there’s no doubt that she would be angered to death. However, this is just the start. I’ve already said that Ning Anlian will not live happily.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Many thanks to this Prince for allowing you?” Pei Qianhao’s voice was icy cold. He stepped closer and closer to Su Xi-er. “Say it again.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When she heard his tone, she knew that this was not the time to test him. As a result, she simply stood there without saying anything.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Pei Qianhao felt that he couldn’t do anything with her. <em>She is like a ball of cotton. I can’t vent my anger on her, but having to bottle it up inside feels even more stifling. I’ve never been repeatedly angered by someone like this before, much less a maidservant.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Do you know what this Prince is thinking?” A playful glint flickered across Pei Qianhao’s eyes, making it impossible to read his thoughts.</p>
