 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>

 <p>Reluctantly, Su Xi-er undid her belt and took off her red dress. Watching her, Pei Qianhao felt that Su Xi-er with her outer clothes off was extremely alluring, and even more attractive than usual.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He couldn’t help but feel a bit of elation. <em>Only I am able to witness such a sight, while others are only allowed to see her superficial outer beauty.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There was only one rack in the room, forcing Su Xi-er to shift Pei Qianhao’s robes to the side before placing her own red dress beside them.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After setting her dress down, she was struck by a thought after looking at her clothes beside Pei Qianhao’s black snake patterned robes. <em>Why are Pei Qianhao and I getting along like husband and wife?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Come here," the low voice sounded again, pulling Su Xi-er's thoughts back.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er's eyes darted over as she walked to the side of the bed. <em>With him lying on the outer side of the bed, how am I supposed to get to the inner side?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Should I just flip over him and ask him to sleep on the inner side, or go by the foot of the bed?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er chose to go by the foot of the bed, but just as she was about to do that, Pei Qianhao spoke, "You're not allowed to go by the foot of the bed."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"How else is this servant going to reach the inner side of the bed if I don't go by there? Or are you going to sleep on the inner side, Prince Hao?" Doubt filled the recesses of Su Xi-er's eyes. <em>Even I know the rules of master and servant.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>If a master sleeps with a maidservant, the maidservant can only reach the inner side by crawling up from the foot of the bed. Only the official main wife is allowed to get there by crossing over the center of the bed.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"This Prince can’t be sleeping on the inner side. Come here." Pei Qianhao sat up and placed his hands around her waist.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In a blink of an eye, Su Xi-er was on top of him. With a turn of his wrists, Pei Qianhao had brought Su Xi-er to the inner side of the bed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hence, she had crossed to the inner side, by flipping over his body. <em>Compared to the official wife, such an act is even more...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Don't talk about those dead rules in front of this Prince. Instead, you should just treat this Prince’s words as the rules." Pei Qianhao understood Su Xi-er's thoughts. <em>Her status as a maidservant means that she has to go by the foot of the bed. It’s just that… I don't want that.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao's hands didn't leave her waist. "Sleep quietly," he said and closed his eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er watched him as he slept. At this moment, all his conceitedness was shed. The cold and aloof aura that always surrounded him was gone, making him seem just like any other human.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She originally thought that he would sleep quietly. Who knew that his hands that were originally wrapped around her waist would gradually head downwards. His large hands were like fire, lighting up places that he touched; she felt uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Prince Hao, stop moving your hands."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao opened his eyes, a playful glint shimmered within. "What did this Prince do?" He asked as he moved his hands.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"You touched this servant." Su Xi-er answered and shook her legs to try to remove his touch.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"It's merely touching, this Prince isn't doing anything else."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Don't touch." Su Xi-er stated firmly, her tone sounding very much like Pei Qianhao's</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Am I supposed to obey just because you said no? Who's the master here?" Pei Qianhao snorted coldly before he picked himself up slightly and held her down.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He didn't speak a single word, only cupping her chin with one hand as the other wandered over her body.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Taking advantage of her stunned state, he swiftly lowered his head and captured her pink lips.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Their lips were locked, and their breaths mingled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er could only feel that he had complete control of her whole body, his scent wreathing around her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao's hand reached the collar of Su Xi-er's inner garment and intentionally pulled it open. In an instant, his lips had left hers and landed on her shoulders.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er's body lifted slightly as she took a sharp intake of breath. She felt a sudden pain on her shoulder as a bright red mark appeared.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"This is this Prince's mark; I'm imprinting it on you." His voice was low, asserting his power.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er looked at him, "Prince Hao, this isn't a soldering iron branding. It will fade in a few days."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Then this Prince will leave my mark again." It was clear what he meant by leaving his mark.</p>

 <p>~~~<br><strong>Cosy:</strong> Marking his territory hahahaha. Pei Qianhao is sure possessive, but he is also doting and despite her status, break all the rules for her.</p>
 <p><strong>Rakumon: </strong>*Sigh* Pei Qianhao is kinda contradictory right now. &gt;&lt; Hope he realizes his feelings soon. At least it's great that he's slightly changing in terms of not wanting her to behave like a maidservant, even treating her better than an official wife ^_^</p>
