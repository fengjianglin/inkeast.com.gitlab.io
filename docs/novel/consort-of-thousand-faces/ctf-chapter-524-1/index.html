<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>The court officials kept looking between Pei Qianhao and Du Rin, growing increasingly sure that Du Rin had come with intentions towards Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Could it be that she really plans on forging a marriage alliance? If the imperial princess of a country marries, she definitely has to be the main wife. However, that’s impossible with the already married Prince Hao.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Commander Zhao Wu’s tone couldn’t help but become reproachful when he saw no reaction from Pei Qianhao. "Prince Hao, your reputation as a brave warrior precedes you; even in the farway Western Region, your name is known far and wide. Now that we’ve arrived in Beimin, I would also like to witness your skill."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao's harsh gaze landed on Commander Zhao Wu as he coldly replied, "You can only see that on the battlefield."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Commander Zhao Wu was struck speechless. <em>Only if war is declared will I see it on the battlefield?! To think he said such a thing! The Western Region will definitely not deploy troops to Beimin, so how can there be war?!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Du Rin shook her wine cup. "Since Prince Hao isn't willing, this Princess shall not force others. Let's just leave it at that then." She downed the contents of her cup, the drops of wine left on her lips accentuating her charm.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The officials couldn't help but be stunned. <em>The Western Region Imperial Princess is so unique. It's hard to describe the aura she exudes; there's a trace of wildness in her purity, and a trace of allure in her wildness.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everyone continued to partake of their meals and wine served to them by the palace maids. Even if anyone spoke, it would only be out of courtesy. Du Rin also no longer targeted Pei Qianhao, but instead held a bewildered look in her eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Why is Xie Yun still not here?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She had yet to receive the news that Xie Yun had lost his political power, and was currently recuperating in his residence.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just when the court officials thought that the storm had passed, Du Rin suddenly made a proposition. “Your Majesty, since this Princess didn’t get to see Prince Hao’s skills, there should at least be some songs and dances during the night banquet, right?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Situ Lin nodded. “Of course, we have specially invited a renowned song house in the capital. Imperial Princess, with the differences in the Western Region and Beimin’s culture, you will get to enjoy the show as well as broaden your horizons today.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Since there will be songs and dances, there will definitely be females.” Du Rin paused before smiling at Pei Qianhao. “I wonder if Princess Consort Hao can dance?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The officials were stunned. <em>She's really targeting Prince Hao!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before Pei Qianhao could reply, Situ Lin said, "Princess Consort Hao knows everything. A mere dance isn't a problem."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Since that's the case, why don't we invite Princess Consort Hao to the palace? It's also a good opportunity for me to meet her." The corners of Du Rin's mouth curved up into a genial smile.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everyone thought that Pei Qianhao would agree, but he quickly spoke. "The Princess Consort doesn't like the noise and crowds. This Prince hopes that Your Highness can understand."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Du Rin responded, "Prince Hao really dotes on the Princess Consort. This Princess shall not make things difficult for you then, though it is a little disappointing." She then turned and walked off, leaving everyone behind. It seemed that she was heading for the posthouse that the envoys from the Western Region would be staying at.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Commander Zhao Wu looked at Pei Qianhao with a slight reproach in his eyes before swiftly following Du Rin.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After the Western Regioners had left the Imperial Garden, Beimin’s were left stealing glances at Pei Qianhao’s icy expression, frightened to the point that they didn’t dare to breathe loudly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>On the other hand, there was a visible trace of rage on Situ Lin's face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>The Western Region Imperial Princess was so arrogant and unbridled in Beimin's territory! She didn't even pay her respects before simply leaving as she wished.. Fine then, she can leave all she wants. I won't send guards to lead her to the posthouse.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Your Majesty, order the guards to take the Imperial Princess to the posthouse."</p>
