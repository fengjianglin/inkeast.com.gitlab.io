 <p>Wonderful news!<strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">Bone Painting Coroner&nbsp;</span></strong>is back!!! Our EXCEPTIONAL novel lead, <strong>Choufleur</strong>, will be releasing <strong>3 chapters a week, between Friday to Sunday</strong>!! The BPC team has been gradually expanding so that they can post more frequently.

 <p style="margin-left: 20px;"><em>Ji Yunshu was an outstanding anthropologist who was transmigrated into the body of a mistreated young girl. To survive in her new circumstances, she could only rely on her wits and the knowledge she had accumulated in her...</em></p>

<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>“Miss Qing, this servant understands my own status. I won’t try to make connections with powerful men to rise up.” Su Xi-er slowly proclaimed.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Get the latest chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>What she said was all true. <em>Invariably seeking connections to climb the social ladder will only increase a person’s sense of insecurity. Only by relying on myself will I be able to grasp everything in my hand. That is the safest.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It looks like you are quite tactful. As long as you can achieve this, I won’t make things difficult for you. You don’t have to stay here anymore. Return to your room to rest.” Miss Qing snorted. Then, she walked towards the cupboard in the room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er saw that she opened the cupboard door and had begun searching for something, just like Situ Li.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Is she looking for the woven silk fabric? There’s only a leaf and the word, ‘Yun’&nbsp;</em>embroidered on it<em>.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Go back quickly. What are you looking at me for!” Miss Qing looked straight at her, her gaze filled with disdain.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Miss Qing, please take your time to search. This servant will be going back now.” Su Xi-er immediately prepared to step out of the room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She had only taken a few steps when she heard a bellow from behind. “Who said I’m looking for something? Mind what comes out from your mouth. Otherwise, I’ll let you suffer the consequences!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er turned around and smiled slightly. “So you’re actually not searching for something. It looks like you like this place quite a lot, Miss Qing. Why don’t you rest here?” She walked away immediately after, no longer paying any attention to Miss Qing.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Miss Qing represents Prince Hao. The thing she is searching for is probably the woven silk fabric and Situ Li is also looking for it.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>This piece of woven silk fabric is definitely not as simple as it seems on the surface. Now that it’s in my hands, I have to keep it properly. It may come in handy in the future.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>On the way back to her room, Su Xi-er saw numerous palace maids from the Palace Side Quarters give her a terrified expression as they looked at her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Heavens! She really has such good fortune to have survived. Going to the woodhouse at the northwest corner, yet actually returning perfectly fine.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Exactly. The other palace maids who have been there are all dead without exception. This is too inconceivable!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In their astonishment, the palace maids watched Su Xi-er as she walked further away. Every palace maid felt that the Palace Side Quarters had started to become different. <em>Maybe some major event will happen in the future.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When she was about to reach her room, Su Xi-er saw Old Maidservant Zhao. With all the working palace maids still around them in the day, Su Xi-er was still required to put on an act. Hence, she bowed deferentially. “Old Maidservant Zhao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Old Maidservant Zhao snorted coldly and lowered her voice, “Don’t pretend in front of me after appearing so ruthless while spewing out threats! You’re no longer an obedient lamb in my eyes. Right now, I don’t dare to order you about anymore.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant is only someone who scrubs the chamber pots,” Su Xi-er replied indifferently.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Coldness suffused Old Maidservant Zhao’s eyes. Without saying anything, she flung her sleeves and left.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Watching Old Maidservant Zhao’s departing figure fade into the distance, the expression in Su Xi-er’s eyes changed slightly. <em>I must eliminate her as soon as possible.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hong Li was standing far away from them. After she saw that Old Maidservant Zhao had left, she immediately walked to Su Xi-er’s side and patted her. She lowered her voice, “Su Xi-er, Old Maidservant Zhao has begun to ostracise me. She doesn’t allow me to serve her in matters regarding her meals and everyday life, instead instructing me to monitor you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Then you should monitor me properly. Help me pass on some words to her.” She then walked towards the room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hong Li immediately followed. She was completely on Su Xi-er’s side now. <em>Whether or not I can leave the Palace Side Quarters, I have gambled it all on this person.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The two had just arrived at the room’s entrance when Su Xi-er instantly sensed that something was amiss. <em>There’s someone inside!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hong Li didn’t detect anything wrong, and was baffled as to why Su Xi-er was not opening the door.</p>
