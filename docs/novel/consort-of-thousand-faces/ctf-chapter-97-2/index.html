 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>There was a mischievous look in Pei Qianhao’s eyes. “Why do I have to alight? Don’t tell me that you mean to have this prince to stay over at this frontier?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er felt his flippancy and arrogance again. <em>Although Yun Ruofeng is the most powerful person in Nanzhao, he doesn’t amount to anything in Pei Qianhao’s eyes.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Nanzhao is greatly honoured that you have taken the time to travel all the way here. Lotus Flower County has already prepared high-quality dishes, and is awaiting your arrival.” Yun Ruofeng’s clear and sonorous voice entered Su Xi-er’s ears. It was still as mellow and rich as she remembered.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>If it had been in the past, her face would have been lit up with joy at the sound of his voice. However, all that was left now was resentment.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao glanced at Su Xi-er. <em>Why is her head lowered?&nbsp;</em>Despite the confusion in his heart, he knew that it wasn’t the time to be questioning her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Yun, since you have given plenty of face to Beimin by personally coming to receive me, how can this prince not accept the invitation? Please lead the way to Lotus Flower County.” Pei Qianhao hadn’t lifted the horse carriage curtain ever since he started speaking.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The voice streamed into Yun Ruofeng’s ears, but the owner of the voice didn’t appear.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Nanzhao’s soldiers outside the horse carriage were a little indignant. <em>Prince Yun personally came over. Even if Beimin’s Prince Hao doesn’t alight the horse carriage, he should have at least lifted the horse carriage curtains!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>He’s treating Prince Yun with contempt, and looking down on Nanzhao!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng could sense the dissatisfaction of the soldiers and cast a meaningful look to calm their emotions. Then, he replied, “Prince Hao, please rest well in your horse carriage. Lotus Flower County is just 10 miles away.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As the horse carriage continued to move, the wind blew the curtains up. Glancing outside, Su Xi-er caught sight of someone on top of a horse fully clad in white.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>White apparel with cloud designs.</em> Su Xi-er’s eyes were slightly narrowed. <em>The same clothes he wore the night that he killed me.</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Coincidentally, Yun Ruofeng’s gaze also turned around and landed on Su Xi-er sitting in the carriage. His eyes were full of unanswered questions as he continued to stare.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er raised her head to look straight at him. <em>He hasn’t changed in the least. He still has a handsome and elegant countenance. His straight eyebrows are slanted slightly upwards, and his pitch-black eyes carry a sense of confusion and contemplation.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, the horse carriage curtain was pulled down by a large hand before a man’s deep and low voice could be heard. “Have you looked enough?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er broke off her gaze. “This servant was only looking at Nanzhao’s scenery at both sides of the road.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yellow land, grey brick walls, and not many trees. The frontier’s scenery can’t even compare to half of Beimin’s. What is there to look at?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er could hear the reproach in his voice and took the initiative to give in. “This servant has never left the imperial palace, much less Beimin. It’s inevitable for this servant to be curious when coming to Nanzhao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao clearly didn’t buy her justification. “From what I see, your curiosity is not towards Nanzhao’s scenery, but Prince Yun.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He then leaned close to Su Xi-er. “Raise your head and look into this prince’s eyes.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>People’s eyes won’t lie. If she’s feeling guilty, the expression in her eyes will reflect that.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er looked him straight in the eye, completely indifferent. “Prince Hao, this servant has seen just now that Prince Yun isn’t as handsome as you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao was taken aback but quickly returned to normal. He didn’t expect her to have such a reply.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Only after thinking upon her words did he conclude that she was very clever. <em>By changing the topic, not only did she make up for her mistake in lying, she even praised me.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, this time, he wasn’t satisfied.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You are too sycophantic while trying to curry favour with me. This prince is uncomfortable.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er replied slowly, “It must be because you have sat too long in the horse carriage. It’s inevitable that you will be uncomfortable.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You have to be kidding. This prince doesn’t even feel tired when riding on a horse for a few days and nights. How would this prince feel uncomfortable just by sitting in the horse carriage?” Pei Qianhao leaned even closer. <em>Let’s see how she’s going to reply this time.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er shifted to the side. “If that’s the case, you weren’t uncomfortable, but simply scaring this servant just now.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her words caused Pei Qianhao’s face to darken. <em>What a powerful mouth. She set a trap for me to jump into.</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><em>What’s even more ridiculous is that I unsuspectingly jumped in.&nbsp;</em>Recognising this, he was even more displeased.</p>
