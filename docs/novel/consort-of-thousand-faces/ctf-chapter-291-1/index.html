 <p>“You don’t have much meat on you, and mutton can nourish your body.” Pei Qianhao cut a few pieces of mutton for her again.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It would usually be the servant serving the master, yet it was the complete opposite at this moment. Despite this, the servant wasn’t accepting the master’s kindness, causing Pei Qianhao’s expression to darken.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er knew that he was displeased and stood up to help him pour a cup of wine. “Prince Hao, this servant will serve you while you have your meal.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince orders you to eat the mutton.” Pei Qianhao didn’t look at her, and only continued to eat. His tone, however, made it clear that there was no room for resistance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er glanced at the mutton in the bowl before picking it up with her chopsticks. <em>The taste is indeed pretty good, but its preparation method is too cruel. There are many ways of cooking lamb, but roasting it whole is the only one that consists of the little lamb experiencing a slow death.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, this servant shall pick some vegetables for you.” Su Xi-er picked up her chopsticks and began to pile vegetables on Pei Qianhao’s bowl until it was full.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The latter didn’t show any response apart from continuing his meal. The conversation between the two seemed to have halted, and Su Xi-er no longer ate as she served the food to Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Approximately two hours later, the prince wiped his mouth with a handkerchief from Su Xi-er before standing up and walking out.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even when they were settling the bill, Pei Qianhao still didn’t say anything to her. Noticing the awkward atmosphere between them, the manager stared at Su Xi-er strangely. <em>What happened?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After Pei Qianhao had already walked out of Cyan Wind Pavilion, Su Xi-er smiled at the manager. “Cyan Wind Pavilion’s dishes are not bad. It’s just that the private rooms only have one type of layout. You can consider decorating them in a variety of styles according to different customs.” Su Xi-er then turned to leave the restaurant, leaving the manager rooted to the spot.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Miss is telling these words so that I can pass them on to Master.</em>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As soon as she walked out, Su Xi-er was left looking left and right. <em>Where has Pei Qianhao disappeared to? It’s only been a few moments since he walked out.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She continued searching for him, but still didn’t catch any sight of Pei Qianhao’s figure. Instead, she saw Feng Changqing walking over to Cyan Wind Pavilion.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Recalling that they were in public, Feng Changqing made a note to be courteous. “Miss Su Xi-er, why are you out here instead of staying in the posthouse?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er answered politely, “We will be leaving Nanzhao tomorrow. I was simply accompanying Prince Hao on a stroll. Where are you heading to?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’m stopping by Cyan Wind Pavilion to eat some small dishes. I’ll be packing my luggage again and following Prince Hao to Beimin tomorrow.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Su Xi-er felt a pair of eyes on her. Turning around, her gaze met with Pei Qianhao’s, who was already waiting for her a little ways away.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hence, Su Xi-er pointed to the front. “Prince Hao is ahead, so I’ll be going over.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As she passed by Feng Changqing, she heard a low voice. “Yun Ruofeng is being placed under house arrest, and Qin Ling has been dispatched outside of the capital. Meanwhile, Imperial Physician Fang has become His Majesty’s subordinate, and is currently a spy at Yun Ruofeng’s side.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A single sentence had carried a massive amount of information. Su Xi-er noticed that Pei Qianhao had noticed their exchange, prompting her to purposely slow down her footsteps. “Prince Hao values flower growing skills very much, especially when it comes to Lingrui. Remember to play your part for Beimin when you get there.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Feng Changqing put on a respectful expression. “That’s a given.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er nodded and walked forward, with Feng Changqing heading in the opposite direction.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just as she was about to reach Pei Qianhao, the latter began taking large steps forwards without waiting for her. Because her strides weren’t as long, Su Xi-er was forced to hasten her footsteps to catch up.</p>
