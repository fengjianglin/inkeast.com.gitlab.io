 <p>“Don’t worry, I won’t die. The arrow missed my heart by a finger.” Pei Qianhao’s lips were slightly pale as he raised his hand to caress her hair.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>He was shot in the left side of his chest. This technique is… the Heart-Penetrating Arrow! The man in black!</em> Su Xi-er immediately made the connection.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince is fine.” Pei Qianhao assured her, afraid that her silence indicated that she was worried.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial physician came over with the hot handkerchief. <em>Considering Prince Hao’s warm attitude towards this woman, it looks like she isn’t just anybody.&nbsp;</em>Hence, he made sure to be more respectful in his speech.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Miss, this humble subject will be helping Prince Hao remove the arrow. Please move to the side.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er nodded and moved a few steps away, her eyes never leaving Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Pei Qianhao saw her gaze, he instantly felt his heart fill with warmth. <em>Not bad, it’s worth it to have been shot by this arrow!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, this humble subject will pay attention to my strength, and the arrow will be pulled out very quickly.” The imperial physician spoke quietly as he pressed the handkerchief against Pei Qianhao’s chest, using his other hand to grab the shaft of the arrow. Before long, the blood-stained arrow emerged.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even until now, Su Xi-er’s eyes were still fixed on Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Similarly, Pei Qianhao’s gaze also never left her. <em>Women tend to be scared of blood, yet she didn’t even avert her eyes. Has she seen too much blood, or is it because she has suffered the same thing in the past?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His brows furrowed when he thought of this.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial physician immediately set the arrow aside and applied the medicinal herbs that he had ground up. After being handed a roll of bandages by Su Xi-er, it wasn’t long before he finished wrapping up Pei Qianhao’s wound.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, please focus on recovering for the next few days. Do not move too much, and try not to overexert yourself..”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao nodded. “This Prince will take note. You may withdraw.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial physician acknowledged the order and walked out with his medical box.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er immediately dashed forward and grasped his hand. “Is it very painful? I saw that your brows furrowed when the arrow was removed.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why are you not scared of blood?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er was slightly stunned by the sudden question, but quickly recovered. “I was worried because you were injured. I can only be relieved after I see that you are fine.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Only then did Pei Qianhao relax his brows. He raised his right hand, wanting to hug Su Xi-er, but was stopped by her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Don’t make such big movements. Wait, no, don’t move.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing Su Xi-er’s current behaviour, he laughed. “Putting on the airs of Princess Consort Hao and controlling this Prince?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I naturally have to tell you when you do something wrong. I will be controlling in many more aspects in the future. Are you afraid?” Su Xi-er tightened her grip on his hand as she asked.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao lowered his head and touched his forehead with hers. “This Prince will follow your wishes. But...”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“But what?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Looking at her rosy lips, a trace of playfulness emerged in Pei Qianhao’s eyes. “This Prince wants to kiss you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Right after he finished speaking, he lowered his head and captured her lips.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er was afraid that he would reach out his hand to hug her and tear the wound open. Hence, she raised her head and shut her eyes as she kissed him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The kiss gradually deepened, and their breathing became heavier. Pei Qianhao immediately stopped and hovered his lips near her cheek. “Su Xi-er, it’s this Prince’s turn to ask you. Is it painful?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s gaze immediately shifted to her thighs.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er instantly understood what he was referring to. <em>Since he has the strength to kiss me, that means that he’s fine.&nbsp;</em>With her mind at ease, she was suddenly reminded of the pain shooting throughout her body.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Is it very painful?” Pei Qianhao tightened his grip on her hand. <em>It was my first time carrying out the deed, and I was even under the influence of philtre fragrance. I couldn’t control my strength, and ended up hurting her.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’m fine, it isn’t painful.” Su Xi-er endured the pain and smiled.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Right after that, she felt another shock of pain from her legs, along with a warm feeling.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Lowering her head to take a look, she discovered that the bedsheets had already turned red from her blood.</p>
