 <p>Su Xi-er didn’t know whether she should laugh or cry as she patted Situ Lin’s shoulder. “You’ve gotten a little more eloquent after studying diligently for these past few days.. Where did you hear this from?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Although Su Xi-er was smiling, Situ Lin could discern that she was trying to sound him out. <em>I can’t possibly admit that I heard it from the palace maids, right?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Situ Lin quickly made up his mind to fabricate a lie. “I thought of it by myself. I didn’t hear it from anyone.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Really? If you’re not going to tell the truth, I’ll tell your Imperial Uncle when he comes back.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Situ Lin’s heart wildly thumped in fright. Just as he was about to beseech Su Xi-er, he heard a familiar male voice accompanied by a strong presence behind him. <em>Oh no, it’s over for me. Imperial Uncle heard it!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Tell this Prince about what?” Pei Qianhao asked as he looked at Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Situ Lin desperately cast a meaningful and pleading look at Su Xi-er. <em>Imperial Aunt, you mustn’t tell him!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er laughed. <em>Of course I won’t tell him. Besides, it’s not appropriate to mention that sort of thing.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What did you do today? Why did you come back so late?” She tried to act like she was fawning over him as she walked forward and took his hand.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing their display of affection, Situ Lin rapidly left without waiting for his Imperial Uncle to speak.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Watching Situ Lin’s figure disappear, Pei Qianhao’s brows furrowed slightly before he turned to Su Xi-er who asked, “Did you send someone to retrieve the cloth bundle that I left in the Imperial Household Department after just entering the palace?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao nodded. “Yes, this Prince will help you safeguard it.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Shouldn’t you let me have a look at its contents?” Su Xi-er smilingly asked. <em>I want to see the items that belong to the owner of this body.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You said that you’ve left the past behind, and won’t care about your so-called relatives. How come you want those things again?” Pei Qianhao wrapped his arm around her waist, putting his forehead against hers.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Can’t I just have a look? It’s been more than 10 years after all.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing how persistent she was, Pei Qianhao eventually gave in. “Wu Ling, come in.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling entered the hall. “Prince Hao, do you have any instructions?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Bring Princess Consort Hao’s things out.” Despite Pei Qianhao keeping his voice even, being able to use the name, ‘Princess Consort Hao’ made him inwardly delighted.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling took out the folded cloth bundle from his sleeve, but the paper that contained Su Xi-er’s origins had been burnt to ashes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao hadn’t initially planned to destroy the evidence of Su Xi-er’s background, but after finding out she was actually Ning Rulan, he changed his mind.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er took the cloth bundle and placed it on the table, beginning to look through its contents.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The cloth bundle was very small, but contained a tiny and exquisite pouch among other things. When she opened it up, Su Xi-er was stunned by what she saw.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They were three small stones that had been polished until they were extremely round and smooth. Su Xi-er was reminded of the children from farmer families. <em>Without enough money to buy their children toys, the most the kids could do was play with stones. The real Su Xi-er must have played with these stones from a young age, resulting in their current smooth appearance. She had carried them around and treated them like a treasure, even bringing them with her for safekeeping in the Imperial Household Department.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Currently, the colour of the three stones had faded after many years of neglect. Su Xi-er actually felt her heart aching in sorrow as she gazed at them for a long time.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao came forward to see what she was looking at.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, did you play with stones when you were young?” Su Xi-er couldn’t help but ask.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hearing the melancholy in her voice, Pei Qianhao hugged her from behind before whispering in her ear. “It’s been too long. This Prince doesn’t remember.”</p>
