 <p style="margin-left: 20px;"><em>Ji Yunshu was an outstanding anthropologist who was transmigrated into the body of a mistreated young girl. To survive in her new circumstances, she could only rely on her wits and the knowledge she had accumulated in her...</em></p> 
 <p> <a href="/announcement/bpc-resumes-and-pgc-quiz-results">Read More...</a> </p> 
</div>
<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>This time, the madwoman became extremely queer and her eyes sparkled brightly. “Commandery Prince Xie...you know him? Where is he?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Old Maidservant Zhao gnashed her teeth in hatred. She regretted telling Su Xi-er to go to the woodhouse at the northwest corner. She had originally wanted to frighten her a little while she checked how things were going on He Ying’s side. If the Empress Dowager was adamant about killing Su Xi-er, she would join hands with He Ying and kill Su Xi-er in the woodhouse.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>That way, Su Xi-er would no longer be able to threaten her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>However, I didn’t expect that Liu Ye-er would run out.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Commandery Prince Xie is naturally in the Commandery Prince Residence. You know him?” Su Xi-er spoke with a gentle tone and a smile on her face.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I...I want to meet him so much. He doesn’t even know that I…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Liu Ye-er hadn’t finished speaking before Old Maidservant Zhao knocked her head fiercely. “Don’t spout nonsense. We’re leaving!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She didn’t allow Liu Ye-er the chance to speak anymore, proceeding to drag her away forcefully.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This time, Su Xi-er didn’t speak again but looked at their departing figures.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Why does Old Maidservant Zhao treat Liu Ye-er so differently? Her attitude is completely like a mother protecting her child. Is it possible that...&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er laughed. <em>If that’s really true, Liu Ye-er offended Xie Yun, and is also related to Old Maidservant Zhao. Wouldn’t Xie Yun want to find trouble for Old Maidservant Zhao?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You’re unexpectedly not scared at all by coming here.” The clear and mellow voice of a man suddenly sounded. It was not far away from behind Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s brow was knitted. <em>Based on the voice, it’s the Third Imperial Prince.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Is he idle with nothing to do? He even came to the woodhouse at the northwest corner of the Palace Side Quarters.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant pays her respect to the Third Imperial Prince.” Su Xi-er bent her knees and bowed, displaying respect and courtesy.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“When I speak to you, I have never addressed myself as, ‘this imperial prince’. You can also dispense with the formalities.” Situ Li was still donned in white clothes and he was carefully sizing Su Xi-er up.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Third Imperial Prince, why did you come here?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Situ Li’s expression was chilly but he joked, “If I say that I came specifically to see you, would you believe me?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant naturally wouldn’t believe that.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Are you so sure about that?” Situ Li raised his hand, almost touching her face.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er took a step back. “Do you know why Old Maidservant Zhao told me to come to this woodhouse?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“She’s telling you not to forge connections with puissant patronages.” Situ Li’s clear and cold voice escaped from his lips.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>It looks like he is aware of the matter regarding Liu Ye-er. However, He Ying previously mentioned that the Third Imperial Prince had just returned to the imperial palace recently.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>He’s far away in the county city, yet is so clear about matters of the imperial palace. Is it because it involves&nbsp;</em><em>Commandery</em><em>&nbsp;Prince Xie?”</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Su Xi-er, women who are beautiful and intelligent don’t live long in the imperial palace.” Situ Li placed his hand down and softly muttered.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant is stupid and doesn’t understand what you mean, Third Imperial Prince.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Pretending to be foolish.” Situ Li actually laughed before turning around and heading towards the woodhouse.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Strange. For what purpose did the Third Imperial Prince come to the abandoned woodhouse in the Palace Side Quarters?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er was puzzled and followed him in.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She saw him sweep his eyes over the old items before going to rummage through the cupboard as if he was searching for something.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Finally, he came to the wooden table and looked at the words on it.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Ye-er,” he read in a low voice.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>‘Ye-er’ was the name carved on the wooden table. Su Xi-er immediately continued, “This ‘Ye-er’ is referring to Liu Ye-er, the palace maid from the Palace Side Quarters. Third Imperial Prince, you are curious about her?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“She’s a mere palace maid from the Palace Side Quarters with no special traits at all. She’s not worthy for me to be curious.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Then what did you come here for tonight, Third Imperial Prince?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Situ Li raised his head to look at her. “I came to see you but you didn’t believe me.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant is also a palace maid from the Palace Side Quarters with no special traits. Third Imperial Prince, you shouldn’t be curious.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She felt that there was an overtone in the Third Imperial Prince’s words, but she was unable to discern it at this point and guess his reason for doing this.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Your words just now are already enough to prove that you stand out from the rest.”</p>
