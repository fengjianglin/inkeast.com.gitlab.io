 <p>All of a sudden, Pei Qianhao stopped in his tracks. This time, Su Xi-er reacted swiftly and didn’t bump into him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s gaze appeared to be gentle, but his voice was very cold. “What did you talk to the flower grower about?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, since you have chosen him, this servant was naturally reminding him to do the job well.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao scrutinised Su Xi-er for a moment longer before continuing his on the path back to the posthouse. “Follow.” The faint word streamed into Su Xi-er’s ears.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Pei Qianhao seems to be especially capricious with his actions today.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the two of them were back at the posthouse, Pei Qianhao entered the hall and sat at the head seat without uttering a single word. He watched as Su Xi-er took her place at the side before finally breaking the silence. “Go to this Prince’s room. You will be sleeping in there tonight.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>He doesn’t speak often, but when he does, his words are enough to shock everyone.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The few imperial guards standing in the hall were stunned when they heard Prince Hao’s words. <em>He’s really taking in Su Xi-er! There’s going to be a new addition to the Beauty Palace.&nbsp;</em>What they didn’t know was that the Beauty Palace had already been dissolved.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er had to give face to Pei Qianhao in front of others, so she could do little but bow and leave. However, she returned to her own room instead of going to his.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After she had left, Pei Qianhao asked the imperial guards, “Has Wu Ling’s letter arrived yet?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>One of the imperial guards shook his head. “No.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Withdraw.” Pei Qianhao waved his hand, signalling for the guards to stand outside the hall.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Wu Ling hasn’t sent a letter, so it would appear that things are progressing smoothly. Still, we’ll speed up when we leave for tomorrow so that we can reach Beimin’s capital within two days.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>We have left Beimin for so long; there will undoubtedly be many state affairs to handle once I get back.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Ning Lianchen spotted Eunuch Fu anxiously waiting for him when he returned to the imperial palace.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Noticing the Emperor, Eunuch Fu immediately went forward. “Your Majesty, Miss Yinyin is making a scene in the palace after finding out that Grand Tutor Liu is dead.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Lianchen hadn’t seen Liu Yinyin ever since he took her to the palace. <em>I’m the Emperor, and she hates the Emperor. She has been thinking that I am only a subordinate this entire time.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>With the dragon robes I’m wearing now, it’s all the more inappropriate for me to meet her.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hence, he waved his hand. “Instruct the palace maids to look after her properly.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Immediately after the words left his mouth, a palace maid came frantically running. “Your Majesty, Miss Yinyin has run towards the direction of the Imperial Garden!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Lianchen swiftly departed for the garden without another word, leaving Eunuch Fu to watch his departing figure. <em>I was the one who deliberately sent someone to let Liu Yinyin find out about Grand Tutor Liu’s death. This way, it can divert His Majesty’s attention.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As for Prince Yun, Eunuch Fu already knew that Imperial Physician Fang was likely staying in the Prince Yun Residence for now. <em>No one knows exactly what Prince Yun’s condition is right now.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Lianchen rushed to the Imperial Garden, his dragon robes exposing his identity. Liu Yinyin was walking on a small path in a panic after losing her way. <em>I don’t want to stay here. I want to return to the Liu Residence!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yinyin.” Ning Lianchen called out to her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Liu Yinyin heard the familiar voice, she was elated. <em>Big Brother is here to send me back to the Liu Residence!&nbsp;</em>However, she stiffened when she turned around and saw Ning Lianchen dressed in lustrous dragon robes<span id="footnote-ref-9f3e"><a href="#footnote-9f3e">[1]</a></span>. No matter how young and ignorant she was, she would still have a general idea of what the dragon robes looked like. <em>The one wearing the dragon robes can only be the Emperor!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>My Big Brother is actually the Emperor! I hate His Majesty for snatching Daddy away, yet now I am being told that Daddy and Mommy have died, leaving the Liu Residence destroyed!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Liu Yinyin was frozen in astonishment, her limpid eyes never leaving Ning Lianchen for a single moment.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Lianchen walked towards her. “Yinyin, don’t be scared. Even if your Daddy isn’t around, you still have me. I’ll look after you until you grow up.”</p>
