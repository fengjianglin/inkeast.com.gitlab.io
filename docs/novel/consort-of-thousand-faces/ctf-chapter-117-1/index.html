 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>Pei Qianhao walked over and used his right hand on Su Xi-er’s waist as leverage to lay her flat on the bed, pulling up a quilt to cover her afterwards. However, just as he had finished doing so, Su Xi-er flipped the quilt open with a mischievous expression, her cheeks more flushed than ever.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>With how much she moves while sleeping, it’s no wonder that she’s still sick.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao pulled up the corner of the quilt to cover her again, but she raised her hand and grabbed him with a smile on her face. If she didn’t have her eyes closed and act so strangely, he would have thought that she was awake.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Su Xi-er giggled a few times and held Pei Qianhao’s hand tighter and tighter, as if he was an indispensable part of her life.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Pei Qianhao’s face darkened again when she called out sweetly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Mum…” When she had been Ning Rulan, she had always called her empress mother ‘mum’. In front of others though, she would call her ‘empress mother’.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Her words are undoubtedly proof that she is dreaming about her mother.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But, she was holding Pei Qianhao’s hand&nbsp;ー&nbsp;a man’s hand. Although he knew that she was dreaming, she still referred to him as ‘mum’...</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s eyes were dark as he lowered himself next to her ear and whispered in a low voice, “Is this prince your mum? You have a mum like this prince?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Although she was still asleep, Su Xi-er could still instinctually feel the danger in his voice. She immediately released his hand, turning her body to one side and facing away from him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao silently observed her, quietly covering her with a quilt before taking a seat on a wooden chair on the side and rubbing his forehead softly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the voice of an imperial guard sounded from outside of the room, Pei Qianhao stood up and walked outside immediately. Upon opening the door, he silenced the guard with a cold glare.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard immediately trembled with fear and kept his voice very low. “Prince Hao, everything has been handled. The case of the Wei Miss’ will be closed tomorrow.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao nodded. “Keep an eye on Su Xi-er tomorrow. Don’t let her out of the posthouse.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard nodded a few times in a row. “Obeying the orders.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>While everything was quiet and peaceful in the posthouse, it was a different story in the outskirts of the capital...</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The next day, Su Xi-er opened her sleepy eyes with a hangover. <em>I have drunk too much wine last night.</em> She surveyed her surroundings... <em>This is… Prince Hao’s room.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Did he carry me in here last night?&nbsp;</em>Su Xi-er knitted her eyes and lifted the quilt open. When she saw that her grey Chinese bodice was lying on the bed, she couldn’t help but be in a bit of a daze.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>My outer clothes have disappeared, and my bodice has fallen off. What happened last night?&nbsp;</em>Su Xi-er’s head was hurting again; the more she thought about it, the more it hurt.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She rubbed her forehead until the headache subsided a bit, then proceed to pick up her bodice and put it on. Looking around the base of the bed, she found her outer clothes lying next to a long strip of cloth.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er observed the cloth as she dressed. <em>It looks like it was forcibly torn by someone. Did I do it while I was drunk yesterday?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Su Xi-er, your medicine is here.” The female cook’s voice sounded from the outside.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er nodded then remembered that her coarse clothes were the female cook’s.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I specially simmered it for six hours last night, but you were already asleep at that time, so I followed Prince Hao’s orders to keep it warm for you, and I didn’t get to sleep the whole night.” The female cook handed over the bowl of medicine with a big smile, then realised that Su Xi-er was wearing her clothes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I didn’t know you like to wear coarse clothes. I have some more that were made a few days ago from new fabrics. I can bring them to you if you would like.”</p>
