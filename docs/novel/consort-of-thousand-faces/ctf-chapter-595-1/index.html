<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Du Ling patted the Grand Empress Dowager on her back and said, “The carriage has already left. Let’s go back.” He then signalled to the eunuch nearby.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The eunuch walked up to them and said, “Grand Empress Dowager, it’s cold outside. Let us return to the palace.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Grand Empress Dowager nodded and headed back unwillingly, secretly hoping that the pills she had given Rulan would work.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er lay against Pei Qianhao in the carriage and took out the military tally, waving it in front of him. “A quarter of the military power.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao smiled. “A quarter of the military power was used as a dowry for Princess Consort Hao, the Imperial Princess of the Western Region. The news has already reached Beimin, and I can only imagine that everyone will look at you differently from now on.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er knew very well that even though no one dared to openly defy her in the past, most still felt that she was not a good partner for Pei Qianhao due to her humble background.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As Pei Qianhao hugged her tight, he felt a tiny bottle in her sleeve. “What’s this?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Royal Grandmother gave this to me; she said it would help to warm my body.” Su Xi-er smiled and snuggled in closer to him. “Royal Grandmother even told me that men can’t resist temptations. She asked me to keep a close eye on you if I get pregnant in future. You’re not a monarch, so you don’t have to take more than one wife.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao rested his chin on her head as he said, “You’d be the only one for me, even if I am a monarch.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s heart skipped a beat. <em>A monarch without a harem is something that only happens in a play; no matter how faithful a monarch is, it is still impossible in real life.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao explained hastily, afraid that she’d misunderstand. “I won’t be a monarch. I’ll only be supporting the monarch.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I trust you, A-Jing.” Su Xi-er smiled at him and snuggled against his chest.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They switched to a camel-drawn carriage when they reached the desert, and back to a horse-drawn one before they finally arrived in Beimin after more than ten days on the road.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The guards in the city had already been notified of their arrival, and the commoners were lined up along the streets, eagerly waiting to welcome them back. <em>Who would have expected for Princess Consort Hao to actually be the Imperial Princess of the Western Region! The princess who visited Beimin previously and was full of airs is a fake!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er heard the cheers of the commoners as they rode through the city gates, spotting many joyful faces among the crowd through the curtains.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>One of them yelled after getting a glimpse of Su Xi-er’s profile. “I saw the Imperial Princess! She’s much prettier than the fake one from before!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The crowd was stirred up, and the guards had to stop them from crowding the carriage. Suddenly, one of the commoners knelt and cried out, “Long live the Imperial Princess!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The surrounding commoners followed suit as they knelt and bowed to pay their respects, and their voices could be heard long after the carriage had disappeared from sight.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The commoners began discussing Su Xi-er after the guards left.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The Imperial Princess controls part of the military in the Western Region. Her dowry isn’t jewellery, it’s military power!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“That’s amazing! She can use it against Prince Hao if he ever dares to bully her!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“No way, Prince Hao is a good man, and would never bully his princess consort.” A young girl commented. The women in Beimin saw Prince Hao as a hero, and he was the ideal partner for many of them, so they wouldn’t allow others to speak bad of him without reason.</p>
