 <p>“This subordinate obeys the order.” The imperial guard hastily left.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao could no longer remain sitting in the posthouse. <em>Perhaps the reason that Su Xi-er hasn’t returned isn’t because she doesn’t want to, but because she can’t. After all, the one sent after her was Wei Mohai. Even if the latter has died, it doesn’t necessarily mean that Su Xi-er was left unscathed...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this thought, Pei Qianhao immediately walked out of the main hall and headed straight for the posthouse’s main entrance. The imperial guards standing at the entrance of the posthouse didn’t even dare to breathe when they saw the chilly aura surrounding Pei Qianhao. They shot each other baffled looks after the prince had left.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Finally, one of them suggested, “I’ll go and follow Prince Hao in case he needs to instruct someone.” He then quickly ran to catch up to Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao carefully observed his surroundings as he strolled around. After some time, he realised that all the drug stores had been forcibly closed down.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Sigh, what am I going to do with all the drug stores closed down when my wife is sick?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“That’s right! Even the mountains are sealed off, so I can’t even pick herbs on my own. I can endure the little cold that I have now, but it wouldn’t be so simple if I had some major illness!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Exactly, why did Prince Yun give such an order? He stated that he can only rescind the order after Commander Wei’s murderer is apprehended.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s eyebrows knitted, his steps becoming heavy now that he understood what was going on.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There was a bad premonition in his heart. <em>All the medicine stores are closed, and the mountains are cordoned off, preventing anyone from picking herbs on their own. If Su Xi-er is heavily injured without access to any medicine...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao recalled what one of the civilians had said just now and became uneasy. <em>“I can endure the little cold that I have now, but it wouldn’t be so simple if I had some major illness!”</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao looked straight ahead, an inexplicable feeling in his heart telling him that Su Xi-er was at the Literary Association.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao began walking towards the Literary Association immediately after this occurred to him, even forgetting to hail a horse carriage. It had to be said that the Literary Association was quite a distance away- taking over two hours by foot unless you were leaping on the roofs.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the imperial guard following Pei Qianhao saw his pace speed up, he immediately proposed, “This subordinate will bring a horse carriage over.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Coincidentally, a young man with a wine pot at his waist walked by; it was none other than Yu Xiao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao recalled seeing him when the Literary Association was condemning Prince Yun. <em>This man was beside Su Xi-er.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao waved his hand, signalling for the imperial guard to leave. He then walked towards Yu Xiao and coldly looked at him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You are?” Yu Xiao’s expression was solemn. The man’s cold and imposing aura put him on his guard.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The woman in a cyan dress. She was wearing a jade green dangling hair ornament.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yu Xiao immediately understood. <em>This man before me knows Miss. It’s just that her dangling ornament has gone missing.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Despite this, he still didn’t dare to let his guard down. “Who are you? Why are you telling me this?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“She’s this Prince’s servant girl. How is she doing?” Pei Qianhao lowered his cold voice.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yu Xiao was stunned. <em>This Prince’s servant girl? This man before me isn’t Prince Yun but... Prince Hao of Beimin! Miss is actually Prince Hao’s servant girl.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yu Xiao wasn’t sure about Prince Hao’s character, but Beimin’s national strength was ranked first. <em>As the Prince Regent of a strong nation like Beimin, his personality should at least be decent.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Miss is in the Literary Association. She is severely injured, and is still unconscious. I helped her release the poisonous blood yesterday, but I need a type of medicinal herb. I’m currently on my way to the mountains to pick it, but I’m afraid that Miss won’t be able to hold on. She needs to keep a piece of ginseng in her mouth just to hold on.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s eyebrows were scrunched up. <em>Severely injured and needing ginseng to hold on to her life...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, I’ll leave the matter of the ginseng to you. I’ll be going to pick the herbs now.” Yu Xiao turned to head for the suburbs.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao immediately instructed the imperial guard. “Secretly follow him and protect him to ensure that he successfully obtains the herbs.”</p>
