 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>

 <p>Pei Qianhao ignored the smell of wine drifting into his nose, seemingly unbothered as he put down the wine cup. “You don’t have anything else to tell this prince?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s expression was very composed. “This servant went out for a stroll, saw that the teahouse was bustling, and decided to walk inside. After that, just like the waiter explained, he saw this servant.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The corner of Pei Qianhao’s mouth raised as he spoke in a steadfast tone. “This prince believes that the two Miss’ from the Wei Family weren’t murdered by you, but that you had probably pretended to be their handmaid to teach them a lesson.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>What he said is right; I only wanted to teach them a lesson.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Unfortunately, someone wants to plant the blame on you.” Prince Hao listed out his logical deductions in a low and deep voice.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er didn’t try to curry favour with him this time, directly replying, “Prince Hao, you sure are attentive, being able to accurately guess what happened despite not being a witness.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This prince believes that you are not trying to flatter me this time, and that your comment comes from the heart.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er looked at him in puzzlement. <em>He even saw through that. I really want to ask how he could tell.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“If this prince doesn’t deal with this matter, it will come back to you sooner or later. When the time comes, even if you have a hundred mouths, you wouldn’t be able to explain yourself.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, no matter what angle they investigate this from, this matter has nothing to do with this servant...”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before she could finish, she was interrupted by Pei Qianhao. “If this prince deals with it, then isn’t it minding someone else’s business? You have already broken the rules by sneaking out. Moreover, you are the maidservant of this prince. Why lie and pretend to be the maidservant of the Wei Miss’ when you can pretend to be anything else.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er was unsure why he was angry. <em>Is it because of what I had said, or because I pretended to be the maid of the Wei Miss’?”</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Tell me, why did you go to the private room on the second floor of the teahouse. How did they provoke you?” Pei Qianhao suddenly stood up close to her, the smell of wine entering her nose.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er raised her head to look at him. “This servant has told you before. The Wei Miss’ were arguing with each other on the streets about who would become Princess Consort Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“So you decided to punish them because of what they said?” A glint of interest flickered across Pei Qianhao’s eyes, his hand looping under her chin to raise it up.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Su Xi-er suddenly turned her head dodged him. “If this servant had wanted to punish them because of that, I would have taken care of them on the street. When this servant came to the teahouse and surveyed my surroundings, I spotted a mysterious man on the second floor. As this servant was curious, I pretended to be the maid of the Wei Miss’. This servant couldn’t go to the second floor with my current status, so I could only pretend to be a maidservant. But when I went to the second floor, the mysterious man disappeared, and I heard the Wei Miss’ were…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s suddenly felt a pain at her waist. She stopped talking as Pei Qianhao’s eyes shot out a chilling look.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Curious about a mysterious man?” Pei Qianhao chuckled, his laugh containing a trace of sarcasm. “You are easily fooled, just like a pet dog that would wag its tail and fawn over anyone who gives you a bit of good food. Tonight, you saw the mysterious man and chased after him in curiosity; will you also chase after a handsome man tomorrow if you see one?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s face was serious. “Prince Hao, you are the most handsome and powerful man in this world. If this servant had that kind of intention, I would have concentrated on only flirting with you from the start; why should I show interest in an unknown man?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You are not bootlicking correctly this time.” Pei Qianhao narrowed his eyes slightly, his chilly gaze aimed directly at Su Xi-er.</p>
