<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Casting caution to the wind, Su Xi-er immediately pulled the bed quilt over to cover her upper body before shifting back and leaning against the bedpost, looking at Pei Qianhao vigilantly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The more one looked at her, the more she looked like she had been bullied. The more she evaded him, the more Pei Qianhao wanted to approach her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His body leaned forward, cutting off her path of retreat. “Scared of this prince? Averse to men? Or are you scared of all men?” His voice became increasingly low as he lowered his head to stare into her eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, Pei Qianhao detected that there was something strange about Su Xi-er’s expression. <em>In the past, she remained unruffled no matter what I did. Now however, she can’t hide the sense of panic and the desire to escape in her eyes.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er turned her head away, not looking at Pei Qianhao. She was currently struggling to suppress the various emotions that were rushing through her heart; biting her lip, not speaking and not looking at him were simply all she could manage to do at this moment.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She was afraid that if she didn't, she would recklessly disobey him without regards for the consequences.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This time, however, Pei Qianhao didn’t plan to let her off. He pulled her back to face him, gently caressing her smooth skin as he did so.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His grip was harsh in one moment, yet gentle the next. When Pei Qianhao saw her knitted slender eyebrows, he queried, “Something must have happened for you to detest men this much. You entered the imperial palace at a young age and have been on duty in the Palace Side Quarters since. Could it be that some things occurred after you entered the palace?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er remained quiet. With his grip on her chin, she couldn’t turn or lower her head, forcing her to raise her head and look into his eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s aversion to men was such that she would loathe even interacting with them at a close range. Her current position had her eyelashes slightly fluttering and clutching her fists tightly around the sheets.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>This place is only Zhi County. If we travel as quickly as possible on horses, we will reach Nanzhao’s frontier in 4-5 days.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Nanzhao...Nanzhao!</em> Afraid that the emotions in her heart would be given away, Su Xi-er immediately closed her eyes. <em>With my eyes closed, the darkness would then be able to encircle me. Although I won’t be able to see anything, Pei Qianhao will also not be able to read my thoughts.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Interesting.” A deep and low voice streamed into Su Xi-er’s ears. Then, a large hand moved down along her cheeks and neck.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao was sounding her out to find out when she would open her eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He pinched her waist hard, but Su Xi-er gave little reaction besides a slight tremble, her eyes still closed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The corners of Pei Qianhao mouth were raised slightly. One hand held her head, while the other lifted the quilt as he used it to cover the two of them. At the same time, he suddenly lowered his head, accurately capturing her cherry pink lips.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>While Su Xi-er was unable to completely ward him off, she still used her hands to push against his chest with all her might, the rest of her body squirming around in an attempt to escape.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Pei Qianhao’s momentum became increasingly intense as he pried open her teeth.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er could no longer bear it and opened her eyes, ferociously biting his lips.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Due to the amount of strength she put into her bite, the smell of blood blossomed between the two of them in an instant. Retreating, Pei Qianhao’s lips were marred by a bright red line where he had been bitten. Despite this, he still smiled devilishly and managed to pinch Su Xi-er once again, causing her to tremble.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Obstinate temper.” He laughed and licked his lips. “The taste is not bad.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er turned her head away, her fists clenched even tighter.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“If this prince really wanted to eat you, could you have resisted? In this world, there is no woman who can disobey this prince. Of course, this prince still won’t force people.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s gaze landed on the grey Chinese bodice on the floor. “However, it’s this prince’s first time seeing someone with a temper as stubborn as yours. If you provoke this prince, it may even be possible for me to violate my principles and take you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Unbridled. Arrogant. Overbearing. All these words describing powerful men could be applied to Pei Qianhao.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s slender eyebrows were slightly scrunched up as she turned her head to look at him. “Prince Hao, why do you waste your time on this servant? This servant is merely a palace maid from the Palace Side Quarters whose body stinks from scrubbing the chamber pots. Don’t you find someone like that beneath you? Or do you like the smell of the chamber pots?”</p>
