 <p>Within the Compassionate Peace Palace, a woman clad in an elegant pink dress was lying on the bench. Her features were delicate and pretty, smooth porcelain skin accented by a pair of bright eyes underneath her arched willow-leaf shaped eyebrows<span id="footnote-ref-d940"><a href="#footnote-d940">[1]</a></span>. Her right hand waved a small round hand fan<span id="footnote-ref-344c"><a href="#footnote-344c">[2]</a></span> to and fro lightly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span>“Empress Dowager, Imperial Bodyguard Wu has arrived.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Summon him to come in,” a faint voice slipped out from the woman’s lips. She was still waving the round fan in her hand.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Who would have expected that the seemingly innocent woman was already the esteemed Empress Dowager.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“This subordinate pays his respects to the Empress Dowager. May I know for what matter I was called here?” Wu Ling bowed and made his greetings. Although he behaved deferentially, it could be heard from his words that he wasn’t the Empress Dowager’s subordinate, and he didn’t need to take orders from her.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Audacious! How dare you speak to the Empress Dowager like this!” He Ying glared. A bright glint flashed across her eyes as she glared daggers at Wu Ling.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Xiao He<span id="footnote-ref-16c1"><a href="#footnote-16c1">[3]</a></span>, go to one side. Imperial Bodyguard Wu, this Empress Dowager naturally called you over because I have something to ask.” Pei Yaran stood up from the bench and swayed her round fan as she walked towards Wu Ling.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span>“Imperial Bodyguard Wu, where did you find Prince Hao this morning?” She spoke smilingly with an inquiring tone.&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“The woods beside the Palace Side Quarters.” These few simple words caused Pei Yaran to furrow her brow. She also stopped swaying her fan.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“To think he was in such a good mood and ran there.” Pei Yaran chuckled. Her expression stiffened for a split second before returning to normal.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Empress Dowager, if you have any questions, please ask directly. This subordinate still has matters to handle.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Pei Yaran sneered, her voice shrill. “Capturing a woman is called handling matters? From now on, you don’t have to mention this matter again. Creating such a commotion just for a woman is really a joke!”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Empress Dowager, this matter was instructed by Prince Hao. If you’re dissatisfied, you can tell Prince Hao.” Wu Ling was neither supercilious nor servile and had a stern expression. It was precisely such an appearance that infuriated Pei Yaran.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“You!” She raised her hand. Her face was full of ire. “Alright, this Empress Dowager will tell Prince Hao. Xiao He, go with this empress dowager to the Beauty Palace.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Empress Dowager!” He Ying was anxious. <em>The 72 concubines Prince Hao is raising live in the Beauty Palace. How can the Empress Dowager go to such a place?</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Prince Hao is not in the Beauty Palace.” Wu Ling’s words set He Ying’s heart at ease.&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Pei Yaran threw the round paper fan heavily onto the ground. “Where is he?”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>She had been worried as he had been drinking yesterday, immediately ordering people to search for him as soon as he had gone missing. They searched for the entire night but to no avail. Early this morning, she had received news that Prince Hao had fainted in the woods beside the Palace Side Quarters last night, even going as far as to instruct Wu Ling to find the woman he had encountered near the Palace Side Quarters last night.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>She had called Wu Ling to ascertain the veracity of this piece of news.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Previously, he had taken a palace maid from the Palace Side Quarters to the Beauty Palace. In the past, she had turned a blind eye to the 72 concubines of the Beauty Palace, but she could no longer endure it now!</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“When has this prince ever needed you to interfere with my matters?” A deep and low male voice could be heard. When she looked in the direction of the voice, there was a man donned in purple robes with snake patterns. His hair was tied up with a blue silk thread, a round fretwork jade pendant<span id="footnote-ref-6e94"><a href="#footnote-6e94">[4]</a></span> hanging at his waist.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span>As he moved, his imposing manner was to the point that it felt oppressive.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>This aura caused all of Pei Yaran’s temper to dissipate. When He Ying noticed it, she immediately bowed and withdrew.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Wu Ling, withdraw.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“This subordinate obeys.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Only Pei Qianhao and Pei Yaran were remaining in the Compassionate Peace Palace.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Pei Yaran’s fierce bearing immediately vanished, the charming attitude of a little girl emerging on her visage. She raised her right hand to grab Pei Qianhao’s. “Elder Brother, am I or the women in the Beauty Palace more important in your heart?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao looked at her and raised his hand to touch her forehead.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Elder Brother…” Pei Yaran seized the opportunity to hug him and rest her head against his chest.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“You are my younger sister. How can those women compare to you?” He pushed her away and walked to a table to pour himself a cup of green tea. Pei Yaran bit her lips firmly. <em>Younger sister. It’s younger sister again! I have no blood relations with him at all! How do I count as a younger sister! What I don’t want to be the most is to be his younger sister. I want to be his woman!</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Hao…” She changed her manner of address and slowly approached him.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao turned around to look at her and automatically took a step back, increasing the distance between them.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Whether I will pursue the matter regarding the palace maid will depend on my mood. If you’re bored in the Compassionate Peace Palace, get Xiao He to accompany you to the Imperial Garden. The Purple Fragrance Flowers transplanted from Xiliu last year have bloomed.” He then put his teacup down and turned around to leave.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Watching his retreating figure, Pei Yaran was unable to speak and clenched her fists tight. <em>Does he actually like me or not? Or does he fear the Three Cardinal Guides and the Five Constant Virtues</em><span id="footnote-ref-b21a"><a href="#footnote-b21a">[5]</a></span><em>?</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Empress Dowager, Prince Hao has already left.” He Ying felt something clutching her heart. She was very clear about the Empress Dowager’s intentions towards Prince Hao.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Xiao He, I’m only eighteen years old. Why must he do this to me?” Tears trickled down endlessly from Pei Yaran’s eyes.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>He Ying bit her lips, feeling sorry for her. “I understand your pain. With how many years you have been together, Prince Hao definitely likes you. But with the current situation, Prince Hao has no choice but to keep you distant. The Beauty Palace is just another ruse for deceiving the public.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em>The Beauty Palace is used to mislead the public?&nbsp;</em>Pei Yaran’s eyes shone. “Xiao He, if that’s really the case…”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Empress Dowager, after eliminating Commandery Prince Xie and the other imperial princes, there will no longer be anyone in the court who dares to say no to the Pei Family. At that time, Prince Hao will marry you.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Xiao He, if he really thinks that…” Pei Yaran’s face was full of joy.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Empress Dowager, this servant has already investigated. The palace maid Prince Hao took with him from the Palace Side Quarters is related to Commandery Prince Xie.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Hm? Related to Xie Yun? Explicate it specifically.” Pei Yaran had a stern expression. Her misery as a woman had vanished, and her aura as an Empress Dowager reappeared.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“That palace maid is He Xiangyu, the one you just disciplined. She had previously offended Commandery Prince Xie, but her good sister Su Xi-er took the blame for her. Only after that did He Xiangyu meet Prince Hao and enter the Beauty Palace.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>When He Ying spoke until here, she paused. “Commandery Prince Xie is someone who will seek revenge for even the smallest grievances. How could he have forgiven a person who had really offended him? As for the matter of Su Xi-er taking the blame, Commandery Prince Xie didn’t pursue.”</p>

 <p>“Xiao He, instruct the maid in charge of the Palace Side Quarters to dispose of Su Xi-er as quickly as possible. Leave He Xiangyu’s life first.” The corners of Pei Yaran’s mouth were raised as her eyes filled with viciousness.</p>

 <p>“Su Xi-er, sit. I personally instructed someone to simmer a bowl of chicken soup for you. Drink it while it’s still hot and nourish your body.” Old Maidservant Zhao then placed the white bowl on the table.</p>
