 <p style="margin-left: 20px;"><em>Ji Yunshu was an outstanding anthropologist who was transmigrated into the body of a mistreated young girl. To survive in her new circumstances, she could only rely on her wits and the knowledge she had accumulated in her...</em></p>

 <p>Without caring about the pain, He Xiangyu immediately raised her hand to touch her face. In the Beauty Palace, appearance was more important than anything else. If a scar was left on her visage, she would be done for.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>When she saw the blood on her hand, He Xiangyu’s eyes widened and she glared straight at Su Xi-er. “You actually scratched my face! I'll ensure you bear the consequences!” She raised her hand to instruct the palace maids to take Su Xi-er down.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Since there was now irrefutable ‘evidence’, Old Maidservant Zhao didn’t do anything to prevent the palace maids from seizing Su Xi-er and looked like she was going to watch on from the sidelines.&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>However, no one had expected that despite the fact a few palace maids surrounding Su Xi-er, they were still unable to capture her after repeatedly floundering for a long time.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Trash!” He Xiangyu couldn’t contain her anger. She wanted to command the imperial bodyguards but didn’t have the power. Prince Hao had only sent a few palace maids to wait upon her.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“He Xiangyu, why are you certain that it was me who scratched your face?” Su Xi-er halted her footsteps and looked at He Xiangyu with an unperturbed expression. It was as if she was watching a clown playing antics<span id="footnote-ref-f859"><a href="#footnote-f859">[1]</a></span>.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“It can’t be that I used a hairpin to scratch my own face, right?”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er chuckled. “You can’t say that for sure. Just now, everyone witnessed that it was you who pulled out the hairpin from your hair bun and dashed towards me. However, things didn’t go as you wished and you were hoisted by your own petard instead.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>A simple few sentences caused He Xiangyu to be completely speechless, only able to glare at her helplessly.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Harbour no ill intentions to others. Perhaps, after playing with fire for so long, you yourself have been burned.” The smile on Su Xi-er’s face deepened. The palace maids standing in the surroundings could not help but widen their eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em>Is she...still Su Xi-er?</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Far away, He Ying spotted this scene and narrowed her eyes.&nbsp;<em>This Su Xi-er is as beautiful as flowers, has a glib tongue, and doesn’t panic when she encounters problems. Such a person should either stay in the Palace Side Quarters forever...or eliminated as soon as possible.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Old Maidservant Zhao had sharp eyes that discovered He Ying. She immediately called out, “Miss He, why have you returned to the Palace Side Quarters?”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>He Ying smiled as she walked in, her gaze landing on He Xiangyu. “The Empress Dowager has summoned you to the Compassionate Peace Palace. Follow me there right away.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>As soon as He Xiangyu heard that the Empress Dowager was summoning her for an audience, she involuntarily became nervous.&nbsp;<em>I never had any interactions with the Empress Dowager. Why am I being summoned to the Compassionate Peace Palace?</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Quickly follow me, and wipe away the blood on your face.” He Ying took out a handkerchief and placed it in He Xiangyu’s hand without paying any attention to her at all.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>As long as she was the Empress Dowager’s head palace maid, any old-maidservant-in-charge of any palace would have to treat her with respect.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Even ministers had to show some courtesy when they met He Ying.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>He Xiangyu took the handkerchief and wiped away the bloodstains on her face. Her heart was overflowing with flames of fury. She had come to the Palace Side Quarters to display her might and reflect her nobility.&nbsp;<em>Now that Su Xi-er and He Ying have messed it up, what other awe-inspiring might is there to speak of?</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Old Maidservant Zhao, this palace maid doesn’t know her place. You should discipline her more.” As she was speaking, her gaze fell on Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“This old servant will definitely discipline her properly. Su Xi-er, your punishment is to sweep the whole of the Palace Side Quarters! Wash all the chamber pots at night, and you’re not allowed to sleep.” Old Maidservant Zhao chastised her in a stern voice and pointed towards the back.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er didn’t say anything. She nodded lightly and left.&nbsp;<em>My current position is extremely low. It is still fine if I am dealing with He Xiangyu and Old Maidservant Zhao, but if I confront He Ying head-on, nothing good would come out of it.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Old Maidservant Zhao, this palace maid, you can’t keep her.” Before He Ying left, she lowered her head and whispered to Old Maidservant Zhao.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>As Old Maidservant Zhao looked at Su Xi-er’s gaunt retreating figure, she began to contemplate.&nbsp;<em>Even He Ying could see her latent danger. It looks like Beimin’s imperial palace may change because of her.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em>If I don’t keep her, life in the future would be like stagnant water. If I keep her, that would be disobeying He Ying.</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><em>~~~</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er directly walked to the area where the brooms were placed. She hadn’t missed the purposeful looks that Miss He had given her before the latter had left.&nbsp;<em>It looks like I will have to take extra precaution in the future.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>When she was sweeping, all the palace maids in the Palace Side Quarters had avoided her, afraid that they would be infected by her bad luck if they got close to her.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>She dismissed it with a laugh. After she finished sweeping this area, she moved on to another area. Soon, without her even noticing, night had already fallen. On the other hand, she was neither hungry nor had she realised that she was already no longer within the boundaries of the Palace Side Quarters.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>As she raised her head to look at the round moon in the night sky, the rim of her eyes suddenly moistened. Once, she had often admired the moon with Lü Liu. At that time, Lü Liu had even made fun of her,&nbsp;<em>“Eldest Imperial Princess, you’re cold to other people. I wonder how General Yun won you over?”</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em>General Yun...Yun Ruofeng.&nbsp;</em>She thought about the arrow that had flown through the air. That arrow had thoroughly caused her to crumble into pieces.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er clenched her fists tightly. A tremendous amount of rancour was present in her eyes.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>She was immersed in her memories to the point that she didn’t notice the footsteps that were gradually approaching her.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“From which palace?” A husky man’s voice sounded.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er was taken aback. She immediately collected her thoughts back and turned around. When she saw the man before her clearly, she was startled again.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>The man wore his long hair loose, adorning himself with black robes that had snake designs woven into them. His long and narrow red phoenix eyes<span id="footnote-ref-b660"><a href="#footnote-b660">[2]</a></span> were as deep as bottomless wells. There was a scent of wine on him, and drops of wine stains on his lips flickered under the light. With his robes slightly opened, it faintly revealed his taut skin.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“From which palace?” he repeated. His eyes were slightly narrowed as they overflowed with danger.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em>Judging from his apparel, this man is probably a wealthy and respectable person; but he also has the appearance of a hedonistic son of aristocratic parents. Who on earth is he? &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“You’re not speaking. Are you a mute?” He chuckled in a low voice. At the same time, he was about to pinch her chin.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em>He’s really a hedonistic son of wealthy parents, drinking in the night and coming out to flirt with palace maids.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er immediately took a step back and looked at him coldly.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“You have an unexpectedly obstinate temper. This prince likes it.” He walked closer to her. The scent of wine emanating from his whole body mixed with the night breeze and wafted into her nose.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em>This prince? It looks like he’s some ignorant and incompetent prince in Beimin.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Try taking another step back.” His deep and low voice was filled with intimidation.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Although Su Xi-er hadn’t uttered a single word until now, his sentence caused her memories to surge forth violently like a tide.</p>

 <p>That night, Yun Ruofeng had pressed her against the tree trunk and told her,&nbsp;<em>“Try taking another step back.”</em> Then, he kissed her. Although nothing happened between the two of them afterwards, she still remembered that kiss.</p>

 <p>Su Xi-er didn’t know when the man before her had forced her to the tree trunk. Just as he lowered his head and wanted to kiss her, she immediately woke up with a start.</p>

 <p>“Do you believe that this prince will want you here today?” His tone was bantering.</p>

 <p>Su Xi-er lowered her head slightly and cast a glance at the weakest place on a man’s body.&nbsp;<em>He has drunk so he is definitely not as alert as he usually is. Furthermore, it’s nighttime. As long as I rapidly escape, he definitely won’t recognise who I am.</em></p>

 <p>With such a thought, she immediately raised her head. The coldness in her eyes was no longer present, having been replaced by a charming expression.</p>

 <p>She hadn’t gotten far before her collar was pulled by someone from behind.</p>

 <p>“You want to leave after kicking this prince at that place?” He exerted the strength in his arms and flung her onto the ground heavily.&nbsp;</p>
