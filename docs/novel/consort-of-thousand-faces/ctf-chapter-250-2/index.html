 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p><em>‘You are nothing without me, Yun Ruofeng! The face you have lost today is something that you deserve!’&nbsp;</em>Yun Ruofeng could imagine Ning Rulan mocking him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The chilly aura around Yun Ruofeng suddenly dissipated, a smile growing on his face.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian could only feel that the smile was terrifying. She grabbed him tightly. “Feng, don’t do this to me. We are still on the Dragon Boat, and we are still in the middle of the state banquet. Today is the last day; we can’t take it lightly.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You are saying this to this Prince after what you did yesterday and the day before?” Yun Ruofeng looked at her calmly. “Ning Anlian, His Majesty is already 16 years old, and has many ideas of his own. In the past, this Prince couldn’t bear to kill him. Now though, even if I did want to kill him, it would be very difficult.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian knew that something happened when she heard this. Just when she wanted to ask more questions, there was knocking on the door, accompanied by Wei Mohai’s voice. “Prince Yun.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng walked up and opened the door, allowing Wei Mohai to walk in before closing it tightly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wei Mohai knelt down directly. “This subordinate has failed. Please punish me, Prince Yun.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng waved his hand. “Get up. With how things have turned out, there is no point in doing so. All we can do is think about how we can eliminate the Literary Association and the person behind them.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian didn’t understand what was going on, but couldn’t interrupt either, so she just stood on the side quietly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Yun, now is not the time to make a move. The civilians have started to side with His Majesty. If we eradicate the Literary Association now, the resulting mayhem will be the opposite of what we desire.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng nodded. “The Literary Association cannot stay, but we can’t make a move right now. Kill the young man who carries the wine pot near his waist. Make sure you investigate where Su Xi-er is as well; I haven’t seen her today.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wei Mohai didn’t understand why Prince Yun suddenly wanted to investigate Su Xi-er without rhyme or reason.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian was even more confused. <em>Has Yun Ruofeng developed feelings for Su Xi-er? What business does Prince Hao’s maidservant have to do with him?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, Yun Ruofeng’s gaze briefly landed on Ning Anlian. He then replied indifferently. “Su Xi-er made a covenant with you; if you were sent to the Imperial Mausoleum, Nanzhao would lose face again. Moreover…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng’s eyes darkened. <em>Her every move was like Ning Rulan’s. I don’t believe in the occult, and I don’t believe in coming back from the dead. But perhaps since Su Xi-er admires Ning Rulan, she couldn’t accept the latter’s death, and wants to take revenge for her.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This subordinate will investigate this immediately.” Wei Mohai bowed before getting ready to leave.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng added, “Su Xi-er definitely won’t be near Prince Hao. Use this opportunity to find her and kill her secretly. Do a clean job.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian completely forgot about Yun Ruofeng’s previously terrifying demeanour when she heard this. <em>He has ordered Wei Mohai to kill Su Xi-er! He definitely doesn’t have feelings for her!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wei Mohai’s expression was serious. “This subordinate obeys the order.” After that, he opened the door and walked out quickly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Only Yun Ruofeng and Ning Anlian were left behind.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian’s face was full of smiles. She held Yun Ruofeng’s hand. “Feng, Su Xi-er doesn’t look like an obedient person at all. She is always finding faults with me and targeting me. Besides, the way she treats Ning Lianchen differently makes me suspicious.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Princes like women who don’t act wilfully and are docile.” Yun Ruofeng commented indifferently before tidying the hair near Ning Anlian’s ears with his hand.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian’s body trembled uncontrollably. <em>If there comes a day where I am no longer docile, would he kill me too?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, this Prince won’t do anything to you. In fact, aren’t you looking forward to the day this Prince will marry you?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian nodded. “I don’t need anything else, I just want you to marry me. If you want to become powerful first, then I will wait.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You are also a member of the Ning Imperial Household. Won’t you be heartbroken if this Prince fights for the imperial power?” Yun Ruofeng smiled and caressed her chin slowly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I am not Ning Rulan, and I am not so strong-minded. I just want love.” Ning Anlian explained slowly, and the words ‘Ning Rulan’ caused Yun Ruofeng’s expression to change slightly.</p>
