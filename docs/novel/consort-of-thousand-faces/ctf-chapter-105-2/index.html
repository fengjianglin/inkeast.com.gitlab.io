 <p>Heh! That title caught your attention, didn’t it? :P Well, I’m not kidding! We present to you <a href="https://www.volarenovels.com/novel/rebirth-of-a-fashionista" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">Rebirth of a Fashionista</span></strong></a>!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>“This servant saw that the crazy horse is no longer in the shrubs but have instead fallen over, dead. Since we have lost this lead, if they need to find Prince Yun, the soldiers only need to look for his carriage; Why are they taking such a long time?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao shook his head. “Are you silly or are you stupid? If he stayed in the carriage, they would definitely have already found him. Why would they still need to waste so much effort?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>So Yun Ruofeng has disappeared from the horse carriage. If this was really an emergency, he should have at least stayed near the carriage itself. Now though, there are so many soldiers looking for him without so much as a clue.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>If that’s the case, the only explanation is...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao looked afar and unhurriedly remarked, “He appears to be warm and gentle, but his heart is actually more vicious than anyone else. The ambush by the men in black was something that Yun Ruofeng had been expecting. Before it happened though, he didn’t utter a word to anyone else and could still maintain his placid disposition. Was he planning to have the men in black shoot this prince dead by accident?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Without sounding surprised at all, Pei Qianhao had revealed Yun Ruofeng’s true character.<em>&nbsp;I have to admit, Pei Qianhao is very clever. It took me a lifetime of pain and suffering to finally realise what kind of person Yun Ruofeng was, but Pei Qianhao has managed to do so in just one normal encounter. Not to mention, so easily as well!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing Pei Qianhao’s gaze landing on her, Su Xi-er knew that he wanted to see how she would react.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She immediately shook her head and pretended to be ignorant. “Prince Hao, why are you saying this? If you were really shot and killed within the borders of Nanzhao, Beimin would definitely start a war with Nanzhao. Nanzhao is no match to Beimin.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao didn’t reply. <em>Yun Ruofeng can’t govern a nation, but he is one of the best when it comes to leading an army.</em> <em>If what Su Xi-er said had come true, and I had died in Nanzhao, Beimin may not necessarily win a war without me.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, what do we do now? Are we going to just wait here?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This prince never waits for people. If this prince’s guess is correct, Yun Ruofeng’s right-hand man, Wei Mohai, will arrive soon.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Su Xi-er heard the name ‘Wei Mohai’, the right-hand man who Yun Ruofeng regarded highly and treated like a brother, she immediately thought of Lü Liu. <em>She had been like a sister to me, yet she died tragically with a shot of the Heart-Penetrating Arrow. Meanwhile, Yun Ruofeng and his close confidant are living a good life.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>An indignant glint flickered across her eyes before quickly disappearing. Su Xi-er smiled. “Prince Hao, this servant doesn’t know a Wei Mohai. Since you’re fine, this servant is relieved.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly smiling without a reason, Pei Qianhao felt that something was amiss.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before he could question her however, they heard a loud noise behind them, prompting Su Xi-er to look in the direction of the noise. It was the Imperial Guard Army Commander, Wei Mohai.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wei Mohai had never seen Pei Qianhao, and naturally didn’t recognise him. However, he recalled that Prince Yun had gone to receive Prince Hao. <em>With such a bearing though, this man can be none other than Prince Hao of Beimin.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Therefore, Wei Mohai bowed. “Paying respects to Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Prince Hao waved his hand. “No need to stand on ceremony. Prince Yun has disappeared into the undergrowth, you should go and find him immediately.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wei Mohai nodded and saw Su Xi-er when he walked forward, his gaze stopping on her for a moment before quickly moving on. Although he felt that something was strange, he knew that now wasn’t the time to be curious.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As Su Xi-er watched Wei Mohai disappear into the bushes, there was a moment when she very much wished that Yun Ruofeng and Wei Mohai would never ever come back again. <em>It would be best if they were to die to the venom of the banded krait.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>But on second thought, such a death would be too easy on them. Even if they die, they need to be tortured and die with hatred unresolved.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Su Xi-er, although you are obviously from Beimin, this prince gets the impression that you are someone from Nanzhao, and that you have even lived in Nanzhao for many years. ”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er retracted her gaze from the distance. “This servant is from Beimin. It was verified by the Imperial Household Department before this servant entered the palace. How could this servant have entered the palace if I were from Nanzhao?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>What she said was exactly what Pei Qianhao was doubting. <em>The background check clearly shows that she is from Beimin, yet she has a special sentiment towards Nanzhao.</em> Pei Qianhao was sure of it after observing her on the way to Nanzhao, but his suspicions were overthrown by the facts.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, is it time to leave?” Su Xi-er interrupted his thoughts. <em>The longer he contemplates, the more doubts he will have towards me.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>But in this lifetime, I am Su Xi-er. No matter how he checks, he will not find out who 'I' really am.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao didn’t speak, and instead turned to walk towards the meadow by the road.</p>
