 <p>"A-Jing, your little sister lover<span id="footnote-ref-fc3e"><a href="#footnote-fc3e">[1]</a></span> embroidered a silk handkerchief for you; look how nice it is." Su Xi-er walked to Pei Qianhao and purposely shook the handkerchief in front of him with a smile.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao began to carefully examine the handkerchief in his hands. "We can take this silk handkerchief with us."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er observed his expression, then pretended to be haughty. "Wow, how daring; I bet you even know the origins of this silk handkerchief. That makes sense though, since your little sister lover did sew it for you. My hands aren't so nimble; I can't even sew characters, much less the large white lotus flower at the side."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Jealous?" Pei Qianhao smiled, delighted that she was jealous because of him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er held out her hand. "Hand it back to me; you were so eager to inspect it, but I haven’t even taken a good look at it yet!"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao deliberately turned to the side and walked towards the inner chamber. "What can you do if this Prince insists on not giving it to you?" He kept up his proud and aloof facade as he walked away.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"A-Jing, if you don't give it to me, take the handkerchief with you as you step out of the inner chamber. Don't dream of climbing into my bed in the future." Su Xi-er wasn’t anxious at all as she replied while adjusting her golden hairpin.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>They all say that you have to beat a snake at its vital point&nbsp;</em><em>ー</em><em>&nbsp;when you try to control someone, you have to attack their weakness.&nbsp;</em>Su Xi-er understood his intentions. <em>I don't have to take any drastic action; just saying the correct words will suffice.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As expected, Pei Qianhao stopped in his tracks, and his eyes darkened. After a moment of contemplation, he turned around and began to take heavy strides towards her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Hmph, she even dared to threaten me! Of all things, why did she have to choose to use lovemaking to threaten me?!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao stopped before her, and watched as a smug look flickered across her eyes. "Xi-er, you know this Prince quite well."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Of course, you're my husband. If I don't understand you, should I understand the feelings of other men instead?" Su Xi-er continued to play with her golden hairpin, her words eliciting a soft snort from Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A moment later, he passed the silk handkerchief to her. "You're not allowed to use lovemaking to threaten this Prince in the future. Men care very much about such things."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er took the handkerchief and examined it even more carefully. "The embroidery for this large white lotus flower is done so prettily, and the character ‘Hao’ is also rather refined. However, white lotus represents being weak, wronged, pitiful, and moving. It just doesn’t fit Pei Yaran.” She stowed the handkerchief away in her sleeve.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“A-Jing, let’s go. After we return to the residence, I’ll ‘accidentally’ throw the silk handkerchief into the backyard, and we can see how your little sister lover will react.” Su Xi-er smiled as she stepped forward and grabbed Pei Qianhao’s hand.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao flicked her forehead. “My little sister lover is right before my eyes. You’re clearly jealous.” He added. “However, that can also be considered a good thing. I was afraid that you wouldn’t be; if that really happened, this Prince would have looked for...”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He received a glare from Su Xi-er before he could finish his sentence. “Who were you going to look for? Other women to make me jealous?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao let out a low chuckle. “I don’t have to find other people. Just a few casual words were sufficient to make you explode.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“A-Jing, you’re sleeping in the outer chamber tonight.” Su Xi-er let go of his hand and walked out of the inner chamber without sparing him another glance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s brow was scrunched up. <em>The sages were right: Only women beside you and vile people are hard to deal with in this world. She robbed my right to climb into the bed with just a single sentence. However, why do I have to listen to what she said? Not only am I determined to climb in, I also have to be on top!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Outside the room, Su Xi-er was unaware of Pei Qianhao’s devious thoughts. The latter only caught up once she had reached the palace path, taking her hands tightly in his grasp.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It’s cold in winter; I’m warming your hands.”</p>
