 <p>Before Ning Lianchen could reply, Su Xi-er was already pulling Pei Qianhao with her as she headed for the army barracks. Liu Yinyin wasn’t able to catch up with them, so Ning Lianchen tugged her back. “You keep saying that I don’t accompany you; I’ll take you out today then. Feel free to request whatever you want.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Liu Yinyin didn’t want to comply, and pushed his arm away. However, just as she was about to head for the army barracks, she was attracted by the ‘<a href="https://5b0988e595225.cdn.sohucs.com/images/20180105/18aa83827c5140b29239da886340fc32.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sugar People</a>’ and ‘Ring Toss’ that Ning Lianchen began talking about. It wasn’t long before she obediently followed him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the administrator heard that Pei Qianhao would be staying in the army barracks, he immediately cleared out an&nbsp;<a href="https://img7.ddove.com/upload/20190319/110145700907.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">army tent</a> and tidied it up before allowing Pei Qianhao and Su Xi-er to enter.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Su Xi-er went in, she was assailed by a wave of both nostalgia and unfamiliarity. <em>I used to constantly be sleeping in tents, going to bed without even taking my clothes off. It wasn’t like I was able to get a good sleep while being bogged down by urgent matters from the frontline either.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xi-er.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Mmm? What’s the matter?” Su Xi-er walked to Pei Qianhao’s side and lifted her head to ask.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao hugged her. “Nothing, I was just calling you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Oh.” Su Xi-er softly replied and nestled against his chest.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Soon, he called again, “Xi-er.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er raised her head. “What’s wrong?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Nothing.” Pei Qianhao replied with a smile.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Su Xi-er didn’t buy his answer this time, and stared straight at him. “What exactly is the matter? You called me quite a few times.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“How is your body holding up after such a long journey?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Thinking that he was genuinely concerned about her, Su Xi-er immediately replied, “My body is alright. It’s not like water where…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before she could finish her sentence, she sensed a hand roaming over her body. <em>It’s still broad daylight! We can’t mess around!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She immediately grabbed his hand. “Don’t fool around.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You just said that your body is feeling fine.” Pei Qianhao whispered into her ear, the overtone in his words as clear as day.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>So that was what he meant by asking how my body was holding up!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er pinched him. “I won’t let you get your way today.” She then pushed him away and turned to walk out of the tent.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, he pulled her back after she had only taken a few steps, pressing her against one of the wooden support pillars. “Xi-er, I didn’t touch you for the few days we were in the horse carriage. I also held it in when we were at the taverns since I was afraid your body wouldn’t be able to take it. But now that I see you jumping about in a lively fashion, I can’t hold it in anymore.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s gaze swept past the lower part of his body, and her heart fiercely leapt. <em>He really can’t hold it in anymore. Since when…? I didn’t even notice it at all.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xi-er, there’s only two of us. The soldiers won’t disrupt.” Pei Qianhao walked closer to her, whittling away at her barriers.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“A-Jing, it’s still the middle of the day. Why don’t I use my hand? Then, at night, we can… is that alright?” The tips of Su Xi-er’s ears immediately flushed red. <em>I actually took the initiative to propose using my hand.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xi-er, don’t mess around.” Pei Qianhao softly said, his hands already sliding beneath her clothes in a practised manner.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing his eyes, Su Xi-er knew that he had indeed held it in for a long time. <em>Fine then, I’ll just let him do it this once.&nbsp;</em>Hence, she nodded, and hooked her arms around his neck, coordinating with his movements.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The interior of the tent was filled with heated passion. Pressed against the wooden pillar, Su Xi-er raised her head and wrapped both of her legs around Pei Qianhao’s waist while he lowered his head to capture her fragrant lips. “Xi-er, it’s been so many times; are you still nervous?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“A-Jing, don’t speak.” Su Xi-er couldn’t bear his provocation, and involuntarily raised her hand to smack him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The corners of Pei Qianhao’s lips curved up as he pressed them to her ear. “Xi-er, your body is very fragrant and comfortable.” His warm lips then gradually drew a trail downwards.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, in the military drill grounds, the soldiers were currently observing Da Zhu as Wu Ling ran the former through several drills.</p>
