 <p>When Pei Qianhao saw how serious she looked, he stretched his right hand out and brought her close to his chest. “This Prince doesn’t know how to please women, nor do I know how to say those sweet words. Has the wound on your arm gotten better?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Even if he doesn’t know how to express his sincerity and concern, his actions are more than enough for me to understand.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s head leaned against his chest, listening to his strongly beating heart. “It’s much better. A new scab has formed, and it will come off in a few days.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, will you bring this servant to the palace on the day of the Winter Solstice Festival?” Su Xi-er raised her head, looked at him and asked. <em>To choose the day of the Winter Solstice Festival in particular… does he mean to announce that he will take me as his princess consort to all the officials at the palace banquet?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“There are three important palace banquets in Beimin: one is the state banquet; another is the New Year banquet; and the third is the Winter Solstice banquet. Days before and after those banquets are the most auspicious and suitable for marriage.” Pei Qianhao slowly said as he caressed her hair.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Most suitable for marriage.&nbsp;</em>A glint flickered across Su Xi-er’s eyes. <em>If that’s the case, is he planning to prepare everything for a wedding after the festival?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>If I really marry him, then my real identity…&nbsp;</em>Su Xi-er’s brows furrowed together, and her gaze deepened.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Pei Qianhao gently rubbed her temples in an attempt to relax her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, will you marry this servant no matter who this servant really is? Will you treat this servant whole-heartedly, and only have this servant by your side for your whole life?” Su Xi-er stared at him with an earnest look in her eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I don’t trust men, but I somehow trust Pei Qianhao’s words… He is someone that never lies, and disdains those who do.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao could see the seriousness in her eyes. <em>Needing something like verbal confirmation… women are difficult. If I don’t marry her, who else will I marry? Does she think that I would let her run away with another man?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince will give you everything you want, understood?” Pei Qianhao’s said in his usual deep voice with a gaze full of earnestness that matched Su Xi-er’s.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s eyes curved into a smile. She stood on tiptoes and put her hands around his neck. “Prince Hao, this servant trusts you. Although this servant doesn’t say anything, I have remembered everything that you have done for me.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I see that you have a conscience.” Pei Qianhao lowered his head, and his lips slowly landed on her own.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The soft scent of a woman was gently mixed with the masculine scent of a man.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Since I trust you, then that means that I have decided that you are the one. If…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before Su Xi-er could finish talking, Pei Qianhao silenced her with another kiss. “Don’t say anything I don’t want to hear.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After that, he started to kiss her more heavily. His hands also grew more daring, roaming over her body until she was pressed against the side of the bed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er had always refused Pei Qianhao in the past, so he was delighted now that she became obedient. His hands caressed her bare shoulders as her robes slipped down, his lips accompanying them slowly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Pei Qianhao paused and gave her a deep look when he felt the scab on her arm.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Finally, he pulled her clothing back up. “I will wait until you are fully recovered. I have waited so long already; a few more days is nothing.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er suddenly laughed, her bell-like laughter entering his ears. “When did you start having bad thoughts about this servant? You said that you have been waiting for so long.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I have been waiting since my last lifetime. Isn’t that long?” Pei Qianhao joked as he continued to tidy up her clothing.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er thought. <em>He says that he doesn’t know how to use honeyed words to fawn over women, but isn’t what he just said sweeter than anything?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, there was some panicked knocking on the door as Wu Ling’s voice immediately followed. “Prince Hao… This subordinate has something to request.”</p>
