 <p>What Pei Qianhao didn’t know was that Su Xi-er just so happened to be able to do all those things. Her needlework wasn’t fantastic, but she knew the basics. As for the four arts, her calligraphy skill was amongst the best, and her skills in the other three were only slightly worse. As for leading troops and governing a country? It went without saying!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er smiled as she jested. “Prince Hao, regardless of how clever this servant is, I still wouldn’t be able to lead the troops and govern a country. This servant is very impressed by your skills in these aspects.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her last sentence sincerely came from the bottom of her heart. She had already appreciated his talent when she was Ning Rulan, and this appreciation had only grown upon actually meeting him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“How impressed?” Pei Qianhao questioned, evidently a little displeased about her glossing over it by just saying the word ‘impressed’.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er pondered over it for a while. <em>Sometimes, it is necessary to curry favour in an exaggerated fashion.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hence, she smiled brightly. “This servant is impressed from the bottom of my heart. In this whole wide world, Prince Hao stands at the apex, with no one ever surpassing you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her words had greatly pleased Pei Qianhao, and a smile formed at the corner of his lips. “Su Xi-er, from what this Prince sees, your best talent lies in your speech.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant doesn’t dare to accept the compliment.” She turned to look outside the window where the moonlight illuminated the silent night. <em>When is Pei Qianhao going to leave?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s smile immediately disappeared, his delight changing to despondence. <em>Why is she still looking outside the window when I am right here?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Soon, Pei Qianhao stood up and asked in his low voice. “Is the moonlight very pleasing to look at?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er looked at him with a slight smile. “Prince Hao, this servant is extremely grateful that you took time out from your busy schedule to visit this servant.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I see, then are you so grateful that you’ve decided to turn away and admire the moon?” Pei Qianhao continued for her as he approached her, finally stopping beside her without doing anything.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, should this servant have kept staring at you instead? Wouldn’t you say that I am too fond of beauty?” The word ‘beauty’ was naturally referring to Pei Qianhao’s handsome face.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao felt dejected. <em>How can a man’s dashing looks be described with ‘beauty’? Doesn’t she know how to use another term instead?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Noticing Pei Qianhao’s unhappiness, Su Xi-er praised, “Prince Hao, you are the most handsome and mature man this servant has ever seen.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er saw Pei Qianhao’s eyes relaxing, a visible sign that his mood had improved. All of a sudden, she was taken by the impression that he was like a small child that was trying to fight for her attention.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, who’s Xie Liuli?” Su Xi-er suddenly remembered what she had read from the book that she had dropped earlier at the Imperial Library, and tried to sound him out.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Commandery Prince Xie’s biological younger sister.” Pei Qianhao’s reply was curt, signalling that he didn’t wish to speak about the Xie Family.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er could sense his reluctance to divulge more information, but still tried to press forward. “Prince Hao, did you and Xie Liuli previously get engaged?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She only saw that Pei Qianhao’s brows were slightly knitted together before they returned to normal. “Where did you hear that from?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“When this servant was airing out books today, I found an old book called ‘Poetry Classics’. Some of its pages had their corners folded, and some underlined words on these pages suggested that you and Xie Liuli would be married. The bottom part even had your name written along with hers.” Su Xi-er slowly recounted, taking note to observe Pei Qianhao’s expression carefully.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A moment later, Pei Qianhao’s gaze became unfathomable. “That book should have long been destroyed. You believe random nonsense written by others?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er shook her head. “This servant found it strange, which was why I asked you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“In the future, don’t believe any theories about this Prince. You can only trust this Prince, do you understand?” Pei Qianhao patted her head.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“If that’s the case, then the engagement must not have existed. But… who wrote those words in ‘Poetry Classics’ then?” Su Xi-er immediately felt a flick to her forehead, prompting her to raise a hand and rub it as she looked at Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao reached out his arm and held her waist, his other hand gently caressing her forehead. “How would this Prince know who wrote it? It’s impossible to investigate, even if I wanted to do so. Must it be Xie Liuli who wrote it just because her name is there?”</p>

 <p>Hmm if only Ning Rulan and Pei Qianhao had been from the same country and met each other, how do you things would have turned out?&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
 <p>We have a comment from a reader, Seru! XD</p>
 <p><em>If Ning Rulan and Pei Qianhao had met, they'd have clashed too much for anything to have worked out. The only reason it's currently working out is that Pei Qianhao thinks himself much above Su Xi-er, so he let her close to him. This in turn allows him to slowly change his views upon women, so it'll work out just fine (I assume). This time to work things out wouldn't have happened if they had met as people in a similar position.</em></p>
 <p><em>(If you're asking what if Ning Rulan had been a normal person and they had met... that's what is currently happening, Su Xi-er is that Ning Rulan as a normal person ^^)</em></p>
