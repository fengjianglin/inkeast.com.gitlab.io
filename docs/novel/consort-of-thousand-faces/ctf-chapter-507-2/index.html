 <p>“It’s hard to say; we’re afraid that he will have to continue lying down for the rest of his life.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What?! My brother is crippled?” Unable to accept the blow, Xie Liuli kept stumbled backwards until Su Xi-er supported her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Commandery Princess, it’s more important for the Commandery Prince’s life to be out of danger.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Liuli stood dazed for a long while before she finally knelt on the ground with a thud, muttering in agony. “It’s all because of power; competing for power kills people. If Elder Brother had decided to let things go earlier, how would things have come to this?” She looked up at Pei Qianhao. “Prince Hao, let me make a request of you. You asked me to help you with something before, and now I request that you do the same.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er glanced towards Pei Qianhao. <em>She is probably referring to the time when he asked her to refuse the marriage in front of everyone.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s expression remained unchanged as he indifferently replied, “Say it.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, I beseech you, regardless of my brother’s reaction, you must take away all of my brother’s influence. I will bring him to lead a life of isolation in the mountains, and I will take care of him in this life.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I really detest power. If I had the choice, I would have rather been born into an ordinary family.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao had originally planned to do this anyway, so he immediately nodded. “This Prince will promise you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Many thanks, Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial physicians at the side were taken aback. <em>With Commandery Prince Xie gone, chaos will definitely ensue in the court. The officials originally following the Commandery Prince Xie are now…</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At that thought, they couldn’t help but glance at Pei Qianhao. <em>There’s going to be a cleansing of the court soon. Among those who remain, there will only be a few neutral parties; the rest will be Prince Hao’s supporters.</em></p>
 <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p><em>Beimin’s skies are going to change. A major upheaval and change in power is about to occur. Prince Hao will soon have complete control over Beimin.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>While all the imperial physicians were occupied with saving Xie Yun, Su Xi-er grabbed Pei Qianhao’s hand and led him outside the room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“A-Jing, what on earth is the matter with Brother Hu?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei QIanhao took her into his arms and gently patted her head. “Xi-er, Rong Qing already married two years ago. His wife is now pregnant, and she will be giving birth in about four months.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even though Su Xi-er had already guessed the truth, she was still shocked. She tightly embraced him and quietly murmured, “How can one believe a childhood promise?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xi-er, if you and I had met when we were children and made such a promise, I would have been able to keep it and we would have stayed together for a lifetime.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er raised her head to look at him. “How would you know? Rong Qing looks like you; who knows if the two of you have some blood relations. The same…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao immediately cut her off. “You’re not allowed to doubt this Prince. If I say something, then that is how it will be. If I say that I’ll wait for you, then I’ll do so without fail.” His unyielding personality flared up again.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Alright, in our next lifetime, after we make a childhood promise, you must wait for me.” Su Xi-er smiled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>How fortunate I am to have met him in this life.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Silly woman, we will never be separated; of course, that includes in our next lifetime. I’ll take you with me if I leave, so how can I wait for you?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s eyelid twitched. “You want me to elope with you? You’re not allowed to. I will definitely be an obedient daughter and not make my parents angry in my next life.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The corners of Pei Qianhao’s mouth curved up, and he rubbed against her. “As you wish.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>While the two of them were tightly hugging each other, they heard a soft cough from Situ Lin who had left Xie Yun’s room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Imperial Uncle, Imperial Aunt, pay more attention. Commandery Prince is still in the middle of receiving emergency treatment inside. You must show a worried expression, just like this Emperor.” He scrunched up his face to show his deep concern, only to elicit a laugh from Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Your Majesty, you almost committed a grave mistake while this Prince was away.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Situ Lin immediately lowered his head. <em>This matter was indeed due to my negligence and carelessness. If not for Imperial Uncle returning in time, I’m afraid that things in the rural areas would have been difficult to handle.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Imperial Uncle, I will be more careful in the future.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince will reclaim all of Commandery Prince Xie’s military power and integrate it into the current army. Military rules will be made stricter and clearer. By the time you come of age and take over the military, there will only be valiant and competent soldiers remaining.”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er saw that Pei Qianhao’s eyes were filled with determination. <em>Reclaiming the military just to return it as a better army for Situ Lin. Among all the countries, there’s no one who supports the Emperor as wholeheartedly as him.</em></p>
