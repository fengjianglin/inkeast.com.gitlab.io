 <p>The capital’s archery range was the largest in Nanzhao. Cheers erupted through the air as Wei Guang arrived, making it a majestic sight to behold.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Didn’t you see the sign at the side? Leave quickly!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Two soldiers were impatiently blocking Wei Guang with their weapons outside the archery range. They pointed at the sign which stated ‘kill all trespassers with no mercy’.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>If it weren’t for the fact that Wei Guang was an old man, they would have immediately attacked.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wei Guang had anxiously headed into the archery range as soon as he had alighted the carriage, failing to even spot the soldiers guarding the entrance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With the soldier’s reminder, Wei Guang turned his head to glance at the sign, but didn’t turn back. Instead, he stuffed a bag of silvers into one of the soldiers’ hands, smiling as he asked, “Army Sirs, I came to look for someone. May I ask if Commander Wei, Wei Mohai, is around?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Although he was anxious, he knew that the archery range had stringent rules. <em>I definitely wouldn’t be able to bear the consequences if I insist on barging in.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Under such circumstances, I have to employ soft tactics. After all, there’s no one in this world who would reject silvers.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As expected, the person who received the silvers contemplated for a moment before silently accepting. Only then did he treat Wei Guang seriously. “Commander Wei isn’t here. He left the archery range early in the morning.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Wei Mohai isn’t in the archery range!&nbsp;</em>Wei Guang’s eyelids involuntarily twitched.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Army Sirs, do you know where Commander Wei has gone?”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>This question was destined to have no answer. Did a superior have to report to his subordinates about his whereabouts?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Realising what he had asked, Wei Guang returned to his senses. He apologised with a smile, understanding how silly his question had been.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Army Sirs, I am Commander Wei’s relative, and I have some matters that need his attention. Could you let me enter?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Even if you are his relative, Commander Wei isn’t around now, so we can’t let you go in!” The soldier firmly refused Wei Guang.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Answering Wei Guang’s questions wasn’t against military rules, and he could even obtain silvers! Why wouldn’t the soldier reply to Wei Guang?</p>
 <p>However, privately letting someone in would constitute a violation of military rules, and was a huge crime punishable by decapitation. <em>Money is important, but life is even more so.&nbsp;</em>They could still make a clear distinction.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wei Guang wasn’t discouraged, trying to persuade the soldier a few more times, but ultimately failing. Just as he was feeling disheartened and prepared to leave, an inexplicable aura assailed him from behind.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wei Guang couldn’t bear the pressure and actually plopped to the ground.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In that instant, he saw the hem of a luxurious silver robe. One glance was sufficient to tell that it was a personage he couldn’t afford to offend. Furthermore, his aura was frightening enough to force Wei Guang to lower his head.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Paying respects to Prince Hao.” The soldiers hurriedly bowed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wei Guang’s heart trembled as the voices streamed into his ears. <em>So he is Prince Hao of Beimin!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Just his aura is already so powerful. He indeed lives up to his reputation.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao appeared to be entering the archery range to practise his archery skills, but he was actually planning to observe the strength of Nanzhao’s troops.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As Pei Qianhao passed by Wei Guang, he also greeted, “Paying respects to Prince Hao.” Pei Qianhao only gave Wei Guang a cursory glance before nodding his head and walking forward.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After Pei Qianhao had taken a few steps forward, he heard Wei Guang’s voice.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I only have two daughters, but they were mysteriously killed for no reason. This matter is definitely not that simple. I have also interacted with Fortune Apricot House’s manager before, and he was a simple and straightforward person. How could he have killed my daughters for money?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Wei Guang stood up, muttering to himself. Although his voice was very soft, he believed that Pei Qianhao could definitely hear him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wei Guang was also putting all his eggs in a single basket. <em>Prince Hao surely has a significant amount of influence. Perhaps he will help me after he hears my predicament?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His hopes were quickly dashed as he watched Pei Qianhao walk straight into the archery range, seemingly having not heard anything.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Do I, Pei Qianhao, look like a busybody? Furthermore… However, Wei Guang has surprisingly meticulous thoughts for someone who looks like an ordinary landlord.</em></p>
