<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>This naturally drew the bewildered gazes of the officials. <em>Everyone has to drink the first wine of an important banquet. Does the Imperial Princess not know how to drink? How can this do? The Imperial Princess of the Western Region must know how to drink! &nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Under all those gazes, Pei Qianhao took the winecup from Su Xi-er. Standing up and bowing to everyone, he said, “Women in Beimin don’t know how to drink. Even if Rulan is the Imperial Princess of the Western Region, it still doesn’t change the fact that she has lived in Beimin for many years. This Prince will help her drink for tonight’s banquet.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The officials knitted their brow. <em>This doesn’t seem very appropriate, right…?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Grand Empress Dowager exclaimed, “Prince Hao, great liquor tolerance! This Dowager presents a toast to you!” She poured a cup of wine in a heroic manner and raised it to Pei Qianhao before downing the contents.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Du Ling imitated her action immediately after, and Pei Qianhao ended up drinking four large cups of wine to start the night.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The officials clapped in praise. <em>Nothing less from Prince Hao of Beimin! Such valour!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Pei Qianhao settled back in his seat, Su Xi-er reached out her hand to grab him. “Does your stomach feel unwell after not drinking for so long?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, this Prince’s body is in fine shape. This little bit of wine means nothing.” Pei Qianhao softly replied before raising his head to look at everyone.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Having noticed Pei Qianhao and Su Xi-er’s intimate interactions, the officials were delighted. However, some glanced towards Huyan Fei and found him leisurely picking up food with his chopsticks. <em>Ai, Lord Huyan’s look are too delicate for most women in the Western Region. Now that he is also sick, he probably won’t be able to find a wife for the rest of his life.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Great General stood up and bowed at Su Xi-er. “Your Highness, all the officials are in high spirits at today’s banquet. May I ask if Your Highness knows martial arts? Please let us broaden our horizons.” The Imperial Princess of the Western Region would need to know some combat skills. If she could give all the gathered officials a demonstration while they were still dazzled by their first impressions, she would truly earn their respect.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Grand Empress Dowager could easily detect that the Great General’s words were for Su Xi-er’s benefit. <em>But how would Rulan know martial arts?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao replied, “Why don’t the Imperial Princess and I perform a sword dance to a tune?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The crowd applauded with fervour. “Great, great!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The musicians from the royal court stood up respectfully and nodded after confirming that they knew the song Pei Qianhao wanted.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Taking one of the swords that a guard had handed to him, Pei Qianhao casually threw it towards Su Xi-er. With a slight smirk, she deftly caught it before taking a stance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Her posture is evidence of her trained background!</em> The officials shouted out in excitement again, and the Grand Empress Dowager was elated. <em>Not bad! Much like the heroic aura I had back then!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Du Ling chuckled. “Royal Grandmother, Younger Sister isn’t just adept at this; there’s much more to look forward to.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Oh? What else is there?” The Grand Empress Dowager was eager to know.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Royal Grandmother, you will find out.” Du Ling was in a good mood and decided to keep her in suspense.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As the musicians began to play a soothing tune, the Grand Empress Dowager shifted her attention to Su Xi-er slowly walking into the scene, the sword in her hand held upright behind her back. Suddenly, she spun around and ferociously lunged the sword forward in time with the climax of the song.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In front of her, Pei Qianhao strode over with his cold yet charming demeanour.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Clad in red and black respectively, they clashed swords and stared right into each others’ eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The royal painter’s eyes widened as inspiration flickered past his mind. <em>I have to paint right after I return from this banquet!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>While everyone’s eyes were filled with awe, there was a tinge of sorrow in Huyan Fei’s clear eyes. <em>Why must my health be so terrible? Why couldn’t I have met the Imperial Princess before Prince Hao? How wonderful it would be if she were my wife.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Bitterness engulfed his heart, but it only took a short time before Huyan Fei collected himself and looked ahead once more.</p>
