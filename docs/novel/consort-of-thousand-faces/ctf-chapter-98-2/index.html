 <p>Instantly, everyone’s gazes fell on Su Xi-er, and Yun Ruofeng observed her even more carefully.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Noticing Su Xi-er’s hairstyle, Yun Ruofen’s expression changed slightly. <em>That is the… Falling Hairstyle... It looks so familiar.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Are you coming or not?” Pei Qianhao stressed each word while speaking in a low tone.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er walked over and poured a cup of wine for him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao looked at Yun Ruofeng. “Prince Yun, why are you not taking your seat?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Smiling gently, Yun Ruofeng pulled out another mahogany chair and took his seat. “Everyone says that there are plenty of beauties flocking around Prince Hao. Having finally had the chance to witness it today, the rumours are indeed true. Even the servant girl beside you possesses a dazzling beauty.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Among all the maidservants around me, she’s the most beautiful one.” Pei Qianhao commented calmly. Su Xi-er’s slender eyebrows were slightly scrunched up. <em>What is he planning to do?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng looked at Su Xi-er curiously, turning his eyes to her Falling Bun again. “Miss, are you from Nanzhao? Only women in Nanzhao know how to comb a Falling Bun.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His words drew Pei Qianhao’s attention. He had been thinking that her hairstyle was unique, as he had never seen it before in Beimin. <em>So this hairstyle is called ‘Falling Bun’ and only women from Nanzhao know how to comb one?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er replied unhurriedly, “Prince Yun, this servant has known how to comb this hairstyle since I was young. I had an elder sister in the past who had been to Nanzhao before. She felt that this hairstyle was very pretty, and thus learned how to comb one. After returning to Beimin, she taught this servant. However, it was only until today that this servant found out that it’s called ‘Falling Bun’.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng smiled amicably at her. <em>Her temperament is unlike a servant, and she is placid even when facing Prince Hao and me.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er had no fear, and met Yun Ruofeng’s eyes directly without showing any emotion, all the while exuding a peaceful and elegant aura.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Astonished by her demeanour, Yun Ruofeng felt his chest tightened. <em>How long has it been since I felt this disposition? She’s really like...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Yun, ever since you entered this place, you have been observing this prince’s servant girl every now and then. If you like her, why don’t I bestow her to you?” Pei Qianhao raised one corner of his lips, an unfathomable look in his eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Sensing his displeasure, Su Xi-er immediately replied, “Prince Hao, this servant follows you and is unwilling to leave. Please don’t casually bestow this servant to others.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her words were clear and firm, shocking every maidservant and beauty in attendance. <em>This woman just expressed her affection to Prince Hao in front of everyone? It’s understandable that Prince Hao’s charisma captivates the soul, but to think that she even dared to say such words just because she is extremely beautiful.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao didn’t expect her response. He knocked his fingers lightly on the table. “It will have to depend on Prince Yun.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng laughed. “This prince has never forced women. Since she’s unwilling, naturally I can’t accept her. Such fortune only belongs to you, Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The crowd was stunned by Prince Yun’s words this time. They could tell that if Su Xi-er had been willing, Prince Yun would have taken her. <em>Heavens! The two most handsome men in the world are ‘fighting over’ one woman?!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao looked at Su Xi-er. “If that’s the case, you should stay by this prince’s side. Dismiss yourself and stand at the side.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even though Pei Qianhao spoke gently, it displayed his might.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er followed his order and stood to one side. However, she kept feeling a gentle gaze that looked at her or her bun, whether intentionally or unintentionally.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng soon stowed away his gaze and raised his wine cup. “Prince Hao has come a long way. This cup of wine expresses Nanzhao’s sincerity. Let’s drink to peace and friendly relations between the two countries.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao raised his own wine cup and nodded before downing it in one shot.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, everything on the table are Nanzhao’s delicacies. Please feel free to enjoy.” Yun Ruofeng remained warm and genial.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao looked at the dishes and started to search for something. “I heard that Nanzhao has a dish called Lotus Root Salad that originated from Lotus Flower County.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You’re correct, but only women like to eat it. Men usually don’t eat it. Prince Hao, would you like to try some?”</p>
