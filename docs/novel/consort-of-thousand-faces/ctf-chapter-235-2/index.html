 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>Wei Guang was startled and stunned for words, his heart pounding furiously against his chest. In the end, he plopped to the ground and kowtowed successively. "This peasant just wants to find the real murderer. Prince Hao, this peasant is timid, please don't scare me."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Timid? This Prince couldn't see any timidness, but courage from you tonight. At Nanzhao’s state banquet, you followed along to stir up a fuss at such an important occasion, Landlord Wei." Pei Qianhao’s contempt for him was evident in his tone.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng's brows furrowed; he almost couldn't maintain the smile on his face.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian noticed Yun Ruofeng's expression and immediately became a bit afraid. <em>Does Feng hate me now? I didn't bring him glory, but disgrace instead.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>&nbsp;I didn't do anything wrong. I just don't like Su Xi-er, and don't wish to see her wearing that dangling ornament with her arrogant expression. I want to have Su Xi-er under my feet, just like Ning Rulan, and then whip her until her skin and flesh are lacerated!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I'm not wrong, no! Why is Feng upset?!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just as Ning Anlian was lost in her emotional turmoil, Su Xi-er spoke slowly, "Eldest Imperial Princess, it doesn’t matter if you want to agree or not. For the sake of the investigation, this deal will be made. If I am indeed the murderer, you can deal with me however you like. If I am not, Eldest Imperial Princess, you will have to guard the Imperial Mausoleum for three years."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Ning Anlian is vain, and if she is sent to the Imperial Mausoleum, she can no longer enjoy material things. She also likes Yun Ruofeng, but with the latter’s love for power, how is it possible for him to follow her to the Imperial Mausoleum?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hearing Su Xi-er's words, Ning Anlian shook her head immediately. "No. Even if you are not the murderer, this Princess is not going to the Imperial Mausoleum." <em>Let’s not even mention three years!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Great, this Emperor thinks that this deal is fair enough. If Miss Xi-er is not the murderer…" Ning Lianchen paused and looked at Ning Anlian before he continued, "Imperial Elder Sister, you shall head to the Imperial Mausoleum and guard it for three years, how about it? This Emperor knows that you have never been to the Imperial Mausoleum. A few years back, when the imperial descendants headed to the Imperial Mausoleum to pay their respects, you even threw a huge tantrum when Emperor Father didn't allow you to go."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian pursed her lips tightly. <em>This is different from the trip to the Imperial Mausoleum a few years ago. A few years back, going to the Imperial Mausoleum was the symbol of one's position. Of all the princesses that time, Ning Rulan was the only one who was allowed to go!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>But now, guarding the Imperial Mausoleum is just a euphemism for being held captive; and in such a cold and desolate place at that!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"No, this Princess is unwilling! If Su Xi-er isn't the murderer, this Princess shall not take a single step out of my repose palace for three months!"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian said to herself, <em>Being grounded in my repose palace for three months is the harshest punishment I can accept.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er shook her head, "I am placing my life on the line. I will pay for a crime with my life if the investigation shows that I am the murderer, but you will only be grounded for three months? Prince Hao, don’t you think that this punishment is too light?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>How could Pei Qianhao not recognise her intentions? However, he also disliked the aggressive Ning Anlian, and allowed Su Xi-er to have her way this time.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hence, Pei Qianhao turned to look at Yun Ruofeng, "Prince Yun, this Prince's maidservant is risking her life for this. In return, the Eldest Imperial Princess of Nanzhao shall guard the Imperial Mausoleum for three years. How does that sound?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng's gentle eyes met with Pei Qianhao's frosty ones. This showdown had already gone beyond the two women, and had escalated to a fight between the two Prince Regents. Perhaps it was even a competition between the two nations.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>No matter how unwilling Ning Anlian was, the arrow was mounted and had to be fired. She no longer had the privilege to choose her path in the face of such a dispute.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng pondered slightly before he nodded. "This Prince is not against what Miss Xi-er suggested."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hearing Yun Ruofeng's words, Ning Lianchen's heart made a slight lurch. <em>Ning Anlian, you are truly doomed this time around. This Emperor shall see how you deal with three years in the lonely Imperial Mausoleum. Even if you do manage to last through those years, this Emperor will make sure that you never return.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian's face paled. <em>If the murderer isn’t Su Xi-er, I’ll really have to go to the Imperial Mausoleum for three years?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>No, I don't want to!</em> But just as she was about to speak, she caught Yun Ruofeng’s gaze, and her heart froze.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>For so many years, she thought that Yun Ruofeng's gaze was only filled with gentleness. For the first time, she actually saw a hint of cruelty in his eyes.</p>
