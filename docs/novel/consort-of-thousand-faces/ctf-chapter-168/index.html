 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>Su Xi-er smiled at him, a glint of resourcefulness emanating from her eyes. "Master, make your own decisions. Don't pass such on difficult problems to this servant."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao raised an eyebrow, playfulness written all over his face. He leaned close to her ear before he spoke in a low voice. "Since you have said that, you’re not allowed to complain, no matter how this Prince deals with this situation."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>This is his problem; why did he tell me to obediently bear it?&nbsp;</em>Su Xi-er was perplexed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, she thoroughly understood what Pei Qianhao meant after hearing what he said next.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao went with the flow and pulled Su Xi-er into his arms before looking at Mei Jinxiu and saying, "She is this Prince's Room Concubine Servant. If you say that she is of lowly status, you are insinuating that this Prince is of lowly status too."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Obediently bear it indeed!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mei Jinxiu couldn't react in time, her expression immediately freezing. <em>This Prince? He is a prince? There is only one prince in Nanzhao and that's the Prince Regent. If that's the case, then this man claiming to be a prince is not a citizen of Nanzhao! Just who is he? And for this lowly maidservant to be a Room Concubine Servant, that means that they have already done the deed!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Thinking of the latter’s possibility made Mei Jinxiu's face go a shade darker. She shifted all her focus onto the words ‘Room Concubine Servant’ and raised her hand, pointing at Su Xi-er. "Are you really his Room Concubine Servant?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mei Jinxiu felt very uncomfortable when the words left her mouth, as though someone else had taken a bite from a piece of meat that originally belonged to her. That said, she knew that it was common for even wealthy men to have room concubine servants, much less a prince. <em>It’s just that I don’t know where this prince came from.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er hit Pei Qianhao's chest with her right palm, retreating several steps back as Pei Qianhao released his embrace.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He wanted to see how would she answer Mei Jinxiu’s question.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, he should have known that Su Xi-er would once again come up with a shocking statement, causing Pei Qianhao to suffer from her tricks again.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"I am not a room concubine servant, but my master does have many of them. Having you or not having you doesn’t make the slightest difference." Su Xi-er visage was calm, and her speech was clearly enunciated.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hearing her words, Mei Jinxiu felt so much anguish in her heart that she could drop dead. <em>He actually has many room concubine servants; how can I take this lying down!&nbsp;</em>Mei Jinxiu's chest rose and fell a few times before she finally calmed herself down. There was a glimpse of plaintiveness in her eyes, but it swiftly dissipated.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Forget it, the things that happened in the past don’t matter anymore. &nbsp;I can’t go against my Mei Family’s ancestral teachings. I will definitely have you, and you must also marry me." Mei Jinxiu declared as she walked towards Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard from the Prince Hao Residence chose this moment to walk in the door of Flowers Arrive Inn. Seeing the scene in front of him, he was so shocked that his eyes nearly popped out of their sockets. After quickly getting ahold of himself, he unsheathed his sword from his waist. "Impudent! How dare you make a ruckus in front of Prince Hao of Beimin!"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Every word was clear, precise, and powerful. Mei Jinxiu halted her steps, her face full of astonishment. <em>I thought he was just a normal prince from another country, but to think he is actually Prince Hao of Beimin! But even so, I can’t go against the ancestral teachings. My body has been seen, even if it was just my shoulder.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hence, Mei Jinxiu disregarded the sword and continued, "Since you are Prince Hao, it's even more normal then for you to have so many room concubine servants. I won't care about what happened in the past, but now, my Mei Family…"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er interrupted Mei Jinxiu, a smile on her face, but her words were like needles pricking at the latter’s heart. "I know your Mei Family's ancestral teachings, and I know how powerful the Mei Family is. You have dawdled on for half a day, but has Prince Hao regarded you? You better leave soon."</p>
