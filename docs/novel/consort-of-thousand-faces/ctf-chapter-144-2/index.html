 <p>Once the matter was confirmed, Su Xi-er would no longer be allowed to remain in Beimin’s imperial palace. Yet, he wanted her to stay.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At the same time, nothing could escape his knowledge. Everything was in his control.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You really wish to know why this Prince wants to go?” Pei Qianhao asked deliberately as he observed her carefully.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant was just asking. Men who like to look at flowers are rare.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao laughed, “You are right, men have other things to do. Looking at flowers is something that is usually reserved for women. But this Prince is not going there just to look at flowers. There is another use for Lingrui flowers.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hearing these words, Su Xi-er thought carefully. Besides looking nice, Lingrui Flowers can also... Suddenly, Su Xi-er remembered a time that Lianchen accidentally fell down when she was still a child. <em>Empress Mother had taken the petals of the Lingrui flowers, crushed them for the extract, and mixed it with some cooling medicinal powder.</em> <em>Lianchen’s wound had quickly stopped bleeding once the mixture was applied, and the cut had healed quickly to boot.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>So Pei Qianhao is going there because of this?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At the moment, Pei Qianhao had closed his eyes and leaned against the wall of the carriage.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er looked at him. <em>This man is getting more and more terrifying. His purpose of coming to Nanzhao is not just to attend the state banquet. From visiting the archery range, to carefully observing the street, and even going to Moon County now, it is clear that he has always had hidden intentions.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>If</em> <em>Lingrui Flowers are transplanted in large numbers to Beimin and survive there, Pei Qianhao will surely use them on the soldiers to stop bleeding and remove blood stasis.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>In Nanzhao, Lingrui Flowers are a very common species, and not valuable at all. Compared to the medicinal powder in Beimin which only the royal family can use, the cost can be considered negligible. It would be most appropriate to be used on soldiers.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Is this really Pei Qianhao’s purpose in going to Moon County?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, Pei Qianhao suddenly opened his eyes, "You have been staring at this Prince. Why? Are you like the other women who have fallen for this Prince?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant just feels that you are different from your usual self when you’re quiet, Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Oh? What is this Prince like usually?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er answered truthfully, “Cold, callous, and never jesting.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The corners of Pei Qianhao’s lips raised into a smirk, and glimmers of mirth emanated from the depths of his eyes. “Which eye of yours sees that this Prince is cold and callous?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, what is another use of Lingrui Flowers?” Dodging the question, Su Xi-er asked directly, wanting to know his true intentions.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Use?” Pei Qianhao’s eyes wandered all over Su Xi-er. “Don’t you think the fragrant smell of the Lingrui Flower is great for making the body fragrant?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Making the body fragrant?&nbsp;</em>Su Xi-er was completely caught off guard by this answer.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“After we reach Moon County, we’ll pick some Lingrui Flowers and grind them into floral powder. When we return to Beimin, sprinkle them into the wooden barrel when you bathe. Now you can no longer tell this Prince that you stink and smell like chamber pots.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er knitted her eyebrows. <em>He must be joking, right? There are many ways to get rid of the smell of chamber pots. And besides, I only told him this as an excuse; I just didn’t want to get too close to him.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The fragrance of Lingrui Flowers is different. No matter where you are in the future, this Prince will be able to find you just by looking for this smell. Isn’t this a good idea?” Pei Qianhao even chuckled.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er really wanted to ask, “Prince Hao, do you have a dog’s nose?” <em>What tracking me down with floral scent? Isn’t that a waste? I refuse to believe that he is only here to obtain some floral powder.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Since he refuses to say, I shall not probe further. If Pei Qianhao is preparing to take over Nanzhao, the nation’s strength is completely insufficient to resist Beimin.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The carriage picked up speed as soon as it passed through the city gates, reaching Moon County in around two hours.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Entering the county gate, the fragrance of flowers wafted into the noses. They were able to see numerous children running around with flowers in their hands when they lifted the curtains, even catching some of them running into restaurants from time to time.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>These children were aptly named ‘flower children’ by the locals as almost all of them were little girls with a fresh flower stuck in their hair buns.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“As this Prince has said, after the Lingrui Flowers have been made into powder, use it every day for bathing when we get back. This Prince will check in to make sure that you do so.” Pei Qianhao spoke suddenly, startling Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;Looking at his expression, it seemed as though he was serious about what he said. <em>This man is a pervert.</em></p>
