 <p>When she saw Pei Qianhao walking into the outer hall, Consort Dowager Guo showed a benevolent smile. “This Consort Dowager congratulates Prince Hao for marrying a beautiful wife. I like Su Xi-er very much, and I hope she can come accompany this old granny in the future if she has time.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao bowed with his hands folded in front of him and sat at the lower seat, smiling as he remarked, “Consort Dowager Guo, your complexion is rosy, and your glory from days past can be distinguished from your visage. You can’t be considered an old granny.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His words made Consort Dowager Guo laugh. Women who had aged would naturally like being complimented for looking young and beautiful.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Consort Dowager Guo, since you have invited this Prince here, please get straight to the point. This Prince doesn’t like beating about the bush.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Understanding Pei Qianhao’s character, Consort Dowager Guo no longer hesitated. “You transferred the Third Imperial Prince out of the capital, and he was having tea in this Consort Dowager’s repose palace when the Imperial Army took him away. I won’t comment on this, but are you really able to find the Second Imperial Prince?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She was elated upon hearing that her son was about to return to the palace, but at the same time, she was also afraid that it would be nothing but a fantasy. Thus, she had decided to invite Pei Qianhao into the palace so that he could reassure her with his words.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Of course we can find him. This Prince understands that you miss the Second Imperial Prince, Consort Dowager. I have specially ordered my subordinates to find him, so you can rest assured that he will return soon.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Consort Dowager Guo’s eyes lit up. “That’s great! But this Consort Dowager Guo has a request. After the Second Imperial Prince returns to the palace, could you issue an order to forbid him from exiting the capital? After leaving for so many years, he doesn’t even bother to come back for the new year. I don’t know how he’s doing on the outside, and this Consort Dowager really misses him. He’s already 30, the age where he is fully self-sufficient; it’s not good for him to still be aimlessly roaming around.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Consort Dowager Guo was very happy about Pei Qianhao’s grand wedding, but grew sad as soon as she remembered that her son was still aimlessly wandering outside despite being five years older than Pei Qianhao. <em>Not only does he stay out of worldly affairs, he doesn’t even want to marry an imperial princess consort.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Consort Dowager, don’t worry. After the Second Imperial Prince returns, he won’t be able to leave again. His Majesty is not yet at the age to handle court affairs himself, but this Prince is already married. Since I am now attending to the Princess Consort at home, I naturally won’t be able to spend as much time as I have been with His Majesty. This Prince will definitely make the Second Imperial Prince return and take up his responsibility.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Consort Dowager Guo immediately understood that her son would be able to receive an official position upon returning. <em>With responsibility to bear, he won’t escape the capital and waste his days outside anymore.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Tears brimmed in Consort Dowager Guo’s eyes. “Many thanks, Prince Hao. This Consort Dowager doesn’t carry any hopes for him to rise to power. It is enough for him to restrain himself a bit, and devote himself to the Situ Imperial Household by working together with you in assisting His Majesty.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You don’t have to worry, Consort Dowager Guo. This Prince naturally has my own arrangements.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Consort Dowager Guo was much relieved after hearing Prince Hao’s promise, smiling as she said, “Although this Consort Dowager is much older than Princess Consort Hao, we are both still women. Women understand other women better. If you have any trouble understanding her thoughts in the future and are having trouble, you can consult this Consort Dowager.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Many thanks for the kind intentions, Consort Dowager. This Prince won’t hold myself back in the future.” Pei Qianhao stood up and bowed before he left.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Consort Dowager Guo nodded, delighted as she watched his tall departing figure. <em>I don’t trust anyone else, but if Prince Hao says that he can bring my son back, he definitely will. This time, my son won’t leave after returning.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Having the Second Imperial Prince attain a position of an official, serve the court, and marry an imperial princess consort before having children were the wishes that Consort Dowager Guo had for the remaining half of her life.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Having experienced the vicissitudes of life for so many years, Consort Dowager Guo had witnessed practically everything the palace had to offer. Be it others plotting in the dark, or even openly speaking out, she had seen it all. As such, her thoughts were much more magnanimous than others. <em>Pei Yaran is young, but harbours many schemes. After leaving the palace this time, I’m afraid that she won’t be able to come back even if she wants to.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Sighing, Consort Dowager Guo walked into the inner hall and washed up before preparing to rest.</p>
