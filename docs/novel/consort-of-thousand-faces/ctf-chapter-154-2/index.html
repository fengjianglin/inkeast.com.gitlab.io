 <p>Heh! That title caught your attention, didn’t it? :P Well, I’m not kidding! We present to you <a href="https://www.volarenovels.com/novel/rebirth-of-a-fashionista" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">Rebirth of a Fashionista</span></strong></a>!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>Before she could reply, the ice-cold voice of a man could be heard. “This Prince has not said that before, but you could have asked this Prince directly if you wished to know, Prince Yun. Why did Prince Yun look for this Prince’s maidservant in a roundabout way, especially when this Prince isn’t around?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er didn’t turn around, but felt a gloomy and cold gaze landing on her. Finally, she raised her head and bowed at the tall man walking towards her. “This servant pays her respects to Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao didn’t wave his hand to signal for her to get up. He looked at the flower basket in Yun Ruofeng’s hand before turning to Su Xi-er. “Since Prince Yun has gifted you your favourite Lingrui, you should accept it. It’s not good to make a big man like Prince Yun chase after you while holding a flower basket.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His words revealed that he had long since been present to witness the scene of Yun Ruofeng gifting her flowers.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>That means that Pei Qianhao heard the conversation between me and Yun Ruofeng in the small alley. What is this man playing at?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng used this chance to pass the flower basket to Su Xi-er. “Hold it.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Right afterwards, Pei Qianhao’s frigid gaze shot towards her like sharp arrows.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er decided to get up from her bow without Pei Qianhao’s permission and spoke curtly, “It is this servant’s first time visiting Moon County, and I want to take some time to appreciate the differences from Beimin. Prince Hao, if you don’t want to leave today, then this servant will wait for you at Flowers Arrive Inn after looking around for a bit.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She ignored Pei Qianhao’s cold expression, turning to leave the alley at a brisk pace. It wasn’t long before she disappeared from sight completely.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After she left, there was a strange atmosphere in the little alley. Yun Ruofeng was clad in cloud-patterned clothes and full of gentleness with a flower basket in his hand. Next to him was Pei Qianhao, whose face had darkened. It was a misplaced scene of frigid and warm auras put together, with a flower basket on the side...</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>If a civilian saw this, they would definitely alter the details a bit and turn it into a dramatic tale.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng laughed lightly and put the flower basket on the ground. “This is the first time that someone has rejected something this Prince has bestowed. Oh well, I’ll leave it here.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao looked at the flower basket and coldly reminded him. “Prince Yun, this Prince’s maidservant doesn’t pay attention to a person’s status when she speaks. You should try to keep your distance from her in the future.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao strode out of the alley and left Yun Ruofeng by himself after he finished speaking. Gradually, Yun Ruofeng understood. <em>The reason Su Xi-er’s temper is like that is probably because Pei Qianhao has been lenient to her.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>If it wasn’t for that, how could she dare to say those words, “Are you expecting a woman to hate you, Prince Yun?”</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Upon remembering that sentence, Yun Ruofeng’s eyes became even darker.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er was leisurely strolling around, taking in the sights after she exited the small alleyway. Although Moon County was small, it was one of the top counties in Nanzhao. It wasn’t because its civilians led the most comfortable lives, but because the place was unique.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The main road was full of the fragrance of flowers, and even much food from Moon County was named after flowers.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er turned the corner and was suddenly greeted with a large crowd gathering in front of her. Even some shop owners had run out of their stores to watch two people on the street hurling curses at each other.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She took a few steps closer to have a look, and saw a woman who was taller than the average man, and much stronger than the average woman. The woman was punched by a man and fell to the ground with a swollen forehead and many footprints on her body.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was clear that this woman had already been kicked by the man a few times.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Next to the woman, a small boy cried out, “Daddy, don’t leave me and mummy. I’m begging of you, don’t hit mummy.”</p>
