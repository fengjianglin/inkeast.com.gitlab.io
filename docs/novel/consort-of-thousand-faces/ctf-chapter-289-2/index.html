<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Pei Qianhao looked at her, his black eyes seemingly pulling in whoever they looked at. Suddenly, he lifted a hand and swiftly held Su Xi-er's hand in his. "You want this Prince's heart?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Ever since I was born, nobody has asked me such a thing. These words... “What about your heart?” Su Xi-er is the first woman to say them to me.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His gaze was as deep as an abyss, causing Su Xi-er’s heart to skip a beat as she met his gaze. Suddenly, she flung his hands away as she asked him, "Didn't you say you want to go to Cyan Wind Pavilion?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A moment later, Pei Qianhao laughed. "Su Xi-er, you don't dare to." &nbsp;Pei Qianhao then started walking in the direction of Cyan Wind Pavilion.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>She said she doesn’t want to be the centre of attention, but still went and performed not one, but two dances in front of all those dignitaries. Not wanting attention is just an excuse to get me off her back.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Since she wants to return to the Palace Side Quarters, I shall let her be for now. However, my patience is limited; eventually, I have to let her come to my side.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The two didn't exchange another word the rest of the way to Cyan Wind Pavilion. However, Su Xi-er hadn’t expected to see Mei Jinxiu sitting at one of the tables when they arrived. She was dressed in purple robes, looking suave and cool as she happened to look their way.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In stark contrast to when they were in Moon County, Mei Jinxiu’s eyes remained calm when she caught sight of Pei Qianhao. She set down her chopsticks before standing up and starting to approach them.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao grabbed Su Xi-er's hand, wanting to bring her to the private room on the second floor.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Stop, I have something to talk to you about," Mei Jinxiu suddenly called out. She knew that she couldn’t address him as Prince Hao when there were so many people around. <em>His identity would cause a ruckus if everyone were to find out.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao's brows slightly furrowed together, but Su Xi-er tugged his hand. "How about we just listen to what she has to say? If things aren’t properly sorted out, what are you going to do when she just keeps pestering you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Without waiting for Pei Qianhao's reply, Su Xi-er took it upon herself to make the decision. "It's not convenient to speak here. Why don't you follow me up to the second floor?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing the smile on Su Xi-er's face, Mei Jinxiu nodded and followed them upstairs without another word.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>What’s going on?&nbsp;</em>The manager was confused, but he knew that Su Xi-er was a good friend of his boss. As such, he still served the group to the best of his ability despite the situation.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the private room on the second floor, Su Xi-er stood by the side while Pei Qianhao was seated in a chair and staring at Mei Jinxiu.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Mei Jinxiu fell on her knees. "Prince Hao, the Mei family attaches great importance to its reputation. It’s also the indisputable truth that you have seen my body. As a result, I can only beg you..."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao interrupted Mei Jinxiu. "If this is what you came to discuss, you can get out right now."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"I don't have any siblings, and have always had a wild personality even when I was young. The news of what happened between us at the inn in Moon County has gotten out, and I must marry you according to our ancestral teachings. Prince Hao, I know that you stand above the masses, and I don’t dare to ask for anything as frivolous as love. I only hope that you can take me in. As long as I abide by the ancestral teaching, the Mei Family elder’s wouldn’t be able to say anything.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao's eyes were icy and piercing. "Take you in as? As a maidservant? A maidservant's status is beneath that of a commoner. Besides, the Mei family's business spreads far and wide."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mei Jinxiu gritted her teeth and eventually bowed until her head touched the ground. "I don't ask for the position of official wife or side wife. I am willing to be a concubine."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A prideful individual like Mei Jinxiue had initially been unwilling to submit, but under the pressure of her family, she had no choice but to say that she was willing to be a concubine.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er chuckled, not bothering to hide the contempt within.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao could hear the contempt in her laughter. He looked towards Su Xi-er, her words flashing across his mind. “<em>If I enter the Prince Hao Residence, it can only be as Princess Consort Hao!”</em></p>
