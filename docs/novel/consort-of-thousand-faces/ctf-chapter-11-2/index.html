 <p>Old Maidservant Zhao adjusted her state of mind and changed to an expression of doubt. “Imperial Bodyguard Wu, is there something wrong with this chicken soup? That’s impossible. I personally simmered it.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Standing outside the door, Su Xi-er seized an opportune moment. “The chicken soup Old Maidservant Zhao personally simmered won’t have any problems. It’s my constitution that is weak. The chicken soup is too nourishing and my body couldn’t bear such a sublime tonic. I should be fine in a while.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>There was clearly an overtone in her words. While no faults could be picked out on the surface, Su Xi-er’s statement was in fact secretly mocking Old Maidservant Zhao.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Wu Ling turned to Old Maidservant Zhao, his tone stern. “Old Maidservant Zhao, I don’t care who you take orders from, but you can’t touch this servant right now. If you have any doubts, feel free to go and ask Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Old Maidservant Zhao was startled. It was the Empress Dowager on one hand and Prince Hao on the other. Intelligent people knew where they should stand. <em>I really can’t touch Su Xi-er now.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Su Xi-er, make a trip with this imperial guard.” Wu Ling walked forward.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Within an hour, the matter regarding Su Xi-er being taken away by Wu Ling had spread throughout the Palace Side Quarters. Although Mu Tao was also taken away with her, the attention they paid to Su Xi-er was far greater.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>In a desolate palace northwest corner of the imperial palace, Su Xi-er and Mu Tao stayed in separate rooms.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>The wind outside the room grew stronger and howled as it blew at the doors and windows, producing a clattering sound.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>The lighting in the surroundings was very dim. While Su Xi-er looked around and carefully observed her surroundings, she was frightened by a man’s voice which suddenly popped out of nowhere.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Woman, come here.”</p>

 <p>The voice was deep and low, overflowing with a terrorising power.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s face darkened. She could identify from the voice that he was Prince Hao!</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>However, she knew that she definitely couldn’t let him know that she recognised him.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er deliberately revealed a terrified expression. “Who...who are you?”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao chuckled. “Come here.”</p>

 <p><em>No choice. I must pretend to be a weak and timid palace maid right now.</em></p>

 <p>Hence, she walked towards him while her body trembled.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>However, before she had managed to get very close to him, a long arm suddenly reached out and held her waist.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“You...It is improper for men and women to have physical contact.” Su Xi-er cursed him a dozen times in her heart but still feigned a scared appearance.&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao lowered his head, his breath spraying the tip of her nose. “You were in the woods beside the Palace Side Quarters last night.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>His tone was with conviction and domineering.</p>

 <p>“Don’t malign this servant. This servant isn’t the person who offended Prince Hao. Who exactly are you?” Su Xi-er restrained herself from trying to push himself away and intentionally made her body tremble instead.</p>

 <p>“Why don’t you follow this prince to the Beauty Palace?”</p>

 <p>Su Xi-er intentionally widened her eyes. “You...you are Prince Hao?”</p>

 <p>“Isn’t it great for you to serve this prince together with your good sister?” Pei Qianhao chuckled lowly and held her waist tightly.</p>

 <p>“This servant didn’t offend you. I don’t want to go to the Beauty Palace and don’t want to see He Xiangyu.”</p>

 <p>“What a great ‘I don’t want’.” A dangerous glint appeared in Pei Qianhao’s eyes. He was simply sounding her out just now.</p>

 <p>“Prince Hao, there’s the sound of a woman weeping from outside.” Su Xi-er purposely changed the topic.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Prince Hao listened carefully. <em>There’s indeed the sound of a woman weeping.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“The Cold Palace is not far away from here. You’ll hear the sound of women weeping in the night.” Prince Hao slowly explained and observed Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>In every nation, the northwest corner of the palace was the most gloomy and sombre place; the reason for this being that the Cold Palace was always located there.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“The ones shut in there are the imperial consorts of Emperor Shimin. Many imperial consorts die in there without rhyme or reason. At night, there will…” He stopped and looked at her. She had closed her eyes out of fear.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er knew that Emperor Shimin was the previous emperor of Beimin.</p>

 <p><em>This emperor was skilled in governing the nation, his only weakness being that he believed in the occult. He felt that there was a Youth Preserving Technique, that he could maintain his youth eternally and never age or die.</em></p>

 <p>The wind was getting increasingly stronger. In the end, it blew the door open. There was no longer the sound of a woman weeping, but rather the sound of Mu Tao’s voice.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“It’s me. I was in the woods beside the Palace Side Quarters last night!”</p>

 <p>She had barely finished her declaration when a swift and fierce arrow flew over and directly penetrated Mu Tao’s heart.</p>

 <p>Pei Qianhao knitted his brow and let go of Su Xi-er. He walked out of the room and arrived at the courtyard.</p>

 <p><em>What on earth happened in the other room? Why did Mu Tao suddenly dash out and claim that she was the woman in the woods beside the Palace Side Quarters last night?</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Read it for free on volarenovels. Get the most original and updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er walked out of the room. When her gaze landed on Mu Tao’s face, her body involuntarily stiffened as she stared blankly at the arrow wound. The sharp arrow had hit Mu Tao’s heart right on the mark.</p>
