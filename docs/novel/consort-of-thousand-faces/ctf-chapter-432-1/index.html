 <p>Feng Changqing was aware that Pei Qianhao had been investigating him, so the former hadn’t dared to approach Su Xi-er recently. It was only because today’s matter had been so important that he had taken the risk. Of course, he hadn’t expected Pei Qianhao to catch him in the act, much less appoint him as Su Xi-er’s bodyguard. Despite this, Feng Changqing hid his surprise well, simply bowing as he replied, “This subordinate obeys the order. I will definitely not betray your trust, Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince can rest assured with you being the bodyguard. Alright, you may withdraw.” Pei Qianhao waved his hand and embraced Su Xi-er’s waist in a very natural manner before continuing. “The ministers of the court, as well as envoys from various countries will be attending tonight’s palace banquet. You can enter the palace with this Prince later.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The banquet was very important, since everyone was curious about the new Princess Consort Hao. She would have to make use of this chance to turn up in splendorous attire and convince everyone that she was truly worthy of her new position.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xi-er, with your graceful charm, everyone will definitely admire you greatly.” Pei Qianhao’s eyes were bright, delighted at the thought of his wife impressing everyone.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I didn’t know that Prince Hao was also vain.” Su Xi-er teased.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao tightly embraced her, lowering his head to plant a light kiss on her pink lips. “This Prince is a human, so it is inevitable to be vain in some way or another. But…” His gaze deepened. “You’re not allowed to dance.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Her dance is too dazzling, and will leave an impression on anyone who sees it. I don’t wish for so many men to see her dance.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er smiled. “I understand, I’ll only dance for you. However, it turns out that you’re not just vain, you’re also petty.” She broke free of him and walked away.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She had only taken a few steps when she was pulled back by a large hand. “Petty?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing his response, Su Xi-er harrumphed. “Yes, aren’t you?” <em>This possessive fellow.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao pulled her into his arms. “So what if this Prince is petty?” He leaned into her ears. “Princess Consort Hao, this Prince knows that your body has been rather well recently. After we return from the palace banquet tonight, why don’t we…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er immediately interrupted. “Dream on, we’ve already done it so many times, but you never remember to be gentler, no matter how much I tell you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>This kind of matter is like an arrow on a taut bowstring that has no choice but to be released. After all, I have held it in for 25 years. Even if I studied the medical book and grasped the techniques, it’s still inevitable that… But I will take note to be slower next time.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince will definitely remember tonight.” He attempted to coax her like he had been doing recently.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Su Xi-er no longer believed him this time. “Tonight won’t do. Let me rest.” She flatly refused him, but after seeing his disappointed expression, she was reminded that he had held himself back for 25 years. “What about tomorrow night?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao thought, <em>I’ll just go with tomorrow night then. I can’t push her too much.&nbsp;</em>Hence, he nodded. “This Prince will do as you say.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Finally, both sides managed to compromise, and Su Xi-er left the room to prepare while Pei Qianhao waited outside.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The guards watching over the main courtyard in the day felt their eyes widen upon seeing Pei Qianhao patiently waiting. <em>Princess Consort Hao is really amazing to have Prince Hao in the palm of her hands! Who would have thought that the strong and powerful Prince Hao would be scared of his wife? To think that he would so naturally put the Princess Consort above everything else!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ruo Yuan and Hong Li kept going in and out of the room to assist Su Xi-er with dressing up, and she finally emerged from the room after two hours.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao had already witnessed Su Xi-er’s beauty, but looking at her again now still caused his heart to skip a beat. The crimson dress she wore had small golden flowers sewn into the collar and hems, giving her a dignified aura and charm that befitted a young married woman.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her skin was rosy, and her eyes were resplendent like the starry sky.</p>
