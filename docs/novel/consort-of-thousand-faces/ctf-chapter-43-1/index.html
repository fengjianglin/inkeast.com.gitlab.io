 <p>Su Xi-er didn’t want to stay on the topic about her loathing men. “Prince Hao, this servant would like to ask why you transferred Ruo Yuan to the Laundry Service Bureau.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hm? Only Eunuch Zhang from the Imperial Household Department is privy to this matter. How did you know that it was this prince who instructed it?” Pei Qianhao appeared unconcerned, but actually harboured questions in his heart. <em>Don’t tell me that she has even won Eunuch Zhang over?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, why are you so certain that only Eunuch Zhang is aware of this matter?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s gaze deepened. “You’ve become quite efficient at speaking in circles, even managing to threaten this prince in the process.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant isn’t threatening you. I only want to know, why did you transfer Ruo Yuan to the Laundry Service Bureau?” Su Xi-er matched his gaze with her own.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her answer was dead silence. Only after several minutes did she hear Prince Hao’s deep voice again.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You really want to know? Are you not clear about the reason? What things have you done that offended your superiors?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er enunciated her words as she replied, “Since it was this servant who offended you, why didn’t you directly punish this servant instead of randomly punishing me in a roundabout manner?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s eyes narrowed even further, his voice full of a might befitting his noble station as he spoke a single word.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Impudent!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er no longer feigned weakness; even if she continued to pretend, Prince Hao wouldn’t believe her anyways. <em>Either way, he doesn’t have the evidence to prove that I was the one who ambushed him in the woods beside the Palace Side Quarters.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant is only judging the case as it stands. Prince Hao, you can punish this servant however you wish, but I hope that you won’t implicate others.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Since you wish to be punished so badly, this prince will naturally oblige. I take it you will accept whatever punishment I decide on?” he asked coldly. His gaze caused a sudden feeling of doubt to arise in Su Xi-er.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>How does he plan to punish me? Is it a perverted method of punishment? If that’s the case, I will have to tell him properly that I refuse to go along with it.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, you can punish this servant however you want, but you can’t…” Su Xi-er paused and observed Pei Qianhao’s expression carefully.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She only saw that besides a small smirk on his face, Pei Qianhao’s countenance was still ice-cold. “What can this prince not do? Tell me specifically.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er paused for a moment before finally coming to a firm decision. <em>He has already done such shameless actions in the past. No matter how ridiculous it is and how egotistical I may be, I have to at least make just one thing clear...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You can’t take advantage of this servant’s body.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s expression stiffened for a split second, the atmosphere becoming even more awkward.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I &nbsp;never thought that I would hear someone say that to me in my life. In fact, Su Xi-er is probably the only one who dares to do so in this whole world.&nbsp;</em>The very notion was so ridiculous and amusing that he could do little more than offer a helpless smile.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In short, he was unable to express his current mood in words. Despite his internal conflicts however, he kept the same cold smirk visage on his face, making people unable to discern his mood.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao chuckled. “This prince originally didn’t plan on it. Now that you have brought it up however, this prince really wants to. Do you know about this prince’s principles when handling things?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er had never seen such a shameless man before. <em>Is this considered a principle?</em> <em>Not revealing his intentions normally and instead forcing others unreasonably?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“If that’s the case, this servant will decline.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Do you think you have the right to decline? Look at how the wind is blowing restlessly on this dark night. The environment is also not bad.” Pei Qianhao deliberately raised his hand just to see her reaction.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Every time we meet, she always acts in a unique way that surprises everyone, although the surprise is sometimes a shocking surprise instead.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, on such a dark and windy night, it’s actually a more appropriate time for killing someone.”</p>
