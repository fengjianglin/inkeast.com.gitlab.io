 <p>Heh! That title caught your attention, didn’t it? :P Well, I’m not kidding! We present to you <a href="https://www.volarenovels.com/novel/rebirth-of-a-fashionista" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">Rebirth of a Fashionista</span></strong></a>!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>The guests from other nations immediately understood they were being shown out as a courtesy, prompting them to stand from their seats and head out of the main hall and back to their own boats.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Once everyone had cleared out, the main hall was deadly silent. Seeing that even Wei Mohai could only stand deferentially to the side, Wei Guang didn’t even dare to take a deep breath while watching the scene before him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng looked at Su Xi-er, the latter being snuggled up in Pei Qianhao's arms without any movement. <em>In this world, only Prince Hao will hold a woman in his arms without any regard to the situation.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A faint smile appeared on Yun Ruofeng's face, though with a hint of sarcasm. "The rumours of Prince Hao loving beauties are true indeed." He then turned to look at Su Xi-er with an ambiguous look.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er placed both her hands on Pei Qianhao's chest and pushed him away, straightening herself out before looking at Yun Ruofeng. "However Prince Hao acts is his business, and has nothing to do with you, Prince Yun. More importantly, how do you plan to deal with the Eldest Imperial Princess falsely accusing me of the Wei Miss’ murder?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao turned his gaze to Ning Anlian after Su Xi-er’s words, following up with, “If the Eldest Imperial Princess, if you want to conduct an exhaustive investigation of this case, this Prince doesn’t mind cooperating. However, you had best think about the consequences of falsely accusing this Prince’s maidservant if you’re wrong?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His frosty glare made Ning Anlian felt uncomfortable, causing her to part her lips and give off a snort to try to calm herself down. "This Princess never falsely accuses someone. If this Princess says it's her, it's definitely her."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian’s wrist was still hurting, and when Su Xi-er took a few steps forward, she involuntarily retreated. When she realised what she herself had done, Ning Anlian’s expression grew even worse. <em>I am the Eldest Imperial Princess of a nation; how can I be afraid of a mere maidservant?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"The Eldest Imperial Princess must really have sharp eyes and penetrating judgement. If what you say is true, then there must not be any wrongful convictions in Nanzhao.” Halting her steps, Su Xi-er was sure to enunciate each of her words.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian's heart skipped a beat. <em>Su Xi-er is clearly smiling, but why do I only feel the coldness from within her eyes? This bitter and frosty feeling is all too familiar.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There was even a moment when Ning Anlian wanted to address Su Xi-er as Ning Rulan...</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng could see that something was wrong with Ning Anlian and swiftly declared, "If you aren’t the murderer, the Eldest Imperial Princess will extend a formal apology."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Prince Yun, you sure like to joke around. Framing me for murder isn’t something that can be resolved with just an apology. She must be punished." Su Xi-er’s smile stayed on her face the entire time, but nobody could mistake the overbearing tone she took while speaking.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Such overbearingness wasn't in line with her identity, arousing the suspicions of others.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Afraid that Yun Ruofeng would put two and two together, Ning Lianchen immediately intervened. "Framing someone is a major crime, and can severely damage the victim’s reputation. Apart from the formal apology, the Eldest Imperial Princess must receive a punishment."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Your Majesty is wise. Eldest Imperial Princess, do you dare to make a deal with me?" Su Xi-er looked at the silent Ning Anlian. <em>I know her personality well - extremely vicious when she has the advantage, but when she falls into a passive position, she’s like an ostrich with her head in the sand. That is, of course, unless her bottom line is challenged.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian's gaze flickered as she looked at Su Xi-er. "What deal?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao snorted, "From what this Prince can see, the Eldest Imperial Princess seems to be lacking in confidence. After accusing this Prince’s maidservant with nothing more than speculation and guesswork, you are chickening out once a formal agreement must be made before launching an investigation."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao turned to look at Wei Guang, "Landlord Wei, this Prince understands that you are grieved by your daughters' death, but aren’t you afraid that your daughters won’t be able to cross over peacefully and reincarnate if you are to frame an innocent person?"</p>
