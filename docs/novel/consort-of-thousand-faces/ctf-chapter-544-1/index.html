<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Pei Qianhao pulled her into an embrace. “This Prince is only shameless in front of you, but I see that you didn’t drink the white fungus and lotus seed soup today.” He led her to the main hall as he spoke.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Together with the daily bowl of medicinal soup, Su Xi-er was supposed to have either red bean soup or white fungus and lotus seed soup every other day. This had been an ongoing process, and with the couple regularly having intercourse, it wouldn’t be long before they summoned Imperial Physician Zhao to check on her again.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After they entered the main hall, Ruo Yuan served up a bowl of white fungus and lotus seed soup. “Princess Consort, we spent a long time simmering this. We made sure to add less sugar since you don’t like it too sweet.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er reached out, but a hand snatched the bowl away before she could take it.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’ll feed you.” Pei Qianhao then took a spoonful of soup and blew gently on it before lifting it to her lips.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er opened her mouth and swallowed it like an obedient child. Spoonful by spoonful, the entire bowl of soup was finished rather quickly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao then took out a handkerchief from his sleeve and used it to gently wipe her lips.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er grabbed his arm. “When did you start keeping handkerchiefs in your sleeves?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Handkerchiefs were something women often brought around with them, so it was unusual for a man to have one as well. As if to prove this, Ruo Yuan’s eyes were wide as she stared at the object in Pei Qianhao’s hand.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao answered in a casual manner, not embarrassed nor perturbed. “They’re good to have after drinking something, but you’re not used to bringing them with you. Since that is the case, I’ll bring one around for you.” He then continued wiping her lips.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The handkerchief was made of high-quality silk, and one’s heart would overflow with warmth at the sight of Pei Qianhao’s tender actions.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was at this moment that a guard entered with a letter and bowed. “Prince Hao, a letter from Nanzhao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hearing ‘Nanzhao’, Su Xi-er stood up immediately to take the letter from the guard. In fact, she was so quick that the guard couldn’t even react before the letter was sitting in her hands.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Wow, did Prince Hao teach the Princess Consort some combat skills? She’s so fast!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er opened the letter and began to read, her brows slowly raising as a hint of a smile tugged on her lips.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The guard could not understand her reaction, nor did Ruo Yuan, who was once again staring wide-eyed at the situation. <em>The Princess Consort is so happy. Does the Princess Consort have a relative in Nanzhao?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er gave the letter to Pei Qianhao. “A-Jing, take a look.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The letter stated that Nanzhao was doing well, and that Ning Lianchen had even made some tweaks to the new governing policy so that it fit the nation even better than before. It was little wonder that Su Xi-er was happy that her brother was leading Nanzhao to greater prosperity.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The implementation of new policies would also be coming to Beimin after everything with the Western Region had been resolved. Pei Qianhao had been hard at work specifically for this purpose, and he would be implementing the changes soon.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There were two more lines at the end of the letter; one expressing best wishes to the couple, and another asking if Liu Yinyin had been mischievous.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao smiled when he saw the words ‘brother-in-law’. He loved that.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The guard and Ruo Yuan got even more confused at this. <em>Prince Hao is smiling too! Just what is it in that letter from Nanzhao?</em> Before they could think about it more though, a cold gaze swept across them, prompting them to retreat.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“A-Jing, I’m going to the study to write a reply.” Su Xi-er started to walk away, but Pei Qianhao stopped her.</p>
