<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>The seconds slowly slipped by, and Yu Xiao became nervous. He had some medical knowledge, and had invented several types of odd drugs over the years. However, even he couldn’t tell the difference between good and bad Spirit Grass after studying it for so long. <em>One can only find out by taking a sip of the medicine.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>If Prince Hao dies, the responsibility will fall to me.&nbsp;</em>Yu Xiao was even more nervous now, his eyes full of worry.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why are you so nervous when this Prince isn’t?” Pei Qianhao laughed. His laughter had a trace of playfulness.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I was the one who collected the Spirit Grass. Seeing as how this will affect two lives, I don’t see how I can <em>not</em> be nervous.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Didn’t you want to follow this Prince’s maidservant? If she can make it through this ordeal, this Prince will allow you to follow her. However, she is this Prince’s maidservant. Although you are just a young man, you still cannot appear next to her.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yu Xiao was startled after hearing this. <em>Now is not the time to discuss such a thing! But I understand what Prince Hao means. I can follow her, but I must do so from behind the scenes. After so many years, even Guan Xiang can’t see through me, but Miss can! We can only hope for the best now.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao lowered his head and looked at Su Xi-er, his hand caressing her pink ears. <em>They feel warm and soft. Not bad.&nbsp;</em>After that, he continued to caress her chin and neck, completely ignoring the situation at hand.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He just caressed her slowly and massaged her acupoints at the same time, making it so that she would feel better, even if she was asleep.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the old physician entered the room again with the bowl of medicine, 15 minutes was up. <em>Pei Qianhao didn’t have any adverse reactions, meaning that the Spirit Grass is fine!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yu Xiao heaved a sigh of relief. With all the tension leaving his body, he suddenly realised that his wounds were hurting a lot. Since it seemed that things would be fine, he quickly left the room to retrieve more herbs for his cuts.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao held Su Xi-er up with one hand and held the bowl of medicine with the other. <em>She is currently asleep and can’t drink the medicine herself. There is only one way.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A glint flickered across Pei Qianhao’s eyes. The corner of his mouth raised slightly, as if he had just gained some advantage.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He lowered his head and took a sip of the medicine, holding it in his mouth before bringing his lips against hers and prying her mouth open. Being unconscious, Su Xi-er couldn’t stop Pei Qianhao from doing as he pleased. Hence, besides feeding her the medicine, he also took the chance to suck on her small tongue each time he gave her another mouthful.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao fed the entire bowl of medicine to Su Xi-er using the same method. By the time the bowl was empty, Su Xi-er’s face had returned to its normal colour, and her breathing had also calmed down by a great extent.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The old physician walked up to check her pulse and nodded. “Miss will wake up in at most two hours. She needs to take care of her body, but after three days, the sword injury on her arm will form a scab.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao nodded and waved his hand. “Go and prepare a bowl of Red Date Soup<span id="footnote-ref-6f89"><a href="#footnote-6f89">[1]</a></span>. She has lost a lot of blood and needs something to help her recover.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, let’s make some food for you. You still haven’t eaten anything until now.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“No need, this Prince isn’t hungry.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The old physician could tell from Pei Qianhao’s tone that the latter’s decision wouldn’t change. As a result, he bowed and took the empty bowl before leaving the room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao carefully put Su Xi-er down on the bed and covered her with the quilt before his hand started to move.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There wasn’t anyone else around, and Su Xi-er’s life was safe. His heart was finally able to relax, and his hands slowly drifted from her neck into the quilt.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After a while, Pei Qianhao’s hand accidentally drifted over the soft places on her body. He hesitated for a moment before continuing and reaching a hand towards her waist. His dark eyes stared at her pink lips. Having just been fed medicine by Pei Qianhao, her lips were still a bright red with some traces of medicine on them. Under the glow of the candlelight, she looked especially charming.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The colour on Su Xi-er’s face was slowly improving as her breathing grew calmer; even her previously motionless body had begun to fidget.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You are becoming mischievous right after recovering.” Pei Qianhao chided softly before leaning back against the bedpost, his hand already gently caressing her waist.</p>
