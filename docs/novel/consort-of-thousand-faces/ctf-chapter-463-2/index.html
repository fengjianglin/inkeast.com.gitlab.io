 <p><em>Smack!&nbsp;</em>The stone hit Xie Yun’s wrist, and before he could even recover, another flew towards his numbing acupoint.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Coldness emanated from Xie Yun’s eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>There’s a helper hidden in the woods! Pei Qianhao, to think that you’re playing dirty!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao knew who had delivered the attacks. <em>She’s already getting impatient; I have to finish this quickly.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, he had his hand locked around Xie Yun’s wrist. With a sickening crack, Xie Yun felt his wrist being forcefully dislocated. The pain was so excruciating that he let go of the fan, but he still managed to use his other hand to extricate himself from Pei Qianhao’s grasp.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Commandery Prince Xie, just this little bit of suffering is not enough.” Pei Qianhao made a move again, deliberately exposing his weakness to bait Xie Yun. <em>I actually learned this from a certain woman.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Yun did take the bait to attack Pei Qianhao’s knee. However, before he could get close, his right index finger suddenly found itself trapped in Pei Qianhao’s hand.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Crack!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As a person who practised martial arts, Xie Yun understood the human bone structure very well. <em>Dislocating my right hand and breaking the bone of my index finger...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, you are really vicious in your attacks. Don’t blame this Prince for not being polite!” A sinister look appeared at the corner of Xie Yun’s mouth as he slipped his uninjured left hand into his sleeve.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Behind the trees, Su Xi-er’s eyes twitched. <em>It must be poisonous powder!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She hastily picked up a slightly larger stone and flicked her wrist, aiming right at Xie Yun’s Heaven Gate acupoint that was located at the middle of his forehead. She also made sure that she was a bit more forceful with this throw.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With all of Xie Yun’s concentration focused on Pei Qianhao, the former was caught off guard by the attack. A painful yet numbing feeling spread through his body as he stumbled backwards.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Unable to steady himself, he fell backwards and tumbled down a slope that was right behind him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao took a few steps forward. <em>At the bottom of this slope lies a type of poisonous plant that won’t be fatal to Xie Yun’s life, but can force him to stay bedridden for a very long time.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After he finished sorting out Xie Yun, Pei Qianhao shifted his gaze to a tree near him. “Come out.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Soon, a woman with a smiling countenance emerged from behind the tree. She walked over and hooked her arm around his, singing his high praises. “Husband, your combat skills are pretty good.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao tickled her nose. “If they were pretty good, why did you still make a move? Were you trying to mock your husband?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After spotting this scene, the guards around them quickly left the woods, giving peace and silence to the couple.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“When did I mock you? Xie Yun’s attacks were so crafty and underhanded that I didn’t have the time to think so much.” Su Xi-er giggled as her gaze landed on the fan lying on the ground.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She bent down and carefully examined the frame of the fan. “A fan made of human bones; considering the smaller width of the bones, it seems like they would have belonged to a woman.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>To think that he slaughtered a woman and used her bones to make a fan!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At that thought, Su Xi-er immediately broke the fan into pieces, separating out the bones before quietly burying them.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xi-er, everything has gone according to your plan; Xie Yun currently lies in the poisonous plants at the bottom of this slope Even if they aren’t fatal, the lower half of his body will be paralysed for a long time.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This punishment is considered light. Since he cares so much about power, we’ll take that away from him.” Su Xi-er stood up and dusted her hands.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>She’s the only person in this world who speaks so lightly about taking power away.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“As you wish.” Pei Qianhao whispered into her ear before taking her hand, slowly leading her out of the woods.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When they were about to reach the mountain road, Pei Qianhao stopped in his tracks and deeply gazed at her. “You are not the real Su Xi-er, so you don’t have to care about the matters of her maiden family. This Prince’s investigation found that the Su Family didn’t treat her well.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Since I have entered her body, her everything has now become mine. It is already considered evil to seize another’s body; it would be even worse to disregard everything about her history as well.” Su Xi-er softly explained with a serious look in her eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao reached out his hand to press her head against his chest. “Xi-er, you are very kind… You’re the kindest person in this world.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I will naturally be kind to those who treat me well. For those who don’t, I’m sure you must have heard about the story of a soldier who once leaked important military information. I ordered for his tendons and bones to be broken.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao laughed. “That’s how military rules work; you did the right thing.” He then added, “Whatever you do is right.”</p>
