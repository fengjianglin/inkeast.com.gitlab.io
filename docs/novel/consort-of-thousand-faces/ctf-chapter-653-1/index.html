<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Yun Ruofeng was boiling with anger, but the old woman could only leave her mouth hanging open in shock at the word ‘prince’. <em>That young lady only mentioned that she was abducted because she was the daughter-in-law of a wealthy family.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even if the old woman didn’t know who Prince Yun was, the mention of a ‘prince’ was enough to stun her. Likewise, she couldn’t stop herself from trembling as she realised what she had become involved with.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling leapt down from his horse and helped her up, instructing his subordinate to take her away and assuage her fears.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As the two hurried off, Yu Xiao took their place, not wasting the opportunity to throw out insults. “Despicable person, the Princess Consort is not yours to think of.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng treated Yu Xiao as if he was air, eliciting a look of contempt from the latter. “What, you dare not admit to your own deeds?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>While the insults seemed to bounce off Yun Ruofeng, his guard standing behind him, Wu Yong, could not hold himself back. “You’re just Prince Hao’s dog, unfit to speak with my master.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Kek, I expected nothing less from the subordinate of a despicable person. The two of you react the same way when flying into a rage.” Yu Xiao was not one to accept humiliation without a fight.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“If you want to exchange blades here, this Prince can accompany you. I only wonder if you have the guts to do so.” A condescending smirk hung at Yun Ruofeng’s mouth.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The derisive look in Yu Xiao’s eyes sharpened. “I will take your dog life today so that you can’t harm others again.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Rushing forward, Yu Xiao found himself blocked by Wu Yong. The two began to exchange blows, while the latter made sure to show his disdain. “You’re not fit to fight with my master.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Stop.” Clad in black robes with a python motif, Pei Qianhao appeared in front of Yun Ruofeng. Behind him was the Western Region King, Du Ling.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shock flickered in Yun Ruofeng’s eyes. <em>What a bunch of good-for-nothings! The prey has already been sent to their doorsteps, yet they still let him escape.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yu Xiao retreated to Pei Qianhao’s back, while Wu Yong maintained his defensive stance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, did you say goodbye to General Li when leaving Xiliu?” Yun Ruofeng taunted.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s gaze grew cold. “When did this Prince ever need to tell others about my plans?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A look of contempt was apparent on Du Ling. “We could ask you the same question, Prince Yun. Why are you not in Xiliu enjoying the beauties and fine wine, but coming here in the middle of the night instead?” Despite knowing the answer, he deliberately posed the question to give a slap to Yun Ruofeng.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng’s expression did not belie the raging flames in his heart. “Let’s not waste time talking nonsense then. Whatever you plan to do with this Prince, I can accompany you anytime.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s cold gaze made it seem like he was looking down on Yun Ruofeng, while Du Ling revealed a smirk before he spoke. “Let’s change the venue then; it’s time to settle our scores.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The two parties stubbornly refused to give in, but still kept the noise to a minimum, lest they disrupt the villagers and cause unrest amongst the populace.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before they could leave, however, Su Xi-er appeared in her pale blue dress, having heard Pei Qianhao’s voice from inside. Her pale face reflected the moonlight, but her expression seemed unsettled; it went without saying that Pei Qianhao immediately flew to her side. “Xi-er.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Answering with a faint smile, Su Xi-er caressed his cheek gently. Finding it to be much sallower, pain swelled in her heart.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The flames in Yun Ruofeng’s heart flared up upon seeing the interaction between the two. <em>Pei Qianhao came at such an opportune moment. Even if I can’t have Lan-er now, I won’t let things go easily for them as long as I remain alive.</em></p>
