 <p>After Ruo Yuan and Hong Li left, Pei Qianhao and Su Xi-er were alone in the spacious backyard. Their eyes met, and Su Xi-er softly called out, “Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao sat on a round stone stool as he spoke, his deep voice carried by the wind to Su Xi-er’s ears. “Come over and massage this Prince’s legs.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>He has just entered the backyard, and the first thing he does is ask me to massage his legs.&nbsp;</em>Su Xi-er stood on the side. Before she could walk up, she heard his voice again.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You can return to the Palace Side Quarters tonight. If you don’t make use of this last bit of time to serve this Prince now, you may not ever get the chance in the future.” His tone had lightened, his emotions undetectable from his voice.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er walked up and squatted down, beginning to massage Pei Qianhao’s legs. However, no matter how hard she tried, it still felt like raindrops to Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He looked down and saw her smooth black hair framing her face. Raising a hand, he reached out a hand to comb her hair behind her ear and touched her face gently.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er felt some itchiness and turned her head gently to shake off his big hand. “Prince Hao, this servant will tap<span id="footnote-ref-64bd"><a href="#footnote-64bd">[1]</a></span> your knees for a while.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After that, she raised both hands and started hitting his knees with varying speeds. <em>It is easy for those who lead armies and fight battles to have injured knees. If they aren’t careful, they will feel a lot of pain on rainy days.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao noticed her injured arm and immediately stopped her movement. He gently took her by the waist and sat her on his lap.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The sun was bright, and the backyard didn’t have any walls around it. With only a few trees blocking the way, anybody who walked by would be able to see their intimate positions.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before Su Xi-er started to struggle, a kiss landed on her cheek. A husky voice sounded beside her ears. “Your hand has been injured, so you don’t have to massage this Prince’s legs today.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He hugged her even more tightly before she could reply. Her back was flush against his chest, and she could even feel the warmth of his body through their clothes. The softness and elegant scent of a woman mixed together with the toughness and charming scent of a man.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao continued to plant kisses on her face, until he finally reached her neck and gently pulled the top of her dress open.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A gust of wind blew past, and Su Xi-er felt a chill at her shoulders. She barely noticed the passionate kisses, and her gaze looked forward anxiously. <em>Somebody could walk by at any time! Yet, he’s actually doing something like this right now...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er tried to stand up and push him away, but Pei Qianhao caught both of her hands in one of his. He wasn’t happy that she was distracted, so he used his other arm to turn her around and face him. He then rested his forehead on hers, his warm breath caressing her face.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao chuckled, his laugh deep and devilish. “Are you embarrassed or scared? Scared that others will see it?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Anyone can walk past the backyard. Prince Hao, you are too bold!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The corner of Pei Qianhao’s mouth raised, his gaze both indolent and dangerous. “I can do something even more daring.” After that, he raised her chin and caught her lips before winding an arm around her waist.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er had never been treated like this in broad daylight, and she responded by giving a bite to his lips. It wasn’t a hard bite, and it didn’t make him bleed, but his brow did furrow slightly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At last, Pei Qianhao let her go. She got off his legs quickly and immediately moved to the side before tidying her dress.</p>
