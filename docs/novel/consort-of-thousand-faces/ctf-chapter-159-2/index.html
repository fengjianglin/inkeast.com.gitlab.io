 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>“This Prince has my own plan, and there is no need to look for her. This Prince wants to see how she will handle this matter without me.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard was confused. <em>What is this? What happened to Su Xi-er?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, you mean…” The imperial guard’s curiosity got the better of him as he bravely continued to inquire.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao started walking back to Flowers Arrive Inn. “Return to the inn.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard immediately followed. “Prince Hao, the obstinate woman is still at Flowers Arrive Inn. What if she wakes up and continues to pester you?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s insufferably arrogant aura surrounded him. “Is this Prince scared of that? If she comes to me, beat her off.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Beat her off… But how can I do such a thing as a grown man? This… Unfortunately, I can only bear the shame since it is Prince Hao’s order.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When they arrived at Flowers Arrive Inn, the shop assistant who claimed that he could remember a person with one look had disappeared. The manager had told him to go to the backyard to wash dishes as a punishment.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This time, the manager personally welcomed them. <em>Whoever made a move on Mei Jinxiu can’t be a simple person.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“A first-class private room.” Before the manager could say another word, Pei Qianhao opened his mouth.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The manager repeatedly nodded. “Certainly, I will be with you in a moment.” After that, the manager stretched his hands out, gesturing for Pei Qianhao to go on ahead with a respectful expression.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao instructed the imperial guard. “Go to Moon County’s Government Office and investigate the status of Widow Liu’s brother. This Prince wants a thorough report.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard didn’t know who Widow Liu is. <em>He is asking me to investigate a widow’s brother? Besides, this is Nanzhao and not Beimin!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“As for who Widow Liu is, find out by yourself. If you can’t do this properly, then don’t come back.” Prince Hao’s words were serious, and his tone was cold.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The manager on the side heard this and was shocked. <em>To be able to have his subordinate beat up Mei Jinxiu, and now to investigate Widow Liu; this person is undoubtedly someone of great importance. Even though Mei Jinxiu isn’t from Moon County, her title as the female miracle doctor is still well-known. As for Widow Liu, her family is considered wealthy in Moon County.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>But why investigate Widow Liu? I heard that she had recently hooked up with a village man who’s around her age. He’s nothing special, but not bad looking at least.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The manager only woke from his thoughts when he heard the heavy footfalls of the imperial guard walking away.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This way please.” The manager immediately quivered and respectfully said.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao nodded, silently following behind the manager until they reached the first-class room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The manager carefully opened the door of the room. “It’s guaranteed to be clean. If you have any instructions, please feel free to let us know. If you open the windows, you can enjoy the sights and floral scent of Moon County.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Little had he known, all Pei Qianhao cared about was that he would be able to see the outside if he opened the windows.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Sir, please rest well. It’s just…” The manager paused at this moment, but he felt obligated to give a reminder. <em>No matter how important this person is, he can’t be more important than Prince Yun, right?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Say it.” Prince Hao’s tone was simple but icy cold.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The manager shook in fear before clenching his teeth and saying, “You must know who Prince Yun is right? He has arrived at Moon County today, and it doesn’t look like he will be leaving soon. He’s also staying in a first-class room in our inn; and although Prince Yun is polite and amiable to everyone, it’s still better for you to be careful and not offend him.”</p>
