<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Yu Xiao's gaze swept past Ning Lianchen and finally landed on the most spacious horse carriage. "Prince Hao, forgive me for being late. Which horse carriage should I take?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er lifted the carriage curtains as Pei Qianhao's low voice came forth. "The one behind."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yu Xiao acknowledged the order and jumped onto the horse carriage like a monkey. When he found Feng Changqing already sitting in one of the seats, he couldn’t help but feel that he had met the other man at some point.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er watched everything from the carriage, flashing Ning Lianchen a reassuring look to assuage his concerns. Just before Ning Lianchen could nod his head, Pei Qianhao had pulled Su Xi-er back into the horse carriage, his wide back blocking her sight.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Your Majesty, we have already arrived at the outskirts. It wouldn't be convenient for Your Majesty to accompany us any further."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Lianchen raised his hands and cupped them together. "Prince Hao, have a safe journey."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao nodded and let the curtains drop before ordering the guard to continue.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Lianchen was rooted to his spot for a long while as he stared at the horse carriage disappearing into the distance. <em>Imperial Elder Sister, you must stay safe and be well in Beimin. Lianchen will stay here to protect Nanzhao and the Ning Imperial Household.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the entourage of horse carriages had completely vanished, Ning Lianchen boarded his carriage and ordered the guard to head back to the imperial palace.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mei Jinxiu only came out from behind the trees after Ning Lianchen had left. On her right was the road away from home; on her left was Nanzhao's capital. Mei Jinxiu stood frozen in place, having never made such a difficult choice before.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gradually, tears started to well up in her eyes. <em>The Mei Family elders who watched me grow up actually treated me this way!&nbsp;</em>She clenched her hands into fists, and with a determined look on her face, she stepped on the path on her right. <em>I swear, the next time I return to Nanzhao, I will take the Mei Family back with my own hands!!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the past few days, Mei Jinxiu seemed to have matured. She had been too proud and arrogant, so much so that she had continued to make requests of Pei Qianhao even after offending him. <em>Prince Hao's maidservant is right. The problem lies with the family’s stubborn and obstinate attitude; something only made worse by the decrepit elders.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Instead of pestering Prince Hao, I should take a look at myself first. I am only an ordinary female physician with no extraordinary ability to speak of. Thus, I must continue in my studies and constantly better myself so that I can proudly raise my head. I will also make use of my medical skills to earn some money by treating people along the way.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>If I am fortunate enough to meet Prince Hao's maidservant again, I will definitely learn from her.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the carriage, Pei Qianhao's eyes were shut as he leaned against the carriage walls. Su Xi-er was staring at the rapidly passing countryside.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just then, a white pigeon dove into the horse carriage. With the horse carriage going as quickly as it was, the pigeon crashed into the walls with a bang.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The fat pigeon was dazed from the impact, rolling around on the carriage floor before finally stopping in front of Su Xi-er’s feet.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er was amused and a burst of laughter escaped from her lips. She then retrieved the letter from the pigeon's feet. "Prince Hao, the letter."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The smile remained on her face as she spoke.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao had already opened his eyes the moment the pigeon flew into the horse carriage. He took the note and rolled it open.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He had given two orders. First, capture Pei Yong; second, dissolve the Beauty Palace. The letter was detailing that both had been completed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just then, the pigeon picked itself up from the floor and fluttered its wings, unsure of the way out.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er's eyes brightened up as she bent down and caught the pigeon in her hands, lifting up the curtain before allowing it to fly away.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Prince Hao, a fat pigeon like this can be a messenger pigeon? Aren't you afraid that it will give out halfway?" Her eyes were filled with a teasing glint as she asked.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao tore up the note in his hands and threw it out of the carriage. "Who cares if it's fat or skinny? A good pigeon is simply one that delivers the letter the quickest.."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Commander Wu is benevolent to have fattened the pigeon."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao leaned forward and stared at her. "Are you saying that the reason for you being so skinny is this Prince's lack of benevolence?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"No, Prince Hao. You are very benevolent, this servant is now much fatter than before."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Where? This Prince doesn't feel that you have put on weight anywhere."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er shifted a little to the side and replied, "I gained a little belly fat."</p>
