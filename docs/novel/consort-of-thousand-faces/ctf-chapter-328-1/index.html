<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>“Prince Hao, what you said makes sense. Besides, if even you didn’t know about the engagement, it must’ve just been a fanciful story.” Su Xi-er tried to step away from Pei Qianhao as she spoke.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, the latter held onto her tightly. “You can’t believe what others say; you can only trust this Prince. Do you understand?” He asked her. <em>People say that women tend to believe everything that they’re told, and even though I don’t believe that Su Xi-er is like that, I would rather be safe than sorry.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er nodded. “I will only listen to you, Prince Hao.” <em>He won’t let me go if I don’t agree with him.&nbsp;</em>Su Xi-er knew that she should act according to the situation, so she smiled and nodded.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao released her only after she agreed. “A matter in the army barracks requires this Prince’s attention, so I will be away for the next few days. Be careful with everything, and find Yuchi Mo if anything happens.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er bowed in respect. “Many thanks, Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>While she was still mid-bow and facing the ground, she felt a light knock on her head. Pei Qianhao then walked out of the room with a sulky look in his face, not saying a word.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er raised her head and rubbed where she had been hit. <em>It’s difficult to guess what Prince Hao is thinking. He doesn’t like it when I thank him, so should I just not say anything in the future? But then if I don’t thank him, won’t it seem like he’s obligated to do things for me? It’s not like he’s my family.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Once her thoughts reached this point, Su Xi-er’s heart beat painfully. <em>My family...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After Pei Qianhao left the room, he pushed open the door to the book depository and looked around. <em>‘Poetry Classics’ is usually kept somewhere to the left of the depository.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shortly after, he found the book he was looking for, and began to flip through it until he found the pages with folded corners with the words written on them.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao immediately put the Poetry Classics book into his sleeve and walked out of the book depository, heading out of the Imperial Library.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just as he was about to exit the Imperial Library, he heard some soft rustling sounds near the palace path. His brows furrowed as he harshly called out. “Come out!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The surroundings became silent, but no one showed themselves.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao tilted his head slightly, a frigid gaze in his eyes. “Do you need this Prince to invite you?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His voice was low but resounding, and before long, a slim and svelte woman appeared on the palace path. She bowed to Pei Qianhao. “This servant pays her respects to Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The woman was Tan Ge. She had only seen Pei Qianhao once at the Pei Residence.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Even though I could never forget his face, how could Prince Hao recognise someone like me? That there was a woman called Tan Ge who stayed in the Beauty Palace for three whole years? All those years I was at the Beauty Palace, it would be said that he never even looked at me once.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“A palace maid of the Imperial Library?” Pei Qianhao’s eyes slightly narrowed, his voice becoming even deeper.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Tan Ge nodded. “This servant’s name is Tan Ge.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao definitely didn’t remember this name, but he knew of the Tan Residence. <em>More than two years ago, I took a daughter from the Tan Residence into the Beauty Palace. Is this palace maid the same woman?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>The Beauty Palace was dissolved, but now she’s serving as a palace maid in the Imperial Library?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s voice was cold. “With how much it has declined, the Tan Residence doesn’t have the power to let you enter the imperial palace, much less recommend you to a position in the Imperial Library. Who did it?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Commandery Prince Xie.” Tan Ge didn’t dare to lie.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao sneered, a subtle glint flickering across his eyes. <em>I didn’t think that Xie Yun would get involved in this. He is sure poking his nose in where he shouldn’t be. Is he planning to make a move on Su Xi-er?</em></p>
