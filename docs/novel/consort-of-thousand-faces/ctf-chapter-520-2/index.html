<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>The current scene overlapped with one of the past. <em>He was wounded by an arrow that day, and it was two fingers away from his heart. Today, it’s a stab wound, and it’s three fingers away from his heart.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>By the time she entered, the imperial physician had already finished bandaging and applying medication for Pei Qianhao. The latter currently had a piece of ginseng in his mouth, and his complexion was pallid.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Pei Qianhao heard the sound of footsteps, his expression became foul.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Who dares to disturb me?!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, his displeasure vanished from his face as soon as he realised it was Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling stood at the side and stammered. “Prince Hao, this subordinate took the liberty to inform the Princess Consort of this matter.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s brow scrunched up as she walked to the bed. “You didn’t allow Wu Ling to inform me that you were injured? Is your heart made of stone?” Even though her words were full of reproach, her tone was full of concern.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s lips quivered like a little child that had been caught in the act. Finally, he raised his hand, wanting to grab Su Xi-er’s, but she was faster than him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Did you think that your body is made of stone? Is that why you purposely let someone stab you?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xi-er, I did that because…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er interrupted him, raising a hand as if to smack him. “You’re not allowed to let this happen again. Regardless of the situation, you mustn’t joke with your own body.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I was wrong.” Pei Qianhao quietly admitted his mistake with a sliver of a smile at the corners of his mouth.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling was dumbstruck. <em>The Princess Consort is the only person in this world who can manage Prince Hao. He had his reasons for doing such a thing, but as his subordinate, I’m on the same side as the Princess Consort; I disagree with his actions.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Perhaps Wu Ling’s expression was too obvious, because it wasn’t long before Pei Qianhao’s eyes turned and shot him a piercing gaze. Wu Ling’s heart trembled as he turned to leave and wait outside the door.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Inside the room, Su Xi-er was still ‘lecturing’ Pei Qianhao. “A-Jing, tell me your reason. Did you really have to joke with your own body when sorting out obstinate ministers?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao clenched his hands. "A mere minister isn't worth this Prince doing something so extreme; I was simply using this chance to ferret out the mastermind. During this period of time that Xie Yun has been preoccupied with Zhen Yu, he often left court matters to his subordinates, and many of them have already been bribed by others. Even some of his soldiers have become turncoats, and since this Prince is planning to reclaim the military power, a cleansing of the court is inevitable, and I must be sure to do so thoroughly."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Have you found out who the mastermind is?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao nodded. "What is your opinion of the Third Imperial Prince?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Situ Li's cold and unperturbed face flashed in Su Xi-er's mind. <em>He pretends to be aloof and unconcerned about secular affairs, but actually conceals his thoughts deeply. He even knows the half-faced man.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Xi-er, Situ Li appears to be staying put, but he has actually begun to gradually devour Xie Yun's power. If Xie Yun's heart hadn't been wholly captivated by Zhen Yu, he would have realised this."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er slowly remarked. "One particular saying is really apt for him: Heroes have a weakness for the charm of a beauty."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao caressed Su Xi-er's head and said in a domineering manner, "Of course, even a hero like this Prince has become a prisoner to a beauty."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Alright, you're a super amazing hero; let's also not forget that you are now lying on the bed injured."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Xi-er, you're not obedient; you're ridiculing me." Pei Qianhao lowered his hand, a look of displeasure on his face.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er quickly flicked his forehead. "Who's the one not being obedient? Regardless of what you plan to do, if I find out that you want to risk your own safety again, I will punish you to kneel on the washing board!"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er's voice was resounding and piercing, and even the guards outside the hall could hear her. Their mouths twitched as they imagined an interesting scene of a solemn Pei Qianhao being punished by Su Xi-er to kneel on a washing board.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao grabbed Su Xi-er's hand. "I will definitely not do it again. Xi-er, how do you think we should deal with Situ Li?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"He's related to the man in black. I have seen the latter before; he's a half-faced man, and has a special identity."</p>
