<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>“Come here.” The low and deep voice could be heard again, filled with danger and authority. It was almost as if he was asking, <em>“You dare not follow this Prince’s order?”</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er stood there and didn’t move. She raised her head and asked in a clear tone, “Prince Hao, this servant can obey your instructions from here, why do I have to walk to your side?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s eyes narrowed slightly and as he slowly walked towards her. <em>She’s not listening to me again</em>.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Do you not understand the consequences of disobeying this Prince?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s voice sounded next to Su Xi-er’s ear before a pair of arms started to wind themselves around her waist.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, she wasn’t afraid to move out of the way. She lowered her body and dodged under his arm, looping around until she stood about a metre behind him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly left in an awkward position where he was hugging the air, Pei Qianhao’s expression darkened as he turned around and enunciated in a deep voice. “Su Xi-er.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er took two steps back and bowed again. “This servant is here. Prince Hao, this servant will obey any instructions you have if they don’t put me on the spot.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You really think that this Prince can’t handle you?” Pei Qianhao’s narrowed eyes returned to normal. His next move was as fast as lightning, akin to a panther pouncing on its prey.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The room was small, and the door was the only exit if Su Xi-er wanted to leave. Even if she did make it outside, she knew that he would still follow, and the ensuing cacophony would wake everyone else up.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao held Su Xi-er’s arm as he used the other to slowly take the wooden hairpin off her head, laying it on the table next to them.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her loose hair was almost long enough to reach her waist as it unfurled.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everyone said that men liked women with long silky hair. Pei Qianhao was no exception. Women in all four great nations valued and took care of their hair, and would only cut it if it became cumbersome to manage<span id="footnote-ref-4ab4"><a href="#footnote-4ab4">[1]</a></span>.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao tidied Su Xi-er’s long hair carefully and hugged her tightly as he took in her scent from her hair.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Su Xi-er’s words stunned him. “Prince Hao, this servant didn’t wash my hair today.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There was no answer to that. When Su Xi-er raised her hand and tried to struggle free of his grasp, he suddenly tightened his hand around her waist and turned her to face him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s face suddenly filled Su Xi-er’s vision, his manly scent entering her nose as he planted a kiss on her mouth, trying to entangle his tongue with hers.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His hand still wrapped firmly and her wrists, he slowly moved them until they were right next to the bed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er used all of her strength to finally struggle free of his hands before trying to push him away. However, because of how close he was, she couldn’t muster enough leverage to do so.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince isn’t patient; how long do you need to decide?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His meaning was obvious&nbsp;ー&nbsp;<em>When will you return to the Prince Hao Residence with this Prince? I can’t have you keep continuing to delay it.&nbsp;</em>However, Su Xi-er knew that Pei Qianhao wanted a virtuous woman who would obediently obey him, as well as help to raise his children. He had deliberately avoided the subject of Princess Consort Hao in the past as well.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>If I enter the Prince Hao Residence as a maidservant, I will become a concubine at most. It’s impossible for me to become Princess Consort Hao! There has never been a case of a woman in a lowly position rising to such a position, especially if they were a maidservant.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er looked up at him. <em>People with influence like to feel that everything is within their control. Pei Qianhao is no different.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, this servant already said that…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before she could finish, she heard loud knocks on her door, and a woman’s voice could be heard. “Su Xi-er! Come out quickly!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Being interrupted, Su Xi-er shifted her gaze and kicked Pei Qianhao. “Someone’s here; do you want to hide?”</p>

  <p>1. To cut down on a lengthy explanation, people in ancient China valued their hair and would not cut it easily as it was perceived to be a gift from their parents. Since filial piety was important, cutting one’s hair could be sacrilegious. <a href="#footnote-ref-4ab4"><i class="far fa-hand-point-left"></i></a></p>
