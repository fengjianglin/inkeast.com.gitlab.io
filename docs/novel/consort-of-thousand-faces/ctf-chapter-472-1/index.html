<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Pei Qianhao nodded and instructed, “Have everyone come back and discontinue the search.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Bewilderment arose in the guard’s heart. <em>The Empress Dowager is missing, but we’re stopping the search? That is to say, we are going to leave her to her own devices outside of the palace?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, when he saw the cold look in Pei Qianhao’s eyes, he stowed away his doubts and bowed. “This subordinate will get to it right away.”</p>
 <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>“Quickly go and handle the matter.” Pei Qianhao repeated, signalling for the guard to quickly leave.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Soon after the guard left the main courtyard, Su Xi-er went forward to pull on his arm. “What do you plan to do next now that you can’t find the Empress Dowager?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>After all, we still need to come up with an acceptable explanation for the Empress Dowager’s disappearance. Whether she actually returns is another matter altogether.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao pulled her into his arms. “What would you do then? Let me listen to your thoughts.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Naturally, we should announce that the Empress Dowager has already been found. Not only that, but the Empress Dowager has curbed her temperament after returning, and even asked for a decree to guard the Imperial Mausoleum. This will provide a proper reason as to why the Empress Dowager not only left, but also why there are no signs of her after she’s returned.” Su Xi-er’s eyes flickered with slyness.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>The Imperial Mausoleum is an important place for the Imperial Family. Without an imperial edict, no one other than the guards stationed there can enter. As soon as they attempt to do so, there will be no mercy.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s hand slid around Su Xi-er’s waist before he put his forehead against hers, softly agreeing, “This tactic is indeed not bad. Let’s just do as you say then.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“She’s your younger sister in name after all; can you bear to?” Su Xi-er purposely asked with a smile.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I have already spared her many times, but the mistake she has committed this time is too abominable to be forgiven. She has to be prepared to pay the price for the path she chose.” Pei Qianhao’s voice was calm, and there was a trace of coldness in his eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er understood that once the imperial announcement went public, it would signify Pei Qianhao breaking off relations with the Pei Family. <em>Although Pei Qianhao doesn’t say it, he had secretly helped the Pei Residence numerous times</em> <em>in the past; the scions of the Pei Family’s side branches have all committed a host of petty crimes, but as long as they weren’t too severe, they would be pardoned without any repercussions.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>He has already done enough, yet no one in the Pei Residence is grateful to him, even thinking that it’s only right for him to do so just because Pei Zheng raised him and gave him a mouth of rice. However, it’s clear that Pei Zheng’s aim in raising Pei Qianhao was to simply cultivate a chess piece. The former simply became more earnest in pouring resources into this chess piece after his eldest son passed away.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s heart involuntarily ached for Pei Qianhao. <em>He bottles everything up without anybody else to rely on. Everyone can only see the powerful and omnipotent Prince Hao, but how can anybody be truly omnipotent?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er hugged him even tighter, causing Pei Qianhao to sense that something was amiss and whisper into her ear. “What’s wrong? Suddenly in a bad mood?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“A-Jing, I’m not someone who would unreasonably make a scene.” Su Xi-er rubbed against his chest.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Forget it, if you are really disgruntled, I can only bear it since you are my wife.” Pei Qianhao softly replied with a matter-of-fact expression.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er chuckled and continued rubbing against his chest. “Seeing how pitiful you are, you’ll be on top for tonight.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao instantly understood what she meant, and he began to knead her waist while deliberately teasing, “Xi-er, you want it?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>He’s the only one who can say such ‘profound’ words in such a natural manner.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er gave him a sidelong glance and purposely pushed on his chest. “Why? You don’t want it? If you don’t, I’ll just go look for Ruo Yuan and Hong Li.” She pretended to head outside.</p>

 <p>Wow, seems like Pei Qianhao has really done a lot for the Pei Family, considering that Pei Zheng was just trying to use him ;_;</p>
