 <p>Yun Ruofeng quickly shot a look at Li Zikang before saying, “General Li is just anxious.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What are all of you doing? I’m inviting the Western Region King and Prince Hao to Xiliu as guests. Retreat.” He was actually slightly annoyed even though his expression looked calm.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing the soldiers from Xiliu back away, Du Ling waved a hand at his men to do the same. Soon enough, the four of them were left alone.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Please, be my guest!” Li Zikang raised a hand in an inviting gesture.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao and Du Ling went ahead, while Yu Xiao followed closely behind them.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Yun Ruofeng stopped him quickly and said, “A young lad like you has no right to enter the nation of Xiliu.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This angered Yu Xiao further as he said, “Despicable. Be arrogant while you still can.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Pei Qianhao shot Yu Xiao a look and said, “Prince Yun is right. You should just stay here.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yu Xiao wanted to argue, but he realised Pei Qianhao’s intention from that glance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even though Yu Xiao did not wish to split up, he had no choice but to agree.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng smirked at the fact that he was able to isolate Pei Qianhao from his subordinates.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With hatred glinting in his eyes, Yu Xiao watched them depart and said, “Yun Ruofeng, just you wait. You’ll definitely die by my Heart-Penetrating Arrow.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He then walked away in the opposite direction. His mission would be to search for Su Xi-er in the nearby villages; if she wasn’t anywhere nearby, then it meant that she had already been taken to Xiliu.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He would report the news to Pei Qianhao before they worked to trap Yun Ruofeng. Clenching his fists at the thought of his revenge, Yu Xiao quickened his pace.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shortly after, Pei Qianhao, Du Ling, Li Zikang and Yun Ruofeng entered the nation of Xiliu, finding that many of the commoners were dressed in simply and plain clothes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Western Region King, Prince Hao, what do you think of Xiliu?” Li Zikang asked with a semblance of pride.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao and Du Ling, however, were not people who could be swayed that easily.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The atmosphere turned awkward all of a sudden, and Yun Ruofeng laughed as he said, “Xiliu’s economy is obviously doing rather well now that General Li is in power.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng knew Li Zikang well enough to know the right things to say.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You flatter me, Prince Yun. I’m doing this for the people of Xiliu.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Du Ling smirked while Pei Qianhao remained expressionless.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Li Zikang led them to an inn and said, “This is Xiangxiu Inn, one of the most famous inns in Xiliu. I’ll hold a reception for Your Majesty, Prince Hao, and Prince Yun here today.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He then entered the inn, leaving the others to follow closely behind. Bringing up the rear, Yun Ruofeng was left to contemplate his next move. <em>Now that Pei Qianhao and Du Ling are both here, I can kill two birds with one stone. However, this must be done carefully.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In what seemed to be a habit of his, Li Zikang started bragging upon entering the inn. Just like before, it fell on practically deaf ears, with Yun Ruofeng being the only one to humour him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After they were settled in a room, a few women in revealing clothes entered.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Du Ling frowned at this, while Pei Qianhao remained expressionless. While even Yun Ruofeng avoided them, Li Zikang started to get touchy with the women.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“These ladies are the most beautiful ones in Xiangxiu Inn. It seems that the Western Region King and Prince Hao are unsatisfied. Somebody, take them away and execute them.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The women who were all smiling and laughing just a moment ago, immediately paled and started to beg. “Please spare us, General.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao and Du Ling knew that Li Zikang was trying to rile them up, and refused to show any reaction.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What are you waiting for? Take them away.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The tension in the air was palpable, and Li Zikang was rather outraged at the lack of reaction from Pei Qianhao and Du Ling. <em>How dare they look down on me! I guess there’s no need for me to be polite anymore.</em></p>
