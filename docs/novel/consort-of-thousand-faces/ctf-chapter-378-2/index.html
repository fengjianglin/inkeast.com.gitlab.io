 <p>Without giving Su Xi-er the chance to say anything, Pei Qianhao picked her up bridal style, and carried her into the inner chamber of the side hall.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the palace maid guarding outside saw Pei Qianhao, she shivered in fear. “This servant pays her respects to Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s cold gaze landed on the palace maid as he nonchalantly ordered, “Scram. You will go to the Laundry Service Bureau from tomorrow onwards.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When she heard the words ‘Laundry Service Bureau’, she trembled even more. “This servant deserves to die. Please forgive me, Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er understood why Pei Qianhao wanted to punish the palace maid; thus, she immediately interceded, “It doesn’t have anything to do with her. I was the one who insisted on coming out. Don’t blame her.” She then turned to the palace maid. “You don’t have to go to the Laundry Service Bureau tomorrow. Just come here for your duty.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The palace maid nervously glanced at Pei Qianhao before fearfully lowering her head.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao didn’t contradict Su Xi-er, only warning the palace maid not to do it again before he went in with Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The palace maid finally heaved a sigh of relief while staring at the closed door with wide eyes. <em>Just one sentence from that woman was enough to make Prince Hao change his mind!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the inner chamber, Pei Qianhao had carried Su Xi-er to the bed. The bloodstains on the bedsheets had already dried up.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao noticed Su Xi-er’s line of sight, and said, “This Prince will order the palace maids to change them tomorrow. Let’s not worry about it tonight.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why did Tan Ge suddenly go missing?” Su Xi-er muttered and raised her head to look at him. She had originally suspected Tan Ge for mistakenly killing Chao Mu, but was now confused. <em>If she was the culprit, why has she gone missing now? She’s even left behind a bloodstained hairpin.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao saw her knitted brows and couldn’t help but raise his hand to help her smoothen them out. “You also suspect Tan Ge.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Commandery Prince Xie supported the Tan Residence and planted Tan Ge in the Imperial Library. Considering that he always sets himself against you, maybe he had threatened Tan Ge to make a move on me.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Looking at her solemn expression, Pei Qianhao involuntarily pinched her smooth cheek. <em>It feels nice to do that.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Feeling the sudden pinch, Su Xi-er felt the abrupt action lightening the mood as she grabbed his hand and whined softly. “It’s painful.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince has already investigated Tan Ge long ago. She has a pure and kind personality. We can just test her to find out if it was her work.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er harrumphed. “You investigated her before you took her into the Beauty Palace.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The Beauty Palace has been dissolved for a while now. You’re still jealous?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What on earth were you trying to do by keeping so many women around? Even if it was to restrict the power of different factions, what power did the singers in there have? What power did the Tan Residence have?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s mood improved as he watched her jealous appearance, almost forgetting about his arrow injury. “You keep bringing up the Beauty Palace in front of this Prince. Su Xi-er, you should just admit that you have liked this Prince and been jealous since long ago.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er wanted to smack him, but her hand was grabbed as she was raising it. She was then brought into his embrace instead.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You find all men repulsive, and can’t stand them being close, much less kissing you.” Pei Qianhao paused for a moment and hugged her even tighter. “But now that you have given your body to this Prince, you can rest assured that this Prince won’t let you down.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er heard his warm voice flow into her ears. <em>I was reborn while harbouring deep-seated rancour, planning to live for the sake of revenge in this lifetime. However, I didn’t expect the heavens to take pity on me and allow me to meet Pei Qianhao.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She raised his head to look at him. “You keep saying that you don’t know how to speak sugar-coated words, but you’ve been lying this whole time. Look how sweet your words were just now.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Playfulness flickered across Pei Qianhao’s eyes. “It was this Prince’s fault for injuring you. In order for you to make a speedy recovery so that this Prince can repeat last night’s actions, I have no choice but to say some pleasant words to coax you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>This sounds so wrong, and the more I listen to it, the more shameless I think it is!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er raised her hand once again, intending to smack him. But once she remembered his injury, she could only slowly retract her hand.</p>
