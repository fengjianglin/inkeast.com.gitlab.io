 <p>“This Prince purposely told you because I wanted to see your reaction.” Pei Qianhao let out a soft chuckle, and embraced her even tighter. “This Prince hasn’t forgotten that you once ‘exchanged flirtatious glances’ with Nanzhao’s Emperor.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>So that’s the reason.&nbsp;</em>Su Xi-er raised her hand, and suddenly pinched his face. “Randomly letting your thoughts run wild; that didn’t happen at all.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing her mischievous appearance, Pei Qianhao felt his heart move. He immediately captured her lips, his right hand moving behind her waist while his left wandered onto her back.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Despite the strongly blowing wind outside of the room, it was unable to affect the warm atmosphere within.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Only after a long while did Pei Qianhao let go of her. He had indeed deliberately told her about Ning Lianchen, but the real reason for him doing so was certainly not because of the of them ‘exchanging flirtatious glances’. Rather, he had been trying to sound her out. <em>She pays so much attention to Ning Lianchen, and is even similar to Ning Rulan in other aspects. Besides that, she even knows how to write in the Lan Script.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I once told her that I don’t like women like Ning Rulan after she asked me. Even in the past, such a question would’ve drawn suspicion from me. However, things are no longer as simple as they seem.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Even if I were to believe that she was an ordinary maidservant, there are many aspects of her that don’t belong to one. That jade green dangling ornament, understanding the value of Lingrui flowers, being overly concerned about Nanzhao… Everything points to...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>She’s Ning Rulan. I claimed that she was a woman I wouldn’t love, but I have no choice but to admit that she is the one I treasure right now.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao had a rough understanding of how strong-willed Ning Rulan was. <em>If they’re really the same person, I can only… submit to my fate. It’s fine even if she’s strong. This Prince just needs to be stronger.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao wrapped his arms even tighter around her. <em>If my bold speculation is accurate, then that implies that she and Yun Ruofeng really did have a relationship between them. If Yun Ruofeng regrets and comes imploring her, would she go back?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Su Xi-er peeked her head out from his chest. <em>He has been behaving strangely ever since he returned today.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xi-er, remember, you are this Prince’s Princess Consort. You belong to me in this lifetime.” Pei Qianhao’s eyes were filled with an earnest hope.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er laughed. “Who else can I belong to, if not you?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You’re right. No one will dare to want this Prince’s woman, and no one is capable of doing so.” The expression in Pei Qianhao’s eyes was playful. <em>If someone does come to snatch her away, I just have to kill that person.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, a guard’s voice rang from outside the palace. “Prince Hao, Nanzhao’s Emperor has already entered Beimin’s capital.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er was surprised. <em>He arrived so quickly?&nbsp;</em>However, her eyes only glimmered for a moment.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao casually said, “He came pretty fast. He’s the earliest among the monarchs of the four nations.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He walked outside of the palace and informed the guard, “This Prince will personally receive him.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er couldn’t hold on any longer when she heard that. <em>I haven’t seen Lianchen in a very long time. I also want to go and take a look, but what excuse can I give for wanting to go?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, Pei Qianhao’s voice sounded in her ears again. “Xi-er, come and receive Nanzhao’s Emperor together with this Prince.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er couldn’t help the delighted expression that she showed before returning to normal the next moment. When they were out in the hall, she asked, “Why am I going too?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ignoring the guard standing beside him, Pei Qianhao lowered his head and whispered into her ears, “To see whether you and Nanzhao’s Emperor still exchange flirtatious glances with one another.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He pulled her arm and walked forward, not giving her the time to reply.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the palace maids passing by saw Pei Qianhao pulling Su Xi-er as they walked, they thought that Su Xi-er was displeased with him. <em>Wow, she dares to make a fuss in front of Prince Hao!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Some of them turned to one another to gossip. “Princess Consort Hao doesn’t have a good temper. Prince Hao still has to coax her when she throws a tantrum.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“She is lucky that Prince Hao likes her with such a temper.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Maybe this temper is a result of Prince Hao spoiling her!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Soon, the rumours of Prince Hao excessively spoiling Princess Consort Hao spread throughout the palace.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Naturally, Situ Li, who had just moved into the palace, also heard about it. He flipped through the Lan Script copybook in his hand for a while before closing it and looking out the window.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>A glint flickered past his eyes. <em>The letter has been sent. Yun Ruofeng, this Prince can only help you so much.</em></p>
