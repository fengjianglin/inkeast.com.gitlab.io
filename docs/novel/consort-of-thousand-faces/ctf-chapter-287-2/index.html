 <p>Hence, the five flower growers immediately started to study the Lingrui flower before them. They examined everything, from the soil, to the roots, and even the colour of the leaves.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er stepped forward with a smile. "Prince Hao, it will take some time until they finish. This servant will brew a cup of tea and bring you a stool."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao waved his hand. "There's no need for that; accompany this Prince for a stroll around the place."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Leaving on a whim was indeed Pei Qianhao's style. Su Xi-er immediately followed after him, but secretly turned and shot Feng Changing a meaningful glance before leaving.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Prince Hao, where are you going for a stroll?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao turned on his heel and headed off before replying. "My room."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er's halted her footsteps. <em>The room is for resting, but he wants to stroll in it?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Catch up." A deep and powerful voice rang as Pei Qianhao hastened his footsteps and entered the room in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er followed Pei Qianhao in and saw him retrieve a small brown bottle from the cabinet.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He stared at her with an indifferent gaze before pointing to the bed. "Take off your clothes and lie on the bed."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er's first reaction was to take a step back in confusion. <em>Why is he telling me to take off my clothes for no reason?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"This is fresh Lingrui flower powder; apply it on yourself immediately. This Prince wants to see how the effects are." Pei Qianhao's nonchalant expression made it seem like he really only wanted to see the effects of the powder.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"This servant doesn't need Lingrui flower powder, but this servant can help apply it on you." Su Xi-er suggested softly as she approached him. "Remove your clothes and lie on the bed; this servant shall apply it on you."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"This Prince won't repeat myself. Are you going to strip?" Pei Qianhao then took another step forward, as though he was about to do it for her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er felt helpless. <em>It seems like there’s no changing his mind.&nbsp;</em>"Why do I have to remove all my garments? It can just be applied on a single spot."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"This Prince will be applying it to every part of your body in order to see its effect."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A glint flashed across Su Xi-er's eyes as she swiftly arrived in front of Pei Qianhao and took the bottle from his hand. "This servant shall return to my room to apply it myself and not trouble you, Prince Hao."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"If you have the guts to step out of this room, you can try." Before she could turn, Pei Qianhao’s deep voice rang through the room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Prince Hao, if this servant walks out now, what will you do?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Looking at her proudly lifted chin, a streak of playfulness appeared in the recesses of Pei Qianhao's eyes. "This Prince shall take what you care most about."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er froze. <em>He doesn't know my true identity. To him, the thing I care most about is my chastity. If I try to walk out, he will...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"This Prince doesn't make jokes" Pei Qianhao stretched out a hand, "Give me the bottle, strip, and lie down.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er pondered momentarily but before she could make a decision, Pei Qianhao had already stepped forward and placed both hands on her waist. In the blink of an eye, she felt herself being thrown onto the bed and saw Pei Qianhao with a hand raised.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er immediately sat up, dodged into the inner side of the bed, and started to remove her clothes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Only then was Pei Qianhao satisfied. <em>We wouldn’t have wasted so much time if she had been more obedient.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After removing her outer robes and pants and reaching her inner garments, Su Xi-er hesitated for a moment before she pursed her lips and braced herself to strip herself bare.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao opened the bottle and a faint scent emanated from it.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He bent down and poured the powder onto her back. It was rapidly absorbed into the skin, and before long, there were no traces of it left on Su Xi-er’s back.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A pair of large hands moved across her back before his nose leaned in. "Smells good."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He then did the same with her arms and legs before his hands reached the most crucial part of a female’s anatomy.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao halted his movements and looked at Su Xi-er to see that her eyes were shut tightly.</p>
