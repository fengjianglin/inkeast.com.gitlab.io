<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Su Xi-er’s face was wreathed in smiles as she purposely countered. “Whatever I do is right? Even if I beat you and scold you?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She raised her right hand to pinch his cheeks, making it look adorable to her, but quite strange to others.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao allowed her to do as she wished, and only replied when she let go. “Don’t you know that harsh words and deeds can demonstrate one’s love? A woman’s expression of love for their husband is through beating and scolding, but a man’s expression of love for their wife is in bedroom affairs.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>For saying such shameless things in a matter-of-fact way, he naturally received a flick to his forehead. “Where did all your groundless and distorted reasonings come from?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“They naturally make sense. This Prince has recently been studying a play script, and I found many reasonings inside the book that are worth looking into.” He acted as if he was very earnest, taking her hand as he walked them out of the woods.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>First it was the medical book, and now it’s a play script; is this still the mighty and all-powerful Prince Hao?!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The two finally reached the mountain path with Su Xi-er still staring at Pei Qianhao, though there was still no change in the latter’s natural expression.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After being stared at for quite a while, Pei Qianhao decided to ask, “Is this Prince so good-looking today?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“My little Haohao is handsome every day, to the point that I can’t take my eyes off you.” Su Xi-er joked.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, the eyelids of a guard standing on the mountain path fiercely twitched. <em>There have simply been too many shocking matters today! Little Haohao?! Prince Hao’s expression after hearing that can’t be good!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Succumbing to his curiosity, the guard plucked up his courage to look in Pei Qianhao’s direction, only to immediately swivel back to his original position in shock and lower his head.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei QIanhao’s expression was stormy, and his eyes ice-cold.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>On second thought, that’s not surprising. Little Haohao? It doesn’t fit the airs of a prince at all!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, the guard didn’t expect Pei Qianhao’s rebuttal to be so gentle.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince doesn’t like the name ‘Little Haohao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I thought of it for you, yet you dare to say that you don’t like it?” Su Xi-er feigned anger, acting like she was going to hit him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao grasped her hand. “I can listen to you for anything else; this is the only exception.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why? Give me a satisfactory reason.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A naughty smile flickered across Pei Qianhao’s face as he moved closer to her, whispering into her ear, “This Prince wants to be back in charge as the husband.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He immediately received an indifferent look from Su Xi-er who pushed him away. “Go away.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She looked away for a brief moment before turning back to look at him. “Do you not like Little Haohao because it doesn’t fit your disposition?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Must you really make this Prince say the truth?” Pei Qianhao pretended to helplessly laugh. He moved even closer to her and purposely pressed that part of his lower body against her. “You dare to say that this Prince is little? You dare to look down on the most reputable part of a man?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er instantly understood. <em>So that’s what he meant.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The emotion in her eyes changed multiple times before she pushed him away again. “Fooling around.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Right after Pei Qianhao was pushed away, he took a step forward and embraced her from behind. He leaned towards her ear, an earnest expression replacing the playful look in his eyes. “Xi-er, I’ll only say this once, so you have to remember it. Before I joined the Pei Family, my surname was also ‘Pei’, and this was why I chose to enter the Pei Residence. Furthermore, apart from your given name, people in Beimin also have a courtesy name. Mine was ‘Jing’, and my parents called me A-jing.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>A-jing; his pet name.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s gaze flickered as she turned around, and she cupped his face as she softly called, “A-Jing.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao lowered his head, planting a kiss on her forehead. “Mmm.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The guard couldn’t help but feel a shiver down his spine upon hearing the name ‘A-Jing’. <em>Is this the pet name the Princess Consort has given Prince Hao? It sounds rather nice; it fits the demeanour of a prince much more!</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Suddenly, a woman’s anxious voice rang out. All the small yellow flowers in Su Miao’s hands had fallen to the ground. <em>The ground is littered with arrows!</em></p>
