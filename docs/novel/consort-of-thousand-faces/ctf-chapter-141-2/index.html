 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>She turned her body and drunkenly giggled with a foolish expression. Then, she started to adopt a dancing posture.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>She’s actually dancing in the room!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao looked at her foolish grin and messy footwork as she spun around, tiptoed, then turned around again, her large sleeves fluttering in dance. Despite it being chaotic, her dancing finesse could be felt from her movements.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Come, let’s dance.” Su Xi-er waved her hand, having long forgotten who the person before her was.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao was moved by her smile. Before he moved forward, Su Xi-er had already approached him while spinning in circles.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With how unsteady she was, she was already feeling giddy by the time she reached Pei Qianhao. With a bend of her knees, she directly fell to the ground.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Be careful…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A large hand reached out, managing to embrace her. Yet, he saw Su Xi-er smiling with no sense of self-preservation.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hehe...come. Dance, dance…” She whirled out of Pei Qianhao’s embrace.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This time, her footsteps were much more steady, as if she had found the beat.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In fact, she was no longer just dancing, but actually starting to remove her clothes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her temples were drenched with sweat, but she was still smiling. Her outer robe fell beside her feet, but she showed no signs of stopping.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The expression in Pei Qianhao’s eyes instantly changed, his brows furrowing as he moved to stop her. Before he could do anything however, an inner garment flew through the air, threatening to cover his head.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With a flick of his hand, Pei Qianhao had caught the inner garment.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Looking back and forth between the clothes in his hand and the dancing Su Xi-er, Pei Qianhao only felt his temples throbbing madly. <em>Is this woman crazy?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He briskly stepped forward and looped his hand around her waist, ordering, “Stop dancing!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er didn’t understand and pouted, tilting her head to one side in puzzlement. “Why can’t I dance anymore? You don’t know that I dance very well. Why don’t I dance one more time for you to watch?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I don’t need it!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“But what should I do since I really want to dance?” Su Xi-er asked in a tender voice, behaving coquettishly towards Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This was Pei Qianhao’s first time seeing a different side of Su Xi-er. Apart from feeling shocked, he was also a little pleased.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His lips turned upwards slightly. “You really want to dance?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er nodded fervently. “Yes yes, I really like dancing. It’s best if you can dance with me!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao felt his temples continuing to throb, only to hear Su Xi-er’s giggling as she poked his nose. “You little bitch! You little bitch! Hehe...little bitch…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Touching him all over, Su Xi-er was extremely happy; in fact, she ended up pushing Pei Qianhao onto the bed in her excitement.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hehe, little bitch. You little bitch…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She looked up and down his body as her hands began randomly searching for something.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her hand moved from his waist to his chest, then to his neck, where she tried to pull at his clothes, before finally stopping at his face.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Then, she cracked a smile and told the person below her. “Hehe...I didn’t think that a little bitch’s skin would be so smooth…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s face turned from white to red, then to black. He couldn’t describe the odd emotion he felt as the pair of soft hands caressed his cheeks.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, he didn’t get to enjoy that feeling for long. Su Xi-er suddenly raised her hand, her smile suddenly morphing into a face of anger.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But just as she was about to bring her hand down, the effect of the wine assailed her senses, causing her to pass out on top of Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao looked at the unconscious person and thought about the matters that night. He sighed helplessly to himself before flipping over and laying Su Xi-er on the bed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The sound of her even breathing could be heard. Looking at Su Xi-er lying on the bed, Pei Qianhao suddenly smiled. He realised that even though such a Su Xi-er offended her superior, he found her adorable, mischievous, and completely different.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>It’s just that she actually called me a little bitch!</em></p>

 <p>Hey everyone!</p>
 <p>If you are looking for some suspense and thriller to read, I would recommend <a href="https://www.volarenovels.com/novel/split-zone-13" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Split Zone 13</a>. It's one of the most memorable non-historical novel I have read and the world-building is really exciting! XD The best thing is that it's already completed, so it's time to binge! ^_^</p>
