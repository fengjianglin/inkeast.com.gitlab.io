 <p>Heh! That title caught your attention, didn’t it? :P Well, I’m not kidding! We present to you <a href="https://www.volarenovels.com/novel/rebirth-of-a-fashionista" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">Rebirth of a Fashionista</span></strong></a>!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>"This servant is not Prince Hao, how could I guess what you’re thinking? But what this servant can say is that it isn’t anything good."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"You are not this Prince, but you have guessed correctly. Su Xi-er, aren't you powerful?" Pei Qianhao's eyes were fixated on her ankle as he spoke. <em>Since Yun Ruofeng wants her to go on stage and dance, I shall twist her ankle and see how she will dance!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er knew his intent immediately as soon as she followed his gaze. She promptly turned and headed towards the exit; but before she could reach it, she was halted by a long arm reaching out and grabbing her shoulder.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In an instant, Su Xi-er was held in a certain someone's warm embrace, their foot rubbing against her ankle at the same time. This position was not elegant, and not how a Prince Regent should act.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er chuckled. "Prince Hao, you are acting like those dancers from the dance houses when they try to seduce others, even caressing my leg in the process."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao finally realised how unglamorous he looked when she spoke. <em>I had been intending to threaten her with twisting her ankle, but now… Damn, this woman is certainly stepping all over me.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"You are this Prince's maidservant, and this Prince doesn’t allow you to go dance. If Nanzhao’s Eldest Imperial Princess can twist her ankle, so can you." Pei Qianhao carefully observed Su Xi-er and saw a slight change in her expression. <em>Is this state banquet dance so important to her that she has to go?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Prince Hao, this servant must prepare before going. A horse carriage from the palace will arrive when it's time." Seeing that Pei Qianhao wasn't letting go, Su Xi-er raised her foot and stomped on his own.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Such strength was nothing to Pei Qianhao, but he still let go off her. He took a look at the dainty footprint on his shoes before watching Su Xi-er as she walked out.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Logically, I should be angry and have her severely punished. But, instead of doing so, I instinctively let her go. How strange...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Realising this, Pei Qianhao's eyes deepened.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, there was a flurry of activity going on at the imperial palace. This was especially true of the Eldest Imperial Princess’ repose palace.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian had been in her repose palace and re-choreographing her dance. There were more hand movements, but the footwork was now much slower. Even though it was slightly lacking when compared to the original dance, it was still acceptable. At the very least, the dance wouldn’t be cancelled.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yet, just as she was in the middle of deciding how else to alter the dance, she saw Qin Ling approaching with ten imperial guards; five of them stood within the repose palace, and five outside. Such a scene couldn’t help but remind her of the time that Ning Rulan was detained by imperial guards right before she was thrown into prison.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>What are they trying to do!? Are they planning on detaining me even though I have to go on stage to dance at the state banquet?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian couldn't sit still anymore. She stood up and took two hasty steps forward before feeling a sharp pain at her ankle.<em>&nbsp;Damn it, it is not swollen anymore, but I will fall if I try to go any faster.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian held her temper and slowly passed through the main hall entrance. &nbsp;She glared at the Imperial Guard Army Commander, Qin Ling. "What is the meaning of this? You brought your troops to lock down this Princess' palace gates in the hopes of detaining me?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qin Ling bowed and deferentially replied, "Eldest Imperial Princess, you won’t be able to dance properly with your injured ankle. Instead, Your Highness can head to the state banquet when the time is right."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian felt like she had just been struck by lightning. She lost the strength in her legs as she took a few steps back, and if Piao Xu hadn’t caught her, Ning Anlian would’ve fallen to the ground.</p>
