 <p>CHAPTER 419: THE CLOUDS AND WIND GRADUALLY FADE INTO THE DISTANCE <span id="footnote-ref-f5a7"><a href="#footnote-f5a7">[1]</a></span></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng involuntarily smiled as his eyes rested on the distant scenery, then turning around to gaze at Su Xi-er. “Lan-er, how much did you love me back then?” He pretended to casually walk closer to her, reaching out to grab her wrist as he spoke.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His gaze immediately became different. “No one can obtain what I can’t.” His voice was now laced with wickedness, and his eyes were unreadable.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yun Ruofeng, I didn’t expect that you would be reduced to this state; neither a human nor a ghost.” Su Xi-er maintained her composure despite the frostiness in her eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng laughed in response. “I said that I would bring you away. Now that I am going to die, I will also drag you down with me. It’s also not a bad idea for us to become a married ghost couple.” He then pulled her over.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Su Xi-er had already hidden a stone in her hand. When Yun Ruofeng tried to pull her over, she used her free hand to strike his numbing acupoint.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Catching her by surprise, Yun Ruofeng slightly loosened his grip, only to attack once again when Su Xi-er was about to free herself. “Lan-er, having been in the army for many years, I have a wealth of combat experience. How can this little trick deceive me?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was immediately after he spoke that they both felt the vibration of approaching footsteps beneath their feet. A moment later, Pei Qianhao appeared while still dressed in his crimson groom robes. His entire body exuded a dangerous cold aura, and the solemn expression on his face did nothing to mask his murderous intent.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His eyes deepened as he walked closer and saw that Yun Ruofeng was tightly holding on to Su Xi-er as they stood near the edge of the precipice. However, he made sure to conceal his anxiety.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, you are really fast. This Prince still hasn’t managed to say much to Xi-er.” &nbsp;Yun Ruofeng faintly smiled as his hand remained tightly wound around Su Xi-er’s wrist.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er slightly nodded at Pei Qianhao to assure him that she was fine.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This imperceptible movement of hers didn’t escape Yun Ruofeng’s eyes, and he gently smiled. “You are going to become a married ghost couple with this Prince soon, yet you still can’t forget about Prince Hao?” He shifted his gaze as a sombre coldness shrouded his eyes. “Pei Qianhao, do you know who this woman this Prince is holding is?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>What will Pei Qianhao’s expression be like if he finds out that she’s Ning Rulan? I know that he doesn’t like strong-willed women.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er felt a cold hand wrap around her heart, and she immediately looked towards Pei Qianhao with an emotionally charged gaze. What he said next, however, greatly shocked her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince doesn’t care if she’s Ning Rulan or Su Xi-er. All this Prince cares about is that she is now Princess Consort Hao; she is this Prince’s woman.” His tone was confident, and his gaze filled with determination.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Surprise flickered across Yun Ruofeng’s eyes before he turned to look at Su Xi-er. “I didn’t expect him to already know about your identity.” He paused and looked towards Pei Qianhao. “Since you are already aware that she is Ning Rulan, then you must also know that she is this Prince’s fiancée. Now, this Prince plans to bring her away!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao mockingly said, “After penetrating her heart with one arrow; you no longer have any connection with her. There’s no medicine for regret in this world.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With a flash of a red, he had already reached Su Xi-er, and was prepared to snatch her away.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Yun Ruofeng pulled her away just as quickly. “Pei Qianhao, you won’t be able to obtain her!” He immediately dragged her to the edge and jumped while she was within his grasp.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao felt as if a gust of wind had blown past his ears as the red wedding dress slipped past his fingers.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This was the exact sight that greeted Ning Lianchen when he rushed to the scene. He uncontrollably screamed, “Imperial Elder Sister!” His voice reverberated throughout the mountain.</p>
