 <p>Su Miao gazed at Xie Yun’s smiling eyes.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><em>Although he’s the Commandery Prince, he doesn’t put on any airs at all. He didn’t look down on me for being from a poor family, and he didn’t even pretend to not see me when I recognised him. Instead, he warmly greeted me and asked how I was doing.</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><em>Even now, he’s checking on me out of concern; he’s truly a good person.</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The more Su Miao was caught up in her thoughts, the more she couldn’t help but smile. Her ordinary appearance now the picture of an adorable girl.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>However, no matter how pure she was, Xie Yun wouldn’t let his heart soften. His principle was that the ends justified the means.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><em>Besides, I like ruining everything pure the most. Since they will be going to Willow Village tomorrow, I must properly make use of this chance.</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Commandery Prince, you really are a good person. Thank you.” Su Miao sincerely thanked him with a wide smile.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Xie Yun waved his hand. “Miss Su, you don’t have to thank this Prince. I simply passed by Willow Village and happened to see you. Are you and the Princess Consort the only ones going to Willow Village tomorrow?”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Younger Cousin promised to go with me, but I don’t know whether Prince Hao will be coming along. However, considering his noble background, visiting a place as desolate and rural as Willow Village will only taint his status.” Su Miao’s expression was one of tired acceptance.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><em>Even the people in Willow Village don’t deign to go to my house.</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Having seen it before, Xie Yun naturally knew how dilapidated it was. <em>I’m afraid the roof will be caving in soon if they continue to leave it as it is.</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Miss Su, your family is the Princess Consort’s maiden family. With how much Prince Hao dotes on the Princess Consort, how could he possibly disdain her maiden family?”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Su Miao lifted her head to look at him, the sunlight that showered his body making it look like he was glowing. “Commandery Prince, you are truly a good person.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Although the village teacher had taught her how to use other words, the only ones that would come to mind right now were ‘good person’.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Xie Yun smiled, but kept silent.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><em>It’s the first time someone has emphasised again and again that I’m a good person. However, how would I still be alive if that was the case?</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>At this moment, a woman’s laughter could be heard. “The Commandery Prince and my elder cousin are enjoying conversing with one another.” Su Xi-er commented as she walked in. Ruo Yuan followed behind her with a tray of freshly boiled tea.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Xie Yun took out a small box from his sleeve and passed it to Su Xi-er. “A luminous night pearl from the Southern Sea; your wedding gift. I hope you won’t disdain it, Princess Consort.”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>When Su Xi-er opened the box, the bluish-green luminous night pearl that was exquisitely made was a sight to behold. Having never seen such a thing before, even she was briefly dazzled.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“I like it so much; how could I possibly disdain it? Ruo Yuan, keep it well; place it in the main courtyard.” Su Xi-er closed the box and passed it to Ruo Yuan.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“This servant obeys the order.” Ruo Yuan respectfully took the box and bowed before leaving the main hall.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Xie Yun watched Ruo Yuan as she left. “This lass looks thinner than she was in the Palace Side Quarters.”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Commandery Prince, I couldn’t tell that you are so attentive and your observation skills were so acute; she has indeed become thinner since leaving the Palace Side Quarters.” Su Xi-er remarked as she poured a cup of tea for Xie Yun.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The corners of Xie Yun’s mouth curled up as he raised his hand and purposely tried to touch Su Xi-er’s hand. Just as he was about to touch her, however, Su Xi-er retracted her hand. If it wasn’t for Xie Yun’s fast reflexes, the teacup would have fallen to the ground.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Commandery Prince, you should make a trip to the Imperial Physician institute and let the imperial physicians prescribe you something for your hands and legs.” Su Xi-er smiled as she sat back on the main seat.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><em>To dare to take advantage of me, you really have a lot of guts!</em></p>

 <p>What's Xie Yun up to man? O_O</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><em>It’s the first time someone has emphasised again and again that I’m a good person. However, how would I still be alive if that was the case?</em></p>
 <p>Not saying it's justified or anything, but it seems like Xie Yun has a pretty cynical world view</p>
