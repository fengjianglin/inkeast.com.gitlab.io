 <p><strong>At this moment, Flowers Arrive Inn.</strong></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The inn’s manager had long heard of what happened in the alley, and so was well aware that apart from Prince Yun, Prince Hao of Beimin had also arrived in Moon County.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>That said, it was still a shock when Prince Hao was standing in front of him! The manager was immediately even more deferential and fearful than he had been with Prince Yun, his voice even quivering when he spoke. Prince Yun was courteous with everyone, but the same couldn’t be said for the man in front of him. After all, he had witnessed how powerful Prince Hao was.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The manager recalled warning he had once given Prince Hao, and was deeply regretting it right now! <em>I had actually said something so stupid, but there’s no medicine for regrets in this world.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Prince… Hao, this peasant was blind and failed to recognize a great person. If I had offended you previously, please forgive this lowly one and spare my life." The manager could feel his legs trembling as he implored.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao kept quiet, but his gaze was fixed on Su Xi-er. <em>This should be the normal reaction for someone who’s offended me, but what about her? Can't she just pick up a little from others?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao sighed inwardly; he had already forgotten that this was what had attracted him to Su Xi-er in the first place.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er couldn't help but speak up when she saw the manager on his knees, his face full of fear. "Manager, Prince Hao has a magnanimous heart, and won't take it personally. You don’t have to be so afraid. Moreover, as a citizen of Nanzhao, even if you were to be punished, it wouldn't be done by Prince Hao."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She had only spoken a few words, but Su Xi-er had managed to flatter Pei Qianhao before bringing up Nanzhao in quick succession. <em>This mouth is getting more and more voluble.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A subtle glint flashed across Pei Qianhao's eyes as if he was saying, ‘<em>I will deal with you later’.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The manager didn’t dare to look up at Pei Qianhao as a cold sweat ran down his forehead. He had spent half his life running Flowers Arrive Inn, but had never expected the two most powerful men in the world, Prince Hao and Prince Yun, to come and stay in on the same day.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After a substantial amount of time, Pei Qianhao finally made a hand gesture, "Get up, you didn't offend this Prince. Bring some top-grade flower wine that is suitable for women to drink."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The manager was momentarily stunned. <em>What? Flower wine that is suitable for women to drink? What does Prince Hao mean by this?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Just bring it," Pei Qianhao reiterated in a cold voice. The manager was so frightened that he immediately bowed and went to the back kitchen to get the flower wine.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Upon entering the kitchen, the manager finally began to think about the request. <em>Everyone, regardless of gender, can drink flower wine. But wouldn’t someone with a powerful aura like Prince Hao disdain drinking women's wine?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er had a bad feeling when she heard Pei Qianhao mentioning wine, immediately responding, "Prince Hao, it's better if you drink less. Could it be that we are still staying in Moon County today?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao smiled and answered her with another question, "What do you think?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just then, a masculine female voice rang in the air. "You rascal! You saw this lady's body and ordered your subordinate to knock me out. Now, you are flirting with another woman. Watch how I deal with you!"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her voice was loud enough to be heard by everyone in the room. Thankfully, there were no other guests after hearing that Prince Hao and Prince Yun were both staying here., having immediately packed their belongings and left.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This woman however, had been spending this entire time knocked out! She had just woken up, and was still dizzy after leaving her room.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>However, she never thought that she would see the man who provoked her with another woman the moment she stepped out. She hadn't even reached the ground floor! How could she not be worked up? She could not forget the Mei Family's ancestral teachings. <em>This man must marry me!</em></p>
