 <p>Heh! That title caught your attention, didn’t it? :P Well, I’m not kidding! We present to you <a href="https://www.volarenovels.com/novel/rebirth-of-a-fashionista" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">Rebirth of a Fashionista</span></strong></a>!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>“We’ll see who the one begging is soon enough.” &nbsp;Su Xi-er took two steps back, calmly turning her wrists to take out a few small rocks that she had hidden with her sleeves.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Although this body is not as fit as my previous one, I have managed to retain my basic skills. It will be fine as long as I can control their pressure points.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before the two men could touch her, Su Xi-er flicked her wrists, striking them in the knee with two rocks.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Argh!” The two men shouted and both fell on one knee.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er took the chance to rush up and kick them both in the chest with enough force to send them flying for more than a metre.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The two men were caught off guard, and by the time they realised what had happened, they were already laying on the ground in pain.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Argh, Argh...” The two men groaned and couldn’t stand up for a while.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er was satisfied with her work. <em>Although I can’t kick someone a few metres away like I did in my past lifetime, this is still acceptable.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Constable Liu hadn’t expected something like this. <em>Although Dayan and A-song aren’t constables or skilled fighters, they shouldn’t be weaker than a woman. I can’t believe they were beaten to the ground before they even touched her.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His eyes darkened. “You have some skill in martial arts?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er laughed. “I only used a bit of force with that kick. It’s only because these men are useless that they fell to the ground so easily; they are even bawling now.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After that, Su Xi-er walked up and stepped on the two men who remained solidly grounded. <em>The sound of their howls is so ‘mellifluous’!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You…” Constable Liu was enraged.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I have been a constable for so long, but it’s been my first time meeting such a brazen woman.&nbsp;</em>That being said, Constable Liu’s vast experience allowed him to quickly calm down, adopting a more composed and careful stance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’ll have you show me your true strength then. Be careful not to mess up.” After that, Constable Liu pulled out a gleaming dagger from a hidden scabbard on his waist.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er became serious when she saw the sharp blade of the dagger, barely dodging in time as it slid past her face.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Constable Liu was not only strong, but also skilful. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been a leader of the constables.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Although he didn’t have any larger blades today, the dagger couldn’t be belittled. <em>It should be simple for me to win since this woman only has her bare hands.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Each move that Constable Liu made was firm and powerful, aiming at fatal places. Su Xi-er could tell since she was familiar with the body’s acupuncture points, causing her to be even more careful.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After a dozen exchanges between the two, Constable Liu still couldn’t injure Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He didn’t know that it was because his techniques were too ‘hard’, and that Su Xi-er had studied ‘soft’ techniques in her previous life. As a result, she was able to neutralise his moves with relative ease.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Of course, Constable Liu was still a relatively skilled combatant, and it was inevitable that Su Xi-er began to feel some fatigue as the fight went on.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I must quickly bring an end to this!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She didn’t dare to slow down her movement while she was thinking, punches and kicks landing on Constable Liu as she warded off his moves.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At last, she dodged and used her hand to strike his neck, causing him to tremble before falling to his knees.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before Constable Liu had the chance to recover, Su Xi-er kicked him from behind, sending him careening into the dirt.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er only stood at the side, watching the three men who were laid out on the ground in front of her.</p>

 <p>Su Xi-er was satisfied with her work. Although I can’t kick someone a few metres away like I did in my past lifetime, this is still acceptable.</p>
 <p><strong>Sangria:</strong> LOL is Su Xi-er is the female Bruce Lee?</p>
