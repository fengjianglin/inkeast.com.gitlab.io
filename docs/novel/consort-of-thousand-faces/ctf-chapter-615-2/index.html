<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Pei Qianhao waved a hand at the man and said, “You all will return to the Prince Hao Residence and help His Majesty stabilise things in the capital.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Though concerned, the men will not defy their orders. All of them bowed and responded, “This subordinate obeys the order.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before long, Pei Qianhao and a handful of subordinates from Nanzhao were the only ones left at the scene.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao looked at the men and said, “Yun Ruofeng.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>All of the men stiffened at the name. <em>Prince Yun heartlessly pushed the Princess to her death in her previous life, even going as far as to hide her body! Now that she finally has a second chance, how dare he show up again!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hearing the name Yun Ruofeng was already enough to make these people’s blood boil. For him to act against Su Xi-er again? They wanted nothing more than to rip him to pieces!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>One of the men then said, “Prince Hao, Yun Ruofeng is a vicious schemer despite his looks. Many of our brothers lost their lives because of him, and he was the one who disfigured Big Brother Changqing!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>These ex-subordinates of Ning Rulan no longer hid their true identities, believing that Pei Qianhao would already know the truth of Su Xi-er’s identity. Despite how preposterous such an assumption seemed, his actions had been enough to endear Pei Qianhao to these men.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Accordingly, Pei Qianhao didn’t disappoint them as he replied, “This Prince has met him before, and he’s nothing without his men. He’ll be ripped to shreds this time.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The men knelt and said, “Prince Hao, please give your instructions.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao nodded before hopping onto his horse. “Follow the tracks. Once we locate Yun Ruofeng, I will lure him out. Use that opportunity to save Su Xi-er.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This subordinate obeys the order!” The men answered in unison and immediately mounted their horses. Before long, the only sound heard in the night was the sound of the horse’s hooves.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao silently marveled at Su Xi-er’s leadership capabilities. Not only was she able to lead troops, but each and every one of her subordinates loved and supported her in addition to being loyal.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I need to learn from her in future.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Yun Ruofeng could take her away only because she’s in a weakened state. I wonder how she is now?&nbsp;</em>Pei Qianhao frowned at the thought.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this point, Yun Ruofeng used four different horse carriages, and made each one go in a different direction before abandoning them on the road in an attempt to confuse any pursuers. Even if Pei Qianhao found the tracks, he would be led on a wild goose chase.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng wanted to make use of this extra time so that he could make Su Xi-er his!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s hatred for him would never dissipate, but Yun Ruofeng felt that as long as she let go of all that hatred, she would be able to fall in love with him once again. If it had happened once, it could definitely happen again.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>She will only have eyes for me as long as she doesn’t see Pei Qianhao! It’s time for him to return her to me now! No matter what, she’s Ning Rulan! It’s too late to turn things around, so this is all I can do to make her stay.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng caressed her cheek as images of a smiling Ning Rulan flashed in his mind, recalling her serious yet coquettish demeanour.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Lan-er, I won’t let you down. Compared to Pei Qianhao, I’ll take better care of you. Come back to this Prince, and we’ll build a bamboo house together somewhere far away. We can have two kids, a boy and a girl, and you’ll forget all about your hatred and Pei Qianhao. Unfortunately, my methods are a little extreme.” Yun Ruofeng then laughed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He had no idea that Su Xi-er had already woken up at this point. She only pretended to continue to be asleep as she listened to everything he said.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>He actually wants me to forget about everything he’s done and leave A-Jing?! Fat chance!</em></p>
