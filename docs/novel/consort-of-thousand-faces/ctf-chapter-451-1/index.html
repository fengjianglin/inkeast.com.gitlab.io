<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Early the next morning, the guards set off from the Prince Hao Residence and headed for the Merchant River to bring Pei Qianhao and Su Xi-er back to the residence. Shortly after they arrived, Pei Qianhao and Su Xi-er came down from the boat hand-in-hand. They then boarded the carriage that the guards had brought along, quickly beginning their trip home.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Upon arriving at the entrance of the Prince Hao Residence, Su Xi-er lifted the curtains of the carriage when she heard a familiar voice.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>It’s the woman from the restaurant yesterday.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s gaze drifted to Pei Qianhao as she purposely said, “Brother Hu, your childhood sweetheart has even come directly to your door to look for you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao immediately spotted the young lady when he looked out of the carriage.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I’ve never seen her before this, but why is she visiting the residence?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xi-er, you’re jealous.” Pei Qianhao remarked. He reached out his arms to embrace her waist and carry her down the carriage.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the anxious Zhen Yu heard some movements from behind her, she immediately turned around. Even if she was aware that Pei Qianhao wasn’t her Brother Hu, they still bore a striking resemblance. Seeing someone who looked like Brother Hu holding another woman in his arms still made her heart feel uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She watched as Pei Qianhao carefully smoothed out the creases of Su Xi-er’s dress before tidying up her hair. It was only after that did the two of them begin to walk over.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er smiled at Zhen Yu. “Miss, who are you looking for?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After Mei Jinxiu’s lesson, Zhen Yu was well aware of Pei Qianhao’s status. <em>If I still act recklessly, then it would be considered being rude.&nbsp;</em>Thus, she showed a deferential expression as she slowly explained, “This peasant woman is here to look for Physician Mei.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>So she’s not here to look for Pei Qianhao.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Catching herself, Su Xi-er realised that she really was acting jealous.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>The young lady hasn’t even done anything yet, and I’m already jealous. If some young lady really pops up in the future, won’t I fly into a huge temper?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er walked forward. “You’re here to find Physician Mei for treatment?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhen Yu shook her head. “Since I came from a village in the mountains, I didn’t have anybody to depend on when I came here. Physician Mei was kind enough to take me in, so I am doing some odd jobs for her to assist her however I can while I search for my husband.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>So that’s how it is. She went to Mei’s Medical clinic in the end.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er pointed to the direction of the Prince Hao Residence. “Physician Mei is in the residence. Wait here for a moment while I go and call her.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhen Yu nodded, and she urged, “Please tell her to be quick. Big Brother Qin hurt himself while forging iron; there’s a large burn on his arm.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Which Big Brother Qin?” <em>Sounds like he knows Mei Jinxiu quite well.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Qin Ling, the ‘Ling’ from ‘shan ling’<span id="footnote-ref-c6b6"><a href="#footnote-c6b6">[1]</a></span>.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er was slightly stunned, not understanding how the two of them knew one another.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I didn’t expect for her to be familiar with Qin Ling. However, it does make sense; after being stripped of his title of Commander, Qin Ling doesn’t have anywhere to go as an orphan. It can be considered a type of fate that he met Mei Jinxiu after roving around.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er nodded. “I will go and ask Physician Mei to come out.” She immediately headed inside the Prince Hao Residence.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Outside the entrance, Zhen Yu was staring at Pei Qianhao in a trance. <em>He really looks like Brother Hu.&nbsp;</em>Her gaze became lost, as if Pei Qianhao had been replaced by Brother Hu.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Miss, does Brother Hu really look so much like this Prince? When did you two get separated?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhen Yu froze for a moment when she saw him suddenly walking towards her, but quickly recovered. “He does. In fact, you two look so alike that it’s hard to tell the difference. If I take the image of Brother Hu in my mind and take away the childish nature, it would look the same as you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Childish nature?&nbsp;</em>Pei Qianhao knitted his brow. <em>It sounds like they have been separated since they were young.&nbsp;</em>“Miss, I hope you’ll find your Brother Hu soon.” He then turned around to enter the residence.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Zhen Yu immediately called out to him, “Prince Hao, this peasant woman has a request.” She didn’t know why she had suddenly thought to say this, but she was already kneeling on the ground.</p>
