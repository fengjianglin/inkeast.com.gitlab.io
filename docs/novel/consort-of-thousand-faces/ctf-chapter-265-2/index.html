<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Looking at him, Su Xi-er felt that he looked very much like a child who had just eaten sweets and was now looking for more.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>There’s a saying in the folk operas. ‘No matter how old a man is, he is still a child in front of the woman he loves. You can tell that he loves you only if he shows his childlike side’.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s heart skipped a beat. <em>If such a saying is true, then could it be that Pei Qianhao loves me? How is that possible? He clearly said he doesn’t love strong women, and would never fall in love with Ning Rulan.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What are you thinking?” Pei Qianhao’s voice sounded out, inadvertently disrupting her thoughts.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, after coming to the Literary Association and seeing this servant gravely injured, you must already know everything that’s happened.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Yun ordered Wei Mohai to harm you, and this Prince will not let him off. However, your skills have surprised this Prince. How did you kill someone like Wei Mohai, who had many years of training in the army?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er answered slowly, “Commander Wei’s skills were great, and this servant could only use my wits to win.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Your wits cost Wei Mohai his life. People with great skills are usually conceited. The cause of his death wasn’t you, but his own self-confidence.” Pei Qianhao replied and grabbed Su Xi-er's hands, tucking them back under the blanket.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, there was a knock on the door and Guan Xiang’s voice sounded. “Prince Hao, the Red Date Soup is ready.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Bring it in.” Pei Qianhao ordered as he helped Su Xi-er up, leaning her against the bedpost.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Guan Xiang came in and handed the bowl of Red Date Soup in his hands to Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You have been busy today, and should hurry to rest. As for the Literary Association, this Prince will protect it.” Pei Qianhao’s words were like a confidence pill for Guan Xiang.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Prince Yun has control of the military, while the Literary Association is made up of scholars. Other than a war of words, we can’t possibly match up to him. With Prince Hao’s words, however, I can rest assured.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Many thanks to Prince Hao,” said Guan Xiang before he exited the room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao scooped up a spoonful of the Rate Date Soup and gently blew on it before bringing it to Su Xi-er’s lips. “Drink slowly, it’s hot.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er initially wanted to take the bowl in her own hands and drink, but hearing Pei Qianhao’s words had her thinking twice. She involuntarily put her hands down and obediently opened her mouth to take a sip of the soup.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, her tiny movements didn’t escape Pei Qianhao’s eyes. <em>I didn’t say anything, but she now knows to observe my mood before she acts.&nbsp;</em>This improvement made him happy.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er drank about half of the bowl’s content in this manner before refusing to drink anymore. “Have you been sitting here without eating anything?” Her brows were knitted as she asked softly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Stop asking so many questions and just keep drinking.” Pei Qianhao continued to bring a spoonful of soup to her lips after blowing on it.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, you surely haven’t eaten anything. Go out and eat a little first. Otherwise, this servant shall not eat.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Are you threatening this Prince? I am in good health, and one less meal won’t cause any problems.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant has been unconscious for much longer than the timeframe for a single meal. Go and eat.” Su Xi-er was firm, refusing to back down.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Alright, drink the Red Date Soup, then this Prince will go and eat. How does that sound?” Pei Qianhao ceded some territory, offering a compromise.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er shot a glance at him before eventually opening her mouth to drink the soup.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Once she was finished, Pei Qianhao pinched her nose slightly. “Rest well. This Prince shall go have some food.” He then helped to lay her down on the bed before snugly covering her with the blanket.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao only exited the room and headed to the kitchen after settling everything and seeing Su Xi-er close her eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, he then found himself in a predicament: the cooks were all asleep by now. Who would cook for Pei Qianhao?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao entered the kitchen and saw that there was still leftover Red Date Soup in a pot. He scooped out a bowl for himself, drinking it quickly before returning to Su Xi-er’s room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er straightened herself up and sniffed his body. After smelling the scent of Red Date Soup, she was certain that he had eaten.&nbsp;</p>
