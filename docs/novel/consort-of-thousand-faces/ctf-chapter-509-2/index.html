 <p>Hence, Su Xi-er reached out an arm to pull Niu Niu over and smiled at her. “You really look like a fool. Niu Niu, do you remember how old you are?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Niu Niu’s body trembled, but she kept her head lowered, preventing others from seeing her expression. Su Xi-er slipped a hand under her chin, looking into Niu Niu’s eyes and finding them filled with cowardice.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Getting anxious, the old uncle knelt again. “Princess Consort, I beg of you, please let this peasant’s granddaughter off. She has been foolish since she was young. After her parents passed away, this peasant has raised her alone.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s finger brushed Niu Niu’s chin, her eyes filled with a probing look. “Is that so? Did you know that the granddaughter you single handedly raised looks a lot like someone I know from the past.” She paused and turned to look at Ruo Yuan. “Take the old uncle to the Bookkeeping Office to collect more silvers, and get a guard to personally send him back to his hometown. I find this granddaughter of his likeable, so I’ll have her stay in the residence and accompany me for a few days.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant obeys the order.” Ruo Yuan immediately walked towards the old uncle and gestured for him to follow.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The old uncle’s body shuddered, afraid that Su Xi-er would do something to Niu Niu. <em>But I have no way to save her. I could only try to beg for mercy, but that didn’t work at all.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Finally, he sighed. <em>I didn’t raise Niu Niu; I found her. My son died a few years ago, and my daughter-in-law also followed without leaving behind any children. When I saw this foolish girl, I decided to take her back home and raise her. However, I clearly can’t say this out loud.</em></p>
 <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p><em>Judging from the Princess Consort’s expression, the person from her past might have had some conflict with her. If I say the truth, it would be tantamount to harming Niu Niu.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing that the old uncle was leaving, Niu Niu shivered in fear and looked at Su Xi-er with trepidation.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You’re scared of me?” Su Xi-er chuckled and released her chin.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Niu Niu immediately lowered her head, not letting anyone discern her expression. The only reaction she gave was her trembling body.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You really look like someone&nbsp;ー&nbsp;Pei Yaran.” Su Xi-er slowly stated. However, there was no response from Niu Niu.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hong Li, prepare a private room for her in the backyard. We have to properly entertain her for these few days.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant obeys the order.” Hong Li tugged at Niu Niu a few times before forcefully dragging her away.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Watching Niu Niu’s departing figure, Su Xi-er wondered if she was really foolish. <em>This person must be Pei Yaran; there can’t be this many coincidences in the world.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After mulling it over for a while, she turned around to return to the main courtyard. Before she could take another step though, she bumped into a large and cosy embrace, a familiar scent filling her nostrils.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xi-er, since when did you start walking in such a hasty manner?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“A-Jing, Pei Yaran is back. I don’t know if she’s really foolish or just pretending to be.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao caressed her, his eyes looking towards the direction Niu Niu had left in. “We’ll know after we test her.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er moved her body and raised her head to look at him. “She entered the palace when she was 15, then became the Empress before exerting control over the entire imperial harem at the age of 18. We can’t underestimate a woman like that.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Looking at her sparkling eyes, Pei Qianhao knew that she already had a plan in mind. “Xi-er, we’ll do as you like.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Really? Why don’t you ask me how I plan to execute the ruse? She’s your younger sister, after all.” Su Xi-er mischievously smiled.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xi-er, you’re jealous again?” Pei Qianhao teasingly smiled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>She didn’t get jealous when Zhen Yu pounced into my arms, but she got jealous right after Pei Yaran appeared.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What do you mean by ‘again’? I’m not like you&nbsp;ー&nbsp;a vinegar jar. Let me tell you, I plan to use a handsome man trap<span id="footnote-ref-9166"><a href="#footnote-9166">[1]</a></span>.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hearing the words ‘handsome man trap’, Pei Qianhao’s gaze deepened, and he flicked her forehead. “I don’t know what’s stuffed in this brain of yours.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er pouted. “Did you even need to ask? Of course it’s stuffed with handsome men.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao lowered his head and whispered into her ear. “This Prince wants to ask you: who is the handsome man you have in mind?”</p>
