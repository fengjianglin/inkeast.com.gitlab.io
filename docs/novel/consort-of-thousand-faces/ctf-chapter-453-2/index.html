 <p>Su Xi-er immediately changed the topic. “I haven’t been to the western region yet. Second Imperial Prince, why don’t you share what the scenery is like?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Accepting her gesture, Situ Rong followed up. “Those who have never been to the western region think that it mainly consists of deserts and steep precipices, but the reality is far from that. The newly ascended king is very resourceful; there are now lush trees growing, and the civilians’ houses have been revamped, and the newly constructed palace hall is especially spectacular! It sits on top of a high mountain, surrounded by blue skies and white clouds, making it stand out even more.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“That’s pretty good.” Su Xi-er complimented, and began picking at the dishes. “Prince Hao, eat this.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Consort Dowager Guo saw that she had picked the&nbsp;<a href="https://i2.chuimg.com/32d8fc5246a14af083922d227d9016c1_891w_713h.jpg?imageView2/2/w/660/interlace/1/q/90" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Braised Pork with Chestnut</a>. <em>This dish helps to nourish the kidney and strengthen the waist.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Situ Rong burst out in laughter, remarking with a meaningful tone. “Prince Hao, it seems like the Princess Consort is dissatisfied with your performance in a certain aspect.” However, he immediately received a kick from his Imperial Mother, signalling for him not to spout nonsense.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao coldly counterattacked. “Second Imperial Prince, I suppose that this ‘woman from the western region’ was something you fabricated. The Minister of the Court of Judicial Review has three daughters, and they are all decent. Consort Dowager, why don’t you arrange a wedding for him as soon as possible?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Consort Dowager intended to do just that. The main eldest daughter is gentle and polite, the second daughter is beautiful, and the third daughter is witty and charming. It’s just that I’m not sure which type you like, Rong-er.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er interjected. “The Second Imperial Prince seems to think fondly of the western region. In my opinion, he likes the unrestrained and boorish type. Only women with such a character can control him.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What the Princess Consort said is right. I like the boorish types, in particular, I like those unruly ones from the mountains and fields. If there was a princess in the western region, I would definitely pursue her.” Situ Rong suddenly paused, realising that he had exposed his own lie.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>By the time he recovered his senses, he saw a smile flicker past Su Xi-er’s eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>How impressive this Princess Consort Hao is! To think that she deliberately went along with what I said to make me drop my guard, only to watch me fall into her trap!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Consort Dowager Guo shook her head. “This Consort Dowager believes in Prince Hao’s judgement of character; if he says you’re lying, that is undoubtedly the case. This Consort Dowager will go to the residence of the Minister of the Court of Judicial review and select a young lady for you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just like that, Situ Rong’s matter was settled, and he regretted it very much.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Prince Hao is a crafty fox, and it’s clear that the wife he’s married is much the same. This pair is enough to play anyone to death with their pranks!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Come, let’s quickly start eating. Try this Consort Dowager’s food.” Consort Dowager Guo’s face was full of smiles as she continuously entertained Pei Qianhao and Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>During this period of time, Su Xi-er would frequently find a pair of begrudging eyes staring at her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I never expected that despite Situ Rong being 30 years old, he would actually be so similar to Situ Lin. These two are like two babies, just that one is larger than the other.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After they were finished with the meal, Su Xi-er accompanied Consort Dowager Guo to walk around the Imperial Garden; meanwhile, Pei Qianhao remained in the palace to speak with Situ Rong.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>While walking on the palace path, Consort Dowager Guo mentioned that Grand Tutor Kong was down with a severe cold, reminding Su Xi-er that she hadn’t seen him in a while.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>He’s my godfather after all.&nbsp;</em>Thus, she told Consort Dowager Guo, “Consort Dowager, I’ll go to the Imperial Library to visit Godfather.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Consort Dowager Guo nodded. “You should indeed. Go on, I’ll return to the Consort Dowager Palace.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Upon going their separate ways, Su Xi-er found Tan Ge sweeping the ground after entering the Imperial Library.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Tan Ge turned around when she heard footsteps from behind, freezing in place. <em>I didn’t expect it to be Su Xi-er!</em> With the broom in her hand, she pondered for a moment before she bowed. “This servant pays her respects to Princess Consort Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Tan Ge, you don’t have to stand on ceremony. Quickly rise.” Su Xi-er bent down to help her up.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You and I are of different statuses; I can’t dispense with the necessary formalities.” Tan Ge’s gaze became distant.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’ll go and check on Grand Tutor Kong.” Su Xi-er didn’t plan on talking to her any further, and prepared to walk away.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Tan Ge immediately moved forward to grab her. “Can you help me?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er turned back around to ask, “What’s wrong?”</p>
