 <p>Despite always liking to don white robes, Situ Li wore robes of a slightly warmer tone today. His gaze was calm as he silently watched the events at the banquet. <em>All the preparations have been made, and I have already informed Yun Ruofeng of when to sneak into the Prince Hao Residence.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the nuptial chamber, Su Xi-er ate fruits and pastries while listening to Ruo Yuan and Hong Li’s conversation, reminding herself to be patient as she waited for night to fall. Even when it was 8.30 pm, the cacophonous noise from the banquet had yet to cease.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A moment later, someone knocked on the door, and Wu Ling’s voice followed. “Ruo Yuan, come out and get the sweet red date soup. Princess Consort Hao has to drink a small bowl before the nuptial night to represent happiness.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>One bowl in the morning and one bowl at night would symbolise the hope for sweet and blissful days for the rest of one’s life.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ruo Yuan’s heart skipped a beat when she heard his voice, standing up and quickly opening the door to take the bowl of soup, only to close it just as fast. Wu Ling was stunned. <em>What’s going on for her to be so rushed? I only came to deliver a bowl of soup.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hong Li went to take the bowl from Ruo Yuan and tested its temperature before passing it to Su Xi-er. “You have to drink this, so that things will always be sweet.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Mmm.” Su Xi-er took the bowl and drank it spoon by spoon.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The bowl was very small, allowing Su Xi-er to finish it in six spoonfuls. Ruo Yuan took the empty bowl from her and placed it on the table.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao will be coming to take the red bridal veil off in just a bit!” Hong Li’s face was bright with joy as she exclaimed. She then walked to the window to look at the festive red lanterns in the main courtyard.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a faint fragrance wafted in, prompting Ruo Yuan to sniff the air. “What’s this? I smell a faint fragrance.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just as the words had left her mouth, she felt her body losing strength. Hong Li turned around to look at her, but fell to the ground unconscious before she could say anything. Furiously shaking her head, Ruo Yuan managed to squeeze out a few words before dropping to the ground. “Princess Consort Hao, there’s something wrong with this fragrance!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In fact, Su Xi-er had already started to hold her breath when she detected the fragrance. She didn’t reply to Ruo Yuan in fear of breathing it in. <em>This fragrance will cause people to lose their strength, but it won’t endanger their lives. What audacity to dare to cause trouble during my wedding!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er lifted her bridal veil, revealing her deep and cold gaze. With just a few steps, she had already sprinted out of the nuptial chamber.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The night breeze blew against her crimson wedding dress, making it look like a blooming peony, and adding a trace of charm to her exceptional beauty and noble aura.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, a person emerged from the woods just as she walked out of the room; it was Yun Ruofeng. He looked at the woman standing in front of him and couldn’t help but utter, “You’re still as beautiful as ever.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er narrowed her eyes. “Prince Yun, what high spirits you must be in to come all the way to Beimin instead of properly resting in the Prince Yun Residence.” <em>He stealthily came here without exposing himself to a single soul, even tricking Lianchen into thinking that he’s still in the Prince Yun Residence.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Although Lianchen has become more resourceful and astute, he still loses to Yun Ruofeng in terms of being scheming.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Lan-er, I am here to take you away while Prince Hao is surrounded by officials and unable to come. Regardless of what you think, I can’t standby and watch helplessly as you leave me.” Yun Ruofeng softly said as he slowly walked towards her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er could only feel a sense of cruel irony when she heard the name ‘Lan-er’. She swiftly raised her hand, planning to pull out the golden hairpin from her hair and throw it at Yun Ruofeng. <em>That night, he bestowed me an arrow. Tonight, I shall return the favour with a hairpin to the throat.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, before she could even grab the hairpin, she found herself lacking strength.</p>
