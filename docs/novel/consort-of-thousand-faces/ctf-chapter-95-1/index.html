 <p>“Is the lotus root salad or &nbsp;steamed cornbread more delicious?” A man’s deep and low voice sounded. A moment later, Pei Qianhao was already sitting across Su Xi-er, his eyes containing a mischievous look.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er picked up the steamed cornbread. “Prince Hao, I didn’t expect you to know what this is. Impoverished families are too familiar with steamed cornbread, but some aren’t even as fortunate as that.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This prince naturally knows about steamed cornbread. Did you think that this prince only sits idly in the imperial palace and enjoy the fruits of others? When this prince assumed command, you were still scrubbing chamber pots.” Pei Qianhao rebutted as he picked up the placed some salted vegetables in the steamed bread before eating</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Although it was a crude food, the noble aura covering his body caused the steamed cornbread to also have a noble aura.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er knew about the matter of him assuming command. Back then, she wasn’t scrubbing the chamber pots, but discussing the war ahead with Yun Ruofeng in the army camp.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The first time Beimin’s Prince Hao assumed command, he led 1000 elite troops to fend off 20,000 enemy troops by relying on his outstanding stratagems.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The news of 1000 elite troops wiping out 20,000 enemy troops had caused a sensation for a period of time. Prince Hao’s name had spread like wildfire even in other nations, causing her to hold admiration for him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I didn’t expect that I would be here eating steamed cornbread with him.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“That military campaign created a massive stir. Even in the Palace Side Quarters, all of the palace maids were talking about it.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao had already finished eating a piece of the cornbread. Gently wiping his mouth with a handkerchief on the table, he asked, &nbsp;“Did you also join the discussion?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Those palace maids marginalised this servant, so I only listened to their discussion.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Since that’s the case, this prince will give you a chance to talk about it with me. Discussing with me is much better than with any palace maid.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er didn’t know how to respond. <em>Can I not discuss? I don’t need this chance.&nbsp;</em>But when she saw his persistent stare, she could only go along with it. “Gallant and unrivalled. No one can compare to you. Only with you can Beimin thrive and become prosperous.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao knocked the table lightly. “Listening to others currying favour with me is quite satisfying.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er looked at him in bewilderment. <em>It is best if he...takes some medicine. His words don’t sound like what the grand Prince Hao</em> <em>would say.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“There’s a general in Nanzhao… Well, he should be called Prince Regent Yun now. His military strategies are not bad, and has skills in leading troops and managing his generals.” Pei Qianhao remarked indifferently.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s expression didn’t change. <em>Why did he suddenly mention Yun Ruofeng?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“However, although he may have some skill in leading troops, his ability to manoeuvre in the court is too inferior when compared to a certain person.” Unadulterated admiration emerged in Prince Hao’s eyes as he spoke. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er could discern the admiration in his eyes and understood it. ‘<em>That person’ is referring to...Ning Rulan.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“If she had been a man, this prince would have admired even more. It’s a pity that she was a woman.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er asked him back calmly, “So what if she was a woman?” She would never forget that scene where all the subjects submitted a petition. Just because she was a woman who had gotten involved in court politics, she was evicted and banished from the imperial household.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Women can just stay in their boudoirs. An overly strong and opinionated woman would be considered an unruly vicious wife among the people, beaten and berated by everyone. In the imperial household, she would be considered an avaricious and powerful woman, and there would only be one outcome&nbsp;ー&nbsp;death.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er really wanted to look up to the sky and laugh heartily. <em>I was avaricious and powerful, monopolising the affairs of the court. Not only was it the people of Nanzhao, even the other three nations view my death as something deserved! My death was not regrettable at all!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Judging by your expression, you would very much like to cry out against the injustice towards Ning Rulan?” Pei Qianhao suddenly asked as he looked at her face, not understanding her expression.</p>
