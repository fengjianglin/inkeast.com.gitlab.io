 <p>Su Xi-er immediately understood. <em>In other words, it's hard for this body to become pregnant. No wonder there still hasn't been any signs despite A-Jing and I doing it many times.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Get out!" Pei Qianhao was extremely displeased, and his eyes were as dark as a bottomless pit.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He had tried to suppress his temper, otherwise, he would have definitely ordered someone to haul the physician out by his collar with his usual disposition.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When he turned around, he noticed Su Xi-er's calm visage, and he couldn't help but bend down and grasp her hand. "Xi-er, don't listen to the old physician. As I thought, we can't believe the rumours from the common folk. This person is a quack.'</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er stared at him and raised her hand to slowly caress his face, slowly moving her hand from his eyebrows to his eyes, then down to his nose.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>He must like children a lot to want one so much. Considering his parents passed away early, leaving him to be raised as a pawn in the Pei Residence, I wonder how great his desire for a child is.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Emperor Father’s consorts who had cold constitutions tried a multitude of methods, enduring numerous hardships. Yet, I remember how every one of those attempts ended in tragic failure.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Now that the same thing is happening to me…</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A sour feeling crept into Su Xi-er's heart. <em>If I can't give birth…</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Xi-er, let's take it slow. We don't have to rush."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er didn't reply, only raising her hand to stroke his face for a long time before speaking. "A-Jing, you can't have no descendants. If I can't do it, you can…"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao cut her off. "Xi-er, this Prince has promised that you'll be the only one for me in this lifetime. Did you think that I was joking?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er parted her lips. "I…"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Drink some soup to nourish your body. If it works, then we'll have a child. If it doesn't, it'll just be the two of us. That's rather good; that way, no one will snatch you away from me, and I don't have to hold it in for three months. I'll be able to do whatever I want." A glint flashed past Pei Qianhao's eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er laughed out loud, the bell-like sound filling the main hall.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Xi-er, your laughter sounds very beautiful." Pei Qianhao gently pinched her face.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Don't praise me, I'll become proud."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"It's a fact that you're good-looking." Pei Qianhao embraced her and carried her to the main courtyard.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her arms hooked around his neck, Su Xi-er gazing at him with a tender and loving look. However, this appearance of hers only made it harder for Pei Qianhao to ensure, and he quickened his pace.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Placing her on the soft quilt, Pei Qianhao lowered his head and rubbed his face against hers. "Xi-er, Xi-er…" He kept calling her name.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Even if she doesn't say it, I know she's feeling sad inside.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Regardless of how strong a woman is, she will still always long to be a mother. Even my promise of a lifetime can’t dampen her sadness. But, what I can do is give her even more love.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er softly replied. "I'm here." She took the initiative to take off his belt, and her hands smoothly snaked to his chest, running across it as they gradually moved downwards. At the same time, she pressed herself tightly against him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>She's so fiery and passionate today.&nbsp;</em>Pei Qianhao's eyes darkened, and his Adam's apple bobbed up and down. Unable to hold out any longer, he lowered his head and kissed her, tightly tangling with her without the slightest intention of letting go.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er's hand wandered back and forth on his back. Soon, his black gown fell, revealing his perfect sculpted muscles and toned body.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A slight moan escaped Su Xi-er's lips as she was completely taken by him. Tightly intertwined with him, she softly murmured, "A-Jing."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"I'm here." Pei Qianhao gently kissed her ear.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She raised her head with her eyes filled with yearning. <em>I want a child, even if it's just one. I want to be the person who gives birth to A-Jing's child. That child would be the amalgamation of A-Jing and I, and symbolise the passing down of our happiness.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her hands tightly clutched the quilt. <em>No matter how tough it will be, I still want to attempt all sorts of methods.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A large hand smoothened out her creased brow as Pei Qianhao deeply gazed at her. "Xi-er, you're so kind; we'll definitely have our own child."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su X-er hugged him even more tightly. "A-Jing, give yourself to me; I want you."</p>
