 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>After Feng Changqing heard that, his heart skipped a beat, and a surge of warmth surrounded his whole body. <em>I haven’t heard the Eldest Imperial Princess say that for a long time. She always said it before, but I now see what she truly meant.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Feng Changqing, you are Feng Changqing no matter what. Just like the meaning of your name, you will always be tall like the tree, and forever green.” Su Xi-er smiled as she replied. Under her slightly curved brows were a pair of bright, quick-witted eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Feng Changqing’s voice had a trace of added joy. “Eldest Imperial Princess, you are right. This subordinate will forever be Feng Changqing.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I will go to the Literary Association now,” Su Xi-er said slowly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Feng Changqing was confused and immediately asked, “Eldest Imperial Princess, you are Prince Hao’s maidservant right now. Does Prince Hao allow you to come out by yourself for so long?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“He gave me two days to deal with everything. I will use this time to throw Yun Ruofeng off guard. In the meantime, I will give you one day to investigate the grudges that the Wei Miss’ had. When you’re done, come find me at the Fortune Apricot House.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Feng Changqing was the new owner of the Fortune Apricot House, allowing it to be a gathering place for Su Xi-er’s previous subordinates. As for the rest, they had been sent off to various places.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This subordinates understands. I will go and investigate immediately.” After Feng Changqing finished talking, he bowed to pay his respect before disappearing from sight.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er stared at the empty alley. <em>Feng Changqing’s skills have improved a lot. He never stopped training, even after my death.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>With personalities like theirs, the two Wei Miss’ definitely offended a good number of people. If we can find out who they are, we will be able to send Ning Anlian to the Imperial Mausoleum by depending on the deal we made. Best of all, Yun Ruofeng won’t be able to go back on his word since he agreed to the deal in front of Pei Qianhao.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er held the letter in her sleeve tightly and walked out of the alley. <em>If I want Yun Ruofeng’s position to be affected by tomorrow, I need to get to the Literary Association soon.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Meanwhile, at the Water Caltrop River.&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng had brought Ning Anlian onto the boat that he was resting on. He pressed his hands on her shoulders to signal for her to listen to him. “Anlian, you had really acted wilfully by coming to the Dragon Boat Night Banquet tonight.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian chuckled and raised her head to look at him. “Acting willfully? Prince Yun, is it considered willful that as the Eldest Imperial Princess of Nanzhao, I joined the banquet? This is a rule that has been set by Nanzhao’s traditions since the beginning.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You call yourself the Eldest Imperial Princess of the country, but did your behaviour yesterday and tonight demonstrate the disposition of an Eldest Imperial Princess? Ning Anlian, this Prince is warning you, if you act wilfully again…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He was interrupted by Ning Anlian before he could finish. She used all her strength to struggle herself free from him, despite the pain in her wrist. “Yun Ruofeng, if I act wilfully again, will you coldly shoot me with a heart penetrating arrow so that I can’t rest in peace, just like Ning Rulan?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Yun Ruofeng heard the words ‘can’t rest in peace’, a subtle glint flickered across his eyes, and the gentle aura around him diminished. <em>Ning Rulan can’t rest in peace. She blames and resents me, becoming a vengeful ghost who haunts my dreams.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Ning Anlian saw Yun Ruofeng like that, her heart sank. <em>I didn’t think that I would lose like this after all the meticulous steps I took! I thought that I had beat Ning Rulan, but it’s clear that I’ve completely lost!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She laughed desolately and raised her hand to point at Yun Ruofeng. “Yun Ruofeng, you didn’t love Ning Rulan, and you don’t love me either. From start to the end, you have only loved yourself! Your heart is icy cold, and the only person you can stand not being under your control is yourself!”</p>
