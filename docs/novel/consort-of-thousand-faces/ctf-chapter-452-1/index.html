 <p>Su Xi-er had just linked arms with Pei Qianhao, and the pair had been about to walk into the Prince Hao Residence when an Imperial Army guard sped over on horseback.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He stopped before the entrance and dismounted. “Prince Hao, the Second Imperial Prince has returned to the palace. Consort Dowager Guo is setting up a banquet, and has specifically invited you and the Princess Consort.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao turned towards Su Xi-er. “Do you want to go?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Of course, Consort Dowager Guo is sincerely inviting us.” Su Xi-er answered and pulled him forward.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao signalled to a guard at the side with his eyes, and the latter immediately went to the backyard of the Prince Hao Residence. It wasn’t long before a horse carriage was brought before them.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Come here.” Pei Qianhao grasped her hand and walked to the side of the carriage. Supporting her waist, he gave a little push to help her get onto the carriage.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Swiftly return to the palace and report to Consort Dowager Guo that this Prince will be there soon.” Pei Qianhao ordered the Imperial Army guard and leapt onto the carriage.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Imperial Army guard mounted his horse and cracked the horsewhip, rushing on ahead to deliver the message.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Inside the spacious carriage, Pei Qianhao was afraid that the ride would be too bumpy for Su Xi-er, and had set her on his lap, letting her use his chest as a pillow.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Thus, Su Xi-er didn’t hesitate to take advantage, even adjusting her position from time to time to get more comfortable.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It’s so hard to wait upon the Princess Consort.” Pei Qianhao couldn’t help but whisper in her ear and tease her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You still have to wait upon me, no matter how hard it is. This life of yours has fallen into the palm of my hand.” A glint flashed past Su Xi-er’s eyes as she purposely raised her hand to make it look like a wolf’s paw.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao laughed. “Princess Consort, you’re so heartless. This Prince is scared.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Wait upon me properly if you’re scared then.” Su Xi-er slyly smiled, snuggling her head against his chest before closing her eyes with her hands tightly wound around him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao shifted his posture so that Su Xi-er could rest more comfortably, gently patting her back until she gradually fell asleep.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the horse carriage arrived at the side gate of the imperial palace, the guard stopped the carriage and leapt down before calling out, “Prince Hao, we have arrived at the imperial palace.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, the only reply he received was silence. Although the guard was confused, he didn’t dare to make another sound.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even after waiting for several minutes though, the guard still didn’t hear any movement from within the horse carriage, leaving him no choice but to muster up his courage and try again.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Right before he could do so, he heard some noises from within the carriage that were quickly followed by a woman’s voice. “Why didn’t you wake me up when the carriage stopped? I can’t believe that I actually fell asleep.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Although the guard was already well aware of how much Pei Qianhao doted Su Xi-er, he still couldn’t help but be stunned. <em>The extent of Prince Hao’s affection increases by the day! At this rate, even if the Princess Consort asked for the moon, Prince Hao would exhaust all his means to accomplish it!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A short while later, he saw Pei Qianhao carrying Su Xi-er as they alighted the carriage. Once they were on the ground, Pei Qianhao helped her tidy her hair and straighten her collar.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I never knew that Prince Hao was actually such an attentive person. He is so meticulous when it comes to caring for the Princess Consort.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Park the carriage in the horse stable in the palace.” Pei Qianhao instructed before bringing Su Xi-er into the imperial palace.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Watching their departing figures, the guard sighed. <em>There’s actually such a compatible couple in this world.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the Consort Dowager Palace, Consort Dowager Guo was all smiles after having personally cooked a table full of dishes. More importantly, her son who had been gone for years was sitting beside her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Rong-er, your Imperial Mother hasn’t cooked for many years.”</p>
