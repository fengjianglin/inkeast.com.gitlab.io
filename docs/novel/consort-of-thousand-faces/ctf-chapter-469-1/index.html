<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>There was a bit of a lingering awkwardness when Pei Qianhao returned, but it soon relaxed after everyone began to eat and joke around with one another. A few hours later, the imperial physician and the guard from the Prince Hao Residence came back with their hands full of nourishing ingredients.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He Xiuxiu was filled with gratitude as she took the bundle of food, handing them off to Su Zhuang to store in the kitchen. It was late in the afternoon the next day when Pei Qianhao and Su Xi-er decided to leave.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The family watched the horse carriage disappear into the distance before they returned to their house.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He Xiuxiu immediately grabbed Su Zhuang's hand. "What did Prince Hao talk to you about last night?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Zhuang instinctively felt that he shouldn't reveal certain details, so he decided to gloss over it. "He asked about Xi-er's childhood. After marrying her, he naturally wants to understand his wife better."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Asking about her childhood…" He Xiuxiu's face paled as she kept mumbling.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing that she was frightened, Su Zhuang patted her shoulder. "People say that Prince Hao is cold, but after interacting with him yesterday, that doesn't seem to be the case. You don't have to be scared; he was also just concerned about Xi-er."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With her husband pacifying her, He Xiuxiu managed to calm herself down, and was finally able to forget her fear when she heard her son calling for her. She hastily rushed into the inner chamber to check on him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Inside the carriage, Su Xi-er was lying in Pei Qianhao's arms. "Why did you ask about my birth? Is there something wrong?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao caressed her hair. "Xi-er, do you remember me asking you about the flower on the cloth pouch the other day?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She was immediately reminded of the pouch she found in the cloth bundle from the Imperial Household Department. <em>That flower was very strange, and I’d never seen it before. I had originally planned to look it up in the Imperial Library, but the wedding took up all of my time and I forgot about it.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Do you know what flower that is?" Su Xi-er raised her head to ask.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"A Purple Mandarin Duck flower from the western region." Pei Qianhao replied as he gently held her against his chest.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He continued before she could say anything. "Perhaps the blood flowing in you is from the western region's court, and it's a noble bloodline at that."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er sensed that something was amiss when he mentioned the name of the flowers. <em>But I am not the original Su Xi-er, and the western region's court is not my home.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Xi-er, do you wish to go to the western region?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er pondered for a moment. "No, I won’t. Wouldn’t I just end up feeling guilty if I do? You clearly know who I actually am."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"It's precisely because I know who you are that I am asking you. But if that’s how you feel, we’ll let this matter be." Pei Qianhao said as he cupped her face.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Carefully observing the contours of his face, Su Xi-er’s gaze flickered before she imitated his action with her own hands.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"A-Jing, if people from the western region don't come looking for me, I won't take the initiative to go and look for them. I will help the real Su Xi-er take care of the Su Family, but I won't do anything else. I only have eyes for my husband and my younger brother, the two most important men in my life."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao pinched her face as he purposely teased her. "Between Ning Lianchen and I, who's more important?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er harrumphed. "Both of you are important; there's no room for comparison."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Xi-er, who's going to be at the top and who's going to be at the bottom tonight?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Assailed by the sudden out of place question, Su Xi-er only understood what he meant when he rubbed his leg against her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"It's broad daylight right now; you're not allowed to talk about it." Su Xi-er cast a sidelong glance at him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao softly chuckled. "I won't listen to you for tonight; I'll be on top." Su Xi-er happened to catch the smug look that flashed past his eyes.</p>
