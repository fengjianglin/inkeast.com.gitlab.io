 <p>The horse carriage continued heading for the suburbs, and Pei Qianhao did nothing besides quietly watch Su Xi-er with a gaze that made her shift to the corner in apprehension.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A slight breeze lifted the window curtain of the carriage, and Su Xi-er knew that they had arrived in the suburbs when she saw the expanse of trees outside.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Soon, the guard stopped the carriage beside the woods and reported, “Prince Hao, we have arrived at the suburbs.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao lifted the window curtain and ordered, “Princess Consort Hao wants to eat a&nbsp;<a href="https://s1.ig.meishij.net/p/20130710/06ecf8dcf0f570cdeb93061375fe6ce2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corn-flavoured steamed bun</a> from a farmer’s family. Go to a nearby village and buy some.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Despite his bewilderment, the guard deferentially bowed. “This subordinate obeys the order.” He then turned to walk towards the woods where a small village lied beyond.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After sending the guard away, Pei Qianhao looked towards Su Xi-er with a natural expression and raised his hand. “Xi-er, come here.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er remained in the corner and flatly refused. “I don’t want to go over. I’m already regretting making a promise with you. &nbsp;I won’t have any strength for the palace banquet tonight if you torment me now.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince definitely won’t torment you; I’ll just kiss you.” Knowing that she wasn’t gullible, Pei Qianhao reached out his hand to pick her up and set her on his lap.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Take it easy; tonight will be a major event.” Su Xi-er couldn’t help but remind him when she saw him trying to remove her dress.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince will pay attention.” Right afterwards, a rain of kisses ran down her neck while he avoided her face so as not to mess up her makeup.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At the same time, his hands mischievously wandered under her half-open clothes with a sense of familiarity. Su Xi-er felt her body warming up, and her half-lidded eyes gave off an alluring aura.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao was a rather clever man; he had quickly figured out which parts of her body were more sensitive.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It didn’t take much time before Su Xi-er’s hands hooked around Pei Qianhao’s neck, and the latter supported her waist as he moved up and down. The moving lustre on her face caused his heart to palpitate as they gazed into each others’ eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Of course, the carriage itself was jostling due to the movement inside. The only thing that prevented someone from peeking into the slightly open curtain was a small hand holding onto it from the inside.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fortunately, the early time of day and isolated location made it unlikely that anybody was around.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When they finally finished, the sound of clothes being put on could be heard. A while later, the coquettish voice of a woman rang out. “Pei Qianhao, I won’t believe you anymore!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A man’s voice followed. “This Prince has already restrained myself. It won’t affect tonight’s palace banquet.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You clearly know there’s a banquet in the palace tonight, yet you still…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You’ll be able to quickly recover your strength after you rest at Consort Dowager Guo’s repose palace later.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the guard came back, he didn’t understand why Su Xi-er was at loggerheads with Pei Qianhao, but he did notice that his master was taking the time to coax his wife. The guard couldn’t help but lament. <em>It’s really not easy for Prince Hao to defer to the Princess Consort on everything.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Detecting the noise outside the carriage, Su Xi-er immediately lifted the curtain. Realising that it was the guard, she immediately spoke in a cold and imposing manner that didn’t lose to Pei Qianhao, “Give the buns to me and bring us to the imperial palace right away.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shocked, the guard hastily passed over the steamed buns wrapped in yellow paper.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before he could hand them to Su Xi-er, Pei Qianhao’s large hand came and took the package as he ordered, “Listen to the Princess Consort and head to the imperial palace immediately.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This confirmed the guard’s suspicion that Pei Qianhao was scared of his wife, and he couldn’t help but inwardly howl in grief before leaping onto the carriage and steering it towards the imperial palace.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao wrapped the yellow paper more securely. “Consort Dowager Guo was born of a merchant background, but she usually likes eating corn-flavoured steamed buns the most. Remember to give these to her when we reach her repose palace later.”</p>
