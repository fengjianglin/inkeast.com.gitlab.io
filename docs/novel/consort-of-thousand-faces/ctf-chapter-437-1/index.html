<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Everyone sucked in a cold breath of air in shock again as their gazes shifted between Chu Linglong and Pei Qianhao. <em>It wasn’t that Prince Hao was hiding behind his woman, but that he simply didn’t deign to take action!</em> The ministers from Beimin inwardly cheered. <em>Crown Prince Chu spoke with no restraint on Beimin’s territory. It’s about time to show him who’s boss! Serves him right for trying to stir up trouble and underestimating Beimin!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hence, everyone’s gazes converged on Su Xi-er once again. <em>We can count on Princess Consort Hao to douse Crown Prince Chu’s arrogant flames!&nbsp;</em>In an instant, the officials from Beimin began to truly appreciate Su Xi-er. <em>Although she was a maidservant, this aura of hers is a perfect match for Prince Hao!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Despite being baffled about how a maidservant could develop such a demeanour in just a few months, everyone agreed that it was due to Prince Hao’s overwhelmingly strong presence and aura. <em>After being together with him every day, it’s inevitable that Princess Consort Hao would end up the same way.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>It isn’t as if she’s simply undeservingly conceited either; this arrogance springs from a well of self-confidence!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It wasn’t long before the guards returned with many pots of wine, and the palace maids filled the large winecups.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er raised her winecup faster than Chu Linglong, and gave a smile. “Crown Prince Chu, I would like to express my gratitude to you for travelling all this way just to celebrate the wedding of Prince Hao and I. I am willing to accept the outcome regardless of what happens, so I hope that you won’t make things difficult for me either, Crown Prince Chu.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She then downed the contents of her large winecup in one go. The large cup was equivalent to three normal ones, and being able to do such a thing was already enough to prove her worth. There were hardly any women in Beimin who possessed such spirit!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>On top of that, she relied on reason to justify her speech. <em>After the Princess Consort has been so magnanimous, Crown Prince Chu would only appear to be a petty and sore loser if he insists on pushing the matter! &nbsp;</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Chu Linglong had no choice but to admit that Su Xi-er was very eloquent, with every one of her words holding a deep undertone. <em>As expected, birds of a feather flock together. The experienced and astute fox, Pei Qianhao, has found another similarly sly female fox.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>With the two of them joining hands, I may very well face certain death if I’m not cautious.&nbsp;</em>Chu Linglong immediately hid his thoughts behind a facade, and dared not be careless.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He immediately took the winecup presented by the palace maid behind him and filled it, respectfully bowing to the crowd before downing its contents.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He had just finished drinking when he heard a crisp clap, and Su Xi-er’s slow and soft voice filled the air again. “You can really hold your liquor well, Crown Prince Chu. Fill it up again!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The palace maid acknowledged her order and immediately poured wine for Chu Linglong.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In order to salvage his reputation, he downed it in a few mouthfuls without saying a word. The palace maid behind Su Xi-er also poured another cup, leaving the Princess Consort to polish it off just as quickly as she had the first.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s current rosy smiling visage mesmerised those present, and the foreign tribe leaders couldn’t help but be visibly moved as feelings of respect surged in their hearts.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao was extremely displeased when he noticed their blatantly obvious reverence all over their faces, and turned to Su Xi-er who was currently exuding a mature charm with her slightly narrowed eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was unclear how many cups Chu Linglong had drunk when he suddenly found himself getting a little dizzy. When he looked at Su Xi-er, however, he saw that her face was perfectly composed. <em>I...can’t possibly have lost, right?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With her acute observation skills, Su Xi-er detected that there was something amiss with Chu Linglong, and set down the winecup with a smile. “Even people who can hold their liquor well will get drunk. There are still dance and opera performances that we must enjoy later, so let’s not drink anymore. However...”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everyone’s curiosity was piqued at the last word. <em>The competition has yet to end, and it feels like neither of them is even drunk yet. There’s no result!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Amidst everyone’s puzzlement, Su Xi-er proposed, “Crown Prince Chu, let us spin around on the spot. Whoever lasts the longest will be the winner.”</p>
