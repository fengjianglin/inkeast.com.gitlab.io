 <p>Yun Ruofeng’s brows couldn’t help but furrow when he saw this, causing the palace maid to hurry Ning Anlian back to the repose palace.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Ning Anlian has gone mad, and now she thinks that I am a bad person.&nbsp;</em>Yun Ruofeng chuckled inexplicably.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>The reincarnated Ning Rulan also thinks that I’m a bad person - no, not just that. She thinks that I’m a lowly and shameless villain that can’t be any more despicable. She has used all of the worst insults on me.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A trace of gloominess flickered across Yun Ruofeng’s eyes. <em>Ning Rulan, you never thought about your own mistakes. It wasn’t me who pushed you away, but the other way around. It was like that in the past, and still holds true now.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Your arrogance and aloofness hasn’t changed. Despite you seeming to like me, I probably was little more than a dog in your eyes right? A dog that was a bit more handsome and gentle, and happened to be acceptable to you.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Ning Rulan, you are now attached to Pei Qianhao and refuse to let go. Did you ever think that in Pei Qianhao’s eyes, you’re probably just a beautiful dog?!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng laughed to himself before walking towards the entrance of the imperial palace. Upon arriving, he ordered an imperial guard to retrieve a horse carriage and commanded, “To the posthouse.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard was confused. <em>Why is Prince Yun going to the posthouse again? It’s getting harder and harder for us subordinates to guess what Prince Yun is thinking.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Without further hesitation, the imperial guard raised his horsewhip and drove the horse carriage quickly towards the posthouse.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Outside the posthouse, imperial guards from the Prince Hao Residence didn’t dare to let down their guards. <em>An assassin entered the posthouse and injured Su Xi-er. Prince Hao is already unhappy enough without us messing up again. Even the guards who were on duty earlier have already voluntarily received their punishments and could only silently endure after being flogged a few dozen times.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Thus, when Prince Yun arrived, the imperial guards didn’t dare to let him in. “Prince Yun, please wait here. This subordinate must report to Prince Hao first.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng nodded. “This Prince will wait here.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>An hour passed, and Yun Ruofeng continued to stand outside the posthouse without budging a single step.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Finally, the imperial guard returned with Pei Qianhao’s order. “Prince Yun, you can enter now. Prince Hao is waiting for you in the &nbsp;main hall.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng nodded and stepped inside.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When he entered the main hall, he found that Pei Qianhao was standing right in the middle of the hall instead of sitting down.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Yun, it is strange how often you come to the posthouse. You didn’t feel well enough to go to the morning court assembly, but you have so much energy to come here.” Pei Qianhao stared at him directly with a cold expression.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He was always icy cold to everyone, let alone someone that he hated.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng said firmly, “Prince Hao, you like to be direct, so this Prince will follow suit. As the Prince Regent of Beimin, you shouldn’t get involved in Nanzhao’s state matters.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“If you hadn’t made the first move and offended this Prince, this Prince wouldn’t have cared about what happened in Nanzhao.” Pei Qianhao’s reply was curt and cold.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Everyone likes beauties, and this Prince just wanted to get closer to Su Xi-er. Prince Hao, is it appropriate for you to get involved in Nanzhao’s state matters just because you are displeased?” Yun Ruofeng’s voice was gentle and slow, but his expression was serious. This matter was related to his military power, so he couldn’t show his usual gentle smile.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Military power represents soldiers, and it also represents battles. I can’t allow anyone to destroy it!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“So it turns out that you like beauties too, Prince Yun. But if that’s the case, this Prince is confused as to why you killed Ning Rulan. She was a beauty known far and wide, her name stretching even beyond the four great nations.” Pei Qianhao’s voice was low, but every word he spoke was clear.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng’s gaze changed slightly. <em>Pei Qianhao doesn’t know that Su Xi-er is Ning Rulan. As two men in similar positions, there’s no way that I can tell him this. When people like us realise that something of ours is taken by someone else, even if it’s as insignificant as an ant, we won’t let it go.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>This is not just about possessing something, it’s a battle between men. It relates to our dignity and position.</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng was sure that he wouldn't let Su Xi-er go. <em>I am certain that she is Ning Rulan reincarnated, thus, she is mine! Her ashes have been scattered to the bottom of the lake in the Prince Yun Residence so that she can never leave me! Everything and every part of her belongs to me! Even if I don’t want her anymore, I won’t allow her to run to the arms of another man!</em></p>
