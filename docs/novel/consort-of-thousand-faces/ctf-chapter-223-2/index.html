 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>

 <p>He then turned towards Yun Ruofeng. "Prince Yun, don't you have some explaining to do?" He had already suspected that the Jinghong Dance wasn't performed by Ning Anlian, but after seeing Su Xi-er's dance, he had come up with a wild hypothesis: Su Xi-er had replaced Ning Anlian at the banquet.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Being interrogated, Yun Ruofeng promptly composed himself and looked at Chu Linglong with a smile. "Crown Prince Chu, for you to say such a thing just based on a hunch, could it be that you plan to govern Dongling with your feelings alone after receiving the throne?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Upon hearing such a response, Chu Linglong could only let out a laugh. Though he did not refute Yun Ruofeng openly, he was certain in his heart that Su Xi-er was the woman who performed the dance at the banquet last night.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>She is just a mere maidservant, but she can actually perform the Jinghong Dance. Not only that, she even presented another splendid dance today. Prince Hao sure knows how to make everyone jealous with such a beauty by his side.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Lianchen's gaze followed Su Xi-er as she returned to the observation deck. His action was caught by Pei Qianhao who snorted silently to himself. <em>This young emperor, where does he think he's looking at! I must do something to teach him a lesson.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hence, when Su Xi-er was about to sit down in the seat next to him, Pei Qianhao reached out to pull her into his embrace right in front of everyone.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In an instant, the eyes of every ruler of the smaller nations widened. <em>Prince Hao sure loves beauties, and especially the one in front of us!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao's broad shoulders and strong arms had Su Xi-er tightly locked in his embrace. Unable to struggle free, Su Xi-er gently reminded him, "Prince Hao, take note of where we are."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"This Prince always does as he wishes, regardless of the venue. What is the name of the dance that you just performed?" His eyes were full of smiles and overflowing adoration; he even went as far as to teasingly tap her on the nose.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He did this expressly so that Ning Lianchen could see that Su Xi-er was his maidservant, and belonged to him!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er looked at him, but her voice was loud and clear. Her words were meant for Ning Lianchen. "Bending Branch Dance."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Every word was clearly enunciated. A shudder went down Ning Lianchen's spine.<em>&nbsp;I don't believe in the occult, nor do I believe in reincarnation, but I really miss Imperial Elder Sister a lot. If Su Xi-er is really Imperial Elder Sister, I… I would rather believe that than accept the fact that Imperial Elder Sister is dead.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I must find the chance to ask Su Xi-er where she learned the Bending Branch Dance. Did she previously have a brother named Ning Lianchen...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao hadn’t expected for Su Xi-er to reply so loudly, and could only knock her on the forehead as he furrowed his brows. "Bending Branch Dance, this Prince will keep it in mind. You're not allowed to perform it in the future." Pei Qianhao then let go of her and allowed her to return to her seat.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, as soon as Su Xi-er sat down, her gaze drifted towards Ning Lianchen. It just so happened that Ning Lianchen was looking in her direction as well.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There was a strange feeling in the air as their eyes met.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Lianchen's gaze became deeper. The voice inside his head was practically screaming at him now. <em>She is Imperial <em>Elder&nbsp;</em>Sister, and she is alive in another body!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chu Linglong felt something amiss, but chose to remain silent and not stir the pot this time around.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao set his winecup on the table with a thud. "This Prince is feeling tired and shall head back to rest. I look forward to the Dragon Boat banquet tonight."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Lianchen stood up immediately. "Prince Hao, it would be disrespecting Nanzhao if you leave so hurriedly. After the performance, the guests of Nanzhao can enjoy themselves by the Water Caltrop River as much as they want. There is a specially built Imperial Household Landscape Garden beside the Water Caltrop River that is heavily guarded, where the guests can enjoy themselves with ease."</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ning Lianchen wanted to see Su Xi-er a little longer, and didn't want her to leave so soon. <em>Prince Hao may not bring her out again tonight.</em></p>

 <p><strong>Cosy:</strong> Omo, are they going to finally acknowledge each other soon?</p>
 <p><strong>Rakumon:&nbsp;</strong>Oh my, I hope Ning Lianchen gets all the hints and they can somehow acknowledge one another &gt;&lt;</p>
 <p>I like how he can feel the his elder sister's vibes from Su Xi-er despite not believing in reincarnation XD</p>
