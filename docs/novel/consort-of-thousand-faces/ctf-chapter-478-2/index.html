<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Tan Ge became even more frantic at that thought. <em>This jade pendant belongs to Su Xi-er, which means that this man before me is definitely related to her in some way.</em></p>
 <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p><em>Now that I have claimed that the jade pendant belongs to me, I can’t change my story unless I no longer want to live. Since I have already taken this step, I must continue the act. This is an opportunity, but a very dangerous one; a single misstep, and my life would be forfeit.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Su Xi-er was no longer in a mood to go to the tavern after the incident with the old auntie, so she brought Hong Li and Ruo Yuan back to the Prince Hao Residence.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao had already come back from the morning court assembly, and was waiting for her in the main hall with Situ Lin.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Situ Lin originally wanted to flash a wide grin when he saw Su Xi-er, but upon noticing Hong Li and Ruo Yuan, he immediately became solemn. “Imperial Aunt, where have you been? This Emperor and Imperial Uncle have waited for a very long time.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I went out for a casual stroll through the streets.” Su Xi-er faintly smiled, then looked towards Hong Li and Ruo Yuan. “Go to the kitchen and bring some fruits.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant obeys the order.” The two of them replied and left the main hall.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After they had disappeared from sight, Situ Lin immediately pulled on Su Xi-er’s sleeve, sweetly saying, “Imperial Aunt, you clearly said that you would come visit the Dragon Heaven Palace before you got married, but it’s been so long since I’ve seen you. Are you going back on your words?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Right after he finished speaking, he could feel a harsh gaze shoot towards him. He immediately released Su Xi-er and retreated to a side, looking at Pei Qianhao as he muttered, “Imperial Uncle, you once promised me that you would still come and stay over in the Dragon Heaven Palace for short periods of time even after you get married.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Looking at his pitiful appearance, Pei QIanhao conceded for the first time ever. “If this Prince observes improvements in your homework and combat skills after this period of time, I will bring your Imperial Aunt into the palace.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Really? I’ve been particularly diligent in my studies recently, so you don’t have to worry about that. As for my combat skills, I don’t know how to leap onto roofs and vault over walls, and I also can’t smash a massive rock into pieces with my chest.” Situ Lin’s eyes were filled with grievances.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er couldn’t help but laugh when she heard the part about smashing a huge rock with his chest. “How old are you? How could we possibly let you smash a massive rock? It’s also impossible for you to leap onto roofs and vault over walls for now. The most your Imperial Uncle would ask of you is to practise your punches. Which mentor from the palace has been invited to teach you?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Situ Lin widely grinned when he thought of his mentor. “Mentor is very mysterious. He wears a veil every day, and his combat skills are excellent! I call him Mentor Changqing.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>So it turns out his mentor is Feng Changqing. Since when did he enter the palace to become His Majesty’s official mentor?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er immediately looked towards Pei Qianhao. “You didn’t let me know about letting Feng Changqing enter the palace.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Using my people without informing me.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao stood up and wrapped his hands around her waist, whispering into her ear, “I didn’t carry this matter out properly. I’ll apologise to you tonight.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Oh, when Imperial Uncle hugs Imperial Aunt, Imperial Aunt doesn’t feel shy.” Situ Li purposely covered his eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er cast a sidelong glance at Pei Qianhao before breaking free of his grasp and turning around to face Situ Lin. “Your Majesty, did you come up with those words by yourself again?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Situ Li immediately became serious and shook his index finger. “I read it from a book. The holy book states ‘see no evil’. What I just said was simply explaining this phrase.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er didn’t know whether she should laugh or cry before she finally teased, “If Grand Tutor Kong learns of your explanation, he would probably be furious enough to give you a beating.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Situ Lin smugly smiled. “He won’t. Grand Tutor Kong has also recently been learning punches from Mentor Changqing, and he has a very good relationship with me; we are all Mentor Changqing’s students.”</p>
