 <p style="margin-left: 20px;"><em>Ji Yunshu was an outstanding anthropologist who was transmigrated into the body of a mistreated young girl. To survive in her new circumstances, she could only rely on her wits and the knowledge she had accumulated in her...</em></p>

 <p>Everyone laughed at what she said. <em>Even if He Xiangyu gets beaten to death, this life of hers has been worth it.</em></p>

 <p>Su Xi-er placed her bowl and chopsticks down and looked at the surrounding palace maids who were giggling. <em>The grass at the top of the wall can sway either way. She had seen many of this type of people who were easily swayed.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Su Xi-er, don’t be so impatient to leave. Don’t tell me that you have an urgent matter?”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em>These palace maids are really worried about me.&nbsp;</em>Su Xi-er sneered inwardly. Yet, when she turned her head around, her face was wreathed in smiles. “I’m going to scrub the chamber pots. Does it count as an urgent matter? Do you want to do it with me?”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Do this kind of thing yourself. Don’t drag us down with you.” The palace maid had a face of contempt. She remembered Mu Tao’s lesson. <em>The chamber pots are so smelly. I don’t want to touch them at all.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er didn’t respond but directly walked out instead. She needed to return and gather her strength.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>She had just taken a few steps when she saw a group of imperial guards arriving. The guard in the lead had a tall figure and an extremely solemn countenance.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em>What exactly did imperial guards with swords come to the Palace Side Quarters for?</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Lord, to what do I owe this pleasure?” When Old Maidservant saw the head imperial bodyguard, her legs were trembling. Everyone recognised the stern-faced imperial bodyguard. <em>This person is Prince Hao’s close and trusted imperial guard!</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Palace maids, assemble.” Wu Ling’s ice-cold tone startled Old Maidservant Zhao. When she was able to react, her hands were trembling.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>It was the first time Su Xi-er saw Old Maidservant Zhao being so flustered. <em>This imperial guard must be some personage’s subordinate.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Yesterday night, an audacious palace maid mounted a sneak attack on Prince Hao…” At this point, Wu Ling stopped and swept his gaze over the palace maids arranged in two lines.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>If a palace maid from the Palace Side Quarters had offended Prince Hao, the whole Palace Side Quarters would be out of luck too. Old Maidservant Zhao wasn’t able to assume such responsibility. <em>Although I want to see something exciting, even I wouldn’t purposefully bring disaster upon myself by getting myself implicated.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em>Thump!&nbsp;</em>Old Maidservant Zhao knelt down and spoke in a quivering voice, “Lord, the palace maids can’t leave the Palace Side Quarters without a command. Could it be that Prince Hao came to the Palace Side Quarters yesterday?”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Prince Hao naturally wouldn’t come to the Palace Side Quarters. He simply drank a little wine yesterday and entered the woods beside the Palace Side Quarters.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Wu Ling’s ice-cold words were like a needle that pierced into Su Xi-er’s ears. <em>Drank wine last night. The woods beside the Palace Side Quarters...The wastrel from last night was actually Prince Hao!</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em>Beauty Palace. 72 concubines. When he sees a beauty, he likes to obtain them. A callous and devilish mien, coupled with an extremely lofty status.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em>All these characteristics match with that man last night.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er clutched her sleeves tightly. <em>He drank quite a lot of wine last night.</em> <em>He probably won’t remember my looks when he wakes up today.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Lord, no palace maid left the Palace Side Quarters yesterday night! Please investigate thoroughly!” Old Maidservant Zhao forced herself to calm down. <em>It mustn’t be a palace maid from the Palace Side Quarters. If she launched a sneak attack on Prince Hao, regardless of whether she was intentionally approaching him or unintentionally attacked him, there’s only death awaiting.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Old Maidservant Zhao, you don’t have to explain. We’ll find out after we investigate thoroughly. Since he was attacked in the woods beside the Palace Side Quarters, the first to be investigated ought to be the Palace Side Quarters.” Then, Wu Ling walked towards the palace maids. His eyes were as sharp as an eagle, causing every palace maid to involuntarily become tensed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Old Maidservant Zhao didn’t dare to speak. <em>Prince Hao is so formidable. How could he have been attacked by a palace maid?&nbsp;</em>Although she was completely bewildered, she wouldn’t dare to voice her questions even if she had ten times the courage.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Hold out both of your wrists,” Wu Ling coldly commanded.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em>Hold out both of our wrists. That means that Prince Hao remembers that he had dislocated my wrist yesterday.&nbsp;</em>Su Xi-er pursed her lips tightly. <em>There are traces of medicinal herbs on my wrist. If this imperial bodyguard finds out...</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>The most excited one right now was Mu Tao. Only she knew someone had left the Palace Side Quarters yesterday. <em>Hmph! Su Xi-er, your time of demise is here!</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er was lined up at the extreme end. Before she showed her wrists, she glanced at the other palace maids. Some of the palace maids also had red marks on their wrists; others even had bluish-purple bruises. They were results of toiling in hard labour.&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em>As long as it’s not someone who has medicinal knowledge, they won’t be able to discern anything just by pinching and looking at my wrists.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Thus, she was at ease as she revealed her wrists.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Wu Ling inched closer and closer until finally, he stood firm in front of her and carefully inspected her wrists.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Why is there a strange odour from your hands?”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Old Maidservant Zhao replied on her behalf, “Lord, this palace maid is in charge of scrubbing the chamber pots. She scrubbed for the whole night yesterday.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Wu Ling’s responding frown frightened Old Maidservant Zhao to the point that she didn’t dare to speak.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“The smell I was talking about wasn’t referring to the smell of the chamber pots. There’s the smell of medicinal herbs coming from your wrist.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er lowered her head and pretended to be flustered as she replied, “Lord, last night... this servant accidentally fell down and my wrist happened to rub against the grass beside the well. Is the smell of medicinal herb you were talking about referring to the smell of regular grass?”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“If it’s the smell of regular grass, would I have asked you? Guards, take her away.” Wu Ling took a step aside. Then, two imperial guards walked towards Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>The corners of Mu Tao’s mouth were slightly raised. <em>Imperial Bodyguard Wu indeed has a good eye. I hadn’t even mentioned Su Xi-er leaving the Palace Side Quarters!</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Lord, this servant had started to sweep the courtyards yesterday afternoon and scrubbed the chamber pots at night. How would I have the time to ambush Prince Hao?” Su Xi-er looked at Wu Ling and fiercely pinched her wrist under her sleeve. In an instant, her eyes were brimming with tears.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>When Wu Ling saw her crying, he was taken aback.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>He had listened to Prince Hao’s instructions to start investigating from the Palace Side Quarters. <em>To have dared to injure Prince Hao, the palace maid responsible definitely has plenty of courage.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em>The palace maid before me has an endless stream of tears. She really can’t fit the bill in terms of courage.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em>However, her wrists are very suspicious. Prince Hao also couldn’t remember the palace maid’s appearance clearly with how drunk he was last night.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>When Mu Tao saw Wu Ling hesitating, she immediately stepped out of the line. “Lord, this servant saw her leave the Palace Side Quarters and come back in a panic last night!” She pointed at Su Xi-er with her right hand.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Old Maidservant Zhao’s heart had risen to her throat. <em>This worrying trouble-maker! She actually left the Palace Side Quarters! What Miss He said is right. I must quickly deal with this palace maid who doesn’t know her place.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em>I was harbouring intentions of enjoying the show and didn’t take care of her but I must sort her out now. Inviting disaster to myself just to watch some fun isn’t worth it.</em></p>
