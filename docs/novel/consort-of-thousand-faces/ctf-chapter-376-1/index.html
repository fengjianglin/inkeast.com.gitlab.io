<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Pei Yaran stared at the imperial guards walking towards her. <em>They will only listen to Pei Qianhao, and will completely disregard me, despite being the Empress Dowager.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Beimin’s Empress Dowager appears to be a dignified position on the surface, but only I know that’s it’s far from the truth. Even Xie Yun looks down on me, much less Pei Qianhao! Even my father only knows how to make use of me!&nbsp;</em>Endless sorrow and self-deprecation surged from the recesses of her heart.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Empress Dowager doesn’t need you all to send me back. I can walk on my own.” Pei Yaran harshly berated before turning to Pei Qianhao., not caring that others were around as she warned him. “If it hadn’t been for the Pei Family, the current Prince Hao would have died on the streets more than 10 years ago. The Pei Family didn’t know that they would raise an ungrateful dog who would bite the hand that fed him. Now that your power has become almost unsurpassable, you can easily confine this Empress Dowager with just a word. Very well then, Pei Qianhao, you better remember this!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Yaran turned around and left the Dragon Heaven Palace with no hesitation. Her departing figure carried a faint sense of resolution, not even turning around once. <em>Standing before me now is no longer Elder Brother Hao, but my enemy!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her love had run deep, and now, it had become twisted into hatred.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As Yuchi Mo watched Pei Yaran walk further into the distance, he felt that her back looked very desolate. He turned towards Pei Qianhao and asked, “Prince Hao, would confining the Empress Dowager result in some problems? It would be detrimental to you if we offend the Pei Family.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince knows when to stop.” Pei Qianhao’s gaze deepened, making it look as if his jet-black eyes had fused with the boundless night sky.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yuchi Mo, investigate Shu Xian thoroughly.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Bafflement appeared in Yuchi Mo’s eyes when he heard Pei Qianhao’s order. <em>Why does he want me to investigate Shu Xian? He’s just a little scholar boy assistant in the Imperial Library.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Could it be that Prince Hao suspects Shu Xian of killing the imperial guards at the northwest side?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Realising this possibility, Yuchi Mo immediately replied, “Shu Xian entered the Imperial Library as a scholar boy assistant after being selected by Grand Tutor Kong. It’s impossible for him to possess the fighting skills to resist even one imperial guard, much less kill 10 of them.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, he was immediately silenced by Pei Qianhao’s cold glare, and quickly corrected himself. “This subordinate obeys the order. I will go and investigate right away.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao waved his hand. “Quickly get to it.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yuchi Mo turned to walk out of the Dragon Heaven Palace, happening to see Imperial Physician Zhao, who had just arrived in the courtyard.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Imperial Physician Zhao bowed with his hands held out in front of him. “Prince Hao, please enter the hall. This humble subject shall take your pulse.” Even until now, he was under the impression that Pei Qianhao had summoned him to take his pulse.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao didn’t say anything, but turned to enter the side hall, with Imperial Physician Zhao following behind.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When he saw the person lying on the bed, Imperial Physician Zhao was stunned. <em>Why is Su Xi-er in the side hall of the Dragon Heaven Palace? Not to mention, she’s even sleeping on the bed?!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Help her take her pulse.” Pei Qianhao instructed as he walked to the bedside.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Imperial Physician Zhao placed his medical box down and walked over. <em>Su Xi-er’s complexion is extremely pale, and her eyes are closed. It appears that she has… passed out.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao felt as if his heart was being wrung in worry, but he didn’t show any of those emotions on his countenance. <em>Not only was she hurt with me around, it was even my fault.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Feel her pulse.” Pei Qianhao lifted one corner of the quilt and pulled Su Xi-er’s hand out from under the quilt.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Imperial Physician Zhao nodded and placed his hand on Su Xi-er’s wrist.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His brows knitted a moment later, his gaze flashing to Pei Qianhao in confusion before taking her pulse again.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“How is it?” Pei Qianhao got increasingly anxious when Imperial Physician Zhao didn’t reply for a long time.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Imperial Physician Zhao retracted his hand and bowed. “Prince Hao, based on this humble subject’s diagnosis, she…”</p>
