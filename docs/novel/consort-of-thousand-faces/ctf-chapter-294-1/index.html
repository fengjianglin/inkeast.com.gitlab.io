 <p>Pei Qianhao's gaze landed on her stomach, the corners of his lips raised up into a teasing smile. With a darkened gaze, he remarked, "This Prince did notice that you have gained some belly fat, but feels that that part on top is still small." His gaze then drifted to the aforementioned soft part of her body.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Following Pei Qianhao’s gaze, Su Xi-er unconsciously tightened her arms around herself. <em>Regardless of identity, any woman would be concerned if a man says that she is small there.&nbsp;</em>Su Xi-er only rolled her eyes at Pei Qianhao and immediately retorted, "This servant has been malnourished since I was young, and naturally isn’t big there. However, this servant isn’t worse than other women either."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er had not realised how her words and expression could have been misinterpreted.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao let out a clear and crisp chuckle, an indication of his good mood. "This Prince feels that I can grab both in one hand; is that still not considered small?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er's expression darkened at his words; she turned away, seemingly refusing to look at him. In reality, she couldn’t help but glance at him out of her peripheral vision. <em>How is it possible for him to grab both in one hand! He clearly had one in each hand when he touched them in the room.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Realising her own thoughts, blood rushed to Su Xi-er ears. <em>What the hell am I thinking? Being around Pei Qianhao for too long, I actually became… No, I can't be like this.</em> Su Xi-er shook her head and looked out of the carriage through the curtains to divert her attention.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The current Su Xi-er was like a shy little woman. Pei Qianhao's lips rose into a smile as he leaned forward again, stretched out his arms as he hooked them around her waist.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As soon as Su Xi-er fell into his embrace, Pei Qianhao’s hands fell upon that part of her body as he spoke into her ears with a husky voice. "This Prince was wrong to say that; I can only grab one in each hand."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>What would have sounded like an apology from somebody else, sounded like words from a gangster when it came from Pei Qianhao’s lips.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er pushed his arms away. "This servant doesn't like to discuss this. Prince Hao, please take the time during our journey to have a good rest." She then stood up and moved to the other side of the carriage while cautiously watching him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The corners of Pei Qianhao's lips rose slightly as he closed his eyes and leaned against the carriage walls, as though he was resting.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Two days passed by just like this, with the entourage choosing to camp out and setting up tents instead of staying at an inn when night fell.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With such a quick pace, the entourage arrived back at Beimin’s capital in only two days.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Beimin's imperial palace had already made the necessary preparations to receive them. The Imperial Army lined both sides of the road going from the city gates, all the way to the imperial palace gates. Each of them stood stoically in place, full of respect for the person passing by.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the commoners had heard that Prince Hao would be returning today, and had paused their work in order to catch a glimpse of him. These people were not only anticipating the arrival of Prince Hao, but also the woman who was by his side. From what they had heard, they assumed that Prince Hao would be bringing this extremely favoured woman back with him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>What kind of woman is capable of making Prince Hao dissolve the Beauty Palace for her?</em> At this thought, the crowd couldn't help but get excited, the curiosity on their faces unmistakable.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When one of the commoners standing at the head of the street saw a corner of the horse carriage, he couldn't help but shout, "They're here!"</p>
