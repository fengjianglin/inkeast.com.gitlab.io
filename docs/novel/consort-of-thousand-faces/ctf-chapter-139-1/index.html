 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>Su Xi-er didn’t want to drink, but just as she was about to decline, her gaze landed on someone not far away from her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Drink what wine? This Princess shall also have a taste.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>It’s Ning Anlian!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>She must have heard that Yun Ruofeng was holding a banquet for Pei Qianhao and decided to show her concern for her lover.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even though such a long time had passed, Su Xi-er couldn’t stop her gaze from becoming chips of ice when she saw Ning Anlian.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her deep-seated hatred of Ning Anlian made her unable to hide the brief glint of undisguised animosity in her eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even though it had vanished so rapidly, it didn’t escape Pei Qianhao’s eyes. He was silently observing, his thin lips pursed as if he was contemplating something.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Eldest Imperial Princess, Ning Anlian, approached him and bowed. “Greetings to Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao only nodded slightly. “I presume this must be the Eldest Imperial Princess.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“That’s this Princess.” Ning Anlian was neither haughty nor hot-tempered. She wore a faint smile at the corner of her mouth, demonstrating the proper disposition of an imperial princess.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She coldly scanned her eyes across the surroundings before taking a seat next to Yun Ruofeng, smiling at him, but otherwise silent.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian knew enough that she had to put up the front of an ordinary relationship in front of outsiders. Naturally, this involved allowing Yun Ruofeng to keep his face, not leaving anything for others to gossip about.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, she unknowingly revealed the overly passionate look in her eyes. How could someone as meticulous as Prince Hao miss something like that?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng turned the cup in his hand, his expression remaining usual. With the same gentle smile on his face, nobody knew of his inner thoughts.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian looked at the cup in his hand and inhaled the scent of wine in the surroundings. <em>He must have drank a lot.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She couldn’t help but knit her brows. Smiling at Pei Qianhao, she spoke, “Prince Yun has yet to recover from his previous injuries, and it’s not appropriate for him to drink too much wine. If you don’t mind, this Princess will drink with you, Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hearing what she said, Pei Qianhao suddenly chuckled. “A man hiding behind a woman, and even needing her to help him drink. It’s this Prince’s first time hearing about it.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian’s expression instantly changed. “You…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng interjected. “There’s no need for that. This Prince can drink.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian’s expression soured once again. Noticing that Yun Ruofeng’s complexion didn’t look too good, she couldn’t be bothered to mind the surrounding people. “You can’t drink with your body still unwell. Have you forgotten the previous palace banquet…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“There’s no need for you to be worried, Eldest Imperial Princess. This Prince is fine.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With the continuous exchange between the two, it was inevitable that people would let their imaginations run wild.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er watched on coldly. <em>What a great display of affection between lovers.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, Pei Qianhao suddenly said, “This Prince doesn’t make things difficult for people. Since Prince Yun is feeling unwell, the Eldest Imperial Princess can take his place. However…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As Pei Qianhao paused, everyone’s gazes landed on him, only to see the smile in his eyes. “Since the Eldest Imperial Princess is drinking on his behalf, this Prince can’t drink.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao immediately pulled Su Xi-er over to the seat beside him without asking if she agreed. He then poured a cup of wine and told her with a placid expression. “You can drink a cup with Nanzhao’s Eldest Imperial Princess.”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ning Anlian looked at Su Xi-er’s maidservant attire. <em>This is clearly a maidservant serving Prince Hao. How can I, the grand Eldest Imperial Princess, drink with a maidservant? This Prince Hao is really audacious to compare me with a servant girl!</em></p>
