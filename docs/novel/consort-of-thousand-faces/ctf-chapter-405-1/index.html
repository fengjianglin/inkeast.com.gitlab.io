 <p>“Is this how you write it?” Situ Li asked as he demonstrated the strokes on the cupboard.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er carefully observed his strokes before replying. “That’s correct. Do you still have other questions?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“No, this Prince will leave now. It wouldn’t be good if Prince Hao found out about me being here.” Situ Li took the Lan Script copybook back before closing it, glancing at Situ Lin before walking out of the main hall.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Once he was outside of the palace hall, he stowed the book away in his sleeve, the expression in his eyes still cold and devoid of emotions.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was only once he turned the corner of the palace path that he saw Pei Qianhao coming from the other direction. <em>It looks like he is going to the Dragon Heaven Palace. Ever since Xie Yun left the capital, it seems as if Prince Hao has become idle. However, he really is ruthless when he acts, bringing down Xie Yun’s general so quickly.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The two gradually approached one another, and Situ Li’s expression was as flat as his voice when he spoke up. “Prince Hao, you have been staying in the Dragon Heaven Palace instead of the Prince Hao Residence recently.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince will naturally return to my residence after the wedding.” Pei Qianhao’s voice was cold and innately imposing.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I see that you will be wherever your beautiful bride is, Prince Hao. This Prince won’t disturb you anymore then.” Situ Li moved to the side and walked past Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s brow was slightly furrowed. <em>Situ Li rarely comes to the Dragon Heaven Palace, but he suddenly came today for some reason.&nbsp;</em>Pei Qianhao hastened his pace as he headed for the Dragon Heaven Palace.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When he entered the main hall and found Situ Lin diligently practising his writing, Pei Qianhao finally felt gratified. <em>He’s finally more sensible.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Situ Lin looked at Pei Qianhao, quickly speaking before the latter could say anything. “Imperial Aunt is in the side hall. Third Imperial Brother came and consulted Imperial Aunt about the Lan Script just now.” He then continued with his practice.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao turned around to head for the side hall without another word. After entering, he saw Su Xi-er arranging the wardrobe.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He couldn’t help but stop in his tracks and take in the sight of her taking out all the clothes and folding them before putting them back in the wardrobe. Even his tough and unyielding heart couldn’t help but soften as he watched, unable to bear disrupting the peaceful scene in front of him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just as Su Xi-er was finished, she finally noticed Pei Qianhao’s presence.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She smiled. “Do you never fold your clothes before you place them into the wardrobe?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao walked to her, and tightly embraced her with his strong arms. “Xi-er.” The usual coldness in his voice was supplanted by tenderness.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hearing his form of address, Su Xi-er felt a little unnatural. <em>He usually calls me by my full name in a solemn or displeased manner. For him to suddenly call me Xi-er...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The weather today isn’t good, so I didn’t go to the Imperial Library. That said, it didn’t feel right to just laze around, so I thought I would organise your wardrobe after seeing it full of clothes that haven’t been properly folded.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Men are usually more casual when it comes to folding clothes, and Pei Qianhao doesn’t like other women touching his things.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xi-er, all the wedding preparations are complete. We just have to wait for the auspicious day to arrive.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er raised her head to look at him, taking in the earnest look in his eyes as her heart melted once again. Without speaking, she returned his hug even more tightly. <em>I won’t tell him my identity, because that is now a thing of a past. Right now, I am Su Xi-er; that is the identity I want to accompany him for a lifetime with.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xi-er, Nanzhao’s Emperor has been on his way, and will be here soon. Grand Tutor Liu’s daughter is also travelling with him.” Pei Qianhao said as he planted a kiss on her forehead.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>A trace of confusion flashed past Su Xi-er’s eyes. <em>Why did he suddenly mention Lianchen? Not to mention he went into such detail, even telling me who Lianchen brought with him.</em></p>
