 <p>Pei Yaran’s fists tightened again, her gaze immediately going to Su Xi-er. <em>It hasn’t even been that long since I took her away, and Pei Qianhao is already on his way. To think that this lowly maidservant holds so much weight in his heart.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The guard who reported the news to the Empress Dowager was panicking. When Pei Yaran saw the expression on his face, it only added to the anger in her heart. “Why are you panicking? It’s not the first time that Prince Hao has visited the Compassionate Peace Palace.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The guard’s expression stowed away his flustered expression and bowed. “This servant deserves to die.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Soon, the sound of steady footsteps entered Pei Yaran’s ears. She caught sight of Pei Qianhao as she turned around, and could tell that his eyes had been on Su Xi-er from the moment he had arrived. Although he was calm, his furrowed brows revealed that he was in a bad mood.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant pays her respects to Prince Hao.” The sound of people paying their respects continued until Pei Qianhao waved his hand to stop them.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao walked forward, each step like a hammer on Pei Yaran’s heart. At last, he stopped in front of her and said, “Empress Dowager, it is already past 11pm. You should retire for tonight.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After that, Pei Qianhao’s gaze landed on the corpse on the floor. “Someone take him away and give him a proper burial. Close up all the gates in the palace, and have the Imperial Guard Army continue to patrol throughout the night. Every section of the repose palace must be checked carefully. If any suspicious-looking people are found, send them to the Dragon Heaven Palace immediately.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>The Dragon Heaven Palace is His Majesty’s repose palace, and there is a side palace hall there that belongs to Prince Hao as it allows him to assist the Emperor when needed.&nbsp;</em>Everyone understood that Pei Qianhao wouldn’t be returning to his residence after what he had said. He would be staying in the imperial palace to manage the political affairs.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The guards acknowledged the order and immediately took the corpse away. Shortly after, only five people including Su Xi-er, the Empress Dowager, and Pei Qianhao, were left in front of the hut.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er bowed. “This servant pays her respects to Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before she got up, a big hand stretched out and helped her. “You may dispense with the formalities since your arm is wounded.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The sight of their hands touching was like a bright fire that burnt Pei Yaran’s eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Empress Dowager, it is already late; you should rest early.” Although Pei Qianhao’s words were respectful, his voice was very cold.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Yaran’s heart felt suffocated when she saw that Su Xi-er was going to be taken away. “Prince Hao, this Empress Dowager cannot allow you to take Su Xi-er away so easily.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s expression didn’t change, but his voice became lower. “Reason?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Empress Dowager suspects that Su Xi-er has lost her chastity in the palace, and I am waiting for Old Maidservant Zhao to examine her body. When I am certain that she is still a virgin, you can take her away.” Pei Yaran’s voice was soft and slow as she suddenly smiled and looked at Old Maidservant Zhao, signalling her to walk up.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even with the Empress Dowager there, Old Maidservant Zhao wasn’t courageous enough to directly go against Prince Hao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, everybody had stopped speaking, and the only sound that could be heard was the leaves in the wind.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er opened her mouth. “Empress Dowager, this servant will know if I have lost my chastity or not. After this servant entered the palace, I didn’t go near any men.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Every maidservant who has lost their chastity has said something like that before they were examined. Su Xi-er, if you are innocent, why not get examined?” Pei Yaran asked her with a smile on her face.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s parted her lips to reply, but Pei Qianhao suddenly raised his hand to stop her from talking.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, what Pei Qianhao said afterwards shocked everyone, especially Old Maidservant Zhao. Even Eunuch Zhang and Old Maidservant Liu’s expressions froze before quickly returning to normal.</p>
