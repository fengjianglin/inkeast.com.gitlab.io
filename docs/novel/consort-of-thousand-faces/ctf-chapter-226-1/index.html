 <p>Heh! That title caught your attention, didn’t it? :P Well, I’m not kidding! We present to you <a href="https://www.volarenovels.com/novel/rebirth-of-a-fashionista" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">Rebirth of a Fashionista</span></strong></a>!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>Ning Lianchen's brows furrowed momentarily before returning to normal. <em>If Prince Hao were to agree to Yun Ruofeng's arrangement, Imperial Elder Sister will have to follow him, and I won't get to see her anymore...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Yun Ruofeng sure knows how to pick the right timing!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Compared to Ning Lianchen's unhappiness, Pei Qianhao felt relaxed as he waved his hand to signal for Eunuch Fu to rise. "That's great. This Prince shall head to the boat to rest." He then looked towards Ning Lianchen before he continued, "The Imperial Household Landscape Garden of Nanzhao has such nice scenery. Your Majesty should take your time and enjoy it, but this Prince would like to take a rest."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He glanced at Su Xi-er after he finished, issuing a quick command as he turned to head off. “Hurry up.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This time, he used a threatening look to push her along instead of physical force.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Having spoken his part, he then ignored her and continued on his way. Pei Qianhao was adept in human psychology. <em>If trying to force her along didn’t work, why not try ‘cutting her a bit of slack’?</em> He believed that even if Ning Lianchen didn’t know how to be tactful in such a situation, Su Xi-er would.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Lianchen was elated when he watched Pei Qianhao go on his way, allowing him to try to reach out for his Imperial Elder Sister. However, he had forgotten that Eunuch Fu was present.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er bowed and spoke, "This servant shall take her leave." She secretly gave Ning Lianchen a meaningful look, signalling for him to calm down and look for another opportunity in the future.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With Eunuch Fu around, it wasn't convenient for her to speak to Lianchen. Although they had successfully acknowledged one another, it was still difficult for them to communicate with everyone else around.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Lianchen watched as Su Xi-er disappeared in the distance, wishing that he could follow along. It was clear, however, that Yun Ruofeng had sent Eunuch Fu to mess things up.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Your Majesty, Prince Yun had ordered this servant to bring you a message. Su Xi-er is Prince Hao's maidservant, a citizen of Beimin. Your Majesty should keep a distance from her. The current Nanzhao is very much lacking when compared to Beimin."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Lianchen's expression became solemn." You are indeed a loyal servant. This Emperor's business does not concern Prince Yun. Bring him a message for me instead: Karma." He then walked straight on. <em>Without Imperial Elder Sister, any sort of beautiful scenery is meaningless.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Eunuch Fu was rooted to the spot. <em>Karma? Why did His Majesty say that?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Su Xi-er had caught up with Pei Qianhao and silently followed after him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Pei Qianhao halted his steps. With how abrupt it was, Su Xi-er wasn’t able to stop herself in time, and ended up bumping into his back.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She lifted a hand to rub her nose as she took a few steps back and looked at him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao sighed before he lifted a hand and pulled her into his embrace. He raised his right hand and gently rubbed her nose without thinking. "From how this Prince sees it, you are the most stupid. I'm afraid you'll be stupid all your life."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er didn't reply and just allowed him to hold her and rub her nose as she looked into his bright eyes. Somehow, for a moment, her heart skipped a beat. <em>His embrace is warm, and gives a sense of security.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But it lasted for only a moment before she swiftly regained her composure.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao let go of her. "The Emperor of Nanzhao has impure thoughts towards you, can't you see it? When are you going to gain some wits?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She had allowed Ning Lianchen to approach her. This alone had upset him. <em>She is my maidservant; she belongs to me.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Prince Hao, if what you said was true, this servant would not be here, but beside the Emperor of Nanzhao instead. Please do not doubt this servant." Su Xi-er's voice was clear and distinct, allowing her words to be overheard by Ning Lianchen.</p>
