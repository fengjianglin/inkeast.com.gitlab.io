 <p>With the combined efforts of the imperial physician’s Xie Yun’s life was saved. Once he regained consciousness, he instructed Xie Liuli to go to the hidden chamber in the study to retrieve the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ttv.com.tw/homev3/ProgramInfoImg/2013-4/18386/12431.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">military tally</a> before passing it to Pei Qianhao. He then immediately made the request to resign as an official to Situ Lin.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Xie Family had been an aristocratic family for many generations, and one of their ancestors had even been an Empress Dowager who had made many contributions to Beimin. As such, Situ Lin agreed to his resignation, but was unwilling to strip him of his position as Commandery Prince.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The family estates, fields, and stores were all transferred under Xie Liuli’s name, but her mind was focused on taking care of her brother. Not in a mood to manage properties, she handed the task to their honest and loyal butler.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Yun felt as if his whole body was relieved. <em>Despite fighting with Pei Qianhao for so many years, I actually feel at ease after being defeated. Even when we speak, it’s not nearly as hostile as it was in the past.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao poured a cup of water for Xie Yun, watching as the latter took it before leaning against a pillar and chuckling. “I never expected that there would be a day when two of us could calmly talk to each other.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince also didn’t expect something like this either.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Pei Qianhao, I really envy you; you don’t lack anything.” Xie Yun’s gaze grew distant, and he would glance towards the door from time to time.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Zhen Yu wouldn’t come and see me, right?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xie Yun, Brother Hu’s real name is Rong Qing. He is already married, and his wife is pregnant.” Pei Qianhao placidly said, but his words were undoubtedly a pleasant surprise for Xie Yun.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Brother Hu already has a wife.” Xie Yun mumbled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Zhen Yu is such a good young lady, yet Brother Hu let her down.&nbsp;</em>He was delighted, but his heart also ached for her. <em>If he has let her down, then maybe I have a chance.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“ Zhen Yu is temporarily staying in the Prince Hao Residence, and it will be up to you to decide what you should do. Since you are no longer the Xie Yun of the past, this Prince naturally welcomes you.” Pei Qianhao stood up and walked out of the room, leaving Xie Yun to his own thoughts.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Zhen Yu probably still doesn’t know about Brother Hu being married. I can’t tell her, otherwise, she’ll be grief stricken. However, how am I supposed to get close to her if I don’t tell her?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not long after Pei Qianhao walked out of the room, he spotted Xie Liuli walking over with a bowl of medicinal soup.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Liuli stopped before him with a respectful smile. “Prince Hao, thank you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Take care of Commandery Prince Xie well.” Pei Qianhao indifferently replied before leaving the courtyard.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Liuli watched as Pei Qianhao faded into the distance, then looked at the tightly shut door to the room. <em>Things are...very good in the Commandery Prince Residence now. Everything has changed.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With a wide smile on her face, she quickly headed towards the room where Xie Yun was waiting.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Pei Qianhao reached the Prince Hao Residence, Su Xi-er had just come out of Zhen Yu’s room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“A-Jing, Zhen Yu’s emotions seem to be unstable, and she would vomit as soon as she eats. Could she be pregnant?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Instruct an imperial physician to diagnose her after a period of time. Xi-er, you don’t have to involve yourself with this any longer.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er nodded. “I also don’t know how to deal with this. We can’t tell her that Brother Hu has let her down. It’s fine even if she doesn’t meet him.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xi-er, you also have to nourish your body over this period of time.” Pei Qianhao immediately wrapped his arms around her waist.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“My body is fine. Medicinal soup is too bitter, and I don’t want to drink it.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao tightened his hold and whispered into her ear, “Are you not going to drink child giving soup?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Child giving soup...children…</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er raised her head to look at him. “If I get pregnant, you can’t touch me for the first three months. Are you able to endure that?”</p>
