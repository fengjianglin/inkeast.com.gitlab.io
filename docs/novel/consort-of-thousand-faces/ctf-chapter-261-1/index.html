 <p>“No one likes scrubbing chamber pots. When winter arrives, this servant doesn’t wish to be the one doing it.” Su Xi-er explained slowly as her hand that wasn’t being held by Pei Qianhao crept out from under the blanket.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao grabbed hold of her hand and tucked it back into the blanket. “Don’t be naughty. You don’t wish to scrub chamber pots, but it’s rare for you to beg this Prince. Say, if you won’t do that, where will you go?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Despite him posing the question, Pei Qianhao already felt that he had an answer that he wanted to hear.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yet, what Su Xi-er said silenced his little selfishness. “I don’t mind staying in the Palace Side Quarters as long as whatever I do doesn’t involve water.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao raised his hand to caress her face; it was much warmer than before. “You have really low expectations. Why didn’t you say you want to serve in the Prince Hao Residence?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant heard that there are no women in the Prince Hao Residence. If this servant enters the residence, it will incur the jealousy of others.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao let out a chuckle. “With this Prince around, what is there for you to be afraid of?” <em>Who would dare to object if I allowed it? Not to mention, there doesn’t seem to be a lack of people who are jealous of her right now, but she’s only chosen to be concerned about it once we return to Beimin?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er didn’t reply; her main worry was becoming overly reliant on a man’s support. <em>Once it becomes a habit, there is no telling what would happen if there is any falling out between Pei Qianhao and me in the future.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing her lack of response, Pei Qianhao understood. He suppressed his domineering air and spoke in a nonchalant tone, “This Prince shall not force you. One day, you will personally &nbsp;come to beg this Prince to serve at the Prince Hao Residence.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s body was gradually warming up, her face becoming a healthier rosy colour. With a smile on her face, she said jokingly, “Prince Hao, if you aren’t concerned with keeping beauties, why do you still keep the Beauty Palace around?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao couldn’t resist and slightly pinched her cheek. “For you to bring up the Beauty Palace of your own accord, could it be that you are jealous? Are you refusing to enter the Prince Hao Residence simply due to the existence of the Beauty Palace?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er turned her head to escape the large hand that was pinching her cheek. “This servant is just curious, Prince Hao. You don’t keep useless people around, so what is the point of those women? Just to admire, or for the sake of stirring the pot? If that’s the case, why do you need to do such a thing?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A mischievous glint appeared in the recesses of Pei Qianhao’s eyes. “This Prince is looking at you just to admire, but I really couldn’t admire your pale appearance earlier. So, in order to allow this Prince to fully appreciate you inside out, you must be sure to recover as soon as possible.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er understood; he had subtly diverted the topic. <em>Since that’s the case, I shall not mention the Beauty Palace again.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why? Are you upset? This Prince has never treated any woman as well as I treat you.” Pei Qianhao tucked her under the blanket. “Even if you feel hot, don’t try to get out from under the blanket. You may feel hot on the outside, but the cold air hasn’t completely dissipated from your body yet.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just as the words left his mouth, Su Xi-er’s expression suddenly changed. Her eyes drooped, and her head suddenly felt heavy. Her face became flushed, but it was akin to someone who had a fever. “This servant is sleepy.” She only managed to let out a few words before slumping back, unconscious.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><em>For her to fall asleep so suddenly, something must be wrong.&nbsp;</em>Pei Qianhao immediately lifted the blanket to see that the white bandage on her injured arm was soaked with black blood. <em>Her blood has to be let out immediately.</em></p>
