<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>The imperial guard obeyed, going as far as to move slightly to the side and hide secretly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the main hall, Pei Qianhao continued to instruct, “It doesn’t matter how much Lord Pei wants to save Pei Yong. The latter has committed too sinful crimes, and will be punished. Inform Wu Ling to swiftly arrest Pei Yong and throw him in prison. This Prince will personally give the order for him to be executed in front of everyone once I return.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This subordinate understands.” After that, the imperial guard got ready to leave.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just as the guard was about to start walking towards the door, Pei Qianhao suddenly stopped him and handed him a letter. “Hurry and return to Beimin, making sure to give this letter to Wu Ling. He will know what to do after that.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard took the letter. “This subordinate will return to Beimin posthaste.” He assured Pei Qianhao before heading out of the main hall.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er waited until the imperial guard left before coming out of hiding, immediately proceeding to her room. <em>I can tell from his surname that Pei Yong is related to the Pei Family, but Pei Qianhao is determined to execute him. Even if his crime is heavy, is Pei Qianhao truly going to act without regard for the Pei Residence? Is he planning to break himself away from them?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Of course, she didn’t know that Pei Qianhao was investigating Pei Yong completely for her sake. The reason that he had insisted on her leaving was because he didn’t want her to hear Pei Yong’s name. He was worried that she would remember the humiliating memories.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, not only did Su Xi-er not know that Pei Yong had offended the host of her body many years ago, she didn’t even know who he was.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao was all alone inside the main hall. After a while, he walked out of the main hall and glanced towards Su Xi-er’s room before heading in the opposite direction. <em>I must do something about the fake rumours that Yun Ruofeng is spreading around.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao acted fast; it wasn’t long before another rumour made it to the ears of the civilians.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>‘Prince Yun mistook someone else as Prince Hao’s maidservant and thought that she seduced him.’<em>&nbsp;</em>The news soon spread across the streets of Nanzhao, quickly igniting another round of gossip.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“So it was Prince Yun who made a mistake. I told you that it was stupid to think that Prince Hao’s maidservant would betray him to seduce Prince Yun!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Today has been crazy with all the twists and turns, but only Prince Yun would know the truth. We shouldn’t be making our own mindless speculations when it comes to matters of these big figures.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, the flour peddler who Su Xi-er had helped couldn’t help but interrupt. “Prince Hao’s maidservant is so intelligent, and her personality is great. I don’t believe that she tried to seduce Prince Yun. Prince Yun must have made a mistake, and someone must have spread the rumour on purpose.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a burly man laughed and made a bold guess. “Maybe Prince Yun fancies that beautiful maidservant and wants her for himself, but Prince Hao didn’t agree. Prince Yun then tried to force himself onto her, but didn’t succeed! In order to maintain his reputation, he spread the rumour that the beautiful maidservant had seduced him. Haha.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A young woman spat. “Prince Yun is open and aboveboard, he wouldn’t do that. Don’t think that Prince Yun is as perverted as the rest of you men!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The burly man wasn’t convinced. “You just said that men have perverted thoughts. As long as they are a man, who wouldn’t want to have all the beauties in the world? Even heroes have a weakness for beauties. Prince Yun must be the same.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Screw you. Nothing good can come out of your stinky mouth.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guards patrolling on the streets furrowed their eyebrows tightly after hearing this. They quickly passed the message to Qin Ling. <em>Commander Wei is dead, so Qin Ling is our new boss.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After Qin Ling heard the message, he waved his hand. “I will go and report this to Prince Yun; you all stay on guard here.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qin Ling then immediately headed towards the Prince Yun Residence, noticing Eunuch Fu standing by the door when he arrived.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Eunuch Fu is an old eunuch in the imperial palace and is very experienced, having served the late Emperor.&nbsp;</em>Qin Ling didn’t dare to be slight and bowed to pay his respects. “Eunuch Fu, did something happen in the imperial palace?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Eunuch Fu nodded. “Something big happened. This old servant is very anxious because Prince Yun still hasn’t appeared. His Majesty has ordered this old servant to come to the Prince Yun Residence and invite him to the palace.”</p>

 <p><strong>Sangria:</strong> Will Prince Hao find out Su Xi-er’s identity soon?</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Suddenly, a burly man laughed and made a bold guess. “Maybe Prince Yun fancies that beautiful maidservant and wants her for himself, but Prince Hao didn’t agree. Prince Yun then tried to force himself onto her, but didn’t succeed! In order to maintain his reputation, he spread the rumour that the beautiful maidservant had seduced him. Haha.”</p>
 <p><strong>Rakumon:&nbsp;</strong>Lol lol this guy was spot on. Prince Hao can consider taking him as his new subordinate ;)</p>
