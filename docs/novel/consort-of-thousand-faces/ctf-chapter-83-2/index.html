<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Su Xi-er walked forward step by step, her eyes never leaving him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just as she was about to bump into him, he raised his right hand and pulled her over.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s centre of gravity wasn’t stable, causing her to fall into his embrace.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao didn’t make any other movements besides his right hand wandering around the scar on the back of her shoulder. “Why didn’t you apply the medicinal powder? This scar will fade if you apply it daily.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant’s body is filled with scars. Many thanks for bestowing the medicinal powder on this servant Prince Hao. The scars on this servant’s back have already faded; it’s simply that this one is a bit deeper and requires more time.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s eyes slightly narrowed. “The last time I saw the scar on the back of your shoulder, it wasn’t as severe as it is today. Who whipped you?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>‘The last time I saw you’ he mentioned was referring to the day where he had forced her to change into a red Chinese bodice. At that time, he had broken his promise and turned around to look at her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“No one whipped this servant. This servant cut myself with the golden bamboo pole when I was washing the clothes.” Su Xi-er then twisted her body, wanting to get up.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao stopped her, taking out a bottle of medicinal powder from under his pillow and helping her to apply it on her scar.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Only after he was done did he realise that he had actually applied the medicinal powder for her personally. <em>The first time...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Unmindful of Pei Qianhao’s thoughts, Su Xi-er was still wriggling around in an attempt to escape his grasp.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao stowed away the white porcelain bottle before he placed his hands on her waist, reversing their positions with a flip.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His eyes were filled with danger as he observed Su Xi-er, who was now pressed under his body. “You think that this prince’s body is weak?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er raised her head to look at him. “This servant has never said that.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The three dishes all contained eggs. Isn’t that implying that this prince’s body is weak?” Pei Qianhao’s head gradually lowered as he spoke, eventually ending up right next to her ear.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Feeling his warm breath against her skin, Su Xi-er felt very uncomfortable. She didn’t like being controlled by others.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, the Beauty Palace is full of women who dress up exquisitely for the sole purpose of welcoming you into their rooms. Prince Hao…” Before she could finish, she was interrupted by Pei Qianhao.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You also came from the Beauty Palace, although it was the Empress Dowager who dispatched you there.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s hands pressed against his chest as she refused. “Only with their name carved on the Beauty Plaque is one considered a woman of the Beauty Palace. This servant is not one of those women as my name wasn’t carved. Please do not forget that this servant is from the Palace Side Quarters.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao chuckled. “This prince knows that you scrub the chamber pots.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His hands then reached out to secure her own, his gaze landing on her lips.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His handsome face was gradually enlarged before her eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just as his lips were about to press onto hers, Su Xi-er raised her legs and ruthlessly kicked his buttocks. At the same time, she nimbly raised her head and slammed into Pei Qianhao with all her might.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao didn’t expect that she could still launch such a powerful attack despite already being restrained by him. For a split second, his strength relaxed, allowing Su Xi-er to escape from his hands.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Pei Qianhao wasn’t such an easy target to be fooled with.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He reached out his right hand and made a deft grabbing motion just as Su Xi-er dodged. The Chinese bodice’s strap loosened, and the grey cloth floated onto the floor.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s expression changed. Her arms were hugged around herself as she looked at him with alarm.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao commented jocosely, “The one who should be eating eggs is you. Your body is weak. It isn’t big anywhere.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There was an overtone in his words, causing Su Xi-er’s face to turn white on the left side and red on the right side in anger and embarrassment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You don’t have to look at this prince in such a manner. This prince hasn’t eaten you yet.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, this servant has already received the punishment. This servant can leave now.” She then bent down to pick up the grey Chinese bodice.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just as she was about to pick it up, a large hand blocked her path and took her towards the bedside.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In an instant, her whole body was flung onto the bed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Such an ugly Chinese bodice. You’re better off not wearing it.”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er simply didn’t understand. <em>How is the colour of the Chinese bodice I wear any of his business?</em></p>
