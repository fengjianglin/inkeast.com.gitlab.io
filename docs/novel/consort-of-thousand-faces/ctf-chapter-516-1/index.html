 <p>The temperature in the room rose, and the two of them continued tossing around for an extended period of time before they stopped to rest. Su Xi-er hugged Pei Qianhao tightly and snuggled against his chest. "A-Jing, I won't drink wine anymore, and I'll also drink less tea. I can drink flower tea instead."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Mmm, if you're not going to drink wine, then neither am I. Rest for tonight; I’ll be back after settling some matters." Pei Qianhao caressed her head and gently coaxed her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"I'm going with you. Pei Yaran harmed me so much in the past." Su Xi-er pushed him away and began to put on her clothes. "For the handsome man trap, don't drink wine; just pretend you're drunk in the main hall. I'll ask Ruo Yuan to get Pei Yaran to sweep the front yard."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao carefully examined her face, but found no sign of sorrow. <em>She's already fine? Or has she buried this matter deep inside her heart so that her expression won't betray her?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Once Su Xi-er was fully dressed, she turned around to realise that Pei Qianhao was still standing there while staring at her motionlessly. She couldn't help but move forward and tug at him. "A-Jing, quick. I'll go and instruct Ruo Yuan before I prepare the wine in the main hall. Come over then."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She then walked out of the inner chamber without sparing him another glance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao still stood rooted to the spot and became deep in thought. <em>How exactly is Xi-er feeling right now? Is she simply forcing a smile, or has she really dropped the matter? Surely I’m not the only one who’s hoping for a child? If anything, she must yearn for one more than me. Our parents both passed away early, leaving us to shoulder many responsibilities; and so, both of us long for something we can call family.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I once read a book titled 'Family &amp; Country'. It stated that a family has a father, mother, and children; without children, the family line will end. Not only that, a country is made of many small families.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>She must have read this book before. It's a book that members of the imperial family from all four nations must read.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao furrowed his brow for a moment before relaxing them. <em>A woman's heart is like fishing for a needle at the bottom of the sea; it's so hard to fathom. How can I understand her better? Apart from observing her expressions and my interaction with her, what else do I need to do? Why don't I go to the Imperial Library and look for some play scripts?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Having made up his mind, he got up from the bed and swiftly put on his clothes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the meantime, Su Xi-er had already passed on the instructions to Ruo Yuan, prompting her to pour out a cup of wine before setting it next to the main seat that Pei Qianhao would be sitting in.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao arrived at the main hall about 15 minutes later, having taken the time to retrieve a type of medicine that would make someone become foolish.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Come, I'll pour some wine for you." Su Xi-er briefly glanced at Pei Yaran sweeping in the main courtyard before pouring him a cup of wine.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao took the cup and decided that if Pei Yaran was going to act, he should let her go all the way. When he raised the cup, he nimbly titled his body and threw the contents under the table before sprinkling some of the medicinal powder into another cup and setting it to the side.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After pouring a few times, Su Xi-er deliberately shouted outside. "Ruo Yuan, come and support me. I'm a little drunk."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ruo Yuan immediately went over and supported her, only to find Pei Qianhao's hand pressing against the table with his eyes closed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Princess Consort, is Prince Hao also drunk? Both of you have shown great liquor tolerance in the past!" Ruo Yuan exclaimed in shock.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er waved her hand. "I brought the wrong wine, and this is too strong for me. Support me to the main courtyard; Commander Wu will come and help Prince Hao in a while."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Alright, this servant will bring you there." Genuinely thinking that Su Xi-er was drunk, Ruo Yuan hurriedly helped her up before they both left the main hall.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Soon, only Pei Qianhao remained in the main hall. With his hands propping himself up against the table, his eyes were narrowed as he observed the still sweeping Pei Yaran.</p>
