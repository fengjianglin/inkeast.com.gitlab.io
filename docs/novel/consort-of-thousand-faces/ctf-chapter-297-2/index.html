<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Hong Li immediately covered Ruo Yuan’s mouth. “How many times have I told you to be careful with your words? Since we have decided to follow Su Xi-er, we must learn to become more clever. We can’t give others anything to use against us and bring unnecessary trouble.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ruo Yuan widened her eyes, quickly nodding before Hong Li let her go.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er looked at Hong Li. <em>I haven’t seen her in a while, but she’s become even quick-witted. Not bad, with that sort of improvement, I can put her in an important position in the future.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After that, the conversation no longer involved Prince Hao. It was all about Nanzhao’s scenery, cuisine, and floriculture.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, while the three were happily chatting, Prince Hao was solemnly sitting at a desk in his study room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Commander Wu respectfully stood on the side as he waited for Prince Hao to decide what to do about Pei Yong.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shortly after, Pei Qianhao commanded in a frigid tone. “Pass on this order from this Prince. Pei Yong is to be beheaded on the streets at noon tomorrow as an example to others. If anyone tries to disobey, kill them right on the spot as well.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling’s expression didn’t change. <em>Prince Hao is just following the law. For the crimes that Pei Yong committed, he deserves to die.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Apart from Pei Yong, there is another thing.&nbsp;</em>Wu Ling immediately asked, “Prince Hao, when we dissolved the Beauty Palace that day, some women returned to their birthplace, some left to find work, and some even committed suicide on the spot.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There was not even a single crack in Pei Qianhao’s expression after he heard that. He simply asked, “Have they been buried?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This subordinate has asked people to return those women’s bodies to their families, as well as providing those families money for a funeral. For those without a family, this subordinate has instructed people to bury them appropriately.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao nodded. He looked through the window of his study room, his gaze landing on the slowly falling leaves outside before coldly declaring, “There will no longer be a Beauty Palace in the future.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling wasn’t shocked about this anymore. <em>Prince Hao must have dissolved the Beauty Palace for Su Xi-er. Now that he has brought her to the Prince Hao Residence, it’s even possible that she’ll live here from now on.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, what Pei Qianhao said after that stunned Wu Ling. “Prepare a horse carriage by 5 pm today; you are going to personally send Su Xi-er and her people back to the Palace Side Quarters. Enter from the back door of the imperial palace.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling’s eyes widened in confusion. “Prince Hao, you have already brought her back to the residence; are you not going to keep her here?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I won’t.” The cold and curt answer was clearly displayed Pei Qianhao’s attitude.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Although Wu Ling still had his doubts, he didn’t dare to keep asking questions when he saw Prince Hao’s expression. Thus, he could only bow and acknowledged the order. “This subordinate obeys the order.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After that, Wu Ling turned around and left the study.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Left alone, Pei Qianhao picked a book off the shelf to read. It was only after about six hours that he left the study and made his way to the backyard.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before he even entered the backyard, Pei Qianhao heard a clear and ringing bell-like laughter. The source of it was Su Xi-er; she sat facing her two maidservants who wore smiles just as large as their master. <em>What are those three talking about to laugh like that?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When they noticed Pei Qianhao, their laughter was instantly cut off. Pei Qianhao immediately felt unhappy. <em>They were laughing so much without me here, but immediately stopped once I arrived.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ruo Yuan and Hong Li immediately bowed. “This servant pays her respects to Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er was about to follow along, but was stopped by Pei Qianhao. He looked at Ruo Yuan and Hong Li and waved his hand. “Withdraw, both of you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant obeys the order.” Hong Li immediately replied before dragging Ruo Yuan out of the backyard.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ruo Yuan turned around and looked at Su Xi-er with a trace of worry on her face, but Hong Li forcefully dragged her out. Just as they walked out, Ruo Yuan saw Wu Ling walking past them, causing her ears to suddenly turn red again.</p>
