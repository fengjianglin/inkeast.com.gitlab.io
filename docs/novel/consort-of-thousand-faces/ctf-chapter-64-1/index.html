 <p>Su Xi-er carefully sized Wu Ling up. <em>His expression doesn’t look like he’s kidding, but it’s already so late at night. Who takes people to meet someone in the middle of the night? Surely Pei Qianhao also needs to rest?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Su Xi-er, are you going or not?” Wu Ling asked. It was as if he would immediately take her to meet Prince Hao as long as she nodded.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Imperial Bodyguard Wu, are you sure you haven’t been beaten silly? What time is it now? Even if this servant didn’t need to, your prince does have to rest.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao has yet to rest.” <em>Since Prince Hao has instructed me to monitor Su Xi-er, why don’t I be bolder and simply take her there? It’s just that I don’t know what Prince Hao’s reaction would be. If I guess wrong, I’ll just have to suffer a flogging from the planks again.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant can’t go. Continue monitoring then, Imperial Bodyguard Wu.” Su Xi-er then turned around and entered the room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling looked at the tightly shut door. <em>If I forcefully bring Su Xi-er to Prince Hao, he would definitely be displeased.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Forget about it; I’ll just drop the matter.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Returning to his previous position against the wall, he stifled his yawns for the rest of the night.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling only left when it was almost 5 am, hurrying over to the Prince Hao Residence.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>On the expansive lawn in the backyard of the Prince Hao Residence, its namesake was practising archery.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao raised his bow, his eyes narrowed as he set his sights on a target a hundred meters away. He released three arrows in one go, with all three hitting the bullseye</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Your Highness.” Wu Ling walked to him and bowed deferentially.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao continued the process of knocking the arrow and firing before he finally spoke. “What’s the matter?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the three arrows had shot the centre of the target simultaneously.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Su Xi-er has already discovered that this subordinate is monitoring her.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao placed the bow down as the expression in his eyes became unreadable. He only asked after a period of time had passed, “How long did it take for her to find out?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The first day I monitored her…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao looked at Wu Ling and chuckled. “You were discovered right on the first day. Is it because you are incapable, or because she’s too adept?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This subordinate…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Alright, since you have been found out, you don’t have to spy on her anymore. This prince had long expected this to happen.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling felt very embarrassed. <em>Long expected? If that’s the case, it seems like Prince Hao instructed me to monitor her so that I can be discovered, thus indirectly reminding Su Xi-er to exercise more restraint.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Nanzhao’s state banquet will be held in the middle of next month. This prince will set off tomorrow.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling was a little bewildered. <em>When Nanzhao invited Prince Hao in the past, he had always rejected them. Why is he going this year?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just as he was feeling puzzled, he heard Prince Hao’s deep and low voice.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It’s the first year Yun Ruofeng is acting as regent while the emperor is like a puppet. It is currently a critical period for Nanzhao, how can this prince not go?” Pei Qianhao’s lips were upturned with a devilish look decorating his eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Your Highness, Yun Ruofeng ascended to this position by stepping over the deceased Eldest Imperial Princess; someone that you had even complimented in the past. To think that…” <em>She died so quickly. It’s truly hard to escape the word ‘love’.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao passed the bow in his hand to Wu Ling. “She was a brave and resourceful woman. Of course this prince would admire her. Since she has died, this prince will also admit that she was the first person I have praised.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Your Highness, if that was the case, why didn’t you marry that Eldest Imperial Princess earlier? She wouldn’t have died then.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling’s tone was filled with confusion. <em>Since he already admires her, if he further deepens his feelings, wouldn’t that be the love between men and women? The plays performed on the stage are like this.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This type of woman can only be admired. Closing the distance and forcing her to become someone’s wife would be unsuitable.” Pei Qianhao then turned around and walked towards the forecourt of the residence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling immediately followed. <em>Unsuitable to be a wife? Then who’s suitable to be one? Don’t tell me that it’s Su Xi-er, the one previously scrubbing the chamber pots and now washing the clothes, who is suitable to be a wife?</em></p>
