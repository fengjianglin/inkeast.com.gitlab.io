 <p>Pei Qianhao glanced at Su Xi-er before looking at Situ Li. “So what if this prince says yes?”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>His tone was overbearing and arrogant, like he considered himself unparalleled in the world.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s brow was slightly knitted. <em>He deliberately drew Situ Li away. That is to say, he knows all about me approaching Liu Ye-er and trying to trick her into saying something.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>This man hides his schemes too deeply. If that’s the case, he won’t ever believe my obedient and terrified appearance again in the future.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Thinking of this, Su Xi-er clenched her fists before making up her mind: <em>regardless of how he doesn’t believe me or how he sounds me out, I definitely can’t let the cat out of the bag.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Prince Hao doesn’t have conclusive evidence, so he can’t capture someone as he pleases. I have to be prudent in not allowing him to find out anything that may incriminate me.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Situ Li slowly walked closer towards Su Xi-er, When he was less than a metre away from her, he suddenly reached grabbed her right hand, pulling her behind him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao raised his eyebrow and found it very interesting as he looked at Su Xi-er but he was talking to Situ Li. “She’s with you?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“To use Prince Hao’s words, so what if this imperial prince says yes?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This prince has no interest in the matters of you two. It’s fine as long as you don’t actively provoke this prince. Su Xi-er, am I right?” Right afterwards, Pei Qianhao began scrutinising Su Xi-er’s expression.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At one side, Ruo Yuan was still kneeling on the ground. She could no longer fathom the current situation. <em>Judging from Prince Hao’s and the Third Imperial Prince’s behaviour, they’re arguing over Su Xi-er? They have taken a fancy to the same woman?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er struggled free of Situ Li’s hand and bowed to Pei Qianhao respectfully. “This servant will keep your words in mind, Prince Hao. In any case, there are still chamber pots beside the well that haven’t been scrubbed. This servant will be taking my leave.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You still know that you should go and work.” Pei Qianhao chuckled and waved his hand, indicating for Su Xi-er to leave.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er turned around and signalled to Ruo Yuan with a meaningful glance. Soon, the two of them had left the woods.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Situ Li looked at Pei Qianhao and said coldly, “Prince Hao, I hope that you won’t interfere in the matters of Beimin’s imperial household.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao cast a sidelong glance at him. “This matters involves Commandery Prince Xie. Don’t tell me that he is someone from Beimin’s imperial household?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“He naturally isn’t. He is just a commandery prince with a different surname. Situ is the surname of Beimin’s imperial household.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This prince is aware of the surname of Beimin’s imperial clan. You don’t need to remind me, Third Imperial Prince. However, it seems that you have forgotten that if it weren’t for this prince being soft-hearted, you would still be in a remote county.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Situ Li’s expression immediately changed. The moonlight illuminating his face caused his visage to appear even more ashen pale.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Your Mother Empress’ death anniversary is almost arriving. On the account that you miss your Mother Empress very much, this prince summoned you back with a decree.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Situ Li suddenly laughed and his tone carried a trace of mockery. “This imperial prince should thank you instead.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Since you know that, you should stay further away from Su Xi-er.” His tone was unquestionable and extremely domineering.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, you just said that you have no interest in caring about this imperial prince and Su Xi-er’s matters.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s eyes darkened as the corner of his lips were raised. “Third Imperial Prince, you didn’t listen fully to this prince’s words. Those who provoked this prince, this prince won’t let them off. If you get too close to Su Xi-er, you may be implicated in the future.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Situ Li listened attentively. He understood Pei Qianhao’s implied meaning. <em>There was an audacious palace maid who mounted a sneak attack on Prince Hao in the woods beside the Palace Side Quarters that night.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Furthermore, Prince Hao has already started to suspect Su Xi-er, but he simply suspects her, and doesn’t have any evidence.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, if you put it in such a manner, it would mislead this imperial prince into thinking that Su Xi-er provoked you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Third Imperial Prince, you don’t have to trouble yourself over this matter. The people of the imperial clan have pampered and fragile bodies. With how late it is, you should rest earlier.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Afterwards, Pei Qianhao directly left without glancing at Situ Li.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the woods, Situ Li was absorbed in his thoughts.</p>
