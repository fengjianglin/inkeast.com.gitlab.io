Our EXCEPTIONAL novel lead, <strong>Choufleur</strong>, will be releasing <strong>3 chapters a week, between Friday to Sunday</strong>!!

<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>She had already been at his mercy the two previous times that he had backed her into the wall. <em>Is it going to be like that again now?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Please clearly explain what you mean Prince Hao.” Just as he was about to approach her, she took a step to the side and bowed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Very well!” Pei Qianhao’s voice was deep and low, and his gaze landed on her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Let this prince ask you. Since you have begged this prince to investigate the matter about the fat palace maid, why did you also tell the Third Imperial Prince to do so in the blink of an eye? You don’t trust this prince?” <em>It’s the first time I’ve ever been doubted. Moreover, it’s by a woman.&nbsp;</em>Pei Qianhao had always been confident and this made him feel extremely displeased.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Especially in the case of men, those who were in an eminent position, revered by others and feared by others, always had an innnate self-confidence, noble aura and arrogance. No one could question that, especially women.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His words caused Su Xi-er to be speechless. <em>Indeed, I have told Situ Li.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s cold voice continued, “You have nothing to say now? Woman, you really broadened this prince’s horizons. Your ability in seducing men is really high.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er suddenly raised her head and looked straight at him, her eyes emanating a sharp coldness that would normally be impossible for a delicate woman. Even Pei Qianhao was taken aback for a moment before fixing his expression and staring at her fixedly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, if the other palace maids see you appearing in my room, they would definitely say that this servant is forging connections with you to climb up. However, when has this servant ever acted like a sycophant to you?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao watched her quietly. <em>What she said isn’t wrong. She has never sought connections with me. It has always been me who has tried to make her admit that she was the woman in the woods beside the Palace Side Quarters by sounding her out again and again. However, the results have always turned out to be diametrically opposite of what I had hoped for.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, this servant has indeed told the Third Imperial Prince; with his position, how could this servant refuse to answer when he asked? Besides, you should be in the Compassionate Peace Palace today, Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The room was instantly engulfed in a deathly silence that was so quiet to the point it was a little frightening. Su Xi-er was the first person to bring up the Empress Dowager in front of Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why should this prince be in the Compassionate Peace Palace?” Pei Qianhao crouched down and stared directly into Su Xi-er’s eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>If it had been another palace maid, they would have long fainted from fear, but Xi-er’s unruffled appearance only stirred up Pei Qianhao’s suspicions again.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“There is news in the palace that the Empress Dowager isn’t in a good mood today and invited Prince Hao to the Compassionate Peace Palace. As her elder brother, you should…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She was then interrupted by Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao was caressing her chin as if he was admiring a type of art piece. There were no ripples of emotions in his eyes at all.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“So, based on your logic, this prince should be in the Compassionate Peace Palace and coaxing the Empress Dowager?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After a long time, Su Xi-er nodded.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Do you know what this prince loves the most?” Pei Qianhao asked her the same question again.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You love beauties,” Su Xi-er answered with no hesitation.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yet, this time, Pei Qianhao shook his head. “No, that’s just on the surface.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er knitted her slender eyebrows. <em>Why is he telling me this?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What this prince loves the most is…” The expression in Pei Qianhao’s eyes changed. “People who dare to resist this prince.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As soon as she heard this, Su Xi-er firmly believed that Pei Qianhao was a pervert.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“And you, Su Xi-er, are the first one to do so. ” Pei Qianhao released her chin and stood up.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant can follow your instructions Prince Hao.” <em>Since he likes those who resist him, I’ll just act subserviently.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You will?” Pei Qianhao actually smiled and pointed at the wooden bed. “This prince orders you to take off your clothes and lie on it.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s heart skipped a beat. <em>I have never seen a man like this before.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When he saw that she wasn’t moving, he said indifferently, “You’re not the type to listen to others’ orders. This kind of person only has one outcome when this prince encounters them.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er raised her head to look at him and didn’t speak. She was unable to fathom his profound thoughts.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This prince has another hobby.” In a split second, the expression in Pei Qianhao’s eyes became devilish and wanton.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His ice-cold gaze landed on Su Xi-er. “Destroying everything I am interested in. Do you think it’s interesting this way?”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er held her tongue, wanting only to loudly yell <em>“You are a pervert!”</em>. <em>How can a person like this live in this world? He’s more terrifying than anyone else.</em></p>
