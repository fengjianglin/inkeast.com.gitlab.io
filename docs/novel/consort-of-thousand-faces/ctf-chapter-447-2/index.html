 <p>“I can’t tell you. You’ll find out sooner or later.” The corners of Pei Qianhao’s mouth rose, and he kissed her lips again.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, there was a knock on the door, and Pei Qianhao let go of Su Xi-er before instructing, “Enter.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A row of pages came in, each carrying a tray of dishes. They respectfully laid each dish on the table, saying their names as they did so.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Every single dish was a specialty from Nanzhao, forming a complete set that even consisted of Jade Dew wine. <em>This wine is usually only used to entertain noble guests during Nanzhao’s state banquet.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After the pages were done with arranging the dishes, they bowed and withdrew. Right after Su Xi-er heard the click of the door being shut, she turned to ask Pei Qianhao, “You have long prepared for this?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao smiled and picked some food for her. “Ning Lianchen told this Prince what you like. This table is full of your favourite food.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Soon, her bowl was fully piled with food, and Su Xi-er was so moved that she couldn’t utter a single word. Even her hands that held her chopsticks seemed to be frozen in place.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xi-er, you like wearing crimson dresses, Lingrui flowers, and eating Lotus Salad. You don’t allow this Prince to drink wine, but you yourself love drinking Jade Dew wine. You also like…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er placed her chopsticks down and embraced him, burying her head into his chest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>He has been secretly observing all my likes and dislikes, and even asked Ning Lianchen in private. He knows everything about me, but never tried to brag about it, only silently and diligently putting forth his best effort for my sake.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She heard a soft chuckle from above her head, followed by his playful voice. “However, there’s one thing Ning Lianchen doesn’t know that this Prince knows.” His voice was laced with a hint of smugness and cheeriness.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er raised her head to look at him. “What is it?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing her face filled with curiosity, Pei Qianhao heartily laughed and whispered into her ear. “You like hugging this Prince and putting your hands on my chest when you sleep.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She didn’t know how she should respond when she saw his smug expression, only embracing him even more tightly in the end. “What else have you prepared today? I’m afraid that…” <em>I’m afraid that I’m going to cry and end up with my eyes all red and swollen, and I wouldn’t look nice then.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xi-er, this Prince is here. Don’t be afraid.” Pei Qianhao patted her back before picking up his own chopsticks, picking up some food from her plate.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xi-er, come sit on this Prince’s lap. I’ll feed you.” With his hand around her waist, he effortlessly sat her on his lap.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Presented with the sumptuous feast, Su Xi-er’s heart was warm. She opened her mouth and happily ate what Pei Qianhao fed her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Watching the side of her face, the corners of Pei Qianhao’s mouth curled up when he noticed her smiling visage.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>She’s very happy now.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Not bad, the first attempt was a success, and I was the one who made her happy. I want her to be the happiest woman in this world.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, he wouldn’t say those words out loud because he wasn’t used to doing something like this. <em>My personality and displays of affection focus more on doing rather than saying. I can’t change this part of me.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xi-er, the Jade Dew wine is delicious, but you can’t have too much of it. This Prince realises that you sometimes crave wine more than myself.” He picked up a white porcelain wine cup and held it beside her lips.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er softly chuckled and drank the contents, the clear wine trickling down her throat along with a floral fragrance. <em>Delicious!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er then turned around and hooked her hands around his neck. “Nanzhao is a country famous for its wine. The women there have decent alcohol tolerance, and I was even the Eldest Imperial Princess. My Emperor Father had me start tasting wine as soon as I was old enough to understand things, so it goes without saying that my alcohol tolerance is decent.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The cup of wine seemed to have accentuated the captivating charm in her eyes, causing Pei Qianhao’s heart to stir when he looked at her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The sunlight streamed through the rice paper windows and illuminated her face, the remnants of wine on her lips glistening and presenting an alluring scene.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After Pei Qianhao felt a series of ripples in his heart from taking in the beautiful sight before him, he hugged her even more tightly and smiled. “The Jade Dew wine is indeed delicious. This Prince also wants to have a taste.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Immediately after, his hand reached for her waist and he pressed her down. As fast as a cheetah on the grasslands, he captured her lips in an instant, slowly enjoying it as if he was tasting wine.</p>
