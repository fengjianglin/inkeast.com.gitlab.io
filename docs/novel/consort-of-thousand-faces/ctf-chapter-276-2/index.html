<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>“Regretful?” The pitch of Yun Ruofeng’s voice raised as if he was perplexed, but it sounded like a rhetorical question, even to himself. He felt uncomfortable in his heart when he saw Su Xi-er’s gentle temperament in front of Pei Qianhao. <em>She is still the same person, but why is she so aloof, proud and pompous in front of me, while being gentle and forbearing in front of Pei Qianhao?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Regardless of me being regretful or not, she can’t leave with Pei Qianhao. I cannot tolerate a woman who originally belonged to me lying in the arms of another man!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng narrowed his eyes. “Pei Qianhao won’t be able to bring you back if he can’t find you.” Yun Ruofeng’s voice sounded out, his hand suddenly snaking across the room as he aimed for the sleeping acupoint on Su Xi-er’s neck.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At the same time, Su Xi-er had readied the sewing needle in her hand. She flung it out with practised accuracy, watching as it embedded itself into Yun Ruofeng’s kneecap. A split second later, Yun Ruofeng stumbled, his expression changing as pain shot up his leg.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Having been on the battlefield for many years, his knee suffered from sequelae, and would hurt when it rained. It went without saying that a needle being stabbed into his knee would cause intense pain. Of course, Su Xi-er was well aware of this. When his knee had started hurting in her past life, she had ordered the servants to bring a basin of hot water before personally massaging his knee.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, Yun Ruofeng started shivering. <em>Lovable, gentle and forbearing. Although it was rare, I cannot deny that she has shown this side to me before.&nbsp;</em>Waves crashed into Yun Ruofeng’s heart. <em>My pride is to blame; I only saw Ning Rulan’s arrogant side, focusing on all of her faults. Because of this, I neglected everything that drew me to her in the first place.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Was I wrong?&nbsp;</em>Yun Ruofeng’s gaze was tainted with streaks of pain. <em>Was I wrong?&nbsp;</em>Yun Ruofeng was born of a lowly background, causing his heart to hold the burning desire to rise up above others so that he wouldn’t be trampled on by anyone!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yun Ruofeng, you are too eager to excel, but you have never learned from your mistakes, and always pushed the blame onto others. You say that I was cold and arrogant, but let me ask you: How much concern did you show me? Did you really know me?” Su Xi-er spoke icily, feeling nothing when watching Yun Ruofeng’s pained expression.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Give up the power, and return everything to Ning Lianchen.” Su Xi-er observed Yun Ruofeng’s eyes, making out a flicker of hesitation in his eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A long while later, Yun Ruofeng answered, “I will return it to him, but not all of it. I have worked hard for so many years... I deserve all that I have now! Lan-er, if I return half of my power to His Majesty, can you return to my side? I don’t want you to suffer out there. Stay in the Prince Yun Residence and wait for my return every day. Support your husband and educate our children while you live a life without worry; don’t you want to enjoy a life like this?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hope glimmered in Yun Ruofeng’s eyes. <em>I finally realise that I have never truly forgotten Ning Rulan. I… I love her. I don’t know how much, but I know that I do. I know that I can never eat or sleep peacefully without her.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I treated Ning Anlian well just to fulfil my own fantasies, treating her like a Ning Rulan who had shed her pride and smiled at me coquettishly.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Lan-er, return to me. We shall live each day carefreely, alright?” Yun Ruofeng tolerated the pain in his knee and stood up, stretching his hand towards Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“A passing breeze will never pass by again. The Ning Imperial Household cannot be challenged. Half is not enough; you must return everything that you have taken.” Su Xi-er then turned and left the room, leaving Yun Ruofeng with a slightly stunned expression behind.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He stood there motionlessly staring at the door until pain shot up his knee again. He pulled the needle out, watching the light gleam off its surface. <em>Ning Rulan was just like this needle, piercing straight through my whole body.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng laughed, but it sounded pitiful and broken. <em>Only now do I realise how blind I was when I killed her that day. Only negative points about her clouded my mind, and I believed in the fantasy of living with Ning Anlian. I thought that she would be able to replace Ning Rulan and assist me, educating our children and living together in peace.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>In the end, I lost everything, including my heart to Ning Rulan. I don’t want to lose the opportunity that I have now to get her back.</em></p>

 <p>~~~</p>
 <p><strong>Cosy:</strong> I have reached the point where I don’t know what to say about Yun Ruofeng anymore. What do you guys think of Yun Ruofeng at this point?</p>
 <p><strong>Rakumon:&nbsp;</strong>Oh well, I guess YRF just doesn't want what he doesn't have to land in someone else's hands :/&nbsp;</p>
 <p>but tbh though, I'm still confused about YRF at times O_O</p>
