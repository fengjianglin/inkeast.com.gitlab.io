 <p><em>Eldest Imperial Princess likes Prince Yun, and Prince Yun likes Eldest Imperial Princess.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Despite that, Prince Yun’s feelings towards the Eldest Imperial Princess have definitely changed tremendously since he became Prince Regent!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Besides, didn’t Ning Rulan accompany Prince Yun when he discussed matters with the ministers?” As she spoke, Ning Anlian’s revealed a vicious and resentful expression. “If even a shameful criminal like Ning Rulan can meddle with the discussion between Prince Yun and the ministers, then why can’t this Princess attend the night banquet?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Piao Xu thought about it. <em>The previous Eldest Imperial Princess is different from the current one. Back then, Ning Rulan was the one who controlled and managed the court well. The same can’t be said for the current Eldest Imperial Princess.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>The ministers have never liked the imperial harem interfering with the court politics. The previous Eldest Imperial Princess was really different compared to the current one.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian’s voice grew ever more high-pitched as she spoke, as if trying to prove, ‘<em>This Princess is Prince Yun’s most beloved woman. Even if this Princess doesn’t enter in the name of showing concern for him, as the Eldest Imperial Princess, why can’t I meet Prince Hao with him?</em>’</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Anlian realised that after Yun Ruofeng became the Prince Regent, he seemed to be have been snubbing her. This kind of rejection, whether it was purposeful or not, had made her heart grow cold<em>.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>No, this man is, and always will be, mine. Whether it’s Ning Rulan or other women in the future, Yun Ruofeng is mine in this lifetime! No one can snatch him away from me!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Piao Xu still wanted to stop her, but Ning Anlian was already yelling to people outside. “Come, prepare the horses for this Princess.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yes.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At Prince Yun’s Residence, the banquet was about to begin.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The prince regents sat at the antechamber for a while, talking about unimportant things ever since Su Xi-er left.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Occasionally, Pei Qianhao could feel Yun Ruofeng’s eyes looking towards the back kitchen, as if he was waiting for something.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng’s moves made Pei Qianhao unhappy. <em>Prince Yun is clearly checking if Su Xi-er has returned yet.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Thinking about the interactions between the two, it further supported Pei Qianhao’s suspicions. <em>Is there something going on between Su Xi-er and Yun Ruofeng? I can’t describe the strange feeling of their interaction.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Furthermore, it feels like something I raised has been snatched away by the man in front of me.&nbsp;</em>This made him feel uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>But it’s clear from the investigation that it’s not possible for Su Xi-er to be acquainted with Yun Ruofeng.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The steward suddenly walked up and whispered next to Yun Ruofeng’s ear. “Your Highness, the banquet is ready to begin.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng nodded. “Mmm, go and prepare. This Prince and Prince Hao will come over soon.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just at this moment, Su Xi-er returned from the back kitchen.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This time, Su Xi-er didn’t look at Yun Ruofeng again.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, when Yun Ruofeng saw that Su Xi-er had returned, his gaze unconsciously landed on her with a sense of not wanting to leave.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The faint smile on his face was much more approachable and pleasant to look at compared to Pei Qianhao’s cold and noble face.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao waved his hand at Su Xi-er. “Come here.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er swiftly walked around Yun Ruofeng and came to Pei Qianhao’s side.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s face was cold; he looked at Su Xi-er and asked, “This Prince only asked you to wash the cutlery. Why did you take so long?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er lowered her head and replied obediently. “As your cutlery needed to be washed in a special way, it took a bit longer, Prince Hao. Hope you can understand.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With such a cordial attitude, Pei Qianhao couldn’t make things difficult for Su Xi-er in front of others. As a result, he simply gave her a cold glance before looking away.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Yun Ruofeng saw this, he got up from his chair. “Prince Hao, the housekeeper just came to report that the banquet is ready to begin. Please follow this Prince to the back garden.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao nodded slightly and glanced at Su Xi-er, signalling for her to follow.</p>
