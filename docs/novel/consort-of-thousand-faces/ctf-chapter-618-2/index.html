 <p>Yun Ruofeng bowed respectfully and said, “I am the one asking for a favor now. Though she’s my fiancee, she has been duped by Beimin’s Prince Hao. Now that she’s become his Princess Consort, she’s extremely loyal to him. I’d like you to make her forget her past so that she can start a new life with me.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why don’t you try to convince her through other means? Using medicine is not the best method. Moreover, how can you be so sure I have a way?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng looked at Su Xi-er with sadness in his eyes. “I’ve tried numerous methods, but only he remains in her heart now. I have no other choice, and hope that you can help me out.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Would she have entered somebody else’s body and become Princess Consort Hao if you didn’t kill her in the first place? As the one who initially pushed her away, I can only tell you that there is no medicine for regret in this world.” The man looked at Su Xi-er as he spoke. He knew who Yun Ruofeng was, but it was clear that the opposite was not true.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>If she really is Ning Rulan, she’ll recognise me for sure.</em> After receiving news of her death, he had decided to retire and live in seclusion in Beimin.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng’s heart sank. <em>My plans would all be for naught if the expert refuses to help.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Great Master, please help me.” Yun Ruofeng asked sincerely.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’m no great master. I was originally a craftsman.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er was relieved upon hearing this. She thought that the man had switched allegiances and decided to work with Yun Ruofeng, but it seemed that he was still loyal to her. The only problem now was that she wanted to talk to Feng Xiao alone.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng looked at Su Xi-er again. <em>If the expert refuses to help me, all I can do is to use the incense on her all the time. Better that she stays with me like that than go back to Pei Qianhao’s embrace.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Wait outside. She’s rather weak now, so let me take her pulse first.” Feng Xiao placed a handkerchief over Su Xi-er’s wrist as he spoke.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng didn’t move until Feng Xiao said, “I won’t make her forget about the past if you don’t wait outside.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er opened her eyes after hearing the door close. “Feng Xiao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Feng Xiao had a head of white hair, and his wrinkles were a lot more obvious than before. He seemed to have aged greatly in the years since their last meeting.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Eldest Imperial Princess, so you’re actually awake.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er nodded. “I wanted to find out who the mysterious expert helping Yun Ruofeng was, so I pretended to play along. I didn’t expect it to be you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I decided to save his life since I found him at the foot of the cliff by coincidence. There are some grudges which cannot be solved by dying.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“He is inhumane. I used to love him, yes, but that is all in the past. Feng Xiao, why did you age so much?” Su Xi-er asked.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’ve been burying my head in medical books all this while. My hair turned white, and I’ve gotten many wrinkles because of that.” Feng Xiao answered calmly. “Eldest Imperial Princess, you’re weak now, but you’ll recover your strength after taking some nourishing medicine. I’ll stall Prince Yun for now, and you can decide what you want to do after that.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I know him all too well. If I don’t end him, he’ll follow me to the ends of the Earth. His ego and possessiveness are second to none, and he’d rather pay with his life than have me be with someone else.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Eldest Imperial Princess, there are two things Prince Yun cares about in this world. One is power, and the other is you. His past actions have made it clear which he cares for more, but now that power is no longer within his reach, you are the thing he cares about most.” Feng Xiao signalled for her to lie down as he spoke. He then took out some black paste from his medicine box and spread it on her forehead and wrists.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Take a rest, Eldest Imperial Princess.” The paste was warm and comfortable on Su Xi-er’s skin, and before long, she had entered a deep sleep.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Pei Qianhao had already arrived at the foot of the mountain, and found that the hoof tracks had disappeared.</p>
