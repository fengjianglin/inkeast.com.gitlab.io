<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>The pain had already clouded Su Xi-er’s mind. She didn’t know what was wrong, and she couldn’t even hear Yun Ruofeng well at this point.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng instructed his men, “Set off immediately for the closest county city and look for a physician secretly when we arrive. Forget about that girl!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This subordinate obeys the order.” The carriage then sped off without further delay.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The unwell Su Xi-er threw a wrench into Yun Ruofeng’s plans. He had no choice but to slow down, and they would no longer be arriving at the Beimin-Xiliu border as quickly as he had planned.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They arrived in the county city early the next morning, and Yun Ruofeng quickly selected an obscure inn before inviting a physician to come and check on Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The physician surmised that the patient was likely someone rich or from nobility when he saw the two men standing guard outside the inn. Not wanting to appear disrespectful in any way, he entered quickly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He took out a silk handkerchief and placed it over Su Xi-er’s wrist to take her pulse.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The physician’s expression of concern was replaced by one of joy after a while. “She’s already one month pregnant. She just got too excited, which caused the pain in her stomach. I’ll bring a prescription, and she will recover soon.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng stiffened at what the physician said before glancing at Su Xi-er’s stomach. <em>There’s a child in there, one belonging to Su Xi-er and Pei Qianhao.&nbsp;</em>Yun Ruofeng’s face darkened at the thought as jealousy filled him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The physician was confused at his reaction. <em>Why is this man unhappy about the pregnancy? Could it be because the baby isn’t his?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The physician couldn’t help but feel a little anxious when the thought crossed his mind, wondering to himself, <em>Should I prescribe something to stabilise the pregnancy, or something to abort the baby?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“We’re in a rush, and don’t have time to wait for medicine to brew. Give us a prescription which can be taken conveniently that can stabilise the pregnancy.” Yun Ruofeng then waved a hand to dismiss him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The physician stood up and bowed. “I’ll write up a prescription for that right away.” He then exited the room nervously.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Right now, Su Xi-er was sleeping rather peacefully on the bed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng stared at her stomach as he sat at the edge of the bed. <em>Lan-er, you’re carrying his child! Considering you’ve been married for quite a while now, that’s not too surprising though.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The idea of asking for a medication to abort the pregnancy had crossed his mind, since he hated the thought of her carrying someone else’s child!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, he realised the baby belonged to her as well.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng placed a hand on her stomach above the blanket and said, “You say I’m selfish, but if that was really the case, I wouldn’t have let you keep the baby. I’ll conquer the world, and you’ll just have to stay behind me. There’s no need for you to go onto the battlefields this time. Be my woman, and I’ll let you have everything. I’d even treat this child as my own.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng gave a bitter smile. <em>She had called me despicable, and that I am only using her as an excuse to take over the world. What she doesn’t understand is that it’s actually the reverse; obtaining power is only a means to an end. I want her back from Pei Qianhao, and to do that, I need more power!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Lan-er, no matter what you think of me, I won’t give you up this time. You’re only allowed to be my woman, the woman belonging to the ruler of the world!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng’s eyes glinted. <em>Pei Qianhao, the fight has just begun.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng felt Su Xi-er move, and turned to see a pair of eyes staring cautiously at him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Feeling better?” Yun Ruofeng asked gently, reaching under the blanket in an attempt to take her hand in his. Su Xi-er, however, did not allow him to.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Did you capture Liu Yinyin again?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng scoffed. “I let her go. A little girl like her isn’t worth my time. There are still two other hostages anyway.”</p>
