 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>"This way, please." Wei Guang quickly recovered before gesturing towards the entrance, deferentially inviting her in.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The two servants understood immediately - the woman before them was no commoner! Although they didn't manage to get a clear look at what was written on the waist tablet, they were able to see that it was made out of gold. There were only two kinds of people who would use a waist tablet made out of gold: high ranked court ministers, and members of the imperial household.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Who is this woman?</em> As the servants continue to wonder, Ning Anlian entered the Wei Residence.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the Wei Residence' main hall, Wei Guang dismissed all the servants and closed the hall doors. He then bowed and greeted Ning Anlian. "This peasant pays his respects to the Eldest Imperial Princess."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He was filled with doubts. <em>The celebrations for the second day of the state banquet are held at the Water Caltrop River. Why is the Eldest Imperial Princess here instead? And to talk about my daughters’ death at that...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With a wave of her hand, Ning Anlian gestured for him to rise. "Landlord Wei, this Princess shall not beat around the bush. You must know by now that the woman who taught the two Wei Miss' a lesson on the streets that day is the maidservant of Prince Hao, don't you?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wei Guang’s servants had only informed him about this today, surprising him a great deal. When he had initially heard about his daughters being taught a lesson in the streets, he had waved it off. He knew that they had been spoiled from birth, and had bad tempers as a result.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But not long after, his daughters were found dead at Fortune Apricot House with no explanation.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He had always had his suspicions, but when he found out that the one who had taught his daughters a lesson was someone under Prince Hao...&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Meeting with the Eldest Imperial Princess had only served to confirm this information.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Landlord Wei, you won’t be able to investigate someone like Prince Hao with your status, but things will be different if this Princess helps you."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wei Guang's eyes widened. "Eldest Imperial Princess, you are really willing to help this peasant? This peasant only wants to bring the real murderer to justice."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Why would I be unwilling? The murderer should bear the consequences instead of finding two scapegoats.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wei Guang's eyes lit up. "Do you also feel that the manager and waiter of Fortune Apricot House are merely scapegoats, Eldest Imperial Princess?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Of course. Fortune Apricot House is the number one teahouse in Nanzhao. The manager's annual wages must have been substantial, giving him little motivation to try to blackmail the Wei Family. Not to mention, with your experience in business for many years, you are known for being perceptive, Landlord Wei. Of course, this Princess also has my own reasons for sticking my nose into this, but you don’t need to know them. You only need to heed this Princess’ orders."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wei Guang nodded before he bowed deferentially once again. "This peasant shall follow your orders accordingly, Eldest Imperial Princess."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Great. The ingredients for the banquet beside the Water Caltrop River are all from the Wei Family's farmstead, aren't they?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yes. Eldest Imperial Princess. Please feel free to give your orders."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"This Princess shall head towards the Water Caltrop River by riding the Wei Family’s horse carriage tonight."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wei Guang was stunned, and felt that things were progressing strangely. <em>The</em> <em>Eldest Imperial Princess of the nation ought to be at the Water Caltrop River. Why is there a need for her to sneak in?&nbsp;</em>There were several question marks in his head, but Ning Anlian had already made it clear that she had a hidden agenda.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>If someone bothered to even try to think about it, it was clear that there was no benefit for Ning Anlian to meddle in this matter. However, she was clearly determined to see it through! If that was the case...</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Landlord Wei, this Princess wants you to point out that Prince Hao's maidservant is associated with your daughters' death at the banquet tonight!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Eldest Imperial Princess, this peasant's daughters were only taught a lesson by Prince Hao's maidservant. Is that her motive for murder?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Eldest Imperial Princess sneered. "Not long after she taught them a lesson, your two daughters were found dead at Fortune Apricot House. Moreover, ever since she appeared, everybody has been comparing her with this Princess. I am the Eldest Imperial Princess, but who is she? Just a maidservant! How can she even begin to compare to this Princess?!”</p>

 <p>Wei Guang nodded before he bowed deferentially once again. "This peasant shall follow your orders accordingly, Eldest Imperial Princess."</p>
 <p><strong>Lunarlark:&nbsp;</strong>You know I kinda feel bad for this guy. He just loved his daughters a little too much, and now he's about to get rekt</p>

 <p><strong>Lunarlark:&nbsp;</strong>"You don't need to know about my motivations!"</p>
