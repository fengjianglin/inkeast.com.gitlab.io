 <p>She immediately dashed over. “Younger Cousin, are you alright?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing the open panic on Su Miao’s face, Su Xi-er took a step back and let go of Pei Qianhao before walking over to calm her down. “I’m fine, you don’t have to worry.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Younger Cousin, did you already expect that something would happen? Was that why you purposely told me to alight the carriage and pick the flowers?” By the time she finished speaking, tears were already pouring down her face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I didn’t have any suspicions at all; I simply alighted the carriage as I was told. If I had known about Younger Cousin’s intentions, I definitely wouldn’t have abandoned her.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>When we were young, I had once let go of Younger Cousin’s hand, causing her to be disappointed and run away from the village in the end. How could I have let this happen again?!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing how overwhelmed with emotions Su Miao was, Su Xi-er grabbed her hand. “I’m fine. Elder Cousin, after roaming around outside for many years, I am no longer as weak as I was before. I don’t care about the matters of the past anymore.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Miao sobbed as she nodded. “Mom would be elated if she knew that you thought that way. Although she hasn’t said anything for years, I know that she regrets leaving you in the lurch after Second Aunt died back then.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er released her hand and looked at Pei Qianhao. “I should thank your mother. If she hadn’t let go of me back then, I wouldn’t have met A-Jing.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“A-Jing?” Su Miao repeated before following Su Xi-er’s gaze to look at Pei Qianhao. <em>A-Jing is Prince Hao’s pet name.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>How could I have accidentally called Prince Hao’s pet name?!&nbsp;</em>Su Miao immediately shook her head. “Prince Hao, I accidentally called your name. Please don’t blame me.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“How could this Prince blame you when you’re the Princess Consort’s elder cousin?” Pei Qianhao’s voice was calm as he turned to order the two guards. “One of you, tidy this area up; the other will head for Willow Village.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The two guards bowed. “This subordinate obeys the order.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The guards from the Prince Hao Residence that had laid in wait to counter-ambush Xie Yun’s subordinates had already finished cleaning up the bodies of the assailants. It wasn’t long before Wu Ling stepped out from the woods. “Reporting to Prince Hao, everything has already been settled. Commandery Prince Xie fell into the poisonous plant undergrowth, and is trying to find a way to escape.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao waved his hand. “Let him stay there. Return to the capital and have Yuchi Mo come bring the Commandery Prince back. Summon Imperial Physician Zhao to treat him.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This subordinate obeys the order.” Wu Ling bowed before taking a group of guards with him and leaving.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Admiration emerged in Su Miao’s eyes. <em>Younger Cousin has become much stronger than she was after leaving the village, and her husband is impressive as well! However, the ‘Commandery Prince’ they mentioned is Commandery Prince Xie? Wasn’t he...the gentle man from the other day?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Why does Prince Hao want to deal with him? Isn’t he a good person?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er could discern the bewilderment in Su Miao’s eyes, so she patted her shoulders. “Never judge a book by its cover. Sometimes, what you see with your eyes may not be the truth; you have to use your heart to feel.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Miao stared at her in a daze. <em>Commandery Prince Xie is a bad person? He was a good person from what I could see, but I definitely had my doubts hidden in my heart. Doesn’t that mean that he had an ulterior motive when he came to inform me to look for Younger Cousin?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“A-Jing, the group of guards Commandery Prince Xie brought this time are all a bunch of idiots; it makes him appear foolish.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao raised his hand to tuck some loose strands of hair behind her ears. “The most crafty person in Beimin is only a fool in your eyes. You really have very high standards.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’m simply stating the truth. His methods are so clumsy this time that they don’t match up with him at all. Even Elder Cousin suspected something.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Miao was astonished once again. <em>I didn’t even say anything, yet Younger Cousin could guess what I was thinking? How on earth did she do that?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Let’s go, Elder Cousin, to Willow Village.” Su Xi-er smiled at Su Miao before walking to the horse carriage.</p>
