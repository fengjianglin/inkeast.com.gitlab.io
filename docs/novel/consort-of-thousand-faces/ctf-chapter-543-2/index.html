<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Du Rin stared at him wide-eyed. “I don’t; in fact, Third Imperial Prince, you should kill him as soon as possible. If not, his appearance will mess up our plans.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Women are all like this. The more you love someone, the greater your hatred is towards them. You don’t have to worry; he will die.” Situ Li spoke without emotion before instructing his guards to secretly escort Du Rin out.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As Du Rin glanced outside the curtains of the horse carriage as it passed by the Prince Hao Residence, she happened to see Pei Qianhao and Su Xi-er locked in a tight embrace at the entrance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Jealousy flooded her. I have struggled and fought an uphill battle just so that I can even begin to take her revenge. Meanwhile, Su Xi-er sits in her ivory tower with the world at her beck and call. Her voice resounded in Du Rin’s mind, <em>Who are you to challenge me?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Du Rin felt uneasy even after the carriage had long passed the Prince Hao Residence.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>What she didn’t know was that Pei Qianhao had watched the carriage pass with a glint in his eye. There were rarely any horse carriages that would pass by at this hour, and it seemed to be too much of a coincidence that this particular carriage had to pass by the entrance of his residence.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The same thought passed through Su Xi-er’s mind as she spotted the same carriage. <em>Though Du Rin has been acting rather sneakily lately, she hasn’t made any major moves.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“A-Jing, nothing would happen to the Western Region King on his way here, right?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao hugged her tight as they walked into the residence. “You think Du Ling is an easy opponent?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’m not very familiar with the Western Region, and that includes their king. A-Jing, could you tell me more about Du Ling?” Su Xi-er’s tone was inquisitive, and an expectant look appeared in her eyes. Now that she had decided to reclaim her identity, Du Ling would be her brother.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She had a younger brother from her past life, but now she had an older brother as well. She had always wished for an older brother in the past; for someone to dote on her when she was younger.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao was a little upset when he saw her being so interested in another man.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“A-Jing, stop being jealous. This is serious.” Su Xi-er stood on her toes and gave him a peck on the lips.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The guards who happened to see it while they were passing by quickened their steps to vacate the area.<em>&nbsp;Prince Hao and the Princess Consort are being lovey-dovey now, I’d better retreat!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao caressed her head. “Among women, I respect you the most, while among men, he holds a similar position. Does that tell you what you want to know?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Earning Pei Qianhao’s praise was hard enough, let alone gaining his respect.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“So you hold him in very high regard. I’d have reclaimed my identity sooner if you had told me.” Su Xi-er smiled mischievously with a playful glint in her eye.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“ Xi-er, with the civil unrest in Dongling, the rapid development of the Western Region in recent years has already put them far ahead of the former. Not only that, they’ve even started to catch up to Xiliu in strength, and are a very real threat to the four nations in the Central Plains. However...” Pei Qianhao tapped her on the nose playfully before he continued. “This Prince is not afraid of him. Even if ten Du Ling’s appeared, he’d be no match for me.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This was a classic part of Pei Qianhao’s personality - extraordinary confidence, and unbridled arrogance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er then smacked him gently and asked, “A-Jing, are you afraid of me then?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What do you think?” Pei Qianhao narrowed his eyes as a dangerous glint flashed in them.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er shook her head. “How would I know?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince will tell you then.” Pei Qianhao whispered into her ear, “This Prince is afraid that you’ll bar me from the bed if you happen to be unhappy someday. That is what I’m most scared of.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You- shameless!” Su Xi-er pushed him away as she glanced at him shyly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>He would still climb into my bed even if I refused him. It had been extremely tiring for me in the few days after he returned from the army barracks.</em></p>
