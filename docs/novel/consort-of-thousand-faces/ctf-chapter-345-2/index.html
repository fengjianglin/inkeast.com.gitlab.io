<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Just as she did so, Pei Zheng came out of the main hall and discovered her. “Anru, go and rest. As for your face, I will invite the best physician to treat you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Anru didn’t reply, simply nodding obediently before turning and heading back to her own room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Zheng continued standing ramrod straight in the courtyard as he looked up at the moon and sighed to himself. <em>To think that the Pei Family’s main branch would have no sons in my generation. Even my adopted son, Pei Qianhao, is getting more and more out of control.</em></p>
 <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Pei Zheng felt a headache coming as soon as he thought of Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Pei Qianhao was in the Prince Hao Residence’s main courtyard.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er knew it was him once she heard his footsteps. After smelling alcohol on him, she furrowed her brows. “You drank again?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Mmm, a few mouthfuls.” Pei Qianhao reached out his hands to hug Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, you should drink less. Drinking wine can cause people to make a botch of things.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince will take note of this from now on.” Pei Qianhao was in a good mood today, making him willing to acquiesce to her every request.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, this servant doesn’t have a maiden family. From where should I leave for the marriage?”<span id="footnote-ref-c888"><a href="#footnote-c888">[1]</a></span></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince has already made arrangements. Don’t worry, it must naturally be a glorious sight when this Prince marries a wife. You will know when the time comes.” Pei Qianhao patted her back in reassurance. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You want to give this servant a surprise?” Su Xi-er smiled, her eyes glittering like stars in the night sky.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The scenic night atmosphere was getting to him. Although he had been drinking, Pei Qianhao felt like it was his soul that was being intoxicated as he silently stared at Su Xi-er’s face.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er found the smell of alcohol increasingly pronounced and chided, “Prince Hao, you definitely drank a lot, not just a little.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The corners of Pei Qianhao’s mouth were curved up. “I can’t hide it from your nose. This Prince was in a good mood today and drank a few cups with my group of brothers in the army barracks.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not only had he met Xie Liuli today, he had also handled the matter between Ye Qingzhu and Wu Ling. He was happy enough to drink a few cups with the Minister of War after settling these matters.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant will help you into the room to rest.” Su Xi-er pulled his hand to lead him to the main room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Feeling the warmth in his hands, Pei Qianhao gazed at Su Xi-er’s side. <em>I haven’t married her yet, but she already looks a little like a virtuous wife and good mother.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao smiled to himself at this thought. His intoxicated state of mind made him almost more charming than usual.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er supported Pei Qianhao to the side of the bed before helping him remove his shoes and outer clothes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just as she went to cover him with the quilt, Pei Qianhao’s hand suddenly grasped hers. “Su Xi-er, although your parents are dead, you still have other relatives in this world.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She understood what he meant. <em>On the day of the wedding, we still have to invite people from my maiden family. But the only person left in my maiden family is Lianchen.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er daringly asked, “Prince Hao, do you know who this servant is?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao laughed, his hands caressing her face. “Of course I know; you are Su Xi-er.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“No, I am not Su Xi-er. This servant’s maiden family is from Nanzhao.” After she finished speaking, Su Xi-er realised that Pei Qianhao was already asleep.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>He has been extremely busy because of me.&nbsp;</em>Su Xi-er reached out her hand to gently massage his hands.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Pei Qianhao, I am Ning Rulan. You once said that you would never marry someone like me, but do you still think the same way? If you find out who I am, will you still marry me? Should I tell you?” Su Xi-er’s voice was soft, to the point that one would barely be able to hear it over the shifting of fabric as she pulled the quilt over Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Once she finished, Su Xi-er prepared to leave, but suddenly felt her hand being grasped. When she turned around, however, Pei Qianhao’s eyes were still shut, though he was mumbling in his sleep. “Stay further away from Nanzhao’s little Emperor and Yun Ruofeng. No one can snatch you away from this Prince.”</p>
