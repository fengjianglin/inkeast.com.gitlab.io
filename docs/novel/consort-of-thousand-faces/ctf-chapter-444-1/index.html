<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>The corners of Pei Qianhao’s mouth rose, and he arrogantly remarked in his low voice. “He won’t be able to wrestle his reputation back. If he knew about your true identity, he wouldn’t dare to offend you even if he had a hundred times the guts.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Rulan’s reputation had been widely known among the four nations, not losing out to Pei Qianhao’s. Despite the controversy around her relationship problems, nearly everyone agreed that every other aspect of her was what a woman should aspire to be. Protecting her country, settling matters with foreign tribes, and bringing peace and stability to the people with her strong governing ability.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“That was in the past; I am now your Su Xi-er.” She smiled. She then walked to him and caressed his eyes. “You said that you only want me to be your Xi-er in this life. I don’t make promises easily, but if I do, they will be for a lifetime.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao grabbed her hand. “We have already agreed that I will only touch you twice per day, but you should understand that it’s very hard for me to resist you when you tempt me like this.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Who’s tempting you?” Su Xi-er pulled her hand away. <em>I said some sweet words to me because I wanted to be nice, yet he said that I was deliberately tempting him.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Mei Jinxiu’s voice sounded. “Princess Consort, I have a request.” Only after she spoke did she realise that Pei Qianhao was also present.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Thus, she could only soften her demeanour and bow. “This peasant woman pays her respects to Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er turned around and looked at Mei Jinxiu. “You may dispense with the formalities when there are no outsiders around. What’s the matter?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mei Jinxiu replied, “Many of the other physicians in the capital have blocked the entrance to my medical clinic because they were upset that I was offering consultations at a low price. They say that if I don’t raise my prices, they won’t allow me to continue practising. However, even if Beimin is prosperous, there is no way that everyone can be rich. This is especially the case for some of the old uncles who have been left destitute after their sons passed away, and don’t have the money to seek treatment.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er replied, “Leave this matter to me. You are doing a good deed by saving people with your medical skills. I don’t believe that anyone would dare to block the entrance of your medical clinic!” She immediately headed out of the main hall.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After taking just a few steps, she swiftly turned around to tell Pei Qianhao, “Don’t involve yourself in this. I also won’t use my status as Princess Consort Hao to oppress them.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Without waiting for Pei Qianhao’s reply, Su Xi-er had already left, her strong determination clearly discernible. Mei Jinxiu quickly jumped to her senses and followed along.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao was taciturn. <em>Many people, including me, are unable to avoid using their status as a means to oppress others. My princess consort is always impressing me in new ways.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>This is not about being powerful and strong-headed, but being outstanding. Some men couldn’t defeat her, which was why they used words such as ‘strong-headed’ to gloss over her merits.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>While Su Xi-er had just exited the main entrance, Wu Ling happened to rush back and arrived at the main hall.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, this subordinate secretly sent some soldiers to search, and while they couldn’t find Prince Yun’s body at the bottom of the cliff, they did discover Prince Yun’s torn clothes alongside a pile of bones. He must have been torn apart by wild beasts and devoured by them, leaving him without an intact corpse.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao nodded. “Only if he’s dead will everything be peaceful. Have you dealt with those bones yet?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This subordinate has already ordered someone to bury them without leaving a trace.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Well done. Call back all the soldiers; we’ll leave Prince Yun’s matter at this.” Pei Qianhao waved his hand and instructed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling bowed. “This subordinate obeys the order.” He then turned to leave.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He had only taken a few steps when he heard Pei Qianhao’s voice. “This Prince has assigned Ye Qingzhu to work in the Consort Dowager’s palace. As for when she’ll be able to come back out, I’ll leave that decision to you. Only when you personally take her out can she leave the palace.”</p>

 <p>Haha I like how Prince Hao doesn't decide everything for his subordinates, and he even helps them out discreetly XD</p>
 <p>Wu Ling is in a tough position though ;_;</p>
