 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>Ning Lianchen put down his raised hand and looked at Yun Ruofeng. “Prince Yun, there are many scholars who are submitting this letter. You should give an explanation for Grand Tutor Liu’s death, and for your actions against the Literary Association.” His voice was resounding and full of authority, completely showing off the deportment of an emperor.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The dignitaries from other countries all looked at Yun Ruofeng. Even the usually drama-loving Chu Linglong couldn’t help but become serious.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao was the only person who looked towards the crowd at the riverside; more specifically, he was looking at Guan Xiang. <em>This man is the manager of the Literary Association, and seems a bit old-fashioned. Someone like him is usually inflexible, so I find it hard to believe that he was the one who came up with the idea of confronting Prince Yun.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao then turned his gaze towards a young man who had a wine pot at his waist. <em>This man is interesting. He has a lot of muscles on his arms, and it seems like he often climbs trees or slopes. He must be very agile, and may even be good at reconnaissance.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao continued to look through the crowd, his gaze pausing when he spotted a figure in a cyan dress. <em>This figure looks familiar. Su Xi-er?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He tried to get a closer look, but the woman seemed to know his intentions, purposely having her back turned so that Pei Qianhao couldn’t see her face.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao chuckled to himself, and the corner of his mouth raised slightly. <em>It is Su Xi-er. I gave her two days’ time, but here she is by the Water Caltrop River after just one night.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>The scholars are here to crusade against Prince Yun, but what is Su Xi-er doing in the crowd? She said that she was going to the Liu Residence yesterday; could it be that she is here for the same reason?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Pei Qianhao felt that Su Xi-er was meddling too much. <em>The scholars are causing a wave in the literary world submitting their letter to the emperor, but it also affects Yun Ruofeng’s power. Su Xi-er doesn’t have the reason or right to meddle in another nation’s matters.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, the indifferent voice of Yun Ruofeng could be heard as he slowly took a blood-written letter out from his sleeve. “This blood-written letter is evidence that Grand Tutor Liu had committed treason by handing over information from our country. He was killed because he betrayed Nanzhao. This Prince had originally wanted to protect Grand Tutor Liu’s reputation, and keep this a secret. However, since the Literary Association does not want to let this matter rest, this Prince will let everyone understand the situation.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After that, Yun Ruofeng waved his hand and instructed Wei Mohai to pass the blood-written letter to Guan Xiang.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wei Mohai obeyed the order and came up the stairs of the Dragon Boat, taking the blood-written letter before returning to the riverside.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Guan Xiang’s body trembled. <em>Prince Yun even prepared a blood-written letter to frame Grand Tutor Liu! I know exactly what kind of person Grand Tutor Liu is, and there is no way that he would betray Nanzhao!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er knew that Yun Ruofeng had prepared something. Having been ready in advance, she gave Yu Xiao a glance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yu Xiao understood and secretly left the crowd, not realising that Pei Qianhao’s eyes were closely following his figure as he stepped away.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, Yun Ruofeng commanded, “Take that so-called evidence from Guan Xiang’s hand and let this Prince have a look at it.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Lianchen replied. “Prince Yun, with so many dignitaries from different countries around, where’s your respect for this Emperor? It shouldn’t be solely up to you to decide how to investigate Grand Tutor Liu’s case.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng smiled faintly. “Grand Tutor Liu had taught you for many years, and you respect your teacher greatly. This Prince is worried that you will be biased, so it’s best if Your Majesty doesn’t interfere with this.”</p>
