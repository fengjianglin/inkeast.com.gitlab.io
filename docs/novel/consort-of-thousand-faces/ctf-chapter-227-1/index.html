 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>"Prince Hao, we are still outside." Su Xi-er tried to remind him as she lifted her head to look at his face. She was still slightly alarmed that she hadn’t pushed him away.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She was supposed to be repulsed by men, but she hadn’t rejected his advances just now.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A smile appeared in the recesses of Pei Qianhao's eyes. "Are you shy? Fine, let's board the ship." He then dragged Su Xi-er forward, his warm and broad hands holding onto hers, unwilling to let go.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao felt that holding her hand came naturally. She belonged to him, and as such, nobody could object to him holding her hand.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just like that, the two walked to the side of Water Caltrop River. The palace's imperial guards couldn’t help but stare with wide eyes at the sight. <em>Prince Hao dotes on this maidservant in the red dress, and from the looks of it, she isn't just a mere Room Concubine Servant.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As Prince Hao approached them, the imperial guards kept their surprised expressions and bowed deferentially. "Prince Yun is on the ship on the left, and would like to invite Prince Hao over for tea."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao rejected with a wave of his hand. "This Prince is feeling tired today and shall not head to where Prince Yun is. Moreover, this Prince doesn't like drinking tea. Where is the boat that this Prince will be resting in?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard lifted his hand and pointed at a ship on the right side. "Prince Yun has instructed that you can abstain if you are feeling tired. The rightmost ship is for your use, Prince Hao."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The entire exquisite royal ship was prepared specifically to house Pei Qianhao. One could see the various palace maids and eunuchs deferentially standing onboard the ship from the shore.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao nodded before taking Su Xi-er up the ship.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The palace maids and eunuchs greeted in succession, "Paying respects to Prince Hao."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"All of you, head to the other end of the ship. No one is allowed to disturb this Prince while I am resting." Pei Qianhao then looked at Su Xi-er, his eyes filled with ambiguity. "Follow after this Prince." He said before walking towards the ship's private rooms.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There were a few private rooms on the ship, each decorated differently - Nanzhao's style, Beimin's style, and even one in a foreign style.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao expressed his satisfaction; <em>at least Yun Ruofeng has been thoughtful about this.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the end, he chose a room decorated in Beimin's style. <em>The room gives off the vibes of being in Beimin, also serving as an indirect reminder to Su Xi-er to not flirt with Nanzhao's little emperor. She's a citizen of Beimin, and will soon return with this Prince. She can’t have any lingering feelings for Nanzhao.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er followed after Pei Qianhao and entered the room. After closing the doors, she approached him to help him take off his outer garments.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Not bad, at least she’s more self-aware now.&nbsp;</em>Pei Qianhao's narrowed his eyes slightly as he watched Su Xi-er take off his outer garments.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Prince Hao, you can go ahead and sleep. This servant shall stand by the side."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Stand?" Pei Qianhao's voice rose, "Have you forgotten what you promised this Prince today?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"It is daytime, and this servant clearly promised ‘at night.’" Su Xi-er's hands continued to remove his outer robes before hanging them on a rack by the side.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"This Prince said that I will have the favour repaid with bonus. So instead of once, it shall be twice - once in the day, and once in the night." Without waiting for Su Xi-er's response, Pei Qianhao took off his outer pants and laid on the bed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He was laid on his side with one hand propping his head up, his long eyelashes casting a shadow over his eyes. A sudden devilish allure exuded from him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He looked at Su Xi-er, "Remove your outer garments and come here." His voice was low, his words clearly enunciated and irresistible.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er pursed her lips. ‘<em>Favour repaid with bonus’, he did say that.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing that she made no response, he repeated himself, "Come here." His voice went a notch lower, an indication that he was losing patience.</p>
