 <p>Shui Yinglian trembled so violently that the wooden basin fell onto the ground, causing a deafening <em>clang&nbsp;</em>in the previously silent night<em>.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shui Yinglian immediately prostrated on the ground and begged in a quivering voice, ignoring the icy water seeping into her hair. “Prince Hao, please forgive me…” Her voice faltered.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao looked at the uncontrollably shaking Shui Yinglian and compared her to Su Xi-er. <em>While other women beg for forgiveness after committing a crime, she...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s gaze became even more ice-cold. “Since you like to lie prone on the ground, it would be good for you to do so until noon tomorrow.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shui Yinglian immediately replied, “This humble woman obeys the order.” She then pressed her body even closer to the floor to the point that her whole face was leaning against the floor, causing her fair face to be sullied by the dust on the ground.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Disregarding the fact that Shui Yinglian’s clothing was soaked, the cold temperatures in the dead of night were already enough to guarantee she would fall ill if she was forced to lay there until noon. <em>If I didn’t know her mother’s relationship with Mother Empress, I could still allow myself to watch on unfeelingly. However, she is still of Nanzhao’s blood.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hence, Su Xi-er raised her head. “Prince Hao, why must someone of your station make things difficult for a weak woman? Since she dropped the wooden basin because she was afraid, this servant hopes that you can be benevolent and let her off, Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>After all this time, she is only interceding for the sake of another woman.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s eyes were filled with coldness. “This prince doesn’t know what ‘benevolence’ is. That word is unrelated to this prince.” He then turned around and prepared to leave.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before he could make it far however, the hem of his clothes was firmly pulled by a small hand as a woman’s soft voice sounded. “Prince Hao, let her off. This servant was the root of the matter.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao lowered his head and looked down at her, seeing that her face was filled with sincerity. “Didn’t you have the intention to play a prank on her? What, are you regretting it now?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Shui Yinglian heard the words ‘playing a prank’, her trembling body shook even more violently. <em>That woman is quite nice. She doesn’t have an interest in Prince Hao either, so how could it be possible for her to play a trick on me?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, you have misunderstood. This servant didn’t play a prank on her.” Su Xi-er simply saw the yearning in Shui Yinglian’s eyes and only did that because she was annoyed by her constant pestering.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Besides, Pei Qianhao treated me in such a manner. It’s inevitable that I would want to play a prank on him.&nbsp;</em>To put it bluntly, the person Su Xi-er really wanted to ‘play a prank’ on was Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“If that’s the case, you weren’t playing a prank on her, but this prince instead?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His frigid tone echoed in the night, causing the still shivering Shui Yinglian to once again give a small jolt.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Since she had already come so far, Su Xi-er decided to simply steel her heart. “Prince Hao, since you are already clear on this fact, this servant won’t say anything more. You can punish this servant.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shui Yinglian’s eyes instantly widened, momentarily forgetting about Pei Qianhao as she raised her head to stare at Su Xi-er in astonishment. <em>She actually admitted to pranking Prince Hao! Based on how dangerous Prince Hao is, he will definitely not spare Su Xi-er.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You admitted so readily that you played a prank on this prince. Do you understand what the price is?” Pei Qianhao flung the hem of his sleeves, breaking free of her hand that clutched it.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Of course I understand,” Su Xi-er enunciated.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao crouched down and looked at her at eye level with a devilish face. “As you wish, I will punish you and not her.” He then stood up and waved his hand at Shui Yinglian, instructing, “Withdraw.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shui Yinglian wanted to say something, but was so frightened by the cold glance Pei Qianhao shot at her that she no longer dared to voice anything.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In the end, she could only shoot a flustered glance at Su Xi-er before immediately fleeing down whatever path she could. <em>Perhaps only a personal maidservant can deal with Prince Hao’s unyielding aura.</em></p>
