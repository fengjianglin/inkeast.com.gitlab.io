<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>“Prince Hao, we have to go after him!” The subordinates from Nanzhao yelled collectively. <em>We can’t let Prince Yun go just like that! He might have something else up his sleeves!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao waved a hand and said, “There’s no need to. We’ll get rid of him and all his men next time.” He then entered the bamboo house.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He spotted Su Xi-er laying on a bench inside the warm bamboo house. She was covered with a thin blanket as he made his way over to caress her face.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pouring himself a cup of tea, Feng Xiao said, “Princess Consort Hao is asleep. She’ll need to rest for a few more hours and take some medicine before she recovers her strength.” Feng Xiao knew that Su Xi-er had a cold constitution after taking her pulse earlier.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao walked up to Feng Xiao with slight caution in his eyes. “A Nanzhao citizen who’s been living in Beimin secretly. You seem to be skilled in medicine, and also know Yun Ruofeng and Ning Rulan. Yet, despite saving him, you don’t seem to be on his side.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Feng Xiao raised his brows upon hearing Pei Qianhao’s analysis. <em>It’s no surprise that the Eldest Imperial Princess fancies him.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, the Eldest Imperial Princess likes tea. Would you like to have a sip?” He passed a cup of tea to Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao accepted the teacup and looked at the tea inside. The leaves were large, and the tea itself was a transparent amber. Taking a sip, a pleasant bitterness spread through his mouth.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The Eldest Imperial Princess replied with three words when I served her tea in the past, and because of that, I agreed to design the floating platform.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao knew who the man was upon hearing the words ‘floating platform’. He had seen the structure when they had visited Nanzhao, and it had been obvious that the craftsman responsible had a high level of skill. He hadn’t expected that said craftsman would also have such a high level of attainments in medicine as well, nor did he think that such a person would be living in Beimin.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, tell me what you think about the tea.” Feng Xiao smiled.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao took a seat and said, “It’s not tea.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Feng Xiao laughed. “That was exactly what the Eldest Imperial Princess said to me. The both of you are meant for each other. Prince Hao, aren’t you curious why I saved Prince Yun when I’m obviously on Her Highness’ side?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I won’t make wild guesses at the intentions of an expert like yourself. You definitely have your reasons for doing so.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Feng Xiao put down his teacup and said, “Good, I’ll take care of the Princess for the next few days then. The medicine she’s been taking from the Western Region has already helped to nourish her body.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Thank you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Feng Xiao laughed again. “It’s my duty to do so, but I hope that Prince Hao can uphold your principles.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The subordinates from Nanzhao were all waiting outside the bamboo house with baited breath, only breathing a sigh of relief when Pei Qianhao emerged and told them that the Princess was fine.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Return to the capital and report back to the Commandery Prince Residence. Inform them that the Princess Consort has been found and no one was hurt. This Prince will return after three days.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This subordinate obeys the order.” The men bowed and left.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Yun Ruofeng had taken the time to escape the mountain area and meet up with his subordinates.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Yun, what do we do next?” His men asked.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng looked towards the mountain, thinking, <em>Lan-er must be with Pei Qianhao right now. My wife has been taken by someone else for too long, so I must put my other plan into action.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Go and spread a rumour amongst the people. Say that Beimin’s Princess Consort Hao is no Imperial Princess of the Western Region, but is actually Nanzhao’s previous Eldest Imperial Princess.” He then passed a note to his men.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Copy what’s on this and send several of the notes to the large temples, some of the stubborn officials in Beimin’s court, and teahouses and restaurants in the capital. Fan the flames of public fear.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Once the seeds of doubt were sown amongst the populace, it would create a huge commotion in the nation.</p>
