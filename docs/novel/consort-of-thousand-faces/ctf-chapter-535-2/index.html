 <p>“Princess Consort, Commandery Prince Xie didn’t return to his residence, but went to the posthouse instead. However, he has stayed there for a long time, with no sign of coming out. The soldiers from the Western Region said that Commandery Prince Xie is staying in the posthouse for a meal, and that they will have a horse carriage send him back.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er furrowed her brows. “Go and keep an eye on the posthouse. If Commandery Prince Xie hasn’t left by 9 pm, come back and report to me right away.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This subordinate understands.” The guard turned on his heel and swiftly left.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhen Yu had overheard their conversation from inside the room. <em>Why did Commandery Prince Xie go to the posthouse? And what is it with the Western Region soldiers?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>By the time Su Xi-er returned to the room, Zhen Yu’s expression was calm, and she didn’t ask about Xie Yun.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Princess Consort, I can’t be a freeloader here; I can do all kinds of things.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You just have to take care of your body.” Su Xi-er could guess that Zhen Yu had heard the guard’s report.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’m the daughter of a farmer’s family from head to toe; I’m not that pampered. I can do things like needlework and cleaning.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hearing Zhen Yu mention needlework, Su Xi-er came up with an idea, “I’ll ask Hong Li to send some fabric here so that you can make some clothes for your child.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhen Yu was caught by surprise, only managing to reply after a long time. “But I don’t know if it’s a boy or a girl.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Make clothes for both then. If it’s a boy, just give the girl’s clothes to me, and vice versa.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhen Yu softly replied, “Mmm, thank you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The two continued to chat while strolling around the residence until Su Xi-er sent Zhen Yu back to her room at about 6pm, making sure that Ruo Yuan knew to take good care of the latter.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not long after Su Xi-er left the side yard, she saw a guard rushing over. “Princess Consort, Prince Hao will be staying in the army barracks tonight. Please have your meal and rest on time.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>He wouldn’t avoid coming back if he could help it.</em> Su Xi-er nodded. “What’s the situation at the army barracks?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Everything’s going very well; please don’t worry, Princess Consort.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er pondered over it. <em>If everything’s fine, he would just go to the army barracks and patrol for a few hours. Why does he have to stay there overnight? No, this won’t do. I won’t be able to put my mind at rest if I don’t go to have a look myself.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prepare a horse carriage; I’m going to the army barracks.” Su Xi-er instructed and walked off.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The guard was stunned. <em>Prince Hao ordered me to not let the Princess Consort go to the army barracks.&nbsp;</em>He immediately went to chase Su Xi-er. “Princess Consort, please rest in the residence. Prince Hao will be coming back early tomorrow morning.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I will come back with him early tomorrow morning.” Su Xi-er’s firm tone brooked no opposition.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The guard still wanted to speak, but was scared speechless by Su Xi-er’s gaze. <em>I’m out of ideas; I must take the Princess Consort to the army barracks.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Soon, Su Xi-er boarded the horse carriage and headed straight for the army barracks in the suburbs.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Two hours later, the guard from the Prince Hao Residence who had been watching the entrance of the posthouse saw a horse carriage leaving. He immediately followed it and saw that the carriage entered the Commandery Prince Residence. <em>It looks like the Commandery Prince has gone back to his residence.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The guard soon turned to leave for the Prince Hao Residence.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Xie Yun was still trapped in the room in the posthouse. The horse carriage had simply been a red herring used by Du Rin.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As night fell, Du Rin left her room clad in her colourful clothes, opening the previously locked door to the room in the side yard.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Under the illumination of the bright moonlight, Xie Yun’s white gown gave off a misty feel.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Du Rin shut the door behind her and lit a candle, its light shining on Xie Yun’s handsome face that didn’t look at all devilish.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You have changed; it seems like you have really let go of things.” Du Rin spoke, but her only reply was silence.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A moment later, Du Rin took out a porcelain bottle from her sleeves, slowly opening it. “What you have done, I will have you pay for it ten-fold, starting with this pill. Take it.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With the small black medicinal pill sitting in front of him, Xie Yun’s only reaction was to quietly stare at it.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What, you’re not willing? Don’t worry, you won’t die from eating it.” Du Rin softly laughed before forcing the pill into his mouth.</p>
