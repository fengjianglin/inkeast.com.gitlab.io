 <p>“This servant doesn’t know either. An imperial guard from the Commandery Prince Residence came to inform this servant that they would be attending, so I arranged a seat for Commandery Prince Xie. May this servant know if this seating arrangement is appropriate?” <em>Perhaps the Empress Dowager knew that Commandery Prince Xie would attend tonight’s banquet, and wanted to know where he would sit.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Yaran’s slender finger pointed at the words ‘Commandery Prince Xie’. “You have done well in arranging his seat.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Emperor would be on the highest seat, while Pei Qianhao and Xie Yun would be on his right and left respectively. Immediately below them were seats for the females of the imperial family, including herself and Consort Dowager Guo. Below that were seats for Situ Li, the six ministers, and the three most powerful families of Beimin.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Yaran didn’t think that the banquet would have this many influential figures. <em>With so many people, it will be hard to find a place for Pei Anru.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Empress Dowager, tonight’s banquet is different from the ones in the past. This servant and the Minister of Rites have discussed for a long time before deciding on the seating plan. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.” Eunuch Zhang deferentially bowed again with clasped hands.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Empress Dowager’s personal maidservant, He Ying, has been sent back to the Pei Residence as she was sick; I now lack a considerate palace maid next to me. Originally, I wanted my niece to enter the palace and attend tonight’s banquet to accompany me. This Empress Dowager didn’t know that Commandery Prince Xie, Consort Dowager Guo, and the Third Imperial Prince are all attending. If that’s the case, then I can’t arrange a seat for my niece.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Eunuch Zhang hesitated after hearing that. <em>Beimin’s national rules prevent us from being extravagant and wasteful. Setting up another table and seat just for the Empress Dowager’s niece will directly go against that.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It’s fine, this Empress Dowager has another idea. You can withdraw.” Pei Yaran passed the seating plan back to Eunuch Zhang.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Eunuch Zhang took it and bowed before walking out of the main hall.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>While Pei Yaran sat on the upper seat, she called for the imperial guard outside. “Servants, come in.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The guard immediately entered the hall. “Empress Dowager, do you have any instructions?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Immediately go to the Pei Residence and bring Pei Anru to the Compassionate Peace Palace. Let her know that she doesn’t need to enter the imperial palace with Lord Pei.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This subordinate obeys the order.” The guard immediately walked out of the Compassionate Peace Palace.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Yaran had already decided that if she couldn’t add a seat, she would make Pei Anru serve her, just like He Ying did. <em>My seat is to Pei Qianhao’s right. Standing behind me, Pei Anru will be as close to Pei Qianhao as she can.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Pei Qianhao had brought Su Xi-er to the Prince Hao Residence with him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao instructed his guard to take Su Xi-er to the backyard of the residence.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard respectfully signalled for Su Xi-er to follow him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er followed him and entered the backyard. However, she didn’t think that she would see Ruo Yuan and Hong Li there! <em>This has all been long arranged by Pei Qianhao!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Ruo Yuan saw Su Xi-er, her eyes widened into circles. She put down the food in her hands and ran over at once. “Su Xi-er, you have finally returned! Hong Li and I were so anxious when we didn’t see you on the day that the Beauty Palace was dissolved!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er patted her hand softly. “Anxious? Why do I think that you have gained some fats?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ruo Yuan’s ears turned red after hearing that. “What? I didn’t get fat. I have lost weight; my stomach is smaller too! Isn’t that right Hong Li?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Eunuch Sun always brought us great food at the Beauty Palace, and Ruo Yuan couldn’t control her mouth. On the day the Beauty Palace was dismissed, Commander Wu brought us here and provided us good food as well. We’ve been eating much better than we did in the imperial palace. Ruo Yuan, how could you have lost weight?” Hong Li smiled with her eyes and covered her mouth as she tried to stifle a giggle.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ruo Yuan stared at her. “Rubbish, I have clearly become thinner!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>From Hong Li’s words, Su Xi-er could tell that Pei Qianhao treated them well even when she wasn’t in Beimin.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, Ruo Yuan suddenly acted mysteriously. “Su Xi-er, Prince Hao really dotes on you. Will you be following him from now on?”</p>
