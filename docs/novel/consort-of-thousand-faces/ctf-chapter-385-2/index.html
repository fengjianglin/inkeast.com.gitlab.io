 <p>“You are already 18. How can I still pick fruits and steal eggs with you?” Xie Yun’s face was wreathed in smiles as he walked to his younger sister’s side and caressed her hair.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The time you spend with me has only decreased after dad died and you became the Commandery Prince. Elder Brother, can’t you quit while you’re ahead? Don’t worry about the Pei Residence or Prince Hao. More than anything, don’t try to harm Su Xi-er.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Liuli, you don’t understand. You’ve stayed in your boudoir for so long that you don’t understand the dangers and hardships of the world outside. You treat Su Xi-er like your friend, and even want to become good sisters with her, but you don’t mean anything to her. Even worse, she’ll try to make use of you. Your Elder Brother doesn’t want to hear you mentioning her again.” Xie Yun switched to a solemn expression.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Liuli knew that he was angry and lowered her head before heading back to her own courtyard without another word.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Watching her departing figure, Xie Yun felt helpless. <em>My biological younger sister is giving me the cold shoulder because of an outsider.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Liuli, even if you don’t want to be Princess Consort Hao, this position can’t belong to Su Xi-er. Princess Consort Hao needs to be someone the Xie Family can control. That way, we can whittle away at Pei Qianhao’s power step by step.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the army barracks, Grand Tutor Kong was asking Pei Qianhao to go up to the mountains to pray after becoming unsettled from the numerous incidents in the Imperial Library.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s gaze deepened before he waved his hand. “Return to the Dragon Heaven Palace and teach His Majesty. You can rest assured.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This…” Grand Tutor Kong didn’t expect that Pei Qianhao wouldn’t agree.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince’s wedding is just around the corner. As the godfather of the future Princess Consort Hao, you play a very important role. Nothing must happen to you now.” Pei Qianhao explained himself before instructing a soldier to send Grand Tutor Kong back to the palace.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Only then did Grand Tutor Kong understand. <em>Sigh, I have become muddle-headed. I didn’t think about such things.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After Pei Qianhao had settled his matters, he immediately left the army barracks and headed back to the imperial palace. <em>I only stepped away for a moment, but someone has already made a move on Su Xi-er. It looks like some people need to be dealt with as soon as possible.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just as Pei Qianhao entered the Imperial Library, he saw Su Xi-er returning from feeding Tan Ge her medicine.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao moved forward and embraced her. “This Prince shouldn’t have left you alone. In the future, you will be wherever this Prince is.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’m fine.” Su Xi-er comforted as she combed Pei Qianhao’s windswept hair.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Tan Ge blocked an arrow for you?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Mmm, she’s kind and pure at heart, but she has been forced to this state by Commandery Prince Xie. I’m afraid that she will go insane if this goes on.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao coldly snorted. “Xie Yun is really daring. This Prince should have taught him a lesson earlier.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The time to retaliate has come, but I hope you won’t do anything to Commandery Princess Xie.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Staring at the pure look in Su Xi-er’s eyes, Pei Qianhao reassured, “Xie Liuli is truly the only person who can make Xie Yun worry, but don’t worry. This Prince isn’t as vile as to behave like Commandery Prince Xie and move against an uninvolved woman.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Of course. I wouldn’t expect anything less from you with your upright means.” Su Xi-er smiled at him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Is it still painful below?” Pei Qianhao’s gaze suddenly became solemn as it trended downwards.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>We’re in the middle of the courtyard in broad daylight. Even if there’s nobody else around, doesn’t he feel embarrassed asking this sort of question?!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He took her silence as her saying yes. “ You don’t have to take care of Tan Ge if it’s still painful. Just instructing a palace maid will do. Go back to the Dragon Heaven Palace and lie down.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’m fine, it no longer hurts.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao was sceptical. “Really?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why would I lie? It really doesn’t hurt anymore.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao was finally relieved. “That’s great then.” <em>Imperial Physician Zhao said that it’ll take at least 10 days before we can make love again. I must find time to study the medical book and also let her recuperate properly.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I was indeed too rash and rough the first time, but I am going to make the second time an unforgettable one.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Happening upon the two having an intimate moment, Yuchi Mo coughed to make his presence known. Su Xi-er immediately pushed Pei Qianhao away and stood to the side.</p>
