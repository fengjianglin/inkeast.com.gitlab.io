 <p>Pei Qianhao lowered his head, letting out a warm breath beside her ear. “Beimin used to only value military achievements in the past, but is slowly learning to value literature just as highly. Grand Tutor Kong’s position has been constantly rising due to this. As his goddaughter, your status can be considered acceptable.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, although you have arranged for this servant to have some status, the blood that flows in me…” Before she could finish her sentence, Pei Qianhao pinched her waist.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You’re not allowed to mention anything about lowly bloodlines. If they really want to go into the specifics of one’s birth, this Prince is nowhere near noble.” A cold glint flickered past his eyes before his expression returned to normal.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This servant will be going to the Imperial Garden this afternoon. Prince Hao, will you be publicly announcing that you’ll marry this servant?” Su Xi-er raised her head to look at him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The corners of Pei Qianhao’s mouth curled up as the tone of his voice went up. “Can’t wait anymore? Don’t worry, this Prince naturally has things planned.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was at this moment that someone knocked on the door, and Chao Mu’s voice sounded. “Su Xi-er, come out and have lunch. We’ll be able to go to the Imperial Garden to watch the opera performances in four hours.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er poked him. “Prince Hao, hide yourself.” She started to walk towards the door, not realising that she had said something wrong.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before she could take a single step, however, she was pulled back by Pei Qianhao. “Why does this Prince have to hide? Are you scared of being seen by others? Is this Prince not presentable?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His displeasure was made clear with his three consecutive questions.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Looking at him, Su Xi-er couldn’t help but feel like she was dealing with a child that had been left without any sweets; she could only try to coax him. “If others see you in a hut in the Imperial Kitchen, chaos will break out in the imperial palace.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Today, the imperial palace will break out in chaos sooner or later.” Pei Qianhao didn’t let go of Su Xi-er, instead embracing her even more tightly as he pushed her against the wall.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The door was knocked again, and Su Xi-er could discern the impatience in Chao Mu’s voice. <em>If I still don’t open the door, Chao Mu may just barge in with her personality.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Scared?” Pei Qianhao pressed against her, his jet-black pupils seemed to suck people’s souls in with their allure.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Not scared.” Su Xi-er shook her head and softly replied.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Since you’re not scared, what’s there to worry about if she barges in?” Pei Qianhao comforted in his deep voice as he combed her hair with his fingers.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er kept her attention on the door. “Prince Hao, you will be announcing to everyone that you will marry this servant. Even if chaos is to break out, it should be after you have made the announcement.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Su Xi-er, no one can stop this Prince from doing what I want.” But he still released her from his grasp before taking a few steps back.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“When you go to the Imperial Garden to listen to the operas this afternoon, you can relax and enjoy the show. Just return to the Imperial Library afterwards.” Pei Qianhao advised before walking towards the door.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When he opened it up, the only person there was the respectfully waiting Wu Ling. However, he immediately became frantic as he walked up to Pei Qianhao. “Prince Hao, Lord Pei and Commandery Prince Xie are already having their meals in the Imperial Garden, and the other officials have also arrived. We’re only missing you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao nodded and headed for the Imperial Garden.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After Su Xi-er left the hut, she walked towards the area where the palace maids from the Imperial Kitchen had their meals. It was in the backyard, and just a few hundred metres away.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Upon her arrival, she immediately spotted Chao Mu and Tan Ge.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chao Mu had already occupied a spot and scooped a bowl of rice for her. “Where did you go? Were you not in that small hut? I went to look for you just now, but there was no reply.”</p>
