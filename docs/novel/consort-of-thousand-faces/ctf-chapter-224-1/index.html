 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>Su Xi-er knew that Pei Qianhao would refuse when she saw the cold glint in his eyes, but she still wanted to stay.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Thus, she tugged at his sleeve like a docile little bird. “Prince Hao, this servant wants to take a look at Nanzhao’s Imperial Household Landscape Garden.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Beimin also has an Imperial Household Landscape Garden. Why must you look at Nanzhao’s?” Pei Qianhao ignored her hand that was tugging at his sleeve. <em>It’s the first time she’s tugging my sleeve, and it’s for Nanzhao’s little Emperor.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er nodded. “It’s rare for this servant to be able to come here, so I’m afraid that I won’t be able to see it in the future.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Ning Lianchen heard the words “I’m afraid I won’t be able to see it in the future”, he felt an inexplicable pain in his heart, prompting him to say, “Every nation’s landscape garden has its own unique characteristics. Prince Hao, since it’s your first time coming to Nanzhao, how about this Emperor personally guides you to admire the view?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His ‘you all’ was referring to Pei Qianhao and Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao coldly glanced at Ning Lianchen. <em>Even if we are to go have a look, I don’t want Nanzhao’s little Emperor trailing behind us. It would be fine with just Su Xi-er and me, but this little Emperor just has to be untactful enough to come between us.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng could sense Pei Qianhao’s displeasure from looking at his eyes. <em>Yet, I still can’t read his thoughts. They are buried as deep as an abyss.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing that Pei Qianhao was about to say something, Su Xi-er pulled at his sleeve again. “Prince Hao, let’s just settle with that then. It would be rude of us to reject when Nanzhao’s Emperor is being so polite.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Who says it’ll be rude?&nbsp;</em>Pei Qianhao’s gaze turned cold, but he wavered when he noticed the expectation in the recesses of Su Xi-er’s eyes. He carefully inspected Ning Lianchen. <em>Fine, stay and follow if you wish. When we admire the scenery later, Nanzhao’s little Emperor &nbsp;won’t be able to do anything with me around.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“We’ll follow your wish then. However…” Prince Hao chuckled and leaned closer to Su Xi-er, whispering to her, “Tonight, this Prince wants the favour to be repaid with bonus.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In order to stay with Ning Lianchen longer, Su Xi-er was willing to agree to anything. “Alright, as long as you don’t do anything overboard.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>That</em> was her bottom line. The most she could accept was being embraced by a man while sleeping.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ning Lianchen didn’t know what the two were talking about, but when he saw Pei Qianhao nod, rays of delight shone from his eyes. He immediately reached out his hand and made a polite gesture towards the direction of the Imperial Household Landscape Garden.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao glanced at him before walking down the viewing platform.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing that the performance on the stage was wrapping up, the guests from other nations also began to stand up and come down from the viewing platform. Since the next event would be sightseeing in the Imperial Household Landscape Garden, they naturally followed behind Ning Lianchen and Pei Qianhao who had just left. Yun Ruofeng frowned as he watched Ning Lianchen disregarding the majesty of an emperor and following behind Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hua Zirong’s expression was blank as he observed this scene, but when he saw Su Xi-er’s red figure, the expression in his eyes instantly changed. <em>This woman is very talented, and her charm bears some resemblance to Nanzhao’s previous Eldest Imperial Princess.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chu Linglong looked at Yun Ruofeng and smiled. “Prince Yun, aren’t you going to say something? His Majesty has yet to come of age and is still naive, while Prince Hao is vicious and has his own methods in dealing with people and affairs. Aren’t you afraid that something might go wrong?”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Although His Majesty has yet to come of age, he is clear about what should be done, so it’s unnecessary for this Prince to fuss over him Furthermore, being restrained for a long time isn’t a good thing. There are times when we should loosen the reins.” Yun Ruofeng’s voice was placid. <em>If Ning Rulan had loosened the reins on me, and not beat down my opinions whenever we were planning for major events...</em></p>
