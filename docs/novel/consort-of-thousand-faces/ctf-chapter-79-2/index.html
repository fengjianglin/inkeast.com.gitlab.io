<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>There was only one imperial guard on duty at the back door. Upon seeing Wu Ling, he immediately bowed and paid his respects, “Paying my respects to Commander Wu.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling waved his hand, signalling for him to rise. Then, he turned around to lift the horse carriage’s curtains open and spoke, “We’re here. It’s time to get off the carriage.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard on duty widened his eyes with a face full of curiosity. <em>Exactly what kind of person requires Wu Ling to send them here personally? And what relationship does this person have with Prince Hao? A powerful person in Beimin? Or is he Prince Hao’s good sworn brother?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not long after, a woman clad in coarse clothes descended from the horse carriage, her movements unhurried. When she raised her head, the imperial guard on duty saw her appearance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In an instant, the imperial bodyguard’s mouth dropped open, and his face was filled with incredulity.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>It’s actually a woman! Moreover, she’s very pretty! That kind of beauty...can’t be described in words. Despite being this old, I haven’t seen such a good-looking one.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling saw that the imperial guard’s eyes were staring blankly and immediately patted his shoulder. “Guard the back door properly. You mustn’t lower your guard.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With a pat from Wu Ling, the imperial guard immediately regained his senses and stood straight. “Roger, Commander Wu!” He no longer dared to look at Su Xi-er’s face. If he continued looking, he would return to staring blankly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling opened the back door. “Come with me.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er nodded and followed Wu Ling as he walked inside the County Government Office.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>On the way, Wu Ling kept advising her what areas she needed to pay attention to. “When you meet Prince Hao later, you can’t be like how you were last time and talk back. Just let things take their natural course.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er nodded lightly. <em>It’ll be whatever he says then.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling was not used to this obedient appearance and it only served to heighten his apprehension.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Finally, as they were about to reach the County Government Office’s hall, Wu Ling suddenly stopped in his tracks. “Su Xi-er, you can’t resist even if Prince Hao does something that makes you feel awkward.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er didn’t nod but looked at Wu Ling instead. <em>Do awkward actions refer to Pei Qianhao taking advantage of me? Prince Hao’s personal bodyguard really has acute observation skills.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You can just go in alone. Prince Hao knows that you will be arriving today.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er laughed. “Taking care of every matter, big or small. Imperial Bodyguard Wu, you truly deserve to be called Prince Hao’s personal bodyguard for being so loyal.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She then walked towards the County Government Office’s hall.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling naturally understood what she meant. <em>She’s saying that I advise over and over again even for trivial matters.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling couldn’t help but sigh. <em>I wasn’t like this originally. Isn’t it because...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er walked into the hall of the County Government Office step by step. At this moment, Pei Qianhao was sitting on the main seat while the County Magistrate stood beside him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The atmosphere was ominous. The County Magistrate’s whole body was trembling, while Pei Qianhao’s eyes were like deep bottomless pools, making others unable to fathom his mood.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After noticing Su Xi-er, he arched his eyebrow and set down the celadon teacup in his hand. His movements were very light, to the point that there was no noise when the teacup contacted the table.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The County Magistrate’s body shuddered again. “Prince Hao, I beseech you, please spare this subject’s daughter. This subject only has this one daughter.” The County Magistrate immediately knelt down after his speech.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao was speaking to the County Magistrate, but his gaze landed on Su Xi-er. “Nothing will happen to your daughter. Instead, how should this prince punish such an audacious woman?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The County Magistrate didn’t understand and raised his head to look at Prince Hao, following his line of sight.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When he finally noticed Su Xi-er, the County Magistrate became even more panicked. He raised his hand and pointed as his body trembled uncontrollably. “Where did you come from? The County Government doesn't have you as a maidservant!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this point, the County Magistrate’s heart shivered again as he looked at Pei Qianhao. “Prince Hao, this woman isn’t a maidservant from the County Government!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“How can the woman this prince ordered to be brought here be a maidservant in your County Government?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>An insufferably arrogant aura assailed his senses and engulfed the whole hall. It was as if the air had congealed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er bent her knees as she paid her greetings. “This servant pays her respects to Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao chuckled. “Don’t you think that you said that too late? You came in long ago.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The County Magistrate knelt at one side numbly, failing to understand the situation.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why are you still not getting lost?” Pei Qianhao’s ice-cold voice streamed into the County Magistrate’s ears.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The County Magistrate immediately stood up. “This subject will get lost now.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>It’s fine as long as he doesn’t punish my only daughter.</em></p>
