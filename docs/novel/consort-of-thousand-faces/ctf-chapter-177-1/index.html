 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>In an attempt to understand his motive, Su Xi-er directly asked, “Prince Hao, you’re already leaving after such a short time, but where are we going now?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Are you in a hurry?” Pei Qianhao looked at her. <em>Is she in such a hurry that she needs to know where we are going right now?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er shook her head. “This servant is just curious about what you want to do.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Nothing much, this Prince just came out to take a nice stroll and sightsee.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er was confused. <em>It’s the middle of the night, and there isn’t even a moon in the sky to provide light. What is there to see?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After the horse carriage had travelled for some distance, the imperial guard driving it suddenly slowed down and lifted the curtain, pointing to a road, “Prince Hao, this is the road towards the Moon Lake; it’s not far from here.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao nodded. “Go to the Moon Lake.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er didn’t understand.&nbsp;“Moon Lake will be pitch black at this time of night, and it doesn’t seem very appropriate to go there now. Prince Hao, is there something urgent you have to do there?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao looked at her teasingly. “What? Can’t this Prince go there for sightseeing?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The accompanying coldness he exuded made Su Xi-er aware that she shouldn’t continue prodding, so she simply nodded. “Prince Hao, nobody can stop you from doing as you wish, much less visiting Moon Lake to sightsee.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao glanced at her, but didn’t say anything as the cool night breeze blew through the carriage. It wasn’t long before they stopped at Moon Lake, and the respectful voice of the guard broke the silence.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, we have arrived at Moon Lake.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao lifted the curtain of the carriage before dismounting and staring at the mirror-like Moon Lake in front of him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was pitch-black, and nearly completely silent as well. Only the sound of the wind and gently splashing tide could be heard.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er couldn’t make out Pei Qianhao’s expression after she had dismounted, only able to watch his broad shoulders as he slowly approached the lake. He then squatted down and scooped up some lake water with his hands to smell it.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er walked closer, but was blocked by the imperial guard. “You can’t go over right now.” His voice was solemn. She saw that Pei Qianhao was still analysing the lake water.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Slowly, Su Xi-er grew even more certain that Pei Qianhao was greatly interested in Nanzhao’s Lingrui Flowers. <em>It’s definitely not to create fragrant powders, or for their beauty; it’s for their military use.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Although he is unpredictable, I at least understand one thing about this man after spending so much time around him: He will not waste his time on useless things.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the imperial guard saw that Su Xi-er didn’t plan to approach, he lowered his hand before turning his eyes to Pei Qianhao as well.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, Pei Qianhao’s eyes were full of seriousness. <em>The taste, smell, and colour of this lake water is similar to any lake in Beimin. If that’s the case, what’s the difference that allows Lingrui flowers to flourish in just Nanzhao?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing that Pei Qianhao remained prone by the lake, Su Xi’er’s suspicions grew until she was certain that Pei Qianhao had come to the Moon Lake especially for Lingrui. <em>Coming out to analyse the two most important factors for the Lingrui’s growth, the soil and the water, what else could he be doing? Perhaps there may actually be a successful transplant if he finds out the secret within.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When she thought of this, Su Xi-er’s expression became even more complicated.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After a long while, Pei Qianhao finally got up and glanced at Su Xi-er. He said calmly, “Come over.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Su Xi-er, go over quickly.” The imperial guard on the side immediately urged her, as if he was scared that she would disobey.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er looked at the imperial guard with a fierce glint in her eyes that made him tremble. <em>Why am I seeing Prince Hao’s shadow in Su Xi-er?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Come over.” Pei Qianhao repeated himself when he saw that Su Xi-er wasn’t coming.</p>
