 <p><em>Such audacity!</em> A dangerous glint emerged in Pei Qianhao’s eyes, but he soon stowed it away. “Go to the rear garden first. This Prince will head over in a bit.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Many thanks, Prince Hao.” Feng Changqing bowed again before turning to the rear garden.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao watched Feng Changqing’s swift departure. <em>A bold master produces bold subordinates. Feng Changqing’s character is pretty good; not only is he meticulous, he is also loyal only to Su Xi-er. This type of person reminds me of Prince Yun’s subordinate, Qin Ling.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just as Feng Changqing had arrived at the entrance of the rear garden, he heard the laughter of several women. Upon rounding the corner, he saw Ruo Yuan and Hong Li heartily laughing while Su Xi-er faintly smiled as she watched them from the side.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He could discern Su Xi-er’s good mood. <em>Ever since the Eldest Imperial Princess married Prince Hao, there has always been a smile on her face, even if it remains faint at times.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hearing some footsteps, Su Xi-er turned and spotted Feng Changqing. <em>Maybe he has something to report.&nbsp;</em>Hence, she dismissed Ruo Yuan and Hong Li by telling them to prepare some lotus seed soup.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Only after the two of them had left the rear garden did Feng Changqing speak. “Eldest Imperial Princess, Prince Hao already knows about your identity.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er nodded. “Mmm, I didn’t tell you about this matter.” <em>Even though he found out about it, I can still feel his deep and intense love for me.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“With Prince Yun dead, His Majesty only needs to stabilise the court before he can fully grasp the imperial power. Your old subordinates from Nanzhao have sent a letter asking what our next step should be.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s gaze became distant as she thought about Ning Lianchen who was far away in Nanzhao. “The old subordinates in Nanzhao should assist Lianchen with all their strength. Remember to secretly train soldiers and manage businesses.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What should we do with those who followed us to Beimin? Continue handling businesses?” Feng Changqing asked.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Even if Yun Ruofeng is dead, these subordinates still have some use. Even if things are stable now, it doesn’t mean that peace will hold forever. We mustn’t let down our guard.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This subordinate obeys the order.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing his solemn expression, Su Xi-er couldn’t help but remark, “You are already past 20, right? If there is any young lady you fancy, remember to let me know.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Feng Changqing was stunned for a moment before he quickly replied, “This subordinate is not in a rush to get married.” <em>Besides, this appearance of mine is enough to scare anyone.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yu Xiao excels in strange plants and herbs, while Mei Jinxiu has been diligently studying the Mei Family’s medical skills. With the two of them working together, I trust that your appearance can be restored.” Su Xi-er’s face was full of determination. <em>If their collaboration still can’t recover Feng Changqing’s appearance, I will think of another way.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Eldest Imperial Princess, this subordinate has troubled you. Many thanks.” Feng Changqing understood her character, and knew that she was one who wouldn’t be dissuaded once her mind was made up. However, he was also aware that his injuries were too deep for the scars on his face to fade away.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Feng Changqing, it isn’t right for you to be alone. It is my hope that my subordinate can have a family, and spend his days blissfully.” Su Xi-er enunciated every word.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao happened to hear her words as he entered the rear garden. “She’s right; you should have your own family, and spend your days blissfully.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Feng Changqing turned around and deferentially bowed. “This subordinate pays his respects to Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao waved his hand and signalled for him to get up. “Which young lady do you fancy?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This subordinate doesn’t have a woman I like. There’s no need to rush over this matter.” Feng Changqing hadn’t expected a man to ask him something like that.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er looked at Pei Qianhao. “You are almost done with the flower field, right?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The preparations for the initial stage have been completed. We just have to wait for next spring.” Pei Qianhao replied as he tucked the loose strands of hair behind her ears.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er nodded. “That’s great then. Feng Changqing, find some time to take a walk outside. Who knows if you will find a young lady you fancy?”</p>
