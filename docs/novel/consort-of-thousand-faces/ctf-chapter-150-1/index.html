 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>Su Xi-er froze for a moment, sending him a puzzled look before she eventually moved forward.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao looked at her acting cautiously and asked in disdain, “Were you sneaking glances at this Prince?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Approached by Pei Qianhao’s sudden question, Su Xi-er only answered after some time. “Prince Hao, you are a man of talents, how would this servant dare to sneak glances at you?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“In other words, that is exactly what you have done. As long as you were looking while hiding, that qualifies as sneaking glances at this Prince.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao didn’t comment further, but his eyes stayed on Su Xi-er for a substantial amount of time before they left.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The horse carriage drove for another 30 minutes or so before it reached the flower field.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Lifting the curtains, they alighted the horse carriage, and were greeted by the sight of a sea of flowers dancing in the wind.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Among the ocean of colour, one could make out the busy silhouettes of the gardeners as they completed various tasks such as weeding and adding fertilisers.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao looked far ahead and saw a particularly radiant expanse of yellow&nbsp;ー&nbsp;Lingrui flowers.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er happened to look in that direction as well. The sea of yellow flowers was like a fairyland.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Noticing her eager and hopeful eyes, Pei Qianhao spoke softly, “Let’s go.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guards stayed on the main road while Pei Qianhao and Su Xi-er entered the field.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Walking along the path that cut through the field, Su Xi-er felt very relaxed, her steps light and joyous.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It wasn’t long before the pair reached the Lingrui flower field, watching as each yellow flower fluttered the dainty skirt of a lady in the wind.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In a rare good mood, Su Xi-er practically fluttered through the large patches of Lingrui flowers with nary a care in the world.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao trailed behind as he watched Su Xi-er wander the field, unconsciously relaxing as even his breathing became more at ease.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As Su Xi-er squatted down to inspect the Lingrui flowers in detail, the joy in the recesses of her eyes was even more apparent.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s beauty was moving no matter if she smiled or not. Once she did, however, the inexplicable charm it added was enough to cause even Pei Qianhao to be unable to avert his gaze.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He followed after Su Xi-er, watching as she wandered amongst the flowers. The corners of his lips unknowingly curving up to form a smile.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er stood up, but stepped on the pile of dirt that served as a border to the field. Unable to regain her balance, her body fell backwards.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As she fell back, Su Xi-er let out a cry.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er braced herself for the inevitable impact with the ground, but didn’t expect that she would immediately find a strong arm wrapping around her waist to hold her up.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Looking up, Su Xi-er met Pei Qianhao’s slightly anxious eyes</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Surrounded by fragrant flowers, Su Xi-er froze in place as she stared at Pei Qianhao, not knowing what she should do.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You sure are careless.” Pei Qianhao’s deep and composed voice reached her ears.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her body startled slightly. Only then did she realise Pei Qianhao was holding her in an embrace and had yet to let go.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er winced as her waist was suddenly pinched. Meeting Pei Qianhao’s eyes, she struggled to get out.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But the man didn't seem to want to let her go.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Let go of me.” Su Xi-er struggled to get free, contempt showing on her face whether it was intended or not.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Don’t move.” Pei Qianhao spoke, his voice was one of arrogance that didn’t tolerate resistance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Through their robes, the two could feel each other’s breathing. Su Xi-er was a little annoyed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Let go of me quickly.” The more Su Xi-er struggled, the tighter his hand held onto her waist. Even his breathing seemed to become more laboured.</p>
