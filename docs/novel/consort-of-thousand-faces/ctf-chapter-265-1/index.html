<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Pei Qianhao decided to lie down and prop his head up with one hand as he watched Su Xi-er. His other hand remained underneath the blanket, slowly caressing Su Xi-er’s waist.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her stomach was warm because of his constant touch, and his massaging at the acupoints had her brows unfurrowed in relaxation.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao halted his actions and watched Su Xi-er’s expression. <em>She seems to be enjoying it. She is the one who’s supposed to wait on me, but now I’m the one serving her. I even have to do so delicately.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this thought, Pei Qianhao’s movements became heavier until they were basically pinching. His hands went from his waist to her thighs, then back up before he finally rested them on the soft parts of her body.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The soft sensation made the corners of his lips involuntarily raise into a smile.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, the moment the smile appeared on his face, Su Xi-er happened to open her eyes. She felt his large hands massaging a certain part of her body, and saw a certain someone smirking in satisfaction.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er glared at Pei Qianhao, not realising how ‘flirtatious’ her angry gaze was to the latter. She shook off his hands and spoke softly. “Prince Hao, please behave yourself.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao laughed, the sound crisp and clear in the otherwise quiet room. He bent down his head and leaned close to her ear, his warm breath tickling it as he spoke, “How did this Prince misbehave? Tell me in detail.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, where were your hands just now?” Su Xi-er looked at him before moving herself towards the inner side of the bed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao followed suit, not allowing her to keep a distance from him. “You seem to like it when this Prince touched you while you are asleep. Your brows even relax as if...</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this point, he deliberately paused to watch her reaction.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, which areas have you touched?” <em>Did he touch every area that he shouldn’t have while I was asleep?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince has naturally touched every area that can be touched while massaging your acupoints. What are you thinking of?” Pei Qianhao pushed the aside a lock of hair that had fallen onto her face as he spoke.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Massaging my acupoints, but touching my bosom?&nbsp;</em>Su Xi-er doubted his words but the warmth on her stomach told her that he had indeed been helping her massage her acupoints.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince has never massaged anyone; you are the first. This Prince never does things at a loss, and since I have already massaged you, don’t you think I should get something in return as well?” Pei Qianhao unabashedly expressed his mischievous intentions as he leaned closer to Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er wanted to move towards the inner side of the bed but was stopped by a large hand beside her head.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A handsome face was enlarged before her eyes, the smile on it more pronounced than ever. “Su Xi-er, this Prince has saved your life. Kiss this Prince and that can be considered repaying your debt of gratitude.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He didn’t do anything else, waiting for her to make the first move.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er looked at him. <em>He definitely won’t let this go if I don’t kiss him. However, I haven’t completely recovered, and it would be bad if I pass on my illness to him.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Su Xi-er,” Pei Qianhao murmured, his head closing the distance between them.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er could only bite the bullet and raise her hands out from the under the blanket, hooking them around his neck as she lifted her head and planted her lips on his.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Their lips met, warm and wet. Pei Qianhao put his hands behind Su Xi-er’s head, taking the lead and deepening the kiss.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He conquered her territory and lingered around, causing Su Xi-er to gasp for breath. Considering her body’s condition, Pei Qianhao let go of her after having tasted a little of her sweetness.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He leaned against the bedpost and deliberately stuck out his tongue, licking his lips seductively. “Tastes good.”</p>
