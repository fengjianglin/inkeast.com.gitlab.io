 <p>Lifting the curtains to look outside, she knew that Yun Ruofeng was unlikely to want to meet her again after what happened with Liu Yinyin. It would be difficult for her to obtain more information on Mei Jinxiu and Yu Xiao’s whereabouts for a while.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the meantime, Liu Yinyin had entered a nearby village where an elderly man was kind enough to help her out. She did not reveal much even when the old man asked who she was.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Liu Yinyin trusted Pei Qianhao and believed that he would definitely be able to catch up with them. Once he arrived in this village, she’d just have to inform his men about what happened so that they could go save Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Though Liu Yinyin was worried about how everything would turn out, she tried her best to calm herself and wait patiently for rescue.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Later that evening, a group of men led by Wu Ling entered the village and started searching. Knowing Su Xi-er, Wu Ling figured that it was possible that she had already escaped and hid herself in a village like this.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, it was Liu Yinyin who came forward faster than anybody could stop her, and began to tug on Wu Ling’s clothes. &nbsp;“Fairy Elder Sister was caught by the bad guys. Go save her!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling immediately understood that Su Xi-er was still with Yun Ruofeng, and thus turned to issue orders to his men. “Take Miss Yinyin back to the capital and take good care of her.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This subordinate obeys the order.” The guard then led Liu Yinyin away.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this, the villagers realised that Liu Yinyin was no ordinary girl. If she was being addressed as ‘Miss Yinyin’, it probably meant that she had been kidnapped from a noble family.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling then left with a group of men shortly after to continue with their search. Pei Qianhao and Du Ling were already further ahead, and they all knew that this particular route and crossing the field of grass would eventually lead to the Beimin-Xiliu border.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There was civil unrest in Xiliu right now, and their nation’s monarch, Hua Zirong, had been arrested. Meanwhile, their new leader had tried several times to challenge Beimin. Pei Qianhao’s elite men had already stationed themselves near the border where they currently lay in ambush.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao cracked the whip on his horse, getting it to speed up. Su Xi-er was in a carriage, and there was no way that her carriage could travel faster than his horse.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Yun Ruofeng was extremely familiar with the geography in the area. He had instructed his men to spread out and take different routes, and it was difficult to predict what he actually had in mind.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao grew cautious when he spotted a carriage in the distance, but pushed his horse to speed up nevertheless.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, several arrows rained down upon him out of nowhere, but Pei Qianhao managed to skillfully maneuver around them. As he continued forward, guards from the Prince Hao Residence rushed forward to engage Yun Ruofeng’s menin the nearby forest.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The horse carriage in front of Pei Qianhao was forced to stop, and he saw the injured Yu Xiao inside.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao!” Yu Xiao was rather surprised to see Pei Qianhao appear.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Someone, take him back and treat his injuries,” Pei Qianhao instructed before continuing on his journey. Further down the route was where he and Du Ling had agreed to meet.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yu Xiao renewed his resolve as he watched Pei Qianhao ride into the distance, silently vowing to kill Yun Ruofeng with his own two hands and unique medical skills!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao and Du Ling arrived at the agreed-upon location after an hour. Night had already fallen.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Du Ling shook his head and said, “I didn’t find them on my route.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I found Yu Xiao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A messenger pigeon landed on Pei Qianhao’s shoulder at this point. He picked up the message and sighed after reading it. “Liu Yinyin has been found, but Xi-er is still with Yun Ruofeng.”</p>
