 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>Pei Qianhao looked at Yun Ruofeng, a smile flickering across his eyes. “What are you saying, Prince Yun? It’s this Prince’s honour to be invited to your residence for a meal.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, you’re too humble. It’s this Prince’s honour that you could turn up.” Yun Ruofeng replied in a gentle voice.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As the two were politely conversing, Yun Ruofeng’s eyes involuntarily glanced towards Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Although Yun Ruofeng was standing opposite of Su Xi-er, she hadn’t looked at him this entire time. However, it was unclear if his over scorching gaze was what prompted her to meet her gaze with his.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>While Yun Ruofeng probed her with a gentle look, only Su Xi-er know how much hatred for him she hid behind her neutral expression.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her fingernails were digging into her palms under her sleeves, causing a piercing pain.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er sneered inwardly. <em>Compared to the harm Yun Ruofeng inflicted on me, how can this little pain even be mentioned?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s gaze turned slightly cold as he noticed the interaction between Su Xi-er and Yun Ruofeng. From his perspective, the two looked like they were secretly communicating about a hidden relationship.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Yun, how much longer do you plan on staring at this Prince’s maidservant?” Pei Qianhao frosty voice suddenly sounded.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er hastily came back to her senses and silently reminded herself that now was not the time to engage Yun Ruofeng, lest she drew unwanted attention to herself.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng was unruffled as he smiled. “This Prince was just envious of Prince Hao. Even a simple maidservant looks so beautiful.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao sneered to himself internally, but there was no change in his outward appearance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The two didn’t speak further as Yun Ruofeng led them into the antechamber.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As there was still a bit of time before the banquet, Yun Ruofeng ordered a servant to prepare tea for his guests.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The faint tea fragrance wafted into their noses as two pieces of tea leaves floated to the water’s surface.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao inhaled lightly as he placed the teacup near his nose and closed his eyes, looking like he enjoyed it very much. However, he didn’t drink it immediately, instead asking, “Is this the premium Taiping Houkui tea<span id="footnote-ref-1724"><a href="#footnote-1724">[1]</a></span>?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao opened his eyes, but his attention remained on the tea in his cup.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng was slightly taken aback before he smiled. “It is indeed Taiping Houkui tea. It’s immediately processed after being picked in the tea garden high up in the mountains at the start of summer, so its fragrance is rich and long-lasting.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er watched coldly on the side. <em>I liked drinking Taiping Houkui tea the most in my previous lifetime. However, I hardly ever saw Yun Ruofeng drink it. I didn’t expect him to pick up the habit after I died.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Despite her earlier reminder, she couldn’t stop her gaze from probing Yun Ruofeng. <em>I just can’t see through this ruthless man. What exactly is he doing?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng could always catch Su Xi-er’s gaze. Whenever she looked at him, he always followed suit.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Their eyes met again, although this time, Su Xi-er quickly averted her gaze.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But even though this incident was so subtle, Pei Qianhao still noticed it.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There was a slight change in the expression in his eyes before he turned to instruct Su Xi-er. “Go and wash the cutlery this Prince will be using at tonight’s banquet.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She muttered in her heart, <em>He even needs his cutlery specially washed.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao continued, “The cutlery this Prince will be using must be washed by you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Although I’m quite reluctant, it’s still better to comply with Pei Qianhao for now.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hence, Su Xi-er bowed slightly and replied deferentially, “Yes.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Opposite of them, Yun Ruofeng’s expression remained gentle as he smiled at Su Xi-er, his eyes trailing after her as she left.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er could feel his gaze upon her, but hastened her footsteps anyways in order to shake off any suspicion from Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Finally, a maidservant led her through the back garden. As Su Xi-er looked at this extremely familiar place, she discovered that the back garden seemed to have become larger. There were flowers of countless species planted all over the place.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>When I think about it, this also makes sense. &nbsp;How can he possibly let his back garden be so desolate and simple when his status has risen so much from a general to a prince regent?</em></p>
