 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>The night banquet started, and the back garden of the Prince Yun residence was luminous in the otherwise dark night.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The previously blooming flowers silently stood half-open after the sun went down, like shy beauties illuminated by candlelight in the night, forming a picturesque scenery.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The surface of the nearby lake vaguely reflected the image of people holding a splendorous banquet. Although there were only two people, they were the noble Prince Regents of Nanzhao and Beimin.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Prince Hao sat in the main seat, while Yun Ruofeng sat at the side seat<span id="footnote-ref-7470"><a href="#footnote-7470">[1]</a></span>. Yun Ruofeng’s willingness to allow him to do so was already enough to show his ‘respect’ to Prince Hao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Looking at the beautiful surrounding scenery, Pei Qianhao remarked softly, “Just a back garden from the Prince Yun Residence is already so beautiful and unique. Looks like it can compete with the Imperial Garden in the palace.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>What Pei Qianhao spoke with tongue in cheek; how could Yun Ruofeng not understand his meaning?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With a soft smile at the corner of his mouth, he calmly responded. “This Prince simply likes flowers and plants, so I told people to plant some more.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao stopped talking. Coming forward from her place at the side, Su Xi-er neatly set the bowl and chopsticks in front of Pei Qianhao. Each movement she made was careful and measured, requiring her full attention. Due to this however, she didn’t realise that the other person at the table had already moved his gaze onto her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With just two people at the large table, the atmosphere became extremely cold.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Yun Ruofeng saw that most of the food had arrived on the table, a small smile emerged at the corner of his mouth. He looked at Su Xi-er and couldn’t help but say, “Miss Xi-er, although you are Prince Hao’s maidservant, you are also a guest of Nanzhao. Why don’t you sit at the low seat and eat with us?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Upon hearing Yun Ruofeng’s suggestion, the other maidservants couldn’t help but suck in a breath of cold air and silently curse. <em>Even a maidservant can eat with the noblest men in the world. What kind of honour is this?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Anybody else would be ecstatic; this is a huge gift that should make anyone happy!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Su Xi-er’s face remained indifferent; she continued to serve Prince Hao, unaffected by the dozens of gazes waiting for her answer.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before Pei Qianhao could answer, she replied, “This servant is just a maid, unworthy of eating at the same table as Prince Yun and Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After she finished serving Pei Qianhao, Su Xi-er slowly withdrew to stand behind him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everyone around looked at Su Xi-er with obvious jealousy, surprised that she gave up such a good opportunity. At the same time, they were happy that the woman didn’t eat with the prince regents.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao glanced at her and said in a cold tone. “A maidservant is indeed unworthy of eating at the same table.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng laughed and didn’t try to convince her anymore, instead waving his hand at the maidservant next to him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The maidservant understood, and slowly walked to Pei Qianhao’s side with a wine pot.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>From his seat, Yun Ruofeng said, “This is not the wine from the imperial palace, and it’s not the flower wine either. Instead, it’s a delicious fruit wine. It has ginkgo, Chinese date, pomegranate, and a dozen fruits inside; the fruit wine tastes pure and leaves a great scent in your mouth, but it doesn’t make you drunk. Prince Hao, you must taste it.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>While he was speaking, the maidservant had taken two steps forward and was ready to pour wine into the cup in front of Prince Hao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before the maidservant could pour the wine, Prince Hao waved his hand. “Let this prince’s maidservant pour wine for me; I won’t trouble others.”</p>
