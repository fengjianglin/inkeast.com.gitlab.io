 <p>After Pei Qianhao walked out of the woods, he didn’t leave on his horse but instead walked towards the well.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>From far away, he could see Su Xi-er scrubbing the chamber pots earnestly as the other palace maid collected the water from the well for her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He had dispatched people to investigate Su Xi-er. <em>She had entered the imperial palace very early on, staying in the Palace Side Quarters for ten years, and she is now fifteen years old.</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><em>In those ten years, Su Xi-er would be bullied every now and then. If it was serious, she would be punished by a beating with the wooden planks. If the punishment was light, she would be whipped. Although her body was fragile, she had managed to get through it. Having lived in this kind of environment for ten years, she is an extremely timid and afraid of others.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao,” a soft voice sounded. It was Wu Ling.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao turned around and asked, “How did it go with disposing of the body?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Everything has been dealt with appropriately. As for Commandery Prince Xie…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A devilish and wanton smile appeared at the corner of Pei Qianhao’s mouth. “There is no medicine for regret in this world. Besides, this was single-handedly caused by him.” He turned around and walked into the distance without another word.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling immediately followed and mustered his courage to ask, “Prince Hao, are you really going to take Su Xi-er into the Beauty Palace? When you collected beauties in the past, the Empress Dowager didn’t care. This time, the Empress Dowager insists on interfering.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This prince won’t take her into the Beauty Palace. As for the Empress Dowager’s side, let her be.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling was completely taken aback. <em>What does that mean? Is he going to disregard Su Xi-er, and leave her to perish on her own? If that’s really the case, why does Prince Hao always come to the Palace Side Quarters, even going as far as to personally send medicine to Su Xi-er?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, you are just going to leave Su Xi-er to her own devices and not care about her?” Wu Ling asked again.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao stopped in his tracks and glanced at Wu Ling coldly. “You have asked too much.”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Looking at Prince Hao as he faded into the distance, Wu Ling sighed. <em>The rumours say that Prince Hao collects a beauty every time he sees one. In reality, Prince Hao doesn’t pay any attention to any woman after they enter the Beauty Palace. He only gives them a grandiose prison and watches them struggle against each other inside.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>It’s just like watching a few dozen crazy rabbits biting each other. If Su Xi-er really enters, perhaps this would be the result as well.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Beside the well, Su Xi-er was scrubbing the chamber pots. After Ruo Yuan pulled up the water from the well, she squatted down and looked at her carefully.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The Third Imperial Prince grabbed your hand. I feel that he is very concerned about you.”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Ruo Yuan, you still have to get up early tomorrow to work. You should rest earlier.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ruo Yuan shook her head. “I’m not sleepy. I still haven’t recovered from the many shocking events that happened tonight.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er raised her head, revealing her solemn countenance. “Never breathe a word of the matters tonight. Do you understand?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Mhm! Even if you give me ten guts, I wouldn’t dare to tell others anything about this. However, Su Xi-er, if Prince Hao and the Third Imperial Prince reach out their hand to you at the same time, which person’s hand would you hold?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Both men are noble men with extremely massive power.&nbsp;</em>Ruo Yuan was curious. <em>Which one of them will Su Xi-er actually choose?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After a while, Su Xi-er smiled. “I won’t choose either of them.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Ah?” Ruo Yuan’s face was full of puzzlement. <em>She will reject both of them?!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao is a dangerous tiger, while the Third Imperial Prince is a silent leopard. Will you choose the tiger or the leopard?” Su Xi-er used an analogy.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ruo Yuan’s expression changed. She raised her hand and shook her head repeatedly. “I wouldn’t want either of them. A tiger and a leopard are too scary. As soon as I’m not careful, I will be bitten to death!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“That’s right, you’ll be bitten to death. It’s still better to scrub the chamber pots seriously.” Su Xi-er laughed before she lowered her head and continued working.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ruo Yuan looked at Su Xi-er. She didn’t know why, but she always felt that Su Xi-er would definitely be successful with many accomplishments in the future.</p>
