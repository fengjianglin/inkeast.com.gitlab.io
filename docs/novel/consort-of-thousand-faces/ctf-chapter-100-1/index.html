 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>Su Xi-er walked to the middle of the courtyard, raising her head to gaze at the crescent moon in the night sky before shutting her eyes for a moment. When she opened them again, the expression on her face had completely changed. It gave off a sense of peace and elegance with a trace of bashfulness.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She swayed back and forth under the moonlight with her leg as a pivot to turn her body, the hem of her skirt like a series of flowing waves as it rippled.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The slight redness of her lips complimented the rosiness of her cheeks, and she looked like she wanted to say something but was shy to do so. Her dainty countenance was like the pink peach blossom petals; every single movement of hers displaying the purity and aloofness of an orchid flower. Donned in her elegant long dress, her black hair was cast across her shoulders and a faint smile graced her unadorned face, emanating a unique aura.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The expression in Pei Qianhao’s slightly changed. <em>If I mock this dance, I’m afraid that there isn’t a dance in this world that I can appreciate.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The night breeze blew again, causing the trees to sway and rustle. In the moonlit courtyard, a girl in the prime of her youth was dancing lithely, captivating the hearts of all who gazed upon her. One glance was all it took to be completely mesmerised.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As Pei Qianhao watched this exquisite dance, he gradually furrowed his brows. <em>Is she really just a palace maid from the Palace Side Quarters? Forget about the noble daughters, even the best dancer in Beimin wouldn’t be able to compare to this.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>How on earth does she know this? She was sold off by her parents and lived in an impoverished family. How is it be possible for her to have acknowledged a mentor and learnt dance?&nbsp;</em>The more he thought about it, the deeper his suspicions became.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s dance became faster and faster, like a fairy under the moonlight. Despite this, her breathing was not laboured at all, as if she was already used to performing this dance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The hem of her dress fanned out into a radiant flower as she spun increasingly faster, exuding a beauty that made others fall into a trance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At the other side of the courtyard stood a man dressed in cloud adorned white robes, his gentle aura on full display. However, his slightly knitted brow belied his current emotions.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I have seen this dance before, but this is clearly another woman. Why does Prince Hao’s servant girl know how to perform it? It’s impossible. Apart from Ning Rulan, there’s no one else in this world who can perform this dance.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, an imperial guard came to Yun Ruofeng’s side and whispered, “Prince Yun…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng waved his hand. “This place isn’t convenient for discussing matters.” He then glanced at Su Xi-er again before fading into the distance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Glancing in Su Xi-er’s direction, the imperial guard’s face was immediately painted with an astonished look that remained even after he swiftly left.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Upon completing the dance, Su Xi-er was panting slightly. She bowed to pay her respects, “Prince Hao, thank you for putting up with my mediocre performance.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao stowed away the suspicion in his eyes and raised both of his hands, the crisp sound of applause ringing through the air. “This prince has never praised people easily. This dance is unique and unrivalled in this world, something that applies to the dancer as well.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Many thanks for the compliment, Prince Hao. As this servant has already completed your orders, I will go and bring the water to your room. Prince Hao, since it’s already so late, please return to your room to rest.” She then turned around to walk towards the boiler room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She had paid attention to her surroundings when she was led to the room earlier today, noting that the boiler room was one of the rooms ahead.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You don’t have to go. The imperial guards will send it over. If I let you go and get it, who knows if you will find another maidservant for this prince again.” Prince Hao purposely paused and sized her up carefully.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er raised her head and respectfully replied. “This servant isn’t silly enough to do it a second time. Besides, you are already taking precautions against it in your heart.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Let this prince ask you, who taught you that dance? Which elder sister<span id="footnote-ref-6428"><a href="#footnote-6428">[1]</a></span> was it?” Pei Qianhao intentionally used the words ‘elder sister’ to prevent her from using this reason to solve the issue.</p>
