 <p>Pei Qianhao’s eyes became dark. <em>Yun Ruofeng didn’t attend the morning court assembly, even though he knew that his military power would be taken. It turns out that he took the loss in order to go to the posthouse and make a move on Su Xi-er. It’s definitely his doing that Su Xi-er is injured again.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>After failing to deal with Su Xi-er, Yun Ruofeng decided to spread this false rumour that she tried to seduce him. <em>Wow, Yun Ruofeng, coming to Nanzhao’s state banquet this year has truly been an ‘eye-opening experience’.</em> It’s the first time I have seen a man making such a vicious move on a woman.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s eyes hardened when he thought of this, causing him to coldly instruct the imperial guard, “Speed up.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard looked at the civilians on the road. “Prince Hao, I am unable to do so. If I do, the civilians on the road will...”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao interrupted him. “Don’t mind them, just yell out for them to move.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard could tell that Prince Hao was displeased. He had also heard what the civilians were gossiping about, so he hollered, “All move aside!” He raised his whip and cracked it, causing the horses to neigh and the carriage to speed up, leaving a wake of dust in their path.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The civilians quickly moved to the sides, with some even dropping their groceries on the ground. The street was suddenly in a mess, and no one had time to gossip about Su Xi-er anymore.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao jumped off the horse carriage as soon as it arrived at the posthouse. The imperial guard who was watching over the entrance walked over and immediately reported to him, “Prince Hao, Su Xi-er is in the main hall.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the other guards saw him nod and head towards the main hall with a serious expression, they all felt a cold sweat on their palms. Their hearts couldn’t help but tremble as they thought to themselves. <em>We’ve failed in our duties this time around.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Pei Qianhao stepped into the main hall, he saw that Su Xi-er had already cleaned her own wound and wrapped some medicinal herbs around it. She was just sipping a cup of tea while lounging in one of the lower seats.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Show this Prince your arm.” Pei Qianhao took her arm and looked at it carefully. He could tell from one glance that the white cloth around it had been changed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Did the wound tear open?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er nodded. “Don’t worry Prince Hao, it’s not a problem.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Everyone on the streets of Nanzhao is gossiping about this Prince’s maidservant stripping herself to seduce Prince Yun. What do you have to say about this?” Pei Qianhao let go of her arm and sat on the upper seat while staring at her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er stood up from her seat. <em>I didn’t think that Yun Ruofeng would spread a vicious rumour like that. It seems that I’ve learned something new today: that Yun Ruofeng is just as shameless and vile as a lowly villain.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I previously thought that he was just selfish and overly coveted power. Now, I see him for what he is.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, if this servant had tried to do such a thing, my wound wouldn’t be torn open.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s eyes darkened with a fierce glint in his eyes. “Did he force you?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>How daring you are, Yun Ruofeng! You dared to try to take my maidservant by force, something that not even I have had the gall to attempt!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Yun didn’t succeed, but this servant thinks that he tried because he is jealous of your talents, Prince Hao. He is upset that his light is currently engulfed in your shadow. Hence, when he noticed that you treated this servant so well, he wanted to destroy me in order to deliver a blow to you.” Su Xi-er replied slowly and carefully, observingPei Qianhao as she replied.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao raised his hand and smashed it down on the table heavily, letting the sound of the impact echo through the hall before he began to tap his fingers gently. “He can’t compare with this Prince in any aspect. This Prince won’t let him go, no matter what. Su Xi-er, come to this Prince’s side.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>“Come to this Prince’s side.” Although his face is cold, his voice is gentle, and a trace of warmth flickered across his eyes.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er looked at him until he raised his hand again and signalled for her to go over.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She made her way over, and just when she wanted to open her mouth to speak, was pulled into his embrace.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Don’t be restrained, sit on this Prince’s legs.”</p>
