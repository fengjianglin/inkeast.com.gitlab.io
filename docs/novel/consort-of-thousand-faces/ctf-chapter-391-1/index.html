 <p>“Your Majesty, name a few of the books.” Pei Qianhao sternly demanded in his cold voice as he walked to Situ Lin.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Situ Lin’s mind went blank with panic, but it wouldn’t do to not answer.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hence, he began to stutter. “The book’s title, the title… let me think. Don’t be impatient.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Situ Lin then mumbled to himself, looking as if he was pouting. Su Xi-er didn’t know if she should cry or laugh when she caught sight of his adorable appearance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When she looked at Pei Qianhao’s solemn expression, however, she couldn’t help but remind, “World Virtues, The Entire Nation, The Schools of Philosophy…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Situ Lin recalled the titles of the rest of the books, listing all of them at once.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao glanced at Su Xi-er before resting his gaze on Situ Lin. “Remember to practise writing and study those books. I may decide to test you with a few questions in the future.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Imperial Uncle, won’t you be busy with marrying Imperial Aunt? How would you have the time to test me? Even after the wedding is over, you still have to please Imperial Aunt while she stays in the residence, as well as take her out to play. You won’t have time to...” Situ Lin suddenly felt a cold gaze shot in his direction and immediately shut his mouth.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, Su Xi-er noticed a book with a blue cover that didn’t have a title on it. “What book is this? It doesn’t have a name.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao turned around and immediately snatched the book from her hands when he saw the blue cover, stowing it away in his sleeve with an unnatural expression.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>To think that I accidentally placed the book Imperial Physician Zhao gave me on the bookshelf. If Su Xi-er had discovered it…&nbsp;</em>His expression became even more awkward.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A moment later, Pei Qianhao’s expression returned to normal, frightening Situ Lin to immediately return to his seat when he met the former’s black eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er pulled at his sleeves, reaching out her hand. “What book is it? Take it out.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She hadn’t missed the fleeting change in his expression just now. <em>What kind of book could it be for him to act so strangely?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It’s just a normal medical book.” Pei Qianhao calmly stated, deadpan.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Medical book?” Su Xi-er remained sceptical. <em>Is it really a normal medical book? If it was really the case, why did he show such a strange expression?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It’s indeed a medical book.” Pei Qianhao’s shifted his gaze to Situ Lin. “Take out the copybook and start practising your writing. Grand Tutor Kong will come over to check on your progress.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Situ Lin grunted affirmatively before opening the copybook, beginning to write after he finished preparing the ink.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Pei Qianhao was about to leave the main hall, his gaze briefly landed on Su Xi-er, noticing the confusion that remained in her eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He decided to take her into his arms, bringing her to the side hall.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Situ Lin stopped writing as he watched Pei Qianhao leave the room with Su Xi-er. <em>What’s the matter with Imperial Uncle? What exactly is the blue-covered book about?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao saw that Su Xi-er was still intently staring at him. “Do you want to know what that book was?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’m just curious; what are you hiding from me?” Su Xi-er asked earnestly, her eyes darting to his sleeve.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao acquiesced to her request, taking out the book and passing it to her. “After hurting you last time, this Prince had Imperial Physician Zhao seek out this book. Since you have discovered it, I might as well let you take a look.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er didn’t take the book with her hands, having realised what its contents were as soon as he had spoken.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Do you want to read it?” Pei Qianhao teased, waving the book side to side.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er shook her head. “No, it’s fine. You can read it by yourself.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her bashful expression greatly pleased him, eliciting a low chuckle from him as he took the book back. “It’s good to read more books. There are many positions in it.”</p>
