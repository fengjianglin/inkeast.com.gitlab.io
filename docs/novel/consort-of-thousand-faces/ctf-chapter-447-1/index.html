<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Zhen Yu’s eyes were glued to Pei Qianhao. <em>Even if I haven’t seen him for more than 10 years, I can still recognise him. Although people’s appearances may change a little, there are many things that will remain similar. For example, the contours of this man’s face are a magnified version of Brother Hu’s!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>However, Brother Hu had a gentle demeanour, while this man before me is extremely cold.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Brother Hu, after leaving our village at the age of seven, you have been doing rather well for yourself. You’ve even established a career, as well as married a wife...” Zhen Yu’s voice faded away towards the end, and she looked towards Su Xi-er. “She is very beautiful, even more so than me. I don’t blame you for marrying her, but why didn’t you ever come back to Peach Blossom Village to visit? Did you forget all about us?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao stared at her. “Miss, considering that you seem to have mistaken this Prince for someone that is very precious to you, I won’t punish you.” He then turned towards the guard and coldly ordered, “Send the young lady out.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This subordinate obeys the order.” The guard then swiftly turned around and gestured at Zhen Yu. “Miss, perhaps there is really a person in the world who looks like Prince Hao, but Prince Hao is not your Brother Hu. Please follow this subordinate out.:”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhen Yu stopped weeping, but her gaze remained dazedly on Pei Qianhao. <em>Have I really mistaken him for Brother Hu? He looks so much like Brother Hu though! After waiting for more than 10 years, I can’t just leave so easily.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hence, she decided to take a step forward and look towards Su Xi-er. “Since you are his wife, you definitely know whether he has a mole on the right side of his waist. Tell me, does he have one?” Her eyes were limpid and full of earnestness.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er quietly watched her. <em>There’s indeed a mole on Pei Qianhao’s waist, but it would be better to wait until we can thoroughly investigate this before actually telling her the truth.&nbsp;</em>“Miss, my husband doesn’t have a mole on his waist, but I wish you all the best in finding your Brother Hu soon. When you do, please bring him over for me to take a look. I am very curious to see how much he resembles my husband.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s every word, especially ‘husband’ caused sorrow to well up in Zhen Yu’s heart, but she wasn’t someone who would continue to unreasonably pester others.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I can’t exclude the possibility that he’s someone who looks like Brother Hu.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After some contemplation, she wiped her tears and told Pei Qianhao, “I’m sorry that I mistook you for someone else; Brother Hu wouldn’t forget me. Even if you look like him, the fact is that you’re someone different.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She no longer spared him a single glance, and ignored the guard as she swiftly left the restaurant on her own.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The probing look in Su Xi-er’s eyes only receded when Pei Qianhao embraced her. “Let’s go in. This Prince has ordered a few delicious dishes.” He pulled her into the room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The ‘Brother Hu’ the young lady mentioned just now looks like…”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“If it’s someone who looks like this Prince, would you be able to tell the difference with a single glance?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er smiled. “I’m not a fool; I don’t even need to look, I can just identify you by your aura and scent.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao was delighted by her reply, and bent down to kiss her tender lips. “Xi-er.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why did you bring me to a restaurant when there are superb dishes in the residence?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“To make you happy.” Pei Qianhao truthfully answered. He had inadvertently overheard the soldiers discussing how a man could make a woman happy. <em>Taking her out to tour the streets, go shopping, try tasty food and drinks, and buying her anything that she happened to fancy were among their numerous ideas.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>In the past, I was cold towards her, constantly showing her a poker face, and I would even threaten her with punishment sometimes. Now that I finally have her in my arms, I naturally have to learn how to make her happy.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er mischievously blinked. “How do you plan on making me happy?” She had never expected herself to like hearing a man’s sweet talk.</p>
