 <p>Heh! That title caught your attention, didn’t it? :P Well, I’m not kidding! We present to you <a href="https://www.volarenovels.com/novel/rebirth-of-a-fashionista" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">Rebirth of a Fashionista</span></strong></a>!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>The imperial guard bowed and paid his respects. "As subordinates, we don’t dare to gossip about Prince Hao's affairs." <em>I am just an imperial guard, and Prince Hao hates people who are garrulous. Not to mention, even we are unclear about this matter.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Nodding his head, Yun Ruofeng didn't make things difficult for the imperial guard and turned to head for the second floor. As he began to pass by Pei Qianhao’s room, the doors were flung open, revealing the man himself sporting a cold smile and narrowed eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Prince Yun, you elude this Prince. What do you intend to do by relentlessly chasing after this Prince's maidservant?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng smiled. “Prince Hao, you interfered with Nanzhao’s matters, and this Prince has disrupted your maidservant, so let’s consider us even.” He had directly admitted that he was indeed relentlessly chasing after Prince Hao’s maidservant, and this caused extreme displeasure in Prince Hao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>How can I let others hanker after my maidservant? Especially when it’s someone like Yun Ruofeng who gently smiles all day. Normal women like this kind of men best.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Prince Yun is indeed honest, but this Prince should make things clear first. Stay far away from this Prince's maidservant in the future, or else…"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Or else what? Is Beimin going to start a war with Nanzhao over a mere maidservant?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao smirked. "Not a war, but doesn’t Prince Yun understand what this Prince means already? People in high positions have somewhat similar personalities. It's obvious no matter how well you try to hide it."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng narrowed his eyes. <em>In this world, only the powerful can understand the powerful.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Prince Hao, that's too strong a statement. You have given this Prince much face by coming to Nanzhao this time. Take a good rest; this Prince will leave Moon County today."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He was obviously implying that he wouldn’t approach Su Xi-er again.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao watched Yun Ruofeng's back as he left, a tinge of maleficence rising in his eyes. <em>No one can match up to me in this world. As long as I want something, no one can snatch it from me, regardless of who they are. The last thing I lack is tricks.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng's gentle countenance was immediately dropped the moment he returned to his room. Sitting on a chair, he lightly tapped his fingers against the tabletop as his brows furrowed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er's words lingered in his mind. <em>He should die. He does not deserve to be called a human.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>If Ning Rulan is still alive, would she say these words to me too? “Yun Ruofeng, you should die! You are a beast, and do not deserve to be human…”</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Foolish women like Née Li exist in large numbers in this world, but Ning Rulan will never be one of them.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>My meeting with Ning Rulan was ultimately a mistake.&nbsp;</em>A rare slip revealed an expression of pain in his eyes, but dissipated as soon as it appeared.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Even if I could rewind time and make my choice again, I would still kill Ning Rulan without hesitation.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Knock knock</em>— The sound of someone at the door was soon followed up by the voice of the guard from the Prince Yun Residence.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Prince Yun, something happened in the palace."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng moved towards the room door and opened it. "Immediately prepare the horse carriage and return to the capital."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He had originally planned to stay for a few more days, but recent events had caused him to change his mind. It just so happened that this ‘incident’ was a convenient excuse for him to return.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Prince Yun, the matter concerns the Eldest Imperial Princess and His Majesty. It's an emergency," the imperial guard elaborated.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With a placid expression, Yun Ruofeng made a hand gesture and replied, "Okay. This Prince will settle it. Depart for the capital immediately."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard bowed and received the order before he promptly headed towards the inn's stable.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng swiftly exited his room and headed down the stairs. Just as he began to descend, he came face-to-face with Su Xi-er. She was holding onto a tray containing a teapot and cups.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even though Su Xi-er saw him, she didn't speak a single word before heading straight to Pei Qianhao's room. It was as though she treated Yun Ruofeng like he didn’t even exist.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Standing in front of Pei Qianhao’s room, Su Xi-er could only call out since her hands were full. "Prince Hao, the tea is here. May I come in now?"</p>
