<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Feng Changqing felt a little embarrassed. <em>The Eldest Imperial Princess was never so insistent about this before, and now Prince Hao has also joined in.&nbsp;</em>He immediately bowed as he quickly spoke. “This subordinate has to go check on Yu Xiao’s martial arts practice, and will be taking my leave first.” He then turned on his heel before Su Xi-er could even register what he had said.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Watching his swiftly departing figure, Su Xi-er felt guilty. <em>His pure loyalty is only because I happened to save him in passing while he was being beaten. He has long since returned this favour to me, yet he continues to follow me even now. He’s even gone as far as to disregard his own appearance and marriage.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao embraced her, and whispered into her ears. “Xi-er, Feng Changqing has his own plans and thoughts about this. He will eventually want to get married someday, and you don’t have to beat yourself up over it.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Before you met me, when were you planning to get married?” Su Xi-er raised her head and asked with an earnest expression.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince originally didn’t plan on getting married, thinking that no one would be able to enter my heart. But who would have known that this Prince accounted for everything but you.” Pei Qianhao softly chuckled, and tickled her nose with his finger. “You’re a little bewitching fairy.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er widely grinned in a mischievous manner. “Prince Hao, have you been bewitched?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“I have indeed.” A glint flickered in Pei Qianhao’s eyes as he hugged her and spun around, pressing her against the trunk of the plum blossom tree.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This scene resembled the one in the woods in the suburbs, and Su Xi-er immediately stopped him. “We tossed around enough last night. You’re not allowed to do it in broad daylight. Besides, I’m feeling cold.” She knew that her first two sentences wouldn’t work, but she was confident that her last few words would be effective.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As expected, Pei Qianhao retracted his hand. “This Prince will carry you back to the room.” He then immediately proceeded to pick her up. Feeling the world spin around her, she soon found herself with her arms hooked around his neck, gazing into his eyes with her own resplendent gaze.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s heart stirred, and he bent down to plant a kiss on her forehead before striding out of the rear garden and heading towards the main courtyard.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Every guard that they passed along the way would bow upon seeing Pei Qianhao, then watch with wide eyes as he made his way to the hall. <em>It’s currently the middle of the day, yet he’s walking so quickly towards the main room. It’s inevitable that people would misunderstand.&nbsp;</em>Then, everyone once again recalled that Pei Qianhao had been holding it in for 25 years. <em>Even using the words ‘wolf’ and ‘tiger’ to describe him wouldn’t be sufficient to display Prince Hao’s...formidable might.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After entering the main room, Pei Qianhao set Su Xi-er on the bed, raising his eyebrows as he looked at her. “Princess Consort, what should we do next?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>His hint is already so blatant. I’d be a fool if I didn’t understand what he’s getting at.&nbsp;</em>Su Xi-er immediately sat up. “I want to drink lotus seed soup; I’ll go to the main hall to wait for Ruo Yuan and Hong Li to bring it over.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“They just went to prepare it, so it will be a while before they finish. Why don’t we do something else?” Right after he said that, his tall figure pressed down, pinning her hands above her head.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A trail of kisses rained down and covered her mouth, pushing down the words that she had wanted to say. His tongue slipped into her mouth and entangled with hers. Under his attack, Su Xi-er couldn’t help but lift her legs and wrap them around his waist.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao let out a soft chuckle. “You took the initiative.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s face instantly flushed red as she tried to bring her legs down, but he had already grabbed ahold of them.“Now, this Prince won’t let you retreat.”</p>
