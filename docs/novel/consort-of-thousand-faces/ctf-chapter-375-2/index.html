 <p>“Lie here properly.” Pei Qianhao placed his hand on her head and made sure she obediently lied on the soft pillow.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince will go out for a while. I’ll be right back.” Pei Qianhao walked to the wardrobe area and removed his bloody robes, changing into a clean purplish-blue robe.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er had never seen him in such a colour before. <em>The colour blue usually gives a mature feeling. It feels like the coldness that usually surrounds him disappears a little when he wears it.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Pei Qianhao turned around to find Su Xi-er staring at him, the corners of his mouth involuntarily curled up. “Is this Prince very handsome?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You'd be more handsome if you weren’t injured.” Su Xi-er smiled.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao didn’t say anything else before straightening his collar and walking out the door. For him, any non-fatal wound would be considered an itch to him, and it wouldn’t be long before it healed. With this new set of clothes, nobody could tell that he was injured either.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Outside the side palace, Pei Yaran’s face was stormy as she stood in front of the imperial guards. <em>Situ Lin actually dared to order the guards to block me!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao briefly glanced at Pei Yaran before looking at the imperial guards. “Go to the Imperial Physician Institute and summon Imperial Physician Zhao over.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard acknowledged the order and immediately left.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Imperial Physician Zhao was currently busy studying the water pot that he had taken from Su Xi-er’s room, but when he received Prince Hao’s verbal edict, he immediately departed for the Dragon Heaven Palace without another word.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The atmosphere outside the side hall of the Dragon Heaven Palace was extremely tense. Everyone’s breathing became shallower as they observed the cold look in Pei Qianhao’s eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“All of you may withdraw. This Prince is going to have a proper talk with the Empress Dowager.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guards could finally heave a sigh of relief. They swiftly bowed and withdrew.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A moment later, only Pei Qianhao and Pei Yaran were left outside the hall.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Yaran paid no heed to the dangerous look in Pei Qianhao’s eyes, and pointed at him. “What kind of place is the Dragon Heaven Palace? You actually disregarded the palace rules and allowed that bitch to go in!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Her name is Su Xi-er, and she is Princess Consort Hao. What, is Princess Consort Hao a bitch in your eyes?” Pei Qianhao walked closer to her, an oppressive aura surrounded him, and even his clothes did nothing to diffuse his cold disposition.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Yaran subconsciously retreated a few steps back. “Letting Su Xi-er become Princess Consort Hao will only put you at a disadvantage! You have never allowed yourself to eat a loss, so why this time…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince is happy to do so.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Pei Qianhao, you can’t marry her!” Pei Yaran’s face was covered with fury, and jealousy surged forth from the bottom of her heart.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I can understand if he marries Xie Liuli. But I can’t understand why he’s marrying Su Xi-er!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Are you hiding someone in the Compassionate Peace Palace?” Pei Qianhao’s solemn expression and confident tone made it sound more like a statement than a question.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Yaran was stunned. <em>Hiding someone? Has he discovered Shi Mo?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You have lived in the imperial palace for more than three years. How can you hide someone in the palace, and a man at that?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Yaran shook her head. “Nonsense! I’m not hiding anyone!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince was shot by an arrow, and the culprit is hiding in the Compassionate Peace Palace. Pei Yaran, are you not going to speak the truth?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Pei Yaran raised her voice in an attempt to conceal her panic.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was at this moment that the Imperial Army Commander, Yuchi Mo, chose to arrive.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, we weren’t able to locate Shu Xian. We have checked every nook and cranny of the imperial palace, but weren’t able to find a trace of him. What we have found is that more than 10 imperial guards who were watching over the northwest palace gate have been killed.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Yaran’s gaze faltered. <em>I haven’t seen Shi Mo at all in the Compassionate Peace Palace tonight. Could he have killed the guards at the northwest side?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Guards, send the Empress Dowager back to the Compassionate Peace Palace to be confined.” Pei Qianhao slowly ordered in a cold voice.</p>
