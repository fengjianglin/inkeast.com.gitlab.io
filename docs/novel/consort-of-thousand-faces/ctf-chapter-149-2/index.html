 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p>Pei Qianhao’s face was indifferent. <em>In the end, a legend is just that: a legend. The only differences are the water, soil, and different conditions here. Just like how they say tangerines grow in the south and oranges grow in the north due to different environmental conditions, the difference in conditions causes the growth of the flower to change.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er had heard this legend a long time ago. <em>Of course the legend isn’t real; no one personally experienced it. This is just a beautiful legend about what everyone hopes for.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Moon County was already selling flower seedlings when she was born.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Uncle Zhao saw their expressions, he knew that they didn’t really believe the legend of the flower goddess.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He couldn’t help but explain on the side. “This legend was passed down from the older generations, leaving us unsure if it is true or not. What we can be sure of though, is that the water from the Moon Lake is really sublime, and that the flowers that have been watered by it are completely different from flowers that are watered by other sources.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Is the Moon Lake really that magical?” Pei Qianhao seemed to be asking Uncle Zhao, but his eyes were focused on Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>This woman really has some inexplicable connection to Nanzhao. I can’t explain this feeling, but I know that she has definitely stayed in Nanzhao before.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Uncle Zhao heard his question, he immediately nodded. “Yes, the Moon Lake is special. Even when planted on the same land, the flowers watered by the Moon Lake grow more quickly, and are less susceptible to pests and disease.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Everyone is using the water from the Moon Lake to water our flowers now. When compared to the flowers from other nearby counties, ours are like a beautiful flower sea, much better than the others… hehe.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Uncle Zhao was a bit embarrassed to blow his own trumpet. He scratched his head and didn’t know what to say.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Where is the nearest flower field?” Pei Qianhao asked.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Sir, do you want to take a look?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Mmm.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The nearest one is to the south, but they don’t grow Lingrui flowers there,” Uncle Zhao informed. <em>These guests must be wanting to see the Lingrui flowers.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Then where are they?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“To the north. It’s a bit far, but the gardeners there planted field after field of Lingrui flowers; it is a sea of yellow, and very beautiful. Sir, if you want to go, I will ask my shop assistant to take you there.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Uncle Zhao was enthusiastic, but Pei Qianhao waved his hand. “No need. Shop owner, you just need to tell us the directions and we can go there by ourselves.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Oh okay, okay.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Acknowledging Pei Qianhao’s words, Uncle Zhao went over to the imperial guard driving the carriage to provide directions. “If you really lose your way, you can ask anyone who’s around. Any gardener in Moon County will know that field of Lingrui flowers.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial guard nodded. “Okay, I understand.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing as how the horse carriage was waiting outside, Pei Qianhao and Su Xi-er didn’t stay for long, wanting to hurry ahead to the flower field.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When they were getting on the horse carriage, Su Xi-er happened to see Pei Qianhao first head over to the imperial guard to have a few words.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She couldn’t hear what they were saying. but saw the guard nodding to Pei Qianhao before he swiftly left.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao just turned around and met the eyes of Su Xi-er, who was sitting inside the carriage.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er felt her heart skip a beat when their eyes met. She quickly dropped the curtain of the carriage and looked away.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shortly after, the horse carriage moved a bit, and the curtain was lifted. Pei Qianhao walked in without any expression.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Although she didn’t look at him, the image of Pei Qianhao forcing her against the carriage wall couldn’t help but flicker across Su Xi-er’s mind. Thinking about it, she immediately moved to the opposite side of the carriage.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao looked at her sideways and asked, “Why did you go so far away? Is this Prince going to eat you?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“No, this servant just thinks that Prince Hao is tall and strong, so this servant wants to leave some room for you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao snorted. “Forcing logic with your words.” He then stretched his arm out. “Come to this Prince!”</p>
