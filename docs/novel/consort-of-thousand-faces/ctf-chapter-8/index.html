 <p>Su Xi-er felt a sharp pain on her back before her whole body went limp. Before she could climb up, the man’s tall body was already looming over her.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Having just been flung to the ground, Su Xi-er was still struggling to get her bearings, much less be able to endure the weight of the man seemingly about to press down on her. &nbsp;She raised her head and pursed her lips, her eyes full of icy coldness. &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Instead of pressing down on her body, the man instead propped himself up on the ground with one hand and used the other to lift her chin. “With &nbsp;a temper like yours, it’s a miracle that you can survive in this palace.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er jerked her head free before glaring at him again, her tightly clenched fists digging into the soil. <em>Even if this person has drunk, his vigilance is still high. How can I escape?</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>As she was contemplating, the man took off his clothes and appeared as if he was going to carry it out on the spot.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>The look in Su Xi-er’s eyes changed. Her hand happened to feel a stone with distinct edges. There was no time to lose. She immediately lifted the stone and smashed it towards his head.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em>Clang!</em> The stone fell onto the ground. He rapidly grabbed her wrist and forcefully broke it outwards. <em>Kerchak!&nbsp;</em>Her bones had been dislocated.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>She almost cried out in pain. This body was delicate, and unable to endure such pain.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Woman who doesn’t want your life, even if this prince is drunk, don’t even dream of escaping!” The corners of the man’s mouth were raised and his eyes were slightly narrowed. Under the moonlight, he appeared devilish and terrifying.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>The night breeze rustled the tree leaves and caused his untied robes to fly upwards, revealing his taut and strong skin. There was no excess fat at his waist and stomach. Set off by the bright moonlight, he was beautiful until it caused people to stop breathing.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em>Who would have thought that a man with such an appearance is actually a wastrel?</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>His burning hot breath was close enough for her to feel it on her neck. Immediately after that, warm and moist lips that carried a strong wine scent landed on her lips. As it moved back and forth against her lips, the soft and warm feeling was at once familiar, yet also foreign.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>In an instant, Yun Ruofeng’s gentle smile intruded her mind. A few seconds later, she saw the scene on that night again. <em>The torches illuminating the sky. The Heart-Penetrating Arrow whizzing over. Lü Liu’s tragic death.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>It was as if there was an enormous rock in her heart pressuring her until she was unable to catch her breath. Her long accumulated flames of fury surged up violently.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Just as the man lowered his head again to kiss her, she suddenly opened her mouth and bit the man’s lips ferociously. Fresh blood seeped out and dyed their lips.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>He furrowed his brow and his eyes were deep.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er seized the opportunity to raise her hand deftly and aim a ruthless chop<span id="footnote-ref-9727"><a href="#footnote-9727">[1]</a></span> at his neck. At the back of the neck, the acupuncture points and vertebra were linked. As long as she was precise and utilised sufficient force, he was bound to pass out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>With that, she had exhausted all her strength in this strike.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>When she saw that the man in front of her was still looking at her, her heart thumped wildly.<em>&nbsp;I often use this move to deal with enemies and it has been successful every single time.</em> <em>But when it comes to this man, it doesn’t work anymore?</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“You this... don’t want your life…” His voice became increasingly soft. In the end, he slumped forward with his head resting in the crook of her neck, unconscious.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er heaved a sigh of relief. She pushed his head away and climbed up. She needed to quickly set her dislocated wrist and apply a medicinal spirit<span id="footnote-ref-2af3"><a href="#footnote-2af3">[2]</a></span> to it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>She knew how to set a fracture, but where could she find medicinal spirit in the Palace Side Quarters?</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>She picked up her broom and clenched her teeth as she forcefully twisted her wrist inwards. Accompanied by an acute pain, her bones had returned to their original positions. She quickly walked back to the Palace Side Quarters after she was done. <em>The reason I had met that man was that the area I had been sweeping just now is beyond the boundaries of the Palace Side Quarters.</em>&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>While she was contemplating, she saw Mu Tao walking over.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“You left the Palace Side Quarters just now. Could it be that you went out to meet a man?” Mu Tao’s tone was caustic and she constantly stroked the hairpin bestowed by He Xiangyu.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“You didn’t remember your previous lesson? You still want to wash the chamber pots tonight?” Su Xi-er directly walked ahead and no longer pay any heed to her.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Mu Tao burst into laughter. Her hand happened to nimbly catch Su Xi-er’s dislocated wrist that she had just finished setting, causing her wrist to throb with pain.&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Before Mu Tao could speak, Su Xi-er directly stomped her heel on top of Mu Tao’s foot without a second thought, causing the latter to yelp in pain.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er scowled. “If you scream again, you’ll attract Old Maidservant Zhao here. At that time, the unlucky one would be you.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Nonsense! It’s clearly you who left the Palace Side Quarters. Why would I be punished?”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“If you don’t believe me, then go ahead and holler.” Su Xi-er raised her eyebrow, her tone threatening.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Mu Tao was frightened into silence. She could only gnash her teeth as Su Xi-er retreated into the distance. <em>Hmph! Just wait and see! You secretly left under the pretence of sweeping the Palace Side Quarters. I’ll ensure that you will bear the consequences!</em>&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>When she thought about scrubbing the chamber pots, Su Xi-er sighed. <em>Old Maidservant Zhao is the one in charge of the Palace Side Quarters. I can’t fall out with her yet.</em> <em>I suppose I could purposely sprain my ankle and ask her to give me some medicinal spirit.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>With that in mind, Su Xi-er immediately walked in the direction of where she washed the chamber pots. She had just begun to settle down when she spotted a grass not far away.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>She stared at it and was delighted. <em>That’s a medicinal herb! In fact, it’s the best for falls and sprains!</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er immediately plucked it out. She used her fingers to break it down and smeared it on her wrist. The refreshing spread through her wrist and it was very comfortable.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em>With these medicinal herbs, I’ll be able to recover in five days at most. I didn’t think I would see such excellent medicinal herbs here!</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Her task of washing the chamber pots took up her whole night. By the time she had finished organising the chamber pots in the Palace Side Quarters’ wooden cabin, it was time for breakfast.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“She’s really cut out for scrubbing the chamber pots. She could actually make it in time for breakfast.” The palace maids looked at her in disdain, making it a point to go around her as they carried their bowls.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“She really stinks. Let’s stay further away from her.” After another palace maid saw Su Xi-er, she also immediately carried her bowl to another table.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>In an instant, there was no one at the table. Su Xi-er laughed secretly. <em>I get the whole table.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Breakfast was very simple. It consisted of a bowl of plain rice congee, a white steamed bun<span id="footnote-ref-0f79"><a href="#footnote-0f79">[3]</a></span> and a small plate of dried radish<span id="footnote-ref-440b"><a href="#footnote-440b">[4]</a></span>.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>In her previous lifetime, war spawning from civil unrest and foreign invasions had forced her to starve for up to half a month. <em>Compared to that, the hardships in the Palace Side Quarters don’t amount to much.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>When she was eating, a palace maid ran in panting and pretended to be mysterious.</p>

 <p>Numerous palace maids looked at her in succession, puzzlement written over their faces.</p>

 <p>“Since you all look like you are burning to find out, I’ll tell you. He Xiangyu was summoned into the Compassionate Peace Palace. She infuriated the Empress Dowager, and was sentenced to twenty strikes of the plank!” As she broke the news to them, she gestured the number twenty with her hands<span id="footnote-ref-e639"><a href="#footnote-e639">[5]</a></span>.</p>

 <p>“He Xiangyu is Prince Hao’s favoured concubine. With such a punishment, even if she doesn’t die, she’ll at least become crippled! What did Prince Hao say?”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>The palace maid shrugged her shoulders. “So what if she’s a favoured concubine. She’s not even Princess Consort Hao. Prince Hao’s whereabouts are unknown even until now!”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s expression didn’t change and continued to eat. <em>A concubine is a concubine after all. She can’t climb to the sky. Perhaps it’s that kind of unpresentable cloak-and-dagger relationship between the Empress Dowager and Prince Hao. Since He Xiangyu is in the limelight right now, why wouldn’t the Empress Dowager make her the first target of her attack?</em></p>

 <p><em>Once she provoked the Empress Dowager, even if Prince Hao had supported her, it would still be very dangerous for He Xiangyu, not to even mention that Prince Hao didn’t take her seriously at all.</em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>“Hey, Su Xi-er, are you very happy now? Your close sister has suffered such a calamity.” The palace maid suddenly shifted the topic of the conversation to Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="font-size: 0">Free and Original on volarenovels. Please read the most updated chapters on volarenovels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Su Xi-er neither raised her head nor respond. She simply ate her meal silently.</p>

 <p>“Don’t ask her anymore. She’s definitely elated. However, even if He Xiangyu has fallen, at least she had tasted glory once. At the very least, she had served Prince Hao and got onto the bed of the number one handsome man in Beimin. She can even reminisce about it before she dies.”</p>
