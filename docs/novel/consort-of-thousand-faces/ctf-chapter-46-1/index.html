<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>There was something red on the bed. Peony red. It was so red that it was harsh to the eyes. <em>The Chinese bodice</em><span id="footnote-ref-3a66"><a href="#footnote-3a66">[1]</a></span><em>&nbsp;that women wear...He actually instructed the imperial guard to bring this here! Wu Ling, a fully grown man, had to obey Prince Hao’s order and bring this red Chinese bodice to the Palace Side Quarters.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>It is really...hilarious.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er picked up the Chinese bodice and peered at it carefully, managing to notice that the bottom of it had significantly frayed and that the string had come loose. There was a box with a needle and thread, as well as some red fabric, placed at the side.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Why did he send the Chinese bodice for me to mend? Also, the this fabric feels very soft and it looks like it’s brand new from its colour. If that was the case, how has the bottom been worn out and why has the string come off?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>The only explanation seems to be that this pure red Chinese bodice was purposely damaged by someone. If I’m right, Prince Hao truly has too much time on his hands and is muddle-headed, stirring up trouble just for the sake of it.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>But, since I had already promised him last night, I must do it.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mending this Chinese bodice was quite simple, and would only take her an hour to complete. She would have plenty of time to manufacture the itchy powder afterwards.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er cut a piece of fabric from the corner of the cloth and laid it over the frayed area at the bottom of the bodice. After she threaded the needle, she began to sew the cloth onto the worn-out segment.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Finding herself working in earnest as she stitched threat by thread, the frayed area was soon covered by the new fabric. The only thing left to do was mend the bodice’s ribbon, and all that took was sewing it on.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just as she had re-threaded the needle with the red threat and was ready to begin, the room door was suddenly pushed open.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er raised her head abruptly. A woman clad in a cyan dress entered her sight: Miss Qing</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Placing the Chinese bodice in her hand down, Su Xi-er stood up. “Miss Qing, why have you come today?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Miss Qing caught sight of the pure red Chinese bodice, the expression in her eyes changed as she cast a sidelong glance at Su Xi-er. “What did you tell me previously? Big Brother Wu was acting mysteriously today so I followed him. Who knew that he would come to the Palace Side Quarters and even entered your room!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Miss Qing, you should directly express your thoughts to Imperial Bodyguard Wu and not randomly make conjectures.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Are you starting to challenge me?” Miss Qing raised her slender eyebrow. She quickly walked over to Su Xi-er and raised her right hand to grab the Chinese bodice before she was intercepted by Su Xi-er.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Furious, Miss Qing bellowed, “Let go!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er smiled faintly. “Miss Qing, If you tear the Chinese bodice, you won’t have an easy time in the future.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You are threatening me?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It’s not a threat, but a reminder. You can’t possibly think that this Chinese bodice was secretly hidden by Imperial Bodyguard Wu, right?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Miss Qing’s eyebrows were knitted as she glared at Su Xi-er fiercely. “Big Brother Wu isn’t someone like that. Only a rascal would have a secret stash of Chinese bodice. Moreover, it’s a striking red colour. Disgusting!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Miss Qing has unintentionally cursed out Prince Hao. Disgusting and a rascal...</em>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er’s eyebrows were curved as she smiled at her. This appearance made Miss Qing even more antipathic. Just as she was about to berate her, she heard her indifferent tone.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Imperial Bodyguard Wu is indeed not a rascal, and doesn’t cause others to feel nauseated. But this Chinese bodice was brought over by Imperial Bodyguard Wu under the orders of Prince Hao. The edges are frayed and the string has dropped off, requiring it to be mended.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Miss Qing’s entire body was stiff as she stared at Su Xi-er with a stupefied look, not reacting for a long while.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It wasn’t just her, anybody who had heard those words would have had the same reaction. Prince Hao, high and mighty, as well as revered and feared by others, had actually done something like this!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er waved her hand in front of Miss Qing’s eyes. “The palace maids keep calling you Miss Qing. What’s your real name?”</p>
 <hr>
 <div id="footnote-3a66">
  <p>1. It is the Chinese form of the bodice and is worn as lingerie that covers the chest and abdomen. It is also known as the ‘dudou’. Here is a Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudou <a href="#footnote-ref-3a66"></a></p>
