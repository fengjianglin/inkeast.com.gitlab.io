<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Although Pei Qianhao was extremely worried about Su Xi-er, he also understood how much the latter treasured her brother. Furthermore, Du Ling had only landed himself in this predicament because he had tried to investigate the current state of Xiliu’s affairs. As such, Pei Qianhao had no choice but to lend a hand.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yu Xiao, go reconvene with Wu Ling and bring the Princess Consort back as soon as possible.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After issuing the order, Pei Qianhao left with Du Ling’s subordinate, while Yu Xiao cracked his horse whip with Xiang Village as his destination.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before long, Pei Qianhao and the subordinate arrived at a small private house. There, they found Du Ling sitting in a chair with an ashen complexion and bandaged wound.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong? Why did you come? Where’s Xi-er?” Du Ling asked with his brows creased.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s expression was calm. “I haven’t seen her. How are you?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’m fine, and I can take care of things here on my own. Quickly go and rescue Xi-er.” He furrowed his brow and said no more, hoping that Pei Qianhao could swiftly leave.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, seeing that the other man wasn’t going anywhere, he turned and chided his guard. “Who told you to inform Prince Hao?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The guard knelt on the ground without a single word, understanding that he had gone against his master’s orders.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Naturally, Pei Qianhao could tell that Du Ling was hiding something. “What exactly happened?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Du Ling sighed, but knew that he had to relay the truth.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hua Zirong is being held captive. He’s unconscious and is in a terrible condition. I was about to think of a way to save him when an <em>anwei</em><span id="footnote-ref-dc67"><a href="#footnote-dc67">[1]</a></span> suddenly stabbed me. This alerted the guards in the palace, so I could only choose to temporarily retreat.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s eyes grew darker as he listened to Du Ling. “It looks like Li Zikang has already ascended to power, but he can’t control Xiliu alone. He must have a backer.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Could it be Yun Ruofeng?” Du Ling guessed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“No, Yun Ruofeng and Li Zikang’s dealings happened only because of you and me. He doesn’t have the ability to interfere with Xiliu’s state affairs.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Du Ling remained silent, his mind continuing to filter through the different possibilities.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao also sank into his thoughts. <em>It seems like this isn’t a small matter. I will have to properly investigate after I save Xi-er.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Now that things have come to this, let’s go to Xiang Village first. It’s time to settle the score with Yun Ruofeng.” Despite his seeming placid expression, Pei Qianhao had long since come up with a plan.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Du Ling nodded.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao and Du Ling raced to Xiang Village while the guards stayed behind to clean things up.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>~~~</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>In Xiang Village.</strong></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Late that night, the old woman who had sheltered Su Xi-er woke up to use the toilet. She was on her way when someone suddenly grabbed her, causing a scream of shock to erupt from her mouth. “What do you want?!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Where exactly is the Young Madame? If you don’t tell me, I’ll take your life.” The person uttered a cold threat as he shoved her against the ground.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Scared out of her wits, the old woman responded in a panic. “I don’t know. This old woman has no children, and I don’t know any young madame. Please spare my life!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling happened to arrive at the scene and witnessed everything, including Yun Ruofeng’s coldly glinting eyes as he stood over the old woman.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Be quiet, and don’t wake up the villagers; otherwise, else it’ll ruin things for us.” Yun Ruofeng softly warned before walking inside.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A trace of nervousness seeped into the old woman’s eyes, and she could feel her heart pounding in her throat. Her fingers clutched her own clothes in a death grip as her eyes followed Yun Ruofeng’s every movement without blinking.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She was about to push the door open when Wu Ling appeared with his people, a cold smirk at the corner of his mouth.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Yun, it’s the middle of the night, yet you’re interrogating an old woman by shoving her against the ground. Isn’t that a bit too cruel?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yun Ruofeng stopped in his tracks, but didn’t answer. A sense of danger began to loom over his heart.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Besides, I’ve never heard of Prince Yun having married a wife. Who’s this Young Madame, and why are you bullying an old woman about it?” His words were like knives jabbing into Yun Ruofeng’s heart.</p>
