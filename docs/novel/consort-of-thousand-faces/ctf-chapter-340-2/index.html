<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s hands stopped moving. <em>Doesn’t he know that I am alone with Su Xi-er? Why does he have to choose this time to disturb us?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, Commander Wu must be in trouble. This servant will go and open the door.” Su Xi-er got up from the bed, tidied her dress, and opened the door.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Wu Ling saw Su Xi-er’s face flushed red, along with Pei Qianhao’s dark expression, his heart trembled. <em>I… Did I disturb Prince Hao in the middle of something?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Pei Qianhao sat on a chair and coldly asked.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling’s voice couldn’t help but shake slightly as he implored, “Ye Qingzhu is here, and she knows that this subordinate is here as well. Prince Hao, can you think of something to help this subordinate keep her away?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You’ve already known for several years that she pesters you. Shouldn’t you be used to it by now?” Pei Qianhao’s voice was calm and showed an unconcerned attitude.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This subordinate has always treated her like a younger sister. I thought if I treated her coldly, then she would put her feelings away. I didn’t know that they would instead become stronger.” Wu Ling’s face showed a vexed expression.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er asked, “Commander Wu, how old are you this year?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling was taken aback for a moment. <em>Why is she suddenly asking me how old I am? Is she going to urge me to get married? I can’t; Prince Hao isn’t even married yet!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, he couldn’t think of anything else to say, and so he replied honestly. “I am younger than Prince Hao. Prince Hao hasn’t even gotten married yet, so this subordinate is in no hurry.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He didn’t know that his words had annoyed someone. <em>To imply that I’m old in front of Su Xi-er… I haven’t forgotten how Su Xi-er and the young and vigorous Ning Lianchen were flirting with one another.”</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Wu Ling, you take care of your own things. Get lost.” Pei Qianhao’s voice was frosty as he poured himself a cup of tea.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling was dumbstruck. <em>Get lost?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Commander Wu, you should sit down and talk to Ye Qingzhu properly. If you continue to avoid her, the same situation will only repeat itself. In the end, she may even restrain you from marrying someone else. How would you know when the person you fancy may appear?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling mused over her words. <em>She is right, I can’t hide anymore. I should talk to Ye Qingzhu properly, for both of us.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling started walking away, then he paused and turned around. “Miss Xi-er, how should I talk to Ye Qingzhu?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er felt helpless. <em>What is in his head? Doesn’t he know how to talk to a young lady?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling sighed before mustering up his courage and turning to Pei Qianhao. “Prince Hao, the Empress Dowager is your little sister, but she has other feelings towards you. What did you say to the Empress Dowager?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everyone knows that Prince Hao and the Empress Dowager has a strange relationship, but nobody dares to discuss it openly. For Wu Ling to directly ask such a question, it looks like he really felt like he was trapped in a corner by Ye Qingzhu.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er was also curious about this matter. <em>The Empress Dowager had always targeted me. In fact, she is still doing so, and still hasn’t given up on Pei Qianhao.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao didn’t get angry or annoyed. He picked up his teacup slowly and took a sip. “You want to know?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling vehemently nodded. Su Xi-er also became excited.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After a while, his low and deep voice sounded. “Very simple. This Prince smashed a redwood table with my hand at the Compassionate Peace Palace.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The corner of Wu Ling’s mouth twitched. <em>Prince Hao is so violent. He even smashed a table at the Compassionate Peace Palace!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Su Xi-er hadn’t known about this either, but felt her heart skip a beat when she heard it.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“This subordinate cannot use Prince Hao’s method. This subordinate will withdraw.” Wu Ling cupped his hands together to pay his respects before turning to leave. <em>This is something I must face by myself.</em></p>
