 <p>“Prince Hao, you’re very well-informed. This Prince had only just met with him.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Prince won’t agree to the engagement between the Pei and Xie families. Besides, Commandery Princess Xie isn’t interested in this Prince.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Yun’s laughter carried a trace of mockery. “Marriage alliances between the aristocratic clans are very common. They have nothing to do with love; only the interests of the family.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao glanced at him and replied in a steady voice, “Commandery Prince Xie, a marriage alliance with the Pei Family doesn’t have to involve this Prince marrying the Commandery Princess. There is a woman of suitable age in the Pei Family called Pei Anru. You can marry her, and the Pei and Xie families would still be bound by marriage.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>These words were tantamount to a slap to Xie Yun’s face. <em>Pei Anru is from the Pei Family’s side branch, while I am from the Xie Family’s main branch. How can a main descendant marry a side descendant? Furthermore, everyone is clear about how incorrigible Pei Anru’s father, Pei Yong, was.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Commandery Prince Xie, you’re not willing? Is it because you find Pei Anru beneath you? You should be agreeing as long as it’s a woman who can help the Xie Family.” Pei Qianhao was blatantly mocking what Xie Yun had previously said, disregarding personal love for the sake of the family’s interests.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Yun maintained his smile. “This Prince didn’t know that you were the type to make garrulously long speeches. I’m honestly impressed, but didn’t you know that Pei Anru is already disfigured? No ordinary man would fancy an ugly woman like her, but this Prince is willing to marry Su Xi-er instead.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s gaze deepened. “Su Xi-er is going to become Princess Consort Hao soon. If you want to make a move on her and don’t mind something happening to the Xie Residence, you can try me.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What big talk. The Xie Family has been an aristocratic family in Beimin for many generations; even the late Emperor didn’t dare to say such things. Your confidence is swelling by the day.” Xie Yun stopped smiling and stared straight at Pei Qianhao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The two made no further remarks as a showdown between men silently commenced. It felt as if the atmosphere in the private room had congealed, with even the sound of the wind blowing through the windows being inaudible.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After a long while, Xie Yun patted the hem of his sleeves and stood up from the chair. “This Prince shall kindly let you in on a piece of information. Nanzhao’s Prince Yun has already had his trusted confidante infiltrate Beimin’s capital. This Prince has already transferred all my soldiers elsewhere. As for how to stop Prince Yun, that’s your business, Prince Hao.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Yun then left with a smile on his face. <em>I control a third of Beimin’s military forces, and they have now been removed from the capital.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>The remaining two-thirds are mainly controlled by Pei Qianhao, but a significant number of those soldiers are at the border, while others are camping in rural areas. There aren’t many left stationed in the capital.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This move of Xie Yun was ruthless enough to risk the safety of the whole nation.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao’s eyes were slightly narrowed. <em>Don’t tell me that Prince Yun will also be coming to Beimin? I can tell that his intentions towards Su Xi-er are impure, but I wonder what his reaction would be to our marriage.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Wu Ling’s voice could be heard from outside the room. “Prince Hao, the mission you assigned has been completed.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao stood up and walked out of the private room, lowering his voice. “The corpses have been dealt with?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yes, Qin Ling has already discovered the bodies of his subordinates, and he will definitely report to Prince Yun.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Killing his subordinates was a warning to Yun Ruofeng that he could meet with the same end if he dared to enter Beimin’s capital and cause trouble. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Prince Hao, Commandery Princess Xie has already been confined by Commandery Prince Xie, so we are unable to…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao waved his hand. “You don’t need to monitor Xie Liuli. A wedge has already been driven between the Xie siblings.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling bowed. “This subordinate understands.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Have you properly looked into Feng Changqing?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Ling’s brows were knitted. “Forgive this subordinate’s incompetence. He seems to have appeared in Nanzhao almost overnight. His floriculture skills, however, are nothing fake. The Lingrui flowers have already been successfully transplanted.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pei Qianhao nodded. “Following this, you will stay put in the Prince Hao Residence.”</p>

 <p>Of course Pei Qianhao has to be behind Qin Ling's subordinates' disappearance LOL</p>
 <p>I wonder what other underhanded tactics Xie Yun is gonna resort to O_O</p>
