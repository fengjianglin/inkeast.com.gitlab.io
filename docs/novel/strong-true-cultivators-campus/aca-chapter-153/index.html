 <p><b>Chapter 153: Sleeping Over at the Goddess’s House</b></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng was frightened into a jump as he shot forth from the sofa and rushed into the kitchen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He arrived to see the scene of Liu Qingmei holding a kitchen knife in one hand and a pot in the other, jumping up and down screaming looking nowhere like an icy goddess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng stared flabbergasted with wide eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cockroach! There’s a cockroach! Hurry up and kill it.” Liu Qingmei screamed and pointed at a little cockroach on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng rolled his eyes. What is there to scream about a cockroach. The cockroach seemed to have heard Liu Qingmei’s screaming its name and actually crawled towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingmei once again gave a loud ear-piercing scream. She threw her knife and then flew towards Tang Zheng. It was unknown just where she got her strength but she actually jumped onto Tang Zheng’s back and screamed: “Hurry, kill it. Hurry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng could not help but turn around to give her a look. She really was afraid and was not acting. Moreover, she even jumped onto his back but could it really be that bad?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her busty chest pressed firmly against his back causing ripples of shock to spread through his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little cockroach, in order to appease a beauty you will have to sacrifice your life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng took large steps, without a care about the fact that he had a large package wrapped around his back, and stepped down on the cockroach.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hu!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingmei let out a breath of relief before she discovered that she was hugging Tang Zheng’s back. Moreover, she was using both hands to tightly wrap around his neck. This realization caused her to be embarrassed: “This cockroach deserved death,&nbsp;it actually made a clown out of me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher Liu, is my back very comfortable?” Tang Zheng could not help but joke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingmei gave a cold grunt and climbed down from his back, her face a bit red, as she intentionally pretended that nothing had happened. She then pointed at the door: “Stand there and guard me in case anymore cockroaches appear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng lost his smile and sat by the kitchen door watching her bustle about. Even though she was the sole daughter of the Governor she was actually pretty skilled in the kitchen, as she moved about like a head chef.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have good skills.” Tang Zhen praised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingmei said with satisfaction evident on her face: “Of course, I have cooked for more than ten years.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng was impressed as he gave her a thumbs up: “Impressive!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since my mother passed I’ve made my own food. One has to take care of themselves.” Liu Qingmei said with a strong attitude but Tang Zheng could hear bitterness from her tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s good to be independent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“”You grew up with your grandfather so you should know how to do a lot of things right?” Liu Qingmei asked while cooking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng nodded his head: “Of course. When grandfathers went out to pick up trash I stayed home and took care of housework. We separated the work between us two.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can tell that you and your grandfather are both very happy.” Liu Qingmei’s lips curled up in a hint of a smile as if she was a bit jealous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng did not deny: “Even though grandfather and I don’t have much, we depend on one another so even if its&nbsp;plain food we are very happy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai, I’m very jealous of you guys.” Liu Qingmei gave a distant sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng suddenly felt that Liu Qingmei was not as arrogant as other people. She was clearly different from him but in another sense, she was also an ordinary human with emotions. The only thing was that she tries to cover it up and that may have something to do with what she has experienced before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, three dishes and a soup was made and based on the smell and look of the dishes, Tang Zheng felt hungry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment, let’s drink a bit.” Liu Qingmei poured two cups of red wine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng was flabbergasted: “Didn’t you prohibit me from drinking last time at the dance?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Drinking a bit occasionally is fine. Don’t treat me as ignorant because I know that the amount of alcohol you students drink is not less.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If they were to add some candles whole drinking red wine and eating then it could be considered a dinner date. After setting everything up, Liu Qingmei’s expression grew serious: “Tang Zheng, thank you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher Liu, this is something I should do. Moreover, if I did not give you that information then Song Donghua would not have been forced to such ends.” Tang Zheng said with embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingmei shook her head: “He originally is a bug and these people should be pulled out. As for what he did afterwards, that is because he is not a good person and he was merely revealed for who he is. Oh right, Tang Zheng, just where did you get all that information? Don’t say that you picked it off the side of the road. It’s not like I am a three-year-old child.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng awkwardly said: “Teacher Liu, can we not dwell on this point? Everyone has their own secrets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingmei looked at him with an illuminated gaze but seeing him being so tight lip she could only give up: “Okay, I won’t ask you. Anyways, this matter is all thanks to you. Also, in the future, you don’t need to call me Teacher Liu. Call me… Sister Mei.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sister Mei?” Tang Zheng did not think that she would take the initiative to make such a request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Are you unwilling?” Liu Qingmei’s face changed suddenly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No.” Tang Zheng hurriedly splayed his arms, “I would not dare, then in the future, I will call you Sister Mei.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingmei smiled: “Actually I have always wanted a brother but bureaucratic families can only have one child so my wish never came true. Never would I have thought I would have you as a brother. Come, little Zheng, cheers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng could only accept her good intentions, smile, and tapped their cups together before taking a sip.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s eat, try my handiwork.” Liu Qingmei really acted like an older sister as she passionately passed him the dishes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng did not feel weird and out of place as he only felt warmth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After dinner, Liu Qingmei gave a stretch which made her chest more pronounced. Tang Zheng stole a glance before hurriedly lowering his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I cooked so you clean the dishes. Hurry now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng picked up the dishes and walked into the kitchen as he efficiently started to wash away. Not long later he heard a ruckus outside and he hurriedly walked out to take a look only to discover that the Governor was standing at the door only to have Liu Qingmei refuse him entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Governor Liu seeing Tang Zheng solemnly waved at him to indicate for Tang Zheng to come over. Liu Qingmei blocked him and said: “Continue washing the dishes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng smiled and returned back to the kitchen leaving the two to talk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Governor Liu could be heard solemnly saying: “Qingmei, why are you messing around? He is your student so how can he be your boyfriend?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It appears that Governor Liu already learned of Tang Zheng's identity as a student.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingmei coldly said: “Why can’t a student be my boyfriend? Moreover, finding a boyfriend is my business so what does it have to do with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am your father. So, I should naturally worry about this kind of important matter.” Governor Liu said severely with an imposing tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingmei stuck up her nose: “You care huh? Then what kind of person was Song Donghua who you looked positively upon? Can you not see it clearly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That was an exception. Moreover, it was not something I wanted to happen.” Governor Liu explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anyways, this is my personal affair so I do not need you interfering. You should return and command your own people, as for my own business I do not need your care. I am going to rest now so you should leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… you two live together?’ Governor Liu was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong with that?” Liu Qingmei retorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… you want your mom to be unable to rest in peace in heaven?” Governor Liu defeatedly said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This phrase ignited the anger within Liu Qingmei’s heart as she loudly roared: “You have no right to bring up my mother. Leave, I do not want to see you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Saying up to here she slammed the door with a ‘peng’ and then squatted down where she stood, burying her head into her arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng let out a long sigh as he walked over and patted her shoulders: “Sister Mei, why don’t you tell him the truth?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingmei lifted her head and said: “I want him to be mad. What right does he have to care about me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, you should hurry up and rest. I will return home.” Tang Zheng said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t. He is definitely waiting for you outside. If you are caught by him and accidentally reveal something that would not be good. Moreover, this kind of person likes to take it upon himself to lecture others so you will definitely be annoyed by him. You should just sleep over tonight on the sofa.” Liu Qingmei said firmly deciding for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wouldn’t this be letting him misunderstand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingmei raised her neck: “I want him to misunderstand. Just consider it as a favor from your sister to stay over tonight. Okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng was helpless and could only agree. He called his grandfather to notify him and then he received a call from Fang Shishi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tang Zheng, are you asleep?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you miss me yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng looked at Liu Qingmei by his side and said softly: “I do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingmei hugged her own arms as she looked at him with interest, with a smile that was not really a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard that Teacher Liu has been rescued.” Fang Shishi said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“En, she has been rescued so you should rest early. You need to get up early for school tomorrow.” Tang Zheng did not dare say too much and hurriedly hung up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fang Shishi?” Liu Qingmei asked with interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This little girlfriend of yours cares very much for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng gave a distant smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, you don’t want to give me a little more information about Ye Dingdang? Can’t you show a little favoritism.” Liu Qingmei asked with interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng hurriedly said: “Sister Mei, can you not joke with me. There is really nothing going on between Ye Dingdang and me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? I don’t believe you. I heard quite a lot of rumors about you two. I also have eyes of my own and it doesn’t seem fake.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aiya, I’m tired. I'm&nbsp;going to sleep.” Tang Zheng hurriedly jumped onto the sofa and laid down pretending to sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing him embarrassed, Liu Qingmei could not resist but smile looking nothing like the cold icy goddess she portrays herself to be.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng pretended to not have heard and tightly closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Zheng, good night.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis Mei, good night.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He fell asleep muddled and it was not known how much time had passed when Tang Zheng was suddenly frightened awake by a scream. He flopped up on the sofa like a fish as the sound came from Liu Qingmei’s room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not think too much as he pushed the door open. It was not locked so it opened up only to see Liu Qingmei sitting on the bed shivering. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The night lamp was turned on as her face revealed a look of horror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I had a nightmare.” Liu Qingmei said with fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, you continue sleeping. I will be in the living room. If you need anything just call out.” Liu Qingmei had on her PJ’s but looked as if she could still see his shadow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Zheng, can you sit with me for a bit.” Liu Qingmei pointed at the side of her bed and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng walked over and sat down. Liu Qingmei smoothly leaned against his shoulders and patted his shoulders before asking: “Does it still hurt?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was so greatly shocked that I did not know it was you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anyone would be like that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me take a look at it. Do you need me to put some balm on it?” Liu Qingmei pulled open his shirt.</span></p>
