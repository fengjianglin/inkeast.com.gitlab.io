 <p><b>Chapter 138: Burning With Anger</b></p>
 <p>“Tang Zheng, I miss you.” Fang Shishi said in a low voice that was both soft and filled with love. Hearing this, Tang Zheng immediately felt moved, as she continued, “I just dreamed of you when I was woken up by you opening the door, so how should you compensate me?”</p>
 <p><span style>“You dreamed of me? What did you dream of?” Tang Zheng asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Shishi gently bit her lips and coquettishly said: “Not telling you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng heard the meaning behind her voice and jokingly said: “Is it because you were thinking about doing naughty things to me, that you are too embarrassed to tell me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Shishi hurriedly shook her head in denial: “Did not, it is clearly you who is doing naughty things so how could it be me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng gave a chuckle and temporarily tossed Tian Chanzi to the corner of his mind. With a beauty in hand, how could he possibly let the devil messing around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am such an upstanding person, so how could I possibly do anything bad?” Tang Zheng refuted, with a face full of seriousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All that self-boasting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am merely speaking the truth.” Tang Zheng slowly moved up the hand he had placed on her waist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Shishi hurriedly stopped his hand: “What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I scared you just now, so I am trying to comfort you and to compensate the regret you must have over missing that beautiful dream of yours.” Tang Zheng said looking into her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You naughty person.” How could Fang Shishi not understand his intentions, as she cutely bit on her lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You dare call me a naughty person, then I might really have to play the part.” Tang Zheng said, as his hand reached her erect peak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, don’t.” Fang Shishi’s breathing unconsciously quickened, as her boobs were soft like water in Tang Zheng’s grasp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At times when girls say no when they actually want it, so of course, Tang Zheng was not stupid enough to hear her desires. For this reason, he decided to attack more aggressively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Shishi was wearing a nightgown, which Tang Zheng reached through from the bottom with his other hands, as he grabbed onto her glossy thigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Shishi’s passion was aroused, as she wrapped both her arms around his head and pushed him against her breasts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng’s head sunk into that field of softness, filled with a wonderful fragrance that stoked his blood causing it to heat up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a flip of his body he pressed her down and even though the room was in pitch blackness it did not affect their movement. The only sound that could be heard was a rustling from the bed and suppressed breathing and panting that permeated the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Will your parents hear?” Tang Zheng asked in worry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, the rooms in this house has good noise isolating effects.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng did not worry as he simply increased the vigor of his movement, causing Fang Shishi’s passionate sound to ring out which furthered fueled Tang Zheng’s fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Chongguo and She Mengqin were laying on their bed when She Mengqin suddenly got up and shook her husband awake: “Chongguo, do you hear a weird sound?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Chongguo turned his body and said in a daze: “What sound? Stop messing around and get back to sleep. Just now didn’t the security guards had said that the madman had already been chased away?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She Mengqin scratched her head and listened intently before saying to herself: “I could have sworn I heard something out of place. I can’t believe a madman made his way into our community. Just what the hell are the security guards doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop saying all this and get back to sleep. Early tomorrow morning I still need to get back to the company, as there have been some improvements in our project and we can barely take care of everything that is going on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tang Zheng that little brat is really a saint to actually get Fire Phoenix to listen to him.” She Mengqin said, as she still couldn’t believe it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t look down upon Tang Zheng, as even though I previously thought he was a good for nothing after our few interactions, I feel that I am more and more unable to see through him. He is only how old now? 18. 18 and he has such capabilities, just think back to what you were doing when you were 18.” Fang Chongguo’s interest was caught by the topic of Tang Zheng, as he decided it best to once again solemnly advise his wife so that she did not cause any further problems.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When I was 18 I was learning in school.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right, he is also learning but aside from learning he also has connections with people of high status in the underworld. Moreover, think about his family background and how he has no advantages yet still manages to have some skill. Now, tell me how much of a potential do you think he has?” Fang Chongguo analyzed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She Mengqin pondered for a moment and felt inferior: “This little brat is simply too abnormal, but Shishi that little girl seems to have steeled her heart over him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hei, this is to say that our daughter’s gaze is better than yours. Right now there are so many guys, but to truly find someone who is sincere and has the ability is difficult. Our daughter really knows how to see people and has good luck too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heng, why are you making that little brat sound so good? Our daughter is also not bad but I still must keep an eye on them, as currently, they’re in the throes of their passion, so we can not let anything out of hand occur otherwise Shishi will really have to pay bitterly.” She Mengqin said with worry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Chongguo also nodded his head: “This point is indeed worthy of attention but you do not need to interfere too much, otherwise you may push her to him. Shishi, this little girl may seem delicate by nature but is actually very strong inside, as once she decides on something even 14 horses wouldn’t be able to restrain her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course I know that, as she has the same temperament as you and does not take after me at all.” She Mengqin said with dissatisfaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Being like me is good because if she was like you then shit really will happen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you trying to say?” She Mengqin said with wide eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright, I won’t say anymore. Didn’t you say that you heard a disturbance? Then why don’t you go take a look and once you finish, stop thinking about random stuff and get back to sleep.” Fang Chongguo waved his arms and closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She Mengqin gave her husband a cold stare and hugged her blanket, as she walked out looking at all four sides. She did not see anything weird and then went back to Fang Shishi’s room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shishi, are you asleep?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the room, they were reaching their peak, when they were frightened into a stop by the sound outside. They looked at one another, as even in the darkness they were able to feel the shock and surprise on each other’s face. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“How come your mom is back?” Tang Zheng hugged Fang Shishi and said in a quiet voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Shishi punched his shoulder and said: “How should I know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shishi, are you asleep?” She Mengqin once again asked from outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What should I do? If my mom sees, then it would be so awkward.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think I want to be seen? Relax, it should be fine if we don’t say anything, as she will think I have gone to sleep and will leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng gave an ‘oh’ before slowing down his movement. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Shishi suppressed the emotion within her heart, as she patted his shoulder and said: “Stop moving, otherwise my mom might hear us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you say that the noise isolating effects of the rooms in your house are good?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But my mom is right outside, so no matter how good it is they may hear some slight sound.” Fang Shishi shyly and urgently said, as if the usually obedient daughter was discovered by her mom in this scene, then she really would have nowhere to put her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng also understood the seriousness of the situation and did not dare be rash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kacha.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, the sound of the door lock opening rang out and the two were frightened into a jump. Fang Shishi said in shock: “How come you didn’t lock the door?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your door wasn’t locked, so I just slipped in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What should we do if my mom sees us, then wouldn’t we be as good as dead?.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you say that your mom wouldn’t come in here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She would normally not come in without my permission.” Fang Shishi urgently said as she felt like crying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She Mengqin was paranoid after the madman came by and was worried when her daughter didn’t answer, hence she decided to go in and take a look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and say something to stop your mom, otherwise she will come in.” Tang Zheng reacted immediately and hastily said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Shishi did not have time to think much on it and hurriedly yelled: “What, mom, I almost fell asleep too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her voice was filled with worry and contained a slight tremble, but She Mengqin did not detect it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of the door opening finally stopped, as She Mengqin said: “Oh, then hurry up and sleep. I just wanted to check if you were asleep or not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom, I’m sleeping now. You rest early too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I will go back to sleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They both let out a breath of relief, as they exchanged mutual glances. They nearly couldn’t refrain from laughing, as this high-pressure situation was simply too exciting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s all because of you that I was nearly made into a clown.” Fang Shishi coquettishly said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I did not know that your mom would return.” Tang Zheng felt innocent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and go lock the door, otherwise she might return again and we would be in big trouble.” Fang Shishi pointed and advised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I will go lock the door.” Tang Zheng quickly but cautiously went to lock the door, before jumping back into bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be careful. Hurry up, as we were disrupted just. So annoying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right, your mom really doesn’t plan to let us finish, nearly scaring me weak*</span><span style>1</span><span style>.” </span><span style>*1:TL: his little brother going limp</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me touch.” Fang Shishi reached out her hand, “Just where is it soft? Heng, you liar!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“With such a beautiful girlfriend such as you, wouldn’t it be a shame if I went weak*</span><span style>1</span><span style>. Let’s continue.” Tang Zheng pushed himself on her and the room once again rang out with noise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Quieter, I suspect that my mom might have heard something.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you slow down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were worried, as they laid in the darkness, their warm-hearted voices, the incomparable excitement, and allure could be said to be one of the most beautiful and splendid moments in life. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But there were some people who did not enjoy it, as Daoist Tianji was currently hiding in a corner looking at the row after rows of villas where countless tens of police were still patrolling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just now he had injured quite a few bodyguards, coupled with the fact that the people who lived in these villa enjoyed lavish lives, so the police did not dare be negligent and would not leave if they did not find the culprit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They ended up forming groups of two’s and three’s as they patrolled the surroundings, making it impossible for Daoist Tianji to approach.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Daoist Tianji never felt so vexed, as he was burned into a beggar-like and was also chased by the police, simply too unlucky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even so, he did not plan on giving up, as aside from gaining revenge for his disciple, he was also greatly interested by what knowledge Tang Zheng possesses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The intricacy of his sword technique, the oddity of his True Fire, all of these he must make clear, as he unconsciously believed that Tang Zheng surely possessed a heaven-defying secret. If he were able to possess this secret, then he would naturally reap great benefits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hence, he would definitely not give up on Tang Zheng, as he continued to observe without blinking, as he was aware that Tang Zheng may appear at anytime.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the sky gradually brightened to reveal the white of clouds and a night on watch, Daoist Tianji has not seen a hint of Tang Zheng’s whereabouts and couldn’t help but feel helpless, as he felt indignant with rage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if I have to dig a hole here and stake out, I will definitely catch him.” He gnashed his teeth and fiercely muttered to himself.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Guards, the madman is here! Hurry up and apprehend him!” Suddenly, a police spotted Daoist Tianji and hurriedly gave a loud and angry roar, as a flock of police rushed over.</span></p>
