 <p><strong>Chapter 152: Future Son-in-law</strong></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng held onto Liu Qingmei’s hand and walked out into the courtyard to stand in front of Song Donghua. The reason he did this was not to show off but to let Liu Qingmei untie the knot in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was without a doubt that Song Donghua’s action has left a deep shadow within Liu Qingmei’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng had read a book about a young woman who was threatened and because she was unable to move on she wallowed in hopelessness until she had depression and ultimately committed suicide. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng did not wish for Liu Qingmei to undergo the same results hence he decided to strike the iron while it’s hot so that she can remove the shadow and fear from within her heart. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, while walking towards Song Donghua, Tang Zheng could clearly feel her fear and terror yet he did not stop his steps and continued to walk towards Song Donghua, looking down on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Donghua trembled up on the ground in a curled up position, while looking up angrily at the two. He was ready to start cursing at them but Tang Zheng beat him to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a stomp, Tang Zheng stepped on the others finger causing Song Donghua to scream out in pain. Liu Qingmei hearing this scream unconsciously look a step back but was stopped by Tang Zheng’s firm grip.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng’s soft voice rang out: “Don’t be afraid, he is unable to hurt you. He is but a dead dog waiting to sit in jail.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng’s voice acted like a charm as it caused Liu Qingmei to calm down. As she looked at Song Donghua crying out pitifully in pain, she gradually felt the fear within her heart lesson and she fiercely said: “This kind of person must be heavily punished otherwise who knows how many people he will harm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng let out a breath of relief because as long as she was able to face Song Donghua then the shadow within her heart would be greatly diminished. He nodded his head and said: “He will not be able to harm anyone in the future. Department Chief Deng, why haven’t you apprehended him yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Maocai wanted nothing more than to demonstrate his service in front of Liu Qingmei hence he fiercely grabbed Song Donghua, busted out his handcuffs and slapped it on before dragging him to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng then said to Lin Hu: “you guys first go back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Hu and his men did not say anything more and hurriedly left the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are they?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My friends.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did you find this place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng pointed at Deng Maocai who had walked towards the entrance to the courtyard and said: “Department Chief Deng thought that Song Donghua might have escaped here so he took me along.Thankfully we made it in time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Maocai feeling extremely thankful, stopped in his steps, turned around and gave Liu Qingmei a nod, before turning around to hurriedly bring Song Donghua to the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s return.” Tang Zheng said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingmei nodded her head and the two walked towards the police car holding hands like a couple. Song Donghua on the other hand was sent straight towards the police station as no one wanted to see him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are we going to the police office?” Deng Maocai saw the two’s intimate action but pretended not to see it as he carefully asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingmei nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Maocai raced the car to the police office as if he took a shot of chicken blood. He had already notified his superiors midway through the trip that he had already rescued Liu Qingmei while also having apprehended Song Donghua. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This news rapidly spread to everyone related to this case so when Tang Zheng and them stepped into the police office, a train of cars followed after them. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The people that followed basically jogged up, with Jiang Yongda leading the way. When he heard that Liu Qingmei was safe and sound, he felt as if a heavy burden was lifted from his heart and he immediately rushed over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even so when he saw Liu Qingmei he couldn’t help but feel his heart beat fiercely against his chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Song Donghua did not succeed his animal like actions could be seen by how Liu Qingmei was wearing someone else’s clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, he also saw the bare chested Tang Zheng but he did not have time to care about the other so with a few quick steps he arrived before Liu Qingmei and said with concern: “Qingmei, it is good to see that you are okay. I was really frightened to death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingmei had recovered her icy demeanor and it was even more colder than before as there was not even a hint of a smile nor did she deign to give a reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Yongda awkwardly coughed as he turned his gaze towards Song Donghua and Jiang Yongda’s anger immediately soared. With a fierce slap, he smacked the others face and roared: ‘Song Donghua, you bastard. You dare kidnap someone in broad daylight? Who gave you a dog’s guts?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Donghua drooped his head like a beaten dog, unable to even give a retort as he hid by the side of the car. Nowhere did he possess the previous mighty air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He only acted because of his great rage but even so he clearly knew what the results would be.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Putong!</span></p>
 <p><span style>His knees gave out as he knelt in front of Liu Qingmei. Knocking his head against the ground he pleaded: “Qingmei, please forgive me. It was intentional. Please spare me. Please don’t let them send me to jail.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingmei had on an icy face as she did not say a word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Yongda seeing the situation, waved his hand in disgust: “Take him away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qingmei, please spare me. I am not a man, I am an animal. Please just let me go this once….” Song Donghua pleaded in hopelessness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since you admit that you are an animal then you should definitely be locked up in prison.” Liu Qingmei said bluntly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Yongda hurriedly gave his men the eye and Song Donghua was dragged into the police department.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, another car stopped in front of the police department and a fifty year old lookingman stepped off the car. Upon seeing Liu Qingmei he quickly walked towards her and concernedly said: “Qingmei, are you okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingmei coldly looked at the person and said: “It won’t kill me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad is worried to death, thankfully your mom is protecting you in heaven so that you are fine.” Governor Liu said with lingering fear in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire police department’s atmosphere became heavy with the presence of the governor. No one dared to take to big a breath as this small police department had never seen such a large character before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t bring up my mother.” Liu Qingmei said without the least bit polite.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Governor Liu felt a bit awkward. His gaze then turned towards Jiang Yongda and he sternly asked: “Yongda, just what is going on? Your secretary actually kidnapped my daughter? How do you teach your people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Yongda felt his knees go soft as he felt cold sweat emerge on his forehead. He hurriedly explained: “Boss, it was my fault. I did not protect Qingmei well. Upon self-examination, Song Donghua’s actions was beyond my expectations. I did not expect him to be so sick and mad. I bear great responsibility towards this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Governor Liu, waved a hand to cut off his self examination. Speak, “Did you capture him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is captured.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did you capture him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This…” Jiang Yongda was speechless as he did not know how the events played out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingmei pointed at Deng Maocai and said: “It was Department Chief Deng who saved me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Maocai felt so happy that he felt flowers may blossom in his heart. This joy was even stronger than when he first married his wife and so he put forth all his willpower to prevent himself from smiling. He sternly greeted the Governor deeply and said: “This is what I should do as a police.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Governor Liu gave Deng Maocai a deep look as he took the initiative to stretch out his hands. Deng Maocai used both hands to grasp the extended hand, as he felt unspeakable joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These are the kind of people that are able to protect the people. Good!” Governor Liu praised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Other people looked at Deng Maocai with jealous gaze as this brat actually had such dog gone luck. He was actually able to scoop up such great merit. With a single word from Governor Liu, Deng Maocai would definitely be able to rise in rank.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Maocai felt great excitement as he couldn’t help but sneak a peak at Tang Zheng. This was all given to him by Tang Zheng and at this moment he simply felt as if Tang Zheng was his parent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng was barechested amidst a group of bureaucrats and police officers, standing out, but he did not mind at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Governor Liu’s gaze finally fell on Tang Zheng’s and he asked: “And who is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Yongda previously did not have a chance to interject but upon hearing Governor Liu’s question he finally saw his chance and hurriedly said: ‘he is Qingmei’s boyfriend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boyfriend?” Governor Liu’s eyes flashed with a light as he stared at Tang Zheng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The others were also shocked as this was Governor Liu’s future son-in-law. Oh lord,they must firmly engrave his face into their member so that they can bugger up to him if given the chance in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng helplessly looked at Liu Qingmei as she contrary to his expectations did not provide an explanation. She even pulled Tang Zheng and said: “I want to go home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one dared stop even though they originally wanted to do some sucking up. Governor Liu only nodded his head: “I’ll send you back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need, I’ll send myself back. Tang Zheng, let’s go.” Tang Zheng was hauled away from the police station under the many countless stares.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two sat in a taxi and Tang Zheng finally couldn’t help but gave a low sigh: “I never thought that your identity would be so shocking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingmei wrinkled her eyebrows and said: “He is him, I am me. Do not throw me in with him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t have a good relationship with him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingmei hesitated a bit before saying: “Back then when he was rising through the ranks of the government my mom fell heavily ill but he did not even spare her a glance. My mom ended up passing away without getting to see him for one last time. For this reason, I hate him and anyone who works for the government. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng was speechless, no wonder their relationship was so stiff. The two returned to Liu Qingmei’s house where Liu Qingmei invited Tang Zheng to take a seat: “I’m going to first take a shower. You take a seat first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng nodded his head to signify that she should go do her thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Warm water poured over her body gradually calming Liu Qingmei down. Her heart was still palpitating as she looked at her own curvy body which was the subject of so many men craving and attention. This time, it had actually brought upon her great danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thankfully, Tang Zheng saved her and she felt that she could not get a clear grasp of Tang Zheng. Even so, she was able to feel that just by his presence she could feel safe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her lips unconsciously curled up in a thin smile as her heart gradually underwent change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she finished showering she returned back to the living room where she returned Tang Zheng his shirt and said: “Put it on, otherwise you might get cold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng hurriedly threw on his clothes as a faint fragrance assaulted his nose. He then realized that this clothes had come in intimate contact with her and had her lingering scent causing his heartbeat to quicken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingmei seemed to have realized this and her face turned red. She hurriedly said: “To thank you, I’ll cook dinner for you tonight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to be so polite.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You won’t give me a chance to thank you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go, come buy vegetables with me.” Liu Qingmei regained her icy cold goddess image but her voice contained a trace of intimacy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They went downstairs to the nearby markey and bought some vegetables. Once they returned home Liu Qingmei hurriedly got to work leaving Tang Zheng to sit on the sofa with nothing to do but to watch TV.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style>Suddenly, a scream rang out from the kitchen.</span></p>
