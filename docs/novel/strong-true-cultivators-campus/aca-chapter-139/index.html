 <p><b>Chapter 139: To Broaden one’s Horizons</b></p>
 <p><span style>Early morning, the air was fresh, the birds were singing and fragrant flowers were in abundance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng did a stretch as he discovered that Fang Shishi was still sleeping by his side her face was one of satisfaction as she had a blissful smile, looking exceptionally beautiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yesterday night the two were tossing and turning vigorously only sleeping near the latter part of the night. Aside from the last time they were intimate was at Tang Zheng’s new home and that was there first so this was their second. For this reason, they were not as unsure of what to do but were as fierce as a storm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Shishi was also accustomed to him as they sunk into the beauty of the experience as she had her demands of him. Thankfully Tang Zheng’s had enough strength so he was able to completely conquer her as he not only had the brains but the body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng was used to waking early so even though he slept late he was not tired in the least as his body was different from ordinary humans. On the contrary, he was in great spirit and felt bursting with energy and vitality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yesterday night he had also absorbed quite a bit of yin qi so he temporarily did not have to worry about dying by bodily combustion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Shishi’s immaculate face had a blush of red as her eyelashes twitched a bit. Tang Zheng saw and knew that she had awoken but was pretending to be asleep so he intentionally reached his hands into the blankets and grabbed onto that heart palpitating softness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her body trembled slightly as even though the two had been intimate before her body was still sensitive and with a gentle caress from Tang Zheng it easily moved her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing her still continue to pretend Tang Zheng broadened his movement and the vigor in his action.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Shishi finally could not resist anymore as she gave a yelp and opened her eyes wide before playfully pouting: “Doing naughty things so early in the morning. You are so bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And just yesterday night someone very much liked the naughty me and even wanted me to be naughtier.” Tang Zheng’s lips curled up in a slight curl as he gave a playful smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are not allowed to talk about it!” Fang Shishi urgently sat up and clamped her hands over Tang Zheng’s mouth, causing her blankets to fall to her waist and exposing her upper body to the sunlight. Seeing this Tang Zheng’s hands reached over like claws to grab them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve exposed yourself.” Tang Zheng shrugged his shoulder and jokingly said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heng, I won’t let you see.” Fang Shishi grabbed her blanket and escaped from Tang Zheng’s grasp&nbsp;as she covered herself up from sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have long since seen everything clearly as I had a good look yesterday night so even if I do not see it I can still imagine it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…. naughty!” Fang Shishi’s face was like peach blossoms as both eyes seemed to become wet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shishi, get up and come get breakfast. I’ll send you to school in a bit.” She Mengqin called from the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright mom, I’ll be there shortly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and get dressed.” Fang Shishi urged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want me to help you put on clothes?” Tang Zheng volunteered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Shishi gouged him out with her eyes and said: “No need, I’m sure you will do something bad, as all you know how to do is take off other people’s clothes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two put on their clothes, washed and brushed up before walking out but Fang Shishi stopped in her steps and turned to look at Tang Zheng before saying with embarrassment: “What will we do when my dad and mom see you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng shrugged and said without the least bit of fear: “They will know sooner or later, so might as well sooner than later. Moreover, in the future, it will be easy for us to be together.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heng, I let you take advantage of me this time.” Fang Shishi wrinkled her nose looking cute to the extreme, before opening the door with a creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two held hands and followed the winding of the stairs toward the dining room where Fang Chongguo and She Mengqin were originally talking. When the two turned and saw this scene they both stopped and stared at the two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Shishi’s face flashed with bashfulness but she did not loosen her grip on Tang Zheng’s hand. In fact, she gathered her courage and took steps forward with Tang Zheng. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uncle, Aunt, good morning.” Tang Zheng discovered that his face was becoming thicker and thicker as he did not feel the slightest hint of fear as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Fang Shishi, on the other hand, lowered her head in embarrassment as she did not dare look at her parents. Seeing her appearances, as those who have gone through the same experiences, how could Fang Chongguo and She Mengqin not understand what is going on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They gave each other a glance, as they unconsciously thought back to last night conversation and how they were going to keep a close eye on Fang Shishi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, through the course of one night. Oh god, the two were nearly pushed off the edge as this all happened way too quickly as even the calmly disposed Fang Chongguo felt his expression change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She Mengqin stared at Fang Shishi as if she were about to fly into a rage but Fang Chongguo seeing that the situation was not good quickly restrained her hand. Since the matter already happened then flying into a rage would not help anything, in fact, it may even exacerbate the situation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It seems like their daughter really has grown. Fang Chongguo let out an audible sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yesterday, Tang Zheng was clearly not at their house yet he was currently standing in front of him? But, this issue did not stump them as they were able to imagine Tang Zheng slipping into their house with Fang Shishi’s help.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She Mengqin suddenly thought back to the weird noise she heard last night. It must’ve been the two doing something and to think that she nearly entered the room, stumbling into their act.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though she felt a bit angry she also felt a bit glad as it would simply be too weird if she were to walk in on that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shishi, come and sit!” She Mengqin firmly said in a bad tone, suppressing her angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Shishi obediently went over to sit down, pulling Tang Zheng by her side. Fang Chongguo instructed the servant to bring another set of utensils as his gaze finally stabilized on Tang Zheng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking him squarely in the eyes, Tang Zheng gave a light cough before calmly asking: “Uncle Fang, how has the demolition work been?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Chongguo let out a sigh as if he were in Tang Zheng’s position he would definitely not be able to pull off such a calm countenance. This Tang Zheng was not simple at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But at this time he couldn’t possibly make it easy for Tang Zheng otherwise the little brat may try to take a mile when given an inch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For this reason, Fang Chongguo maintained a solemn face that was not quite angry as he deeply said: “The demolition process has started and Fire Phoenix’s company does not fail to live up to its reputation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s good to hear.” Tang Zheng nodded his head and started to eat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time even Tang Zheng admired his own courage and calmness as if it were him from before he would feel weak. It seems that after experiencing so many weird events this situation was no longer to cause him to be moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eyes firmly on Tang Zheng, She Mengqin fiercely glared at him and pulled Fang Shishi who was almost finished eating away: “You, follow me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Shishi gave Tang Zheng a reluctant gaze but upon seeing the encouragement from his eyes she slightly nodded her head and followed her mom into another room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stand straight!” She Mengqin crossed her arms in front of her chest as she started to interrogate Fang Shishi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Shishi pouted and complained: “What, mom, I was still eating too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eating? You still have the heart to eat? Did you take a good look at what you did?” She Mengqin angrily roared but still tried her best to keep her voice from transmitting to the dining room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her anger knew no bounds as she tried her best to suppress her voice, so it wouldn't be heard in the dining room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Shishi took a deep breath, as she had long since expected her mother’s anger and calmly said: “I know what I did.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think you don’t know what you did. You guys are still students so how could you?” She Mengqin faced her daughter but did not dare use words that were too harsh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what if we are still students? We are both eighteen and are adults. If this were in the past then we would already be married and have kids, so what is this? Moreover, both of us are in love with each other and you also did not resist before.” Fang Shishi explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We indeed did not resist, but we did not think that you guys would progress so quickly.” She Mengqin couldn’t help but regret, as if she knew earlier, then she would firmly guard over her daughter. Even so, she possibly couldn’t follow them everywhere and there was no way she could possibly guard their house door against Tang Zheng this cherry-picker, without sleeping at night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no way to keep a guard up forever and seeing her daughters firmness, She Mengqin was speechless, as she could only fiercely clench her teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Shishi seeing her mom’s anger lessen, quickly hooked her mom’s arms and said with a smile: “Mom, I know you are looking out for me but I also have my own feelings and thoughts. I too know how to look out for my own interests, so you should stop worrying as Tang Zheng really treats me well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heng, he treats you well right now, but that does not guarantee you that he will continue to do so in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He will definitely continue to treat me well. I know him.” She indeed did know Tang Zheng well and had confidence in the words she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How long have you know each other and you still dare to say that you know him well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three years. Its been a long time huh? I remember when you and dad got married, you had only known each other for two years.” Fang Shishi said mischievously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are talking about you guys, so how come you pulled the conversation towards your father and me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Shishi gave a chuckle: “I really envy you and dad, as I want to be as joyful as you two.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She Mengqin opened her mouth as if to speak but no words would come out, as she possibly couldn’t say that she was not joyful. This daughter of hers had really grown up and knew how to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She let out a long sigh and said: “Shishi, don’t blame your mother for her bad temperament, as I have truly seen&nbsp;too many worthless bastards, so I want you to have the best.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Shishi hurriedly nodded: “Of course, I know mom treats me well. This is forever engraved in my heart but Tang Zheng really isn’t a worthless bastard who will forget favors. At the same time, he is also pretty amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Speaking up to here her eyes lit up, as her large eyes contained respect and love.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, how could She Mengqin not understand her daughter’s feelings, as she too was also a woman and was also a youngster before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop, I still do not think he is all that amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Shishi stuck out her tongue and internally said, ‘mom, Tang Zheng is a cultivator and with his help, your daughter is one too’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But let me say this once very clearly, that if I ever see him walk out from your room early in the morning, then I will definitely drive him out.” She Mengqin slightly threatened, as she clearly still contained a bit of anger towards Tang Zheng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Shishi quickly promised: “Don’t worry, there won’t be a second time.” She internally said that at most next time she will have Tang Zheng leave before the sun rises. The reason is since he is so amazing this will be nothing for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Zheng and Fang Chongguo sat alone at the dinner table. Tang Zheng did not say a single word, as he calmly ate breakfast. Fang Chongguo, on the other hand, d did not have any appetite, as even his normal habit of reading the newspaper was currently put on hold, as he stared at Tang Zheng as if he were waiting for the other to say something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, what kind of person was Tang Zheng. This little bit of eye power did not move him at all, as in a moment he put down his food and said: “Uncle, I am full now. You enjoy your meal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing him get up to leave, Fang Chongguo was finally unable to remain seated.</span></p>
