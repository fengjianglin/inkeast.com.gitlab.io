 <p><b>Chapter 52: Invincible Throughout?</b></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaolong!” What was out of his expectations was Li Lu’s familiar voice calling out to him the moment he stepped into the classroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong looked in the direction the sound came from and saw Li Lu waving enthusiastically at him, smiling and exposing two lovely dimples on her cheeks; Huang Xiaolong smiled with a trace of helplessness inside – he’s in the same class as Li Lu?</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Huang Xiaolong didn’t know was that every batch of new students was placed together in the same class because there was only one class for every year.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong’s appearance in the classroom attracted the new students’ attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s that ‘awesome’ waste!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“On the registration day, his guards beat up Academy teachers, not only did nothing happen to him, even all his fees were exempted, too awesome!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Awesome? No matter how ‘awesome’, he’s still a waste relying on his family’s background to get in. If it wasn’t for the recommendation letter, is he qualified to enter the Cosmic Star Academy? In my opinion, at the most, his martial spirit is just a grade six!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of the new students saw what happened between Huang Xiaolong and Xiong Meiqi on the day of the registration, and the scuffle that took place with Zhong Yuan and the rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong’s brows slowly creased as the gossip entered his ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaolong, sit beside me!” Li Lu ignored the discussions around her, went up to Huang Xiaolong and pulled his hand to a seat next to hers. Huang Xiaolong shook his head and smiled, but it wasn’t nice to refuse Li Lu’s kind intention in public.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong had just sat down when a young blonde boy about ten years old, in a pale gold robe walked into the classroom; this blonde boy was born with delicate handsome features, albeit a little arrogant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Teng!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is Jiang Teng? From what I’ve heard, on registration day, his martial spirit was determined to be Sacred Bright Tiger, a grade eleven superb martial spirit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since our Cosmic Star Academy’s founding, there has never been a superb talent martial spirit appearance before. When this matter was reported to the Principal and Vice Principal, both of them already declared they wanted to take him as their disciple!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Both the Principal and the Vice Principal?! This has never happened in the Cosmic Star Academy’s history before!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the midst of the students’ vibrant discussions, the blond boy walked to an empty seat in the middle of the class and sat down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong, who was on the second row, watched the blond boy; this boy’s martial spirit grade was out of his expectation– a grade eleven martial spirit, the Sacred Bright Tiger!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if he felt Huang Xiaolong’s gaze, the blond boy Jiang Teng turned his head, and their eyes met in the air. In that instant, in the blond boy’s eyes, undisguised loathing flashed across them – the same emotion that flickered across Xiong Meiqi’s eyes when she looked at Huang Xiaolong on registration day as he gave her his recommendation letter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Jiang Teng turned his head back in contempt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong noted the other side’s strong dislike and contempt, while his heart sneered; whatever good impression he had of the other side, instantly dropped to the lowest point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the students were discussing in whispers, a cold female teacher suddenly entered the classroom and it was Xiong Meiqi!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Xiong Meiqi, Huang Xiaolong was a little startled: </span><i><span style>don’t tell me this female bear is the class teacher?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xiong Meiqi entered the room and stepped up to the dais: “I am your Class Teacher, Xiong Meiqi!” Her words confirmed Huang Xiaolong’s guess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Xiong Meiqi finished saying that, her eyes were like daggers as she glared at Huang Xiaolong for a split second.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong was calm and indifferent, directly ignoring Xiong Meiqi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing his response, or more accurately lack of response, Xiong Meiqi snickered coldly and went on to inform the class some of Cosmic Star Academy’s rules, the course content that they will be learning in the coming days and some of the methods to advance in class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were only three class years in Cosmic Star Academy: Sixth Order and below in the First Year classes; a breakthrough from the peak late-Sixth Order to the Seventh Order gave one eligibility for taking the Second Year assessment test. Those who passed, advanced to the upper year class– as for the Third Year, students were required to be a Ninth Order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyone who reached twenty-two years of age yet failed to enter the Second Year class would be expelled from the Cosmic Star Academy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiong Meiqi said: “To breakthrough to the Seventh Order before twenty-two is hard for some of you, but it is not so for those with grade nine and above martial spirits. With our Cosmic Star Academy’s nurturing, as long you are willing to work hard, in general, most of you can breakthrough Seventh Order before reaching twenty-two years old. As for wastes that comes in using recommendation letters, no matter how much the Academy nurtures and guides them, a waste is fated to remain a waste.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if intentionally or maybe not, Xiong Meiqi furtively shot a glance at Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These wastes with recommendation letters at most possess grade seven or grade six martial spirits, maybe even grade five; even if they cultivate till forty years old, sixty years old, they still have no chance of breaking through to the Seventh Order. Thus, they have only one ending – expulsion from the Academy!” Xiong Meiqi continued, and as if ‘hate’ wasn’t enough, her eyes stared at Huang Xiaolong with an icy coldness as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the new students in the classroom looked at Huang Xiaolong, turning him the center of attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Xiong Meiqi’s voice tone suddenly changed, her cold expression replaced with an amiable smile, “I would like to introduce everyone to our Academy’s most talented genius in more than one hundred years, Student Jiang Teng!” Xiong Meiqi indicated at the blond boy when she finished the introduction. “Student Jiang Teng possesses a grade eleven martial spirit, the Sacred Bright Tiger; he’s our Academy’s first student who has a superb talent martial spirit since its founding.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, Jiang Teng stood up from his chair and nodded to the surrounding classmates, his head held a little too high.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiong Meiqi led the class in a thunderous applause.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feeling the envious and admiring gazes on his body, Jiang Teng’s demeanor became even haughtier, but when he caught a glimpse of Huang Xiaolong’s indifference as he sat there, clearly having no intention to join in the applause, Jiang Teng’s smile reduced slightly. The dislike in his eyes increased a notch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this point, Xiong Meiqi abruptly spoke, “Let me tell everyone a fantastic piece of news: our Student Jiang Teng just reached ten years old, but he’s already a Fourth Order warrior! A peak early-Fourth Order!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ten years old already is a peak early-Fourth Order!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is too scary!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shock was evident in every new student’s expression and at the same time, envy and admiration almost shot through the roof as they looked admirably at Jiang Teng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Teng, the Principal and Vice Principal mentioned that you had learned battle skills?” Xiong Meiqi smilingly asked Jiang Teng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s true, Teacher!” Jiang Teng answered with a laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you demonstrate and let everyone see?” Xiong Meiqi requested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay,” Jiang Teng nodded and walked out proudly to an empty spot in front the classroom. He stood still at first, then suddenly, a bright light burst out from his body, revealing a huge tiger hovering behind him. This huge tiger’s entire body shone brightly, breathing out radiant flames. It let out a deafening roar, exuding a superb talent martial spirit’s oppressive atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Teng leaped up and bellowed: “Tiger Flame Palm!” one after another tiger paw was stamped in midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While watching, the new students applauded and cheered nonstop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Huang Xiaolong shook his head. This Tiger Flame Palm should be a high grade Mysterious rank battle skill and it wasn’t bad, but in Jiang Teng’s movements, it was full of weakness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Listening to the applause and cheers, Jiang Teng exerted more effort in his performance and at the end of it, he complacently looked down at his classmates, shouting “Sacred Bright Tiger appear, invincible throughout the world!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Invincible throughout?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When Huang Xiaolong heard Jiang Teng’s shout, he failed to hold in his laughter and a ‘puff’ broke out. Huang Xiaolong’s laughter came so abruptly that the whole class abruptly fell into silence. Everyone’s attention zoomed onto Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiong Meiqi lost her smile and stared icily at Huang Xiaolong, screaming “Huang Xiaolong, stand up!”</span></p>
