 <p><b>Chapter 377: Blessed Buddha Temple</b></p>
 <p><span> “For your younger brother Chen Dingyuan’s sake?” Huang Xiaolong taunted.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Yes, yes, yes.” Chen Luoguang saw a ray of hope, nodded his head with vigor.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Do you know how your younger brother Chen Dingyuan died?” Huang Xiaolong’s cold voice sounded in Chen Luoguang’s ear.</span></p>
 <p><span>Chen Luoguang blanked, perhaps due to fear, he missed the meaning of Huang Xiaolong’s words, “How did my younger brother die?” A second later his face ashen, staring at Huang Xiaolong, could it be…?!</span></p>
 <p><span>“You!” The word flew out his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span>That year, his younger brother Chen Dingyuan was assassinated in a Chen Mansion’s small courtyard. All these years, the Chen Family had been searching for the killer, but until now, they hadn’t found any clues.</span></p>
 <p><span>Now, this black-haired young man in front of him was…?!</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong didn’t speak, giving the giant puppet a kill order. The ancient puppets were controlled by Huang Xiaolong through the soul mark he branded in their consciousness, with simply a thought, he could pass his order to the giant puppets.</span></p>
 <p><span>Before the fearful eyes of Chen Luoguang, the two giant puppets moved forward, their hands raised and slammed down, burying Chen Luoguang feet first through the floor, ending the same way the first guard did. &nbsp;From the neck down, Chen Luoguang’s body was drilled into the ground, while his head exploded to pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span>The remaining four of Chen Luoguang’s guards were terrified, wanting to flee, but the two giant puppets struck a punch across space, striking all of them down to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span>The people around witnessed seven people being killed one by one, yet no one dared to utter a single word nor move.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong said to Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu.</span></p>
 <p><span>Both Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu complied in unison. Huang Xiaolong walked out of the restaurant with Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu following behind. Everyone moved away, giving Huang Xiaolong a wide berth.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, as Huang Xiaolong was passing by the fatty, he teased, “Does this brother still want to buy my two guards?”</span></p>
 <p><span>The fatty nearly jumped out of his skin hearing that, his knees went weak, immediately falling down, looking like he was about to cry, “No no no, I don’t want, not right, brother, I mean Senior, I was wrong.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong was merely teasing, seeing the fatty was about to burst his liver in fear, he chuckled softly. Not making things difficult for the fatty, the three of them left the restaurant.</span></p>
 <p><span>The fatty watched the three people leave until their figures disappeared from view, sighing in relief seeing that Huang Xiaolong did not make things difficult for him. It was as if something was breathing cold air down his neck the entire time.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Lucky, lucky.” He panted, but no one knew what he was lucky about.</span></p>
 <p><span>Some time after Huang Xiaolong left, the initially dead silent restaurant suddenly exploded in a furor.</span></p>
 <p><span>The atmosphere in the whole restaurant was boiling.</span></p>
 <p><span>Chen Family’s Eldest Young Master was killed! For Blessed Buddha Empire, this was definitely a shocking news!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Chen Luoguang is the recognized next-in-line successor of the Chen Family, but he was killed on this trip, I wonder how the Chen Family will retaliate!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“How else will they retaliate? Chen Family’s Patriarch will definitely be livid, screaming for that black-haired young man’s life to avenge his son! But, did that black-haired young man mean that he also killed Chen Dingyuan?!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Who knows what this black-haired young man’s identity is, he actually has the guts to kill Chen Luoguang!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Frenzied discussion took place in every corner.</span></p>
 <p><span>On the other hand, after leaving the restaurant, Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu walked along the streets, what happened in the restaurant was already forgotten. His main purpose in stopping in Blessed Buddha City was to pay Shi Fantian a visit.</span></p>
 <p><span>The three strolled idly. Noticing the people on the streets hurrying toward a certain direction, Huang Xiaolong’s curiosity was stoked. Was there a lively event in that direction? He simply stopped a random person on the street, asking what was happening in front. </span></p>
 <p><span>That young man was slightly surprised at Huang Xiaolong’s question, his eyes strayed to the two giant figures behind the black-haired young man, he couldn’t help taking another look, “Doesn't this brother know that today is Blessed Buddha’s Birthday?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Blessed Buddha’s Birthday?” Huang Xiaolong repeated.</span></p>
 <p><span>In Blessed Buddha Empire, there was only one person could be called Blessed Buddha and that person was the founder of Blessed Buddha Empire, the previous emperor of the Blessed Buddha Empire.</span></p>
 <p><span>“That’s right, ah, Blessed Buddha’s Birthday, a lot of people would head to the Blessed Buddha Temple to pray and burn joss sticks to the Blessed Buddha Emperor.” That young man answered. “Apart from that, every year during Blessed Buddha’s Birthday, Princess Shi Xiaofei would go to Blessed Buddha Temple.” Talking about Shi Xiaofei, the young man exposed a look of admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Shi Xiaofei.” Huang Xiaolong was surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span>That young man looked at Huang Xiaolong with an understanding smile, “Bro, why don’t you join me? Let’s go there and have a look, I think you probably haven't seen our Princess before, right? During last year’s Blessed Buddha Birthday, I caught a glimpse from &nbsp;far away, after coming back, I couldn’t sleep well for a whole month.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong was speechless, “That Shi Xiaofei is really that beautiful?”</span></p>
 <p><span> Couldn’t sleep well for one whole month, wasn’t this bragging a little too much?</span></p>
 <p><span>Seeing Huang Xiaolong’s reaction, his eyes widened in a fierce glare, “You don’t believe?” In the next second, a reminiscence look took over the young man’s face: “Beautiful! Absolutely too beautiful! If Princess Shi Xiaofei is willing to say a sentence to me, just one sentence, I’m willing to have my lifespan shortened &nbsp;ten years.” The young man’s expression resembled someone who suddenly roasted drumstick in the middle of a desert, saliva drooling from his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong laughed watching the young man’s unabashed expression, “Let’s go then, I also want to have a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Being baptized by Buddhism energy the last time he was here, according to Shi Fantian’s words, Huang Xiaolong could be considered as one of Blessed Buddha Emperor’s disciples. Since it was so, he should make the trip to burn some joss sticks for this Blessed Buddha Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span>The young man came out from his fantasy hearing that Huang Xiaolong was interested to go, laughing in good humor, the young man was delighted: “That’s great.” And the young man pulled Huang Xiaolong’s hand, “Bro, we must reach there quickly to pick a good spot.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Pick a good spot?</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong laughed helplessly, “Are there a lot of people in Blessed Buddha Temple today?</span></p>
 <p><span>The young man said, “Of course, there’s a lot of people, many women, and even more men. The men usually go for Princess Shi Xiaofei, if we don’t hurry to find a good spot, not to mention Princess Shi Xiaofei, we probably won’t even get to see the backside of her maids .”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu laughed at the young man’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Still, all the maids beside Princess Shi Xiaofei are great beauties, it’s not too bad if we managed to see the butts of her maids.” The young man added.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong grinned.</span></p>
 <p><span>Just as Huang Xiaolong was heading toward Blessed Buddha Temple, in Tai Gan Prince Palace, Chen Family’s Patriarch, Chen Chen, and two Grand Elders were talking, laughing amiably with their host when he spotted a flustered Chen Family guard running into the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Patriarch, it’s bad!” Chen Chen and the two Gand Elders instantly looked grim. &nbsp;Before Chen Chen could ask, the guard blurted, “Somebody just reported, Eldest Young Lord was killed!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“What?!” Chen Chen and the two Grand Elders jumped to their feet, dark clouds brewing on their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span>Even Prince Tai Gan was dumbfounded. Someone actually dared to kill Chen Family’s &nbsp;Eldest Young Lord?! Moreover, they were in the Blessed Buddha City.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It was at Buddhist House restaurant, even now, Eldest Young Lord’s body is still there.” That Chen Family guard added.</span></p>
