 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Xiaolong didn’t ride in the Dragon Shark Flying Ship when he made his way to Mongolia City. Instead, he chose five mounts and brought the four of them along with him as he rode towards the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, the bandits in the Keshen Mountain Range didn’t have good mounts. The mounts Huang Xiaolong chose were the best ones they had but they were barely better than ordinary mounts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Hell Beast they were riding on was called the Purple Qilin and it was a hybrid offspring of a Dark Qilin and a Purple Winged Horse. The Dark Qilin was a top-grade ancient divine beast while the Purple Winged Horse was a regular beast.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the five beasts they were riding on, the Dark Qilin bloodline in them was nearly non-existent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lucky for them, the Purple Qilin they were riding on weren’t too slow and they had cultivation equivalent to a First Order Ancestor God. In six days, they were able to arrive at Mongolia City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After arriving at the city, Huang Xiaoloong ordered two of them to purchase a residence in the city. After all, there were still several days before the recruitment and they needed a place to stay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whatever it was, Huang Xiaolong didn’t lack spirit stones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, he didn’t plan to use the spirit stones in his possession. With the wealth of the bandits in the Keshen Mountain Range, the amount of spirit stones in their possession was more than enough to buy a residence in the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After giving them the order to buy a residence, Huang Xiaolong headed over to the Netherworld King’s Organization branch with the two other bandits in tow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The branch was located in the middle of the city and it couldn’t be easier for him to locate it. In under two hours, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the entrance of the branch office of the Netherworld King’s Organization.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he arrived, Huang Xiaolong felt slightly shocked as the atmosphere there wasn’t as lively as he had imagined.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It might be because the requirements to join the organization was too harsh and that the passing rate was too little that not many people were there to register.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were two guards in black battle armor standing at the entrance and they possessed strength at the early-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm. Looking at the word ‘Nether’ embroidered on their chest, Huang Xiaolong knew that they were the Netherguards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Netherworld King’s Organization was broken up into two sections. The inner division, and the outer division.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The inner division consisted of the Netherguards. The authority the Netherguards held in the Netherworld King’s Organization was similar to the Heavenly Soldiers in the Heavenly Court in the Divine World. However, the Heavenly Soldiers were there to uphold law and order in the Divine World. The Netherguards were only responsible for the order in the Netherworld King’s Organization.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the Netherguards, they were located in every part of Hell, just like the Netherworld King’s Organization branches. They were rampant in the Hell Asura World, the World of Departed Spirits, and the Ghost World. As for the total number of Netherguards, no one knew…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, according to the king of grandmist and the little cow, the Netherguards stationed in the three worlds would be able to exterminate any one of the worlds with ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Netherguards army was possibly three times stronger than the Heavenly Soldiers in the Divine World!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Xiaolong had felt his heart shake when he had heard their evaluation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The little cow had even guessed that the Netherworld King’s Organization was under the king of hell.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, the king of hell had disappeared for a long period of time and the Netherworld King’s Organization had happened to coincidentally form themselves during his absence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">According to the little cow, anyone who could obtain the king of hell’s inheritance would be able to gain control over the entire organization! With the power the inheritor held, he would be able to dominate all three worlds in Hell!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After talking about the inner division, one had to take note of the outer division as well. Those who formed the outer division were the experts who passed the test. They were known as the Netherkings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for their ranks, they started out from one star and rose to the highest rank of ten stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As long as one had broken through into the Ancestor God Realm, they would be eligible to sign up for the recruitment to be a Netherking. According to the cultivation, the early, middle, and late stages of a cultivator in the Ancestor God Realm would correspond to one, two, and three stars respectively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the four, five, and six stars Netherkings, they were ranks given to early, middle, and late stage God King Realm cultivators.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the seventh to ninth star, they were only given to Heavenly Monarchs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Anyone in the Emperor Realm and above were judged to be ten star Netherkings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since ten star was the highest rank one could get, no matter if one was in the early, middle, or late stages of the Emperor Realm, they would be given the ten star rank. It didn’t matter if they were an expert surpassing the Emperor Realm, there were no exceptions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once they passed the recruitment test to enter the Netherworld King’s Organization, they would be given a rank according to their cultivation level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example, Huang Xiaoloing was a Ninth Order God King. The moment he passed the test, he would be a six star Netherking. He didn’t need to climb up the ranks after entering the organization.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The stronger they were, the more privileges they would be able to receive after entering the organization.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Netherworld King’s Organization had their own chamber of commerce and it was known as the Netherworld King’s Chamber of Commerce. They were located in all three worlds and no other chamber of commerce would be able to shake their position at all. The higher one’s rank, the more discount they would be able to get when purchasing items from the Netherworld King’s Chamber of Commerce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One to three star Netherkings would be able to receive a ten percent discount. Four to six star Netherkings would be able to receive a twenty percent discount. Seven to nine star Netherkings would be able to receive a thirty percent discount. As for a ten star Netherking, they would be able to enjoy a forty percent discount when purchasing items in the Netherworld King’s Chamber of Commerce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Netherkings would also be able to issue missions to the Netherworld King’s Organization.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the strength and influence of the Netherworld King’s Organization, the chances of success the moment a mission was issued was practically guaranteed. Huang Xiaolong wanted to use the chance to look for Fang Mingyu and Ren Wokuang using this method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It went without saying that the mission rewards were bountiful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Xiaolong stood before the entrance of the Netherworld King’s Organization and complicated thoughts ran through his mind. After some considerations, he finally stepped into the entrance with his two new subordinates.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment he stepped into the entrance, the Gu Family received news about him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This brat has finally shown himself!” Gu Zheng laughed coldly to himself. “It’s too bad for you that I’ve been paying attention all this while.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Gu Zheng, according to the reports from Mongolia City, this little brat has entered the Netherworld King’s Organization’s main entrance. From the looks of it, he plans to take the recruitment test to become a Netherking.” Gu Fei explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How many days before the recruitment begins?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There are still five days before the test will commence.” Gu Fei replied respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Zheng nodded his head and said, “It’s enough time for me to get there. If we take the transmission array, we’ll be able to arrive in Mongolia City in four days. We have to make our move before he takes the test. Right now, we shall head over to Mongolia City to intercept him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Gu Zheng…” Gu Fei chuckled and continued, “This brat is pretty unlucky. You were going to leave in a few days but he had to court trouble by showing himself. I even thought that he would be lying low for the next few years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among their hearty laughter, they left the Gu Family and headed towards the transmission array located in the inner city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Huang Xiaolong, he went straight towards the side hall after he entered the entrance to register for the recruitment test.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The person in charge of the registration was from the Demon Race, and he was an early-First Order God King Realm cultivator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The members of the Demon Race differed in their appearances based on their bloodline. Their wings shone a different color, and members of their royal family had silver wings. Looking at the person in charge of the registration, his wings shone a brilliant silver.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Huang Xiaolong stated his purpose, he handed over the registration fee of ten thousand grade seven spirit stones. When everything was done, he led Huang Xiaolong into the inner palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they arrived at the inner palace, an extremely huge formation array formed with mysterious symbols was present in the middle of the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stand in the middle and I will activate the formation to test for your bone age and strength.” The Demon Race member pointed towards the formation and instructed Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After nodding his head, Huang Xiaolong casually stepped into the middle of the formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though anyone above the Ancestor God Realm could apply to be a Netherking, not all experts would pass the test. For example, a God King like Huang Xiaolong had to possess a bone age of less than two hundred thousand years. Regardless of their cultivation level, they had to also possess an emperor rank godhead or higher.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they passed the initial test, the Netherworld King’s Organization would provide them with a mission and they would only be accepted if they completed the mission successfully.</span></p>
