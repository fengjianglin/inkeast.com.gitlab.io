 <p><b>Chapter 20: Li Mu’s Celebration </b></p>
 <p><span style>“As long as I break through to Third Order by the end of the year?” A weird appeared expression on Huang Xiaolong face as he listened to his father.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Huang Peng noticed Huang Xiaolong’s expression, he thought it was due to his unreasonable requirement – Third Order being too high, continued gently: “Honestly, Dad and Mom understand&nbsp;that it’s difficult to reach the Third Order by the end of the year, so Xiaolong, don’t put too much pressure on yourself.” Huang Peng hesitated for a moment, then said: “As long as you can advance to peak late-Second Order by the end of the year, then it’s okay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Peak late-Second Order?” Huang Xiaolong’s expression turned even weirder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right, Xiaolong. Even if you can’t breakthrough to peak late-Second Order, but reach late-Second Order, we will still be very happy.” This time, it was his Mom Su Yan who spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Words failed Huang Xiaolong as he smiled helplessly inside his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Order? Peak late-Second Order? Late-Second Order?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, Mom, I’m going back to the small yard.” Huang Xiaolong said as he stood up, gently hitting the arm of the chair; wondering whether his parents would further lower their requirement to peak mid-Second Order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it came to that, he might not be able to resist and expose his current strength of peak early-Fourth Order!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, Xiaolong.” When Huang Xiaolong was about the leave the hall, Huang Peng thought of something, said: “A few days from now&nbsp;is Old Patriarch Li’s eightieth birthday celebration; and he invited our Huang Clan Manor to the celebration party. That little girl kept badgering him to invite you, insisting that you must be there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She insists that I go?” Huang Xiaolong felt amazement. That little girl didn’t really fancy him, right? Just because he looked really cool when he beat up Huang Wei miserably during the annual Clan’s Assembly?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, Mom, can I not go?” Huang Xiaolong asked weakly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you say?” Su Yan’s eyes glared at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong was depressed; looks like he can’t avoid going to the banquet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan laughed seeing her son’s sulky face, teasing him: “You brat, don’t grumble. Li Lu is the apple of Old Patriarch Li’s eyes, possessing a grade nine martial spirit and she’ll surely grow up to be a beautiful young lady.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong was even more speechless, what’s with this and that; if his Mom knew her son had superb talent and a twin martial superb talent &nbsp;at that, she probably wouldn’t think this way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Huang Peng also joined in: “Your Mom’s right. In the future, if you marry Old Patriarch Li granddaughter, Li Lu, then your Mom and I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While his father was still talking, Huang Xiaolong quickly cut in: “Okay, Dad, I understand; it’s fine as long as I go right? When do we leave? Are you going?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan couldn’t help but laugh when she heard Huang Xiaolong’s response: “It seems like our son’s feeling shy.” She stopped teasing Huang Xiaolong and said: “We leave the day after tomorrow, but other than you and your Dad, your Grandfather, Eldest Uncle and that Huang Wei are also going.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong’s brows wrinkled, and nodded: “Okay, I know; if there’s nothing else then I’ll go back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Huang Peng and Su Yan nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong turned around and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Watching his son’s back, Su Yan sighed and said: “How wonderful it would be if our Xiaolong marries Li Lu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Peng shook his head: “With Li Lu’s background and talent, she won’t like our Xiaolong. Also,&nbsp;right now Li Lu is only an eight-year-old child; so while she may not consider it, she will when she grows up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>By this time Huang Xiaolong&nbsp;had&nbsp;returned to his small courtyard&nbsp;and started practicing the Tempest of Hell so he didn’t hear what his parents said after he left</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two days came and went quickly, and the day of departure arrived. The moment Huang Xiaolong arrived at Eastern Courtyard, he was dragged by Huang Peng to the Main Hall; and by the time they got to the Main Hall, his Grandfather Huang Qide, Eldest Uncle Huang Ming, and Huang Wei were already waiting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Huang Wei saw Huang Xiaolong stepping into the Main Hall, his eyes were full of hatred; if not for Huang Qide’s presence, he probably would have pounced on Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father.”</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Grandfather.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong and Huang Peng walked up to Huang Qide and said their greeting, ignoring Huang Wei’s imitation of a ferocious beast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Qide nodded and laughed: “Since everyone’s here, let’s go.” Huang Qide stepped out, and the four people followed after him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though the Huang Clan Manor and the Li Family were known as two of the major powers in Canglan County, there was quite a distance between them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Li Family Residence is in Canglan’s County City whereby the Huang Clan Manor was situated a hundred miles outside of &nbsp;theCounty City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, it was evening when Huang Xiaolong’s group of five arrived in County City, nearing dusk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Qide! You traveled quite a distance to come for my celebration, yet I’m slow in my welcome, please forgive me!” said Old Patriarch Li while laughing merrily when the five of them arrived at County City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Li Mu is too polite!” Huang Qide laughed robustly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong looked around and noticed that the little girl Li Lu was standing behind a roundish faced middle-aged man who was a little chubby with slightly small eyes – which gave the impression that he was always beaming.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is this Old Patriarch Li’s only son, Li Chen, Li Lu’s father?&nbsp;</span></i><span style>Huang Xiaolong wondered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the little girl who was hiding behind Li Cheng looked mischievously&nbsp;at Huang Xiaolong, stuck her tongue out at Xiaolong and giggled; looking very cute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong rolled his eyes, totally ignoring her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Huang Xiaolong’s nonchalant reaction, Li Lu pouted her lips in pique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This scene was seen by Huang Wei who was standing at the side; hatred surged violently in his heart. Although his engagement with Li Lu during the Clan Assembly was ruined by Huang Xiaolong, in his heart Li Lu was already his wife, and now his ‘wife’ was blatantly flirting with Huang Xiaolong right in front of him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the customary greetings, everyone entered the city, heading towards Li Residence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Contrary to expectations, the Li Residence was not located in the center of the city but in the south section. When they arrived before the Li Residence’s main entrance, the twenty meters wide street in front was filled with an endless stream of horses and carriages, the street was lively and decorated with bright and colorful lanterns. For Li Mu’s eightieth birthday celebration, other than Huang Clan Manor, most of the forces in Canglan County had already arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the real celebration would happen tomorrow, thus there were those who were yet to arrive and who were on their way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they arrived at the Li Residence, Li Mu personally lead them to the prearranged courtyard to rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Qide, if there’s anything you need, just inform the Residence’s guards. Please forgive the poor hospitality.” Li Mu said to Huang Qide&nbsp;with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Qide waved his hand and said: “You’re too polite. En, please go and attend to your matters; tomorrow, we brothers will drink together later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Mu laughed ‘hehe’: “Definitely.” Then turned around and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But what happened next stunned Huang Xiaolong. Not long after Li Mu left, Li Lu came to their courtyard! After greeting Huang Qide, Huang Ming, and Huang Peng, she went straight to Huang Xiaolong and said in a petulant voice: “Xiaolong, This is your first time in County City right? Come, I’ll give you a tour!” Her hand was already pulling Huang Xiaolong away from the courtyard even before he had the chance to reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Wei stared pointedly at Li Lu holding Huang Xiaolong’s hand, and watched both of them leave the courtyard; his expression was ugly to the extreme. And of course, Huang Ming’s face wasn’t looking any better either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Qide opened his mouth, but didn’t know what to say; Huang Peng stood there quietly, but his heart was flipping in delight.</span></p>
