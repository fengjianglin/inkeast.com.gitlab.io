 <p><b>Chapter 333: Able To Contend With Me?</b></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong showed a faint smile hearing Lu Kai asking about his current strength, “In your opinion, what’s my current strength?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Kai kept mum for a moment, then said, “You little bastard cannot be judged using normal logic. That year when you participated in the Duanren Imperial City Battle, you had just broken through the Xiantian realm, by now, you probably advanced till Xiantian Fourth Order, right?” Lu Kai squinted his eyes as he fixed a stare on Huang Xiaolong’s face for his reaction.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Xiantian Fourth Order!</span></i><span style> Thinking about what a Xiantian Fourth Order represented, Lu Kai couldn’t help but tremble secretly. Xiantian Fourth Order, a mid-level Xiantian realm, not one person in the entire Luo Tong Kingdom could contend with that kind of strength!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Forget the Luo Tong Kingdom, even several neighboring kingdoms didn't have a Xiantian Fourth Order expert! How old was Huang Xiaolong? No more than twenty-three, right?! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Watching Lu Kai staring at him wide-eyed, Huang Xiaolong shook his head a little helplessly. Huang Xiaolong’s response stunned Lu Kai, and he subsequently breathed out in relieved, grinning “See, didn’t I say, no matter how much of a monster genius you are, how could you break through mid-level Xiantian so fast!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong was speechless at his friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So, are you a peak late-Xiantian Third Order now?” Lu Kai was relentless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak late-Xiantian Third Order? Huang Xiaolong smiled bitterly, shaking his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, Lu Kai continued, “Late-Xiantian Third Order?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong shook his head again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Peak mid-Xiantian Third Order?” Lu Kai tried again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He got the same response from Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Kai’s face was full of doubt, “Cannot be, ah, then mid-Xiantian Third Order? With the speed of your cultivation, it’s impossible for you to be only a mid-Xiantian Third Order?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong laughed, “I am really not a mid-Xiantian Third Order.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not a mid-Xiantian Third Order? Lu Kai blanked for a moment, then a shocking thought struck him, “Could it be… above Xiantian Fourth Order?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Kai laughed as he said, “You kid, really a freak, you actually broke through Xiantian Fourth Order so fast.” Hearing Huang Xiaolong confirmed he had broken through Xiantian Fourth Order, Lu Kai was truly happy for his friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you’re now mid or late Xiantian Fourth Order?” Lu Kai asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong pondered his answer, “Can be considered as a high-level Xiantian realm.” Though Huang Xiaolong could defeat the Saint realm Zhao Chen, he was still a peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order, therefore, he was considered as a high-level Xiantian realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Kai was totally dumbstruck at Huang Xiaolong’s blasé answer, his eyeballs rounded like they were about to fall off, that look was no different than looking at an unknown strange creature.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Can be considered as high-level Xiantian realm?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Kai drew a sharp breath, he had assumed that regardless how talented Huang Xiaolong was, in a short few years’ span, it was already beyond normal to advance into Xiantian Fourth Order, but now...!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Peak late-Xiantian Sixth Order?” Lu Kai tried. Lu Kai thought that Huang Xiaolong’s ‘can be considered as’ meant that he hadn’t stepped into Xiantian Seventh Order, but infinitely close to breaking through to Xiantian Seventh Order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong smiled a little at Lu Kai’s guess, no longer admit or deny, let’s take it that he was peak late-Xiantian Sixth Order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this point, the restaurant boss hastened to their table with an anxious expression. In front of Huang Xiaolong and Lu Kai, he spoke urgently, “Young Noble Huang, Prince Lu Kai, quickly run! Just now, Prime Minister Wu Feng ordered to have the city on lockdown, all the city guards are rushing over here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Talking with Lu Kai, Huang Xiaolong already found out that Wu Feng and most of the Luo Tong Kingdom ministers supported Lu Jing. That Wu Feng too had taken liege under the Wind God Cult, which was why Huang Xiaolong was calm. Raising his cup, he emptied the wine inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Watching Huang Xiaolong and Lu Kai’s unhurried response, the restaurant boss urged them, “Young Noble Huang, Prince Lu Kai, leave quickly, otherwise it will be too late. I heard that Wind God Cult’s Leader and a group of Wind God Cult’s experts are rushing over, they’re probably right outside the city gates!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the restaurant boss’ voice ended, an overwhelming momentum enveloped the entire Luo Tong Royal City like a flood of divine retribution from Heaven, not an inch of land was spared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The commoners living in the city were terrified, feeling fear and despair at the sudden unknown calamity. Even the initially calm Lu Kai was affected, trepidation flickered in his eyes that went all the way to his core, it felt like an insurmountable mountain was pressuring his soul, making it hard to breathe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whereas Huang Xiaolong was surprised; </span><i><span style>Saint realm?</span></i><span style> Well, this was unexpected. Running into a Saint realm in this small place, someone from the Wind God Cult? Not likely, a small sect like Wind God Cult could hardly have such an existence. Then it could only be the people from Deities Templar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time outside, Ao Baixue, who released his Saint realm aura, flew straight toward the Delicious Restaurant at breaking wind speed. In the blink of an eye, Ao Baixue, Fan Yiming, and the Wind God Cult experts stopped right above the Delicious Restaurant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Greetings, Elder Ao, Leader Fan.” Prime Minister Wu Feng, who had brought the city guards over to surround the Delicious Restaurant early on, hurried forward to salute Ao Baixue and Fan Yiming together with other Luo Tong Kingdom’s ministers, on their knees.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ao Baixue nodded, permitting them to rise. Spreading his spiritual sense, &nbsp;he instantly locked onto Huang Xiaolong’s group of three.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huang Xiaolong, Lu Kai, you’re surrounded from all angles, quickly roll out here and kneel before our Elder Ao!” Leader Fan Yiming took a step forward, barking out loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All around was silence. Seconds later, the restaurant door opened, Huang Xiaolong walked out with Lu Kai and giant ghost Feng Yang. Huang Xiaolong’s gaze collided with Ao Baixue in midair, an invisible storm swept out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fan Yiming sneered coldly when he saw Huang Xiaolong appear, “You are Huang Xiaolong? Brat, before our Elder Ao, why aren’t you getting on your knees, begging for mercy?! I am sure you’re already aware that our Elder Ao is a Saint realm expert. Killing you is child’s play.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong merely glance at Ao Baixue: “Really?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Lu Kai was ashen at the sight of Ao Baixue, a Saint realm expert?! This young man was actually a Saint realm expert! Saint realm expert, a high above legendary existence!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Getting over his shock, Lu Kai turned towards Huang Xiaolong, “Brother, I have dragged you down, I am sorry!” In his view, as freakishly talented as Huang Xiaolong was to reach peak late-Xiantian Sixth Order at his age, he still wasn’t a Saint realm expert’s opponent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of a Saint realm expert, whether one was a peak late-Xiantian Sixth Order or a Xiantian First Order, the result was the same: one move kill!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong gave Lu Kai a reassured look, saying: “Don’t worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry?” Ao Baixue laughed, “Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu are both in Duanren Imperial City now, do you think they can make it here to save you from Duanren Imperial City?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong faced Ao Baixue indifferently, “Do you think you can still injure me like you did that year?” That year, Ao Baixue intentionally injured Huang Xiaolong in front of Li Lu, this score, Huang Xiaolong had never forgotten.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ao Baixue laughed even louder at Huang Xiaolong’s words, eyes judging Huang Xiaolong up and down, “You’re trying to say that with your current strength you can contend with me? With me, a peak mid-First Order Saint realm master?” His tone was thick with ridicule.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Experts from Wind God Cult joined Ao Baixue in his mocking laughter.</span></p>
