 <p><b>Chapter 21: Asura’s Gate Disciple</b></p>
 <p><span style>Pulled out of the courtyard by Li Lu, Huang Xiaolong’s brows furrowed, and said: “Little girl, don’t drag and pull me like this, others might misunderstand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Lu was surprised for a moment and then flashed a sweet smile, revealing two cute dimples, “So what if others misunderstand? I’m your wife. What is wrong with a wife holding her husband’s hand? I’m not afraid of any misunderstanding and also don’t call me a little girl. I’m a very big girl!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little girl ended her speech by puffing up her small chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black lines ran down Huang Xiaolong’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wife?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Very big?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong swept a glance across Li Lu’s slightly protruded but yet to develop small chest, and smiled wryly to himself. That area’s still a flat land, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noticing Huang Xiaolong staring at her small chest, her face blushed bright red, in barely a whisper she said, “You, why are you looking at people like that; I’m shy when there’re so many other people here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was so speechless that he decisively clamped his mouth shut, not speaking a word more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pulling away his hand, he went out of the Li Residence, walking to the main street. This really was his first time in Canglan County’s County City, so he wanted to look around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaolong, wait for me!” Li Lu pouted her mouth at Huang Xiaolong for pulling away his hand; she quickly ran&nbsp;after him with quick steps, however, this time instead of holding Huang Xiaolong’s hand, Li Lu wrapped her hand around his arms, just like a submissive little wife. A girl’s soft fragrance wafted into his nose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong was trying to avoid body contact with her, “You can go back, I can walk by myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Lu pouted again, her eyes turned red-rimmed as tears welled within, “I’ll go back and tell Grandfather that you bullied me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong quickly used his hand to stop her from leaving, feeling an onslaught of a headache: “Fine then, let’s go together but you must promise me that you won’t pull or drag me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Lu burst out laughing, the look in her eyes changed instantly, nodded: “Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong sighed in relief when Li Lu nodded in agreement. They turned and began walking along the street with Li Lu following beside Huang Xiaolong on the right, being extremely obedient. As they walked, her big round eyes&nbsp;occasionally&nbsp;stole furtive glances at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong didn’t care and continued to look around; not paying her any attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Neither of them spoke much along the way, and after going around once, just as they were about to return to the Li Residence, they noticed at a corner of the street was crowded with a lot of people pointing fingers and whispering about something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong’s curiosity was stoked, so he and Li Lu walked in that particular direction, squeezing through the crowd have to a look. A middle-aged man was lying on the ground, encircled by onlookers </span><span style>ㅡ</span><span style>his hair was messy and unkempt, a dirty-stained face and worn-out rags for clothes. Evidently, the middle-aged man was unconscious. On the ground, next to the middle-aged man were several small drops of blood, apparently spat out by the injured man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After observing the middle-aged man for a moment, Huang Xiaolong hesitated briefly before walking up to him and lifted him up; since he had become a Fourth Order warrior, his arm strength was not so weak that carrying an adult would pose a problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Lu was astonished&nbsp;when Huang Xiaolong lifted the middle-aged man up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong said to Li Lu as he walked past her carrying the middle-aged man; he noticed Li Lu was still standing on the same spot in a daze. Li Lu quickly ran after Huang Xiaolong after recovering her senses, and couldn’t stop herself from asking, “Xiaolong, why are you carrying this man back with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You wouldn’t understand even if I told you.” He replied without turning his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Are you saying I wouldn’t understand even if you explained it?&nbsp; Li Lu’s small mouth puckered up into a sulky pout but she kept quiet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the way, Huang Xiaolong asked Li Lu for the location of the Li Residence’s back door and went in through the back door carrying the unconscious middle-aged man, placing him in a remote and secluded room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Watching the middle-aged man lying on the bed, Huang Xiaolong circulated his internal force and pointed a finger at the middle-aged man’s chest, his finger subsequently moved lower along the man’s body. He jabbed the man’s body a few more times with his finger and by the time he was done, Huang Xiaolong was panting heavily. Beads of sweat were dripping from his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Lu was stood behind Huang Xiaolong as she watched him indiscriminately poke at different parts of the middle-aged man’s body with a puzzled expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ask someone to bring over a set of clothes, and clean him up.” Huang Xiaolong said to Li Lu after he had recovered his breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, okay.” Coming out from her daze, Li Lu nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A short while later, an attendant of Li Residence brought over a set of clothes and cleaned the middle-aged man, but he remained unconscious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can go now.” He said to Li Lu since the patient hasn’t awakened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was about to say that she will stay here to keep him company&nbsp;but looking at Huang Xiaolong’s stern gaze, she could only nod and say: “Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long after Li Lu left, on the wooden bed Fei Hou slowly opened his eyes, finally awake.&nbsp; He got up slowly supporting his own weight with his hand, he observed his surroundings and his gaze fell on Huang Xiaolong in the end. With a surprised look on his face, Fei Hou asked: “Little Brother, you are the one who saved me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where am I?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are at Canglan County’s Li Residence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Hou tried his best to step down from the bed; frowning abruptly: “Canglan County?” In his memory, there’s no recollection where Canglan County is.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Brother, thank you very much for saving me; I have some matters to attend to, so I need to leave first.” Just when Fei Hou wanted to walk out from the room, suddenly, a violent pain erupted inside his body and with a “waaa” blood spurted out from his mouth and he fell to the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong quickly helped him back to the bed and said: “You were heavily injured. The meridians inside your body are broken. I temporarily used ‘returning soul finger’ to stabilize your injury and your vital acupuncture points. If you move recklessly…” When he got to this point, Huang Xiaolong stopped explaining, for the consequences are clear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Returning Soul Finger?” “Acupuncture points?” Fei Hou looked at Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong did not bother to explain, changing the topic, he asked: “You are a disciple of Asura’s Gate, aren’t you?” While on the street, Huang Xiaolong had noticed an Asura tattoo on Fei Hou’s left arm; a sign of Asura’s Gate disciples, which was why Huang Xiaolong brought him back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Who are you? How do you know I’m a disciple of Asura’s Gate?” Fei Hou was greatly shocked, looking at Huang Xiaolong warily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Again Huang Xiaolong did not answer, under Fei Hou’s watchful eyes he raised his left hand, and a dark black ring appeared on his left ring finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A, A, Asura Ring!” Looking at the dark black ring, Fei Hou’s body trembled with excitement after a moment he snapped out of his daze, finding it hard to believe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong quietly observed Fei Hou’s reaction; according to the piece of paper, this Asura’s Ring was the symbol and proof of Asura’s Gate Sovereign and any disciples who saw the ring would kneel and bow down in a prostrate position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Fei Hou’s shock and excitement passed, recovering his senses, he instantly knelt down and kowtowed before Huang Xiaolong: “Fei Hou disciple of Asura’s Gate greets Sovereign; Sovereign is invincible throughout the world!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong silently breathed out in relief after seeing at Fei Hou’s reaction; if there was something not right with Fei Hou’s response earlier, he was prepared to call out the blades without hesitation and kill Fei Hou. At this moment, Fei Hou’s meridians were broken and he was heavily injured. He definitely couldn’t dodge Huang Xiaolong’s Blades of Asura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fei Hou… you can stand up.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, thank you Sovereign!” Fei Hou stands up, his attitude respectful to the extreme. And Huang Xiaolong could tell his respectful manner were sincere from the heart and not pretense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did you get hurt?” Huang Xiaolong asked after thinking for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Replying to Sovereign, disciple went into the Silver Moon Forest wanting to hunt for a tenth stage Demonic Ghost Eye Spider, to refine dans with its core; but didn’t expect that Demonic Ghost Eye Spider to be a pair, so…” Fei Hou said feeling a little embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So, he was counter-attacked?</span></i><span style>&nbsp;Huang Xiaolong thought, but since Fei Hou was able to escape from the counter-attack of two tenth stage demonic beasts, it looked like he was very strong, at the very least, he must be stronger than Grandfather! </span></p>
