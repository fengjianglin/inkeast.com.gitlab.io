 <p><b>Chapter 365: Refining the Dragon Pearl</b></p>
 <p><span>Silver Dragon Ao Gu observed Huang Xiaolong from head to toe with interest. </span></p>
 <p><span>Ever since the incident at Rising Sun City, all forces and families’ hottest topic of discussion was Huang Xiaolong—the Martial Spirit World’s most awe-inspiring talent in history, no matter who it was, they would show some interest.</span></p>
 <p><span>Silver Dragon Ao Gu was no exception.</span></p>
 <p><span>Until this moment, Silver Dragon Ao Gu still didn’t know that his most favored female disciple, Li Li, was killed by Huang Xiaolong. If he knew, he probably wouldn’t be admiring Huang Xiaolong as he was doing now.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Brother Duan Ren, what happened just now?” Huang Xiaolong asked Duan Ren.</span></p>
 <p><span>Seeing Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Feng Yang arriving just in time, Duan Ren was greatly relieved inside his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span>The cusp of the matter was that Duan Ren found a Dragon Clan weapon and ran into Silver Dragon Ao Gu after that, who wanted to snatch it from Duan Ren’s hands, thus both sides started to fight.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong said after he heard what happened.</span></p>
 <p><span>Since Duan Ren was alright, Huang Xiaolong preferred to avoid a frontal confrontation with Silver Dragon Ao Gu at this instant. Although he didn't know Ao Gu’s true strength, with his standing as one of Bedlam Lands’ top ten experts, it would take quite an effort for Zhao Shu to defeat him. Moreover, if Snow Dragon City’s people were here, then people from Sin City, Imperial Saber City, and Green Ghost City would be close by as well.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong didn’t want to waste time here, if people from Sin City rushed over, it would be much harder for him to leave at that time. The most urgent matter right now was to leave the Dragon City as soon as possible and find a safe place to refine the Dragon Pearl, Dragon Blood Crystals, and the twelve primordial divine dragon corpses.</span></p>
 <p><span>About Huang Xiaolong wanting to leave, Duan Ren and the two other Saint realm experts had no objection.</span></p>
 <p><span>But Li Qiuping, who was standing next to Silver Dragon &nbsp;Ao Gu snapped, “Presumptuous! Huang Xiaolong, who allowed you to leave?!” He took a step forward, planning to block Huang Xiaolong’s group’s path. </span></p>
 <p><span>However, Silver Dragon Ao Gu raised a hand to stop Li Qiuping saying, “Let them leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Qiuping was stunned, “Master, this..?!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Silver Dragon Ao Gu didn’t say another word, watching the several leaving silhouettes.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Master, then the Dragon Blood Blade, are we letting it go just like this?” Wang Lin was reluctant.</span></p>
 <p><span>The weapon Duan Ren found was called Dragon Blood Blade. Though it couldn't compare to the Great Dragon Saber that Huang Xiaolong found, it was still a divine grade weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span>Silver Dragon Ao Gu snapped, “Then, what should be done? Are you confident you can keep them here?” Even Deities Templar’s Elder Li Molin needed to flee in the battle from Rising Sun City, although he, Silver Dragon Ao Gu, had yet to test his mettle against Li Molin before, he knew his strength was not much higher than Li Molin’s.</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Qiuping and Wang Lin hung their heads down, not daring to utter another word.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Let’s go, there should be a lot more weapons left behind by the Dragon Clan Elders, search for the remaining others.” Silver Dragon Ao Gu spoke with finality in his voice and disappeared from view in a flicker.</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Qiuping and the others quickly followed.</span></p>
 <p><span>Leaving the scene, Huang Xiaolong’s group headed straight to the space exit. In a blink, they were transferred back to the same tranquil ravine bottom. In a few quick leaps up the ravine walls, Huang Xiaolong and his group reached the top of the ravine. </span></p>
 <p><span>From there, they rushed out from the Origin Forest, leaving its sphere in just a few days’ time. Leaving behind the Origin Forest, Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, Duan Ren, and the others sped all the way back to Duanren Empire.</span></p>
 <p><span>Due to the fact that they didn't take many breaks along the way, in half a month’s time, the six of them stepped into Duanren Imperial City.</span></p>
 <p><span>The moment Huang Xiaolong returned to the Southern Hill Estate, he told his family to bring only the necessities and led them out of Duanren Imperial City.</span></p>
 <p><span>Now, Huang Xiaolong’s plan was to find a place that would allow him time to refine the Dragon Pearl, Dragon Blood Crystals, and the other things. Staying in Duanren Imperial City wasn’t safe anymore. </span></p>
 <p><span>In the Rising Sun City’s battle, Huang Xiaolong had exposed himself to possess the God Binding Ring and Absolute Soul Pearl, although most mediocre forces wouldn’t be brave enough to take advantage of him, there was still a one in a million chance. Not to mention, once the Ancient Dragon Clan ruins expedition in the Origin Forest ended, Deities Templar would definitely come looking for trouble with him, and the chances of them using his family to threaten him were pretty high. It wasn’t totally safe even with Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu around, therefore Huang Xiaolong decided to move his family away from Duanren Imperial City first.</span></p>
 <p><span>As for where to go, Huang Xiaolong already figured it out—the bottom of the Broken Tiger Rift.</span></p>
 <p><span>The bottom of the Broken Tiger Rift, with the extreme cold wind natural barrier, was temporarily the safest place. Furthermore, there was the Eminent Holiness’ secret cultivation cave below the cold lake.</span></p>
 <p><span>The beauty of Eminent Holiness’s cultivation cave was like a Promise Land, it was a good place for his family to live and cultivate. Of course, this arrangement was temporary. When Huang Xiaolong felt that his strength was sufficient to rival Deities Templar, he would move his family back to Duanren Imperial City.</span></p>
 <p><span>As a precaution, Huang Xiaolong even brought his younger sister Huang Min, brother-in-law Guo Tai, and nephew Guo Xiaofan together.</span></p>
 <p><span>Two weeks later, Huang Xiaolong brought his family to the bottom of the Broken Tiger Rift, entering the Eminent Holiness’ cultivation cave space through the cold lake.</span></p>
 <p><span>Everyone exclaimed in awe looking at the beautiful scenery of Eminent Holiness’ cultivation cave. The little guy Guo Xiaofan’s little hands clapped merrily, obvious he also liked the place very much.</span></p>
 <p><span>The spiritual energy in the space was just as rich, even though all the herbs and elixirs were taken away by Huang Xiaolong previously. In a way, for Huang Peng, Su Yan, and the others, cultivating here would be more beneficial than in Duanren Imperial City’s Southern Hill Estate.</span></p>
 <p><span>Still, there were only a few grass huts inside the Eminent Holiness’ cultivation space, so Huang Xiaolong tasked Yu Ming, Fei Hou, Haotian, and the others to build more huts and simple rooms. Huang Xiaolong already had the necessary materials readied. Before leaving Duanren Imperial City, Huang Xiaolong had Yu Ming, Fei Hou, and some servants buy good quality wood.</span></p>
 <p><span>Other than his family, Huang Xiaolong also brought Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, Yu Ming, Fei Hou, Haotian, and several guards and maidservants. These guards and maidservants were the same ones that followed his parents, Huang Peng and Su Yan, from the Huang Clan Manor to Duanren Imperial City and were absolutely loyal.</span></p>
 <p><span>Very soon, the new huts were ready.</span></p>
 <p><span>But Huang Xiaolong did not enter closed-door practice immediately, taking out a portion of the true dragon essence from the Linglong Treasure Pagoda and dividing it to everyone there for their cultivation. This true dragon essence greatly benefited the human physical body.</span></p>
 <p><span>Then Huang Xiaolong took out a hundred pieces of Dragon Blood Crystal, distributing them to his parents, Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the rest. </span></p>
 <p><span>It was one month after arriving in Eminent Holiness’ cultivation space that Huang Xiaolong entered the Xumi Temple to begin his closed-door practice.</span></p>
 <p><span>In the Xumi Temple, Huang Xiaolong took out the Dragon Clan’s great treasure, the Dragon Pearl. The Dragon Pearl hovered in front of Huang Xiaolong, emitting the same soft golden halo that enveloped him in a comfortable light.</span></p>
 <p><span>Inside the Dragon Pearl, that shadow of the divine dragon was hazy as ever.</span></p>
 <p><span>Repressing the excitement in his heart, Huang Xiaolong dropped a drop of blood on the Dragon Pearl’s surface. The bright red drop was instantly absorbed into the Dragon Pearl, the golden halo becoming a notch brighter.</span></p>
 <p><span>Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong ran the true essence energy from his dantian, infusing it into the Dragon Pearl as he began refining it.</span></p>
 <p><span>Time flowed, days passed.</span></p>
 <p><span>Not even Huang Xiaolong knew how many days passed when the vague dragon shadow inside the Dragon Pearl seemed to come alive. A long humming noise came from the Dragon Pearl as it floated over to Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
