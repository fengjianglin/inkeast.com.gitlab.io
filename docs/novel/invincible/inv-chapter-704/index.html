 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Zishuai snorted loudly, lifting his eyelids slightly as he asked, “What’s the progress of the matter I told you to check?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Weitong quickly replied, “We already found it. The Nine Cloudy Ice Petals that Young Master Li wants are on a lone island in the Sea of Black North. However, a thick multi-colored poison miasma shrouds the island throughout the year. The slightest contact with the poison miasma is enough to render a Tenth Order God Realm master into a pile of pus, therefore, we should wait until the poison miasma dispersed a little before going in.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Zishuai’s eyebrows creased into a furrow, “Multi-colored poison miasma? Then how long do we have to wait? This Young Master is not so idle to stay indefinitely in this Peace Emperor World.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Weitong hastened to assure, “It won’t take long, surely. Three days! Three more days at most, and that multi-colored poison miasma will dissipate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Zishuai nodded, “If it’s like that, then this Young Master will stay for three more days in Peace Emperor World.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Weitong faltered and hesitated, as if there was something he wanted to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Speak, what else?” Li Zishuai’s eyebrow rose in question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s, it’s like this…” Zhao Weitong was extremely careful and cautious as he explained, “Strictly adhering to Young Master Li’s order, we’ve been rushing the production of weapons and armors day and night, but a few days ago, someone stole millions of weapons and armors that we’ve been rushing with all-out effort.” At the end, Zhao Weitong glanced furtively at the four Li Family masters around &nbsp;Li Zishuai.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Weitong knew very well that those four Li Family masters were all mid-Ninth Order God Realm. He refused to believe that they couldn’t exterminate a single Huang Xiaolong if these four people were to lend a hand to their Zhao Family!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, their Zhao Family lost twelve Eighth Order God Realm Grand Elders and close to a hundred God Realm disciples, it’d be a lie to say that Zhao Weitong didn't feel pain and anger. He wished for nothing more than to dismember Huang Xiaolong alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Zishuai’s eyes widened when he heard this, a piercing glint shone in his eyes, “Did you not tell them that it was our Li Family that ordered you to forge those weapons and armors?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Weitong answered, “We did, but the other side claims that the result wouldn't change even if the Li Family comes. Moreover, they clearly knew that our Zhao Family has pledged loyalty to the Li Family, but they still killed twelve of our Grand Elders. Not only that, several Grand Elders that managed to survive and returned reported that this person said he’ll come to Peace Emperor World to annihilate our Zhao Family. He will most likely arrive in the next few days!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The piercing light in Li Zishuai’s face grew sharper, but a smile spread over his face, “Then this Young Master really wants to see what kind of punk is so bold, not putting our Li Family in his eyes!” As an afterthought, he asked Zhao Weitong, “How is this person’s strength?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, Li Zishuai only brought four mid-Ninth Order God Realm guards out with him this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immediately understanding Li Zishuai’s worry, &nbsp;Zhao Weitong, grinned, “Please rest assured, Young Master Li, the other side’s cultivation is definitely below Ninth Order God Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Zishuai became completely at ease and waved his hand without looking at Zhao Weitong, “Leave first, report to me when this person is here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Weitong acknowledged respectfully and withdrew from the courtyard with his Zhao Family Elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong, who was speeding past the vast space, gradually slowed down, coming upon a world surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Xiaolong stopped, observing the Peace Emperor World surface from outer space, his gaze was far from amicable. Since the Zhao Family dared to turn Martial Spirit World into a dead world, then he would see to it that blood would flow into a river in the Peace Emperor World!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a flicker, Huang Xiaolong penetrated the outer layer, diving into Peace Emperor World, emerging in a blue sky. With barely a pause, Huang Xiaolong flew southward in the fastest speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to Huang Xiaolong’s knowledge, the Zhao Family’s territory encompassed most of Peace Emperor World’s southern lands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Peace Emperor World were four major powers; one of them was the Zhao Family, while the other three were the Mo Family, the Demonic Cult, and the Nether Ice Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amongst the four major powers, the Demonic Cult was the strongest, whereas the Zhao Family, Mo Family, and the Nether Ice Palace were more or less equal. And these three powers were on friendly terms with each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, regardless of who they were, as long as they dared to hinder him from annihilating the Zhao Family, they would die together with it!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Overwhelming killing intent surged from Huang Xiaolong’s body, colder than ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slightly over an hour later, above a large city on the south side of Peace Emperor World, Huang Xiaolong suddenly stopped instinctively, then he spread out his divine sense to cover the entire large city below him. A moment later, Huang Xiaolong’s figure blurred, appearing almost instantaneously inside a residence in the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who is it?!” The residence’s patrolling guards discovered Huang Xiaolong and barked with vigilance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Xiaolong did not spare a glance at these guards, his feet moving toward the main courtyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being brusquely ignored, the team of patrolling guards were greatly angered. Each of them raised their swords and blades, sprinting toward Huang Xiaolong with ferocity, however, when they reached thirty meters from Huang Xiaolong, all the guards were knocked back by an invisible energy barrier. When they hit the ground, those guards were no longer moving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The commotion on this side quickly alerted the surrounding courtyards’ guards. Footsteps thundered and sounds of whistling wind came from all directions, inching closer to Huang Xiaolong by the second.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From inside the main courtyard came a middle-aged man clad in a brocade robe sewn with white gold. With every step that middle-aged man took, a silvery white stream of energy weaved around him, this phenomenon was due to a specific cultivation technique that this man practiced. Clearly, this middle-aged man had reached a certain stage in his cultivation technique to produce this kind of phenomenon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This middle-aged man’s gaze was piercing sharp, A quick glance around at the several patrolling guards’ bodies, his cold gaze fell on Huang Xiaolong, “I don’t care who you are, you’re absolutely dead today!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as the middle-aged man’s sentence ended, Huang Xiaolong raised his right hand. An overwhelming suction force pulled the middle-aged man right into his grasp. Clutching the middle-aged man’s throat, Huang Xiaolong exerted some force, crushing his throat. Frigid Asura qi immediately invaded the middle-aged man’s body, sealing his meridians and Qi Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle-aged man finally showed fear in his eyes: “You!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Xiaolong was too lazy to bother questioning the man, his divine sense forcefully broke into his soul sea, scouring his soul for information.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very soon, Huang Xiaolong found the middle-aged man’s identity, he was this city’s Castellan, and also a Zhao Family Elder. Even more of a coincidence was the fact that this middle-aged man was actually the uncle of the previous Sin City Castellan who died in Huang Xiaolong’s hand, Zhao Yi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A short while later, Huang Xiaolong was done with soul-scouring the middle-aged man, finding out what he wanted. A wick of true immortal essence fire appeared on his finger, directly extinguishing the middle-aged man’s soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Yi’s uncle died a baffling death by Huang Xiaolong’s sudden appearance. His body unceremoniously thrown into the Asura Ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By this point, the Zhao Family guards came to their senses and scattered for their lives in panic.</span></p>

It was both a defensive and offensive technique.</span></p>
