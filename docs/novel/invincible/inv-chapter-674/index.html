 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To Huang Xiaolong’s surprise, the spiritual energy here was actually much thicker than the Black Warrior Institute, even its quality was a grade higher! Although far from the spiritual energy on his Golden Dragon Peak, it was far from expected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not forgetting the faint medicinal fragrance floating in the air, a whiff was enough to make a person feel refreshed and light. Looking around, Huang Xiaolong noticed that the medicinal fragrance actually came out from inside the shops lining the streets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Awestruck? The truth is, there’s a spiritual energy gathering formation on every street. As for how many spiritual energy gathering formations there are in the whole Royal Pill City, even this old man doesn’t know. But it’s definitely more than ten thousand of them.” A complacent look appeared on the old man’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ten thousand formations!” Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei were close to shouting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Huang Xiaolong guessed that there would be quite a lot of spiritual energy gathering formations inside the Royal Pill City, this amount was too choking and exceeded his initial assumption miles away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Xiaofei too was shocked, her little face expressed clear disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ten thousand spiritual energy gathering formations! And it was probably more than that!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One must understand, laying out one spiritual energy gathering formation needed a huge amount of resources. Even the smallest formation, a first rank family was considered as better off just by having a few of them. The higher ranked super forces and families had no more than a hundred of these smallest size spiritual energy gathering formations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go, first to the Royal Pill House to get a good seat, that place has a horrible waiting line.” the Ascending Moon Old Man ’s tone changed, urging the other two to move quickly, evidently craving the Royal Pill Wine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Xiaolong smiled helplessly watching the old man, but his interest toward that Royal Pill Wine was stoked. He knew how picky the old man’s mouth was, a wine that could make him show that expression must be extraordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Huang Xioalong and Shi Xiaofei were practically dragged to the Royal Pill House by the Ascending Moon Old Man , reaching their destination rather quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Different from what Huang Xiaolong imagined, although the Royal Pill House was busy, there weren’t too many customers. At least it wasn’t so crowded that one could barely walk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As if he saw through Huang Xiaolong’s doubt, the Ascending Moon Old Man chuckled, “Say, little disciple, do you think the Royal Pill House’s Royal Pill Wine can be enjoyed by anyone? Although the Royal Pill Wine is first on the must-try list in Royal Pill City, it does not come cheap. Even some Elders of the first rank forces cannot afford to drink it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei were stunned, even some of first rank forces’ Elders couldn't afford to drink it! This Royal Pill Wine was so expensive?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the Ascending Moon Old Man was talking, his feet did not slow down at all, leading them both inside the premise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though the Ascending Moon Old Man hadn’t been here in more than ten thousand years, the Royal Pill House barely changed, and it was obvious from the ease and familiarity of the Ascending Moon Old Man as he led them inside. The tables numbered exactly one hundred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Earlier, from the outside, the place did not seem crowded, but once they were inside, Huang Xiaolong found that almost all of the one hundred tables were filled with customers, merely leaving two empty tables.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, those two tables were situated right in the center, with people passing through more often than not. It was a bad seating.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Imagine you were enjoying some good wine, but there were always some people moving back and forth behind you, would you still have the mood to drink?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s brows were slightly scrunched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this time, two people seated at a table by the window stood up, preparing to leave after they were well fed and watered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing this, the old man grinned, “Looks like this old man is quite favored by the heavens, my luck’s quite good everywhere I go.” He led Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei toward that table as he praised himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them took a seat at the table by the window.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, even before their seats could warm up, a pair of a young man and woman came to their table. The young man then spoke, “This table was first spotted by us. Old man, bring these two with you, get up this instant for this Young Master and roll over to that table!” He pointed at the remaining two tables at the center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man’s tone was lofty and arrogant. It was evident from his attitude that had formed a habit of berating his servants, the same berating tone he used with the Ascending Moon Old Man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This table by the window, the young man also saw it, but due to Huang Xiaolong’s group being closer in distance, they got to the table first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to the young man’s loud berating voice, it attracted the surrounding customers’ attention. From their reactions, many of them seemed to recognize this young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s one of the Royal Pill City’s Four Young Masters, Lin Yanhan! His father is the Alchemist Grandmaster Association’s Elder Lin Pinghai!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those three are running into bad luck confronting him! Even the Royal Pill City’s Castellan Ning Re avoids the Four Young Masters!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sense of complacency emerged in Lin Yanhan’s heart listening to the exclamations around him, his tone grew even more condescending as he commanded Huang Xiaolong’s group, “Why are the lot of you still not scramming away from the table?! However, this table was first spotted by this Young Master, yet you dared to sit here, this makes this Young Master extremely unhappy.” His eyes lit up as they fell on Shi Xiaofei, “Leave the girl behind to pour wine for both of us. Unless this Young Master is satisfied with your service, don’t think of leaving the Royal Pill House! Is that clear?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Xiaofei’s face was red with anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ascending Moon Old Man chuckled in response, “Sissy fudge, you kid aren't happy, but this Ancestor is even more unhappy!” With that said, the Ascending Moon Old Man’s palm directly struck out across the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yanhan had yet to react when he was struck by the Ascending Moon Old Man’s palm, staggering back from the force over a dozen meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surrounding customers immediately saw that Lin Yanhan’s originally handsome face was swollen into a super pig-head, as if it was filled with gas. Several families’ beautiful young women could not rein in their laughter seeing Lin Yanhan’s face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Master Lin Yanhan, are you alright?!” The young woman with Lin Yanhan asked anxiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Yanhan clutched his face. Feeling the fiery pain, he was momentarily dumb with disbelief. There were actually people who dare to attack him in the Royal Pill City. Above all else, it was a beggar-like old man!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old man, you’re dead!! All of you are dead for sure! My father is the Alchemist Grandmaster Association’s Elder, don’t dream of leaving the Royal Pill City!” Moments later, he finally awoke from his shock, shouting a the top of his lungs while pointing at the Ascending Moon Old Man, Huang Xiaolong, and Shi Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ascending Moon Old Man’s wrinkly face was ridiculing, “Your father is the Alchemist Grandmaster Association’s Elder, then I’m the Alchemist Grandmaster Association’s Grand Elder!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ascending Moon Old Man was actually telling the truth, not only was he was the sole Special Rank Alchemist of the association, he was also the Alchemist Grandmaster Association’s Grand Elder!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Alchemist Grandmaster Association had three Grand Elders, and the Ascending Moon Old Man was one of them.
