 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the eight of them were immersed in unbridled laughter, a sudden overwhelming dragon might descended over them, vast and profound, shocking the eight Tenth God Realm masters. Turning around to look, none of them could tell when an enormous five-clawed golden dragon had appeared behind them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I-it’s a Highgod Realm master!!” One of them shrieked albeit slightly tongue-tied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s small lake-sized eyes fixed a cold gaze on the eight people, then without any warning, one of its claws slammed down and two people ended up like the previous Wuyue and Zhang Quan, turning into human-shaped patties before they could even utter a cry. The scent of blood diffused in the air as two meat patties were stuck to the floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mer—!” One of the remaining masters was just about to cry out for mercy in fear, but only managed so say one syllable before Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s dragon claw slammed down on him, sending him on his way like the two before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rest finally recovered their senses at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had been wondering where Wuyue and Zhang Quan went after they walked into the main hall, and now, the truth of the matter had dawned on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Xiaolong actually had a Highgod Realm divine dragon protecting him?! The remaining five people were paler than pale as death cast a shadow over their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Huang Xiaolong, please spare us!” One of the remaining five cried for mercy, even kneeling before him. Seeing this, the four others quickly got down on their knees as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As if he had just heard a joke, Huang Xiaolong let out a loud laugh, “Weren’t you the ones who just told me to cry to the heavens and beg you not to leave?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is it that you want, I’m willing to give you anything, please spare our lives! We have gone through untold hardships to reach Tenth Order God Realm, we don’t want to die, don’t want to die. Don’t kill us!” The other four cried incoherently, babbling whatever came to their minds as long as Huang Xiaolong was willing to spare them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Too late!” Huang Xiaolong scoffed, his eyes signaling to Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nodding in return, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s claws fell like the death god’s scythe. Bottomless despair was reflected in the five people’s eyes. If the dragon was a peak late-Tenth Order God Realm master, there might still be a slim chance of escaping. However, it was an actual Highgod Realm master before their eyes, there was naught the slimmest thread of hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, there were five new additions of human-shaped patties on the main hall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi transformed into a streak of golden light, returning to the Dragon Pearl space on Huang Xiaolong’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Watching the eight human-shaped patties, Huang Xiaolong’s expression was hard and cold. Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi was a secret that must not be known by outsiders, moreover, Huang Xiaolong’s current spiritual force was too weak to control a God Realm master, hence, he could only eliminate all of them once and for all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi wasn't fully confident that he could kill a peak late-Tenth Order God Realm, it was a different matter for a bunch of mid and early Tenth Order God Realms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Peng, Su Yan, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu were hit with another bout of shock staring at the eight new meat patties on the main hall floor. A few seconds prior, these were eight fighting-fit Tenth Order God Realm masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside Wuyue and Zhang Quan’s spatial rings lay quite a huge amount of divine grade spirit pellets, saint grade spirit stones, Xuanwu coins, and medicinal herbs ranging from a few thousand years old to above ten thousand years old, but these were useless to Huang Xiaolong. Hence, they were quickly distributed among his parents and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wuyue and the nine other corpses were thrown into the Linglong Treasure Pagoda for the Poison Corpse Scarabs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These ten people merely had a business relationship with the Azure Sea Firm and weren't an integral part of the firm, which was why, even after killing these ten people, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t worried that the firm would question him. If they happened to ask, he could just glaze over the situation with an excuse, saying that the ten of them had already left the Luo Tong Residence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu were laden with whip marks from punishment, most wounds were merely skin deep, with no serious repercussions. With Huang Xiaolong’s divine grade spirit pellets, both of them healed swiftly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Xiaolong decided to stay in the Luo Tong Residence for the time being&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After his Master Feng Yang helped resolve Huang Peng, Su Yan, and his sister Huang Min’s innate talent problem, they had been taking the divine grade spirit pellets given by Huang Xiaolong every day and their strength had grown exponentially, reaching mid and late-Third Order Xiantian realm. Whereas his younger brother Huang Xiaohai, nephew Guo Xiaofan, as well as brother-in-law Guo Tai, they each advanced until Ninth and Tenth Order Xiantian realm, half-step Saint realm was only a matter of time. However, whether they could break through to Saint realm would depend on opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After arriving in the Cloudsea Mainland, Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, Blessed Buddha Emperor Shi Fantian, Emperor Duanren, Yu Ming, Haotian, Fei Hou, and the others’ cultivation had visibly increased.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu were already half-step God Realm. With his support, Huang Xiaolong was confident that both of them would be able to reach peak half-step God Realm in twenty years’ time and break through to God Realm within a hundred years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blessed Buddha Emperor, on the other hand, had also stepped into half-step God Realm, and he was even slightly stronger compared to Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu. He was at the edge of peak half-step God Realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Emperor Duanren was now a Tenth Order Saint realm, the Guo Family Ancestor reached Fourth Order Saint realm, Yu Ming advanced until peak late-First Order Saint realm, while both Haotian and Fei Hou were peak half-step Saint realm. It was the same with Huang Xiaolong’s best buddy Xie Puti, he was now a peak half-step Saint realm. Just a little more accumulation and he would be able to step into Saint realm. However, no breakthrough came easily, although Xie Puti possessed a high talent, other elements also played a part, especially opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That year, during the Duanren Imperial City Battle, Xie Puti’s cultivation was higher than Huang Xiaolong, but now, he could only admire Huang Xiaolong from afar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the same day, Huang Xiaolong went in search of Xie Puti for a drinking session, reminiscing about the old times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How is it? Did any girl take your fancy?” Huang Xiaolong jested, “If there is one, I’ll ask your old Ancestor to go propose a marriage for you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A wry smile emerged on Xie Puti’s face, “So what if I took fancy to one? I’m not even a Saint realm cultivator, less than a fart on this Cloudsea Mainland. Let me breakthrough to God realm first, then we'll talk.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Breakthrough to God Realm?” Huang Xiaolong frowned. “This is the other side’s requirement?” Although Xie Puti was highly talented, to break through to God Realm was not something easy. The reason Huang Xiaolong seemingly broke through to God Realm easily was due to the innate spiritual embryo that he found.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bitter expression on Xie Puti’s face deepened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With your talent, you can definitely advance to God Realm.” Huang Xiaolong said solemnly. However, in Huang Xiaolong’s estimation, even if Xie Puti took the Black Warrior Greater Strength Pellets and Hailstone Divine Pills that he gave on a daily basis, just arriving at peak half-step God Realm would take Xie Puti at least three hundred years. As for God Realm, no one could say for sure, perhaps in five hundred years, maybe even longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xie Puti nodded, his eyes resolute, “I will definitely cultivate harder and strive for the earliest breakthrough.” As he said this, he looked gratefully at Huang Xiaolong, “Xiaolong, thank you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xie Puti was well aware that without Huang Xiaolong’s help, in these short years, he wouldn’t be able to reach peak half-step Saint realm. He might not even reach Tenth Order Saint realm in his life. Moreover, he was sure that his future God Realm breakthrough could be realized because of Huang Xiaolong’s help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’re brothers, no need to say these words.” Huang Xiaolong laughed, “Come, drink up.”</span></p>
