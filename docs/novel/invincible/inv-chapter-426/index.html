 <p><strong>Chapter 426: Shi Xiaofei’s Whereabouts</strong></p>
 <p><span>Treasure City, Castellan Manor’s back garden.</span></p>
 <p><span>Steward Tan An and a Castellan Manor Saint realm expert, Li Feng, were lounging at inside the stone pavilion, enjoying wine in leisure.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I wonder what important matters Cult Leader has that he needed to make a trip to Peace Emperor World and could not return on a short notice.” Tan An said while his fingers nursed the wine cup in a toast.</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Feng too raised his wine cup. Two cups clinked and both men threw their heads back, gulping the wine down. Li Feng shook his head, “Cult Leader’s matter is not something slaves like us can assume.” There were worship and reverence in his voice.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Then let Huang Xiaolong live a few more years of arrogance.” Tan An simply said, then his tone changed, “That woman, is she really Shi Xiaofei? Snow Wind Continent Blessed Buddha Empire’s Princess?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Feng nodded, “It shouldn’t be wrong. That Shi Xiaofei is Snow Wind Continent’s number one beauty, truly a beauty that stirs people’s hearts. The Young Lord can’t be blamed for falling for her.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Tan An said, “Forget about the Young Lord, even I feel hot just thinking of her face, that slight smile and every little action is so enticing. If I can dual cultivate with such a woman for a night, I’m be willing to do it even if my cultivation regresses.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Feng laughed heartily, “Alright, since the Young Lord has taken an interest in that woman, we shouldn’t delude ourselves.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Tan An nodded his head, acknowledging a fact.</span></p>
 <p><span>Right at this time, a cold harrumph sounded from the void. The noise came too suddenly, alarming both Tan An and Li Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Who is it?!” Both men jumped to their feet.</span></p>
 <p><span>Tan An and Li Feng barely got to their feet when a black-haired young man appeared, strolling out from the darkness. With every step the black-haired young man took, the dark red energy shrouding his body seemed to grow a shade darker.</span></p>
 <p><span>A horrifying murderous aura of slaughter wove a net around the entire manor back garden.</span></p>
 <p><span>The look in Tan An and Li Feng’s eyes grew dignified.</span></p>
 <p><span>What a strong momentum!</span></p>
 <p><span>This young man’s strength was definitely above both of them!</span></p>
 <p><span>Still, both of them composed themselves a moment later remembering where they were—the Castellan Manor. This calmed both men considerably.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This friend, what matters do you have trespassing into the Castellan Manor at this late hour?” Tan An questioned, his tone bore a hint of hostility.</span></p>
 <p><span>The black-haired young man was none other than Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What matters?” Huang Xiaolong sneered, “Where is Shi Xiaofei?” At first, he only had a hunch that the fact Shi Xiaofei went missing was related to Treasure City’s Castellan Manor, but he didn’t expect to run right into Tan An and Li Feng’s conversation. Shi Xiaofei really fell into Cosmos God Cult’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span>Tan An and Li Feng were taken aback by Huang Xiaolong’s question.</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Feng laughed, trying to lighten up the tension, “So this friend is an expert from the Blessed Buddha Empire, in that case, I’ll happily oblige the truth. In fact, our Young Lord and Princess Shi Xiaofei have mutual feelings toward each other and are already betrothed to each other. The wedding is coming soon, at that time, we will send someone to inform the Blessed Buddha Empire.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong looked at both men, a cold laugh came from his throat; in the conversation earlier, it was clearly the Cosmos God Cult’s &nbsp;Young Lord that was interested in Shi Xiaofei, but now, this man actually dared to claim that both people were in love with each other? Betrothed to each other? That was even more ridiculous to the ears.</span></p>
 <p><span><span>The Cosmos God Cult decided on the wedding in a one-sided manner, only informing the Blessed Buddha Empire close to the wedding day? By that time, the rice would already be cooked <a href="#footnote-1" id="footnoteref-1">[1]</a>, the Blessed Buddha Empire wouldn’t be in a position to refuse or retaliate.</span></span></p>
 <p><span>From another aspect, it could be said that the Blessed Buddha Empire carried little importance in the Cosmos God Cult’s eyes. They did this knowing full well who Shi Xiaofei was!</span></p>
 <p><span>“How do you want to die?” The look in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes sharpened.</span></p>
 <p><span>One of the points Huang Xiaolong heard from these men’s conversation was that the Cosmos God Cult Leader went to the Peace Emperor World, and since their biggest honcho was not around, Huang Xiaolong needn’t have qualms in dealing with them!</span></p>
 <p><em><span>How do you want to die?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Anger rose in Tan An and Li Feng’s heart. Both of them were Saint realm experts, not to mention they were at the Treasure City’s Castellan Manor, how dare this young man act so insolent?</span></p>
 <p><span>Tan An snickered, “What a big tone! Do you think you’re Huang Xiaolong?!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The moment Tan An finished his question, a swarm of buzzing black beetles flew toward the men, casting over the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span>The two men were stunned, these were…?!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Poison Corpse Scarabs?! The name flashed in their minds at almost the same time, and their faces lost all colors in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span>Even though neither of them had actually seen a real Poison Corpse Scarab, these black beetles that were flying right at them looked exactly like the recently famed Poison Corpse Scarabs!</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Huang Xiaolong?!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Two pairs of eyes were fixed on Huang Xiaolong, filled with horror. Just as the name flashed in their minds, both let out a shout and struck their palms out at the black cloud of Poison Corpse Scarabs.</span></p>
 <p><span>Two Saint realm experts attacking at full force, the impact was enough to split mountains.</span></p>
 <p><span>Contrary to their expectations, when they struck to repel the Poison Corpse Scarabs, a golden ring appeared above their heads, shining down a bright light that enshrouded them entirely.</span></p>
 <p><span>Tan An and Li Feng felt as if space solidified, their bodies unable to move a millimeter.</span></p>
 <p><span>“God Binding Ring!” Glancing at the golden ring above them, Tan An exclaimed aloud. Before another word could come from Tan An’s mouth, a sharp pain in his arm drew his attention. When his gaze shifted toward his arm, Tan An saw a Poison Corpse Scarab crawling around. Just like the rumors described the process, it didn’t take long for Tan An to feel numb all over his body, unable to gather any battle qi in his Qi Sea. Tan An turned deadly pale.</span></p>
 <p><span>Almost at the same time, Li Feng was also bitten by a Poison Corpse Scarab.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong retrieved the God Binding Ring and released from their binding. Tan An and Li Feng plummeted to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span>The ground shook from the impact.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Huang Xiaolong, you, what do you want?” Crashed to the ground, Tan An could no longer conceal the great terror from his face, reiterating, “This is the Treasure City’s Castellan Manor.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong scoffed, “I know that this is Treasure City’s Castellan Manor.” Retrieving the swarm of Poison Corpse Scarabs, he walked toward Tan An and Li Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span>Watching Huang Xiaolong call away the Poison Corpse Scarabs, both men looked slightly better, thinking that Huang Xiaolong still had qualms with them being inside the Castellan Manor. He wouldn’t really dare to commit murder here.</span></p>
 <p><span>While both of were thinking of ways to delay for more time until Cosmos God Cult experts realized what was going on and hurry over, they saw Huang Xiaolong’s pupils suddenly turn violet as two ‘soul’ characters flew out from his eyes straight into Tan An and Li Feng’s pupils.</span></p>
 <p><span>A bright violet light flashed in their eyes and disappeared, leaving two dull, dispirited looking men.</span></p>
 <p><span>The violet light in Huang Xiaolong’s pupils intensified. It was only half an hour later when they returned to normal Huang Xiaolong was worse for wear, but Tan An and Li Feng appeared normal as they were, not dull and dispirited.</span></p>
 <p><span>“You, what did you do to us just now?!” Li Feng demanded as he glared at Huang Xiaolong. All he could remember was a flash of violet light in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, then nothing, as if he lost consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong looked at the two men, chuckling as he brought the Poison Corpse Scarabs out again. Soon, blood-curdling screams echoed in the back garden. This time, Huang Xiaolong absorbed Tan An and Li Feng’s souls into the Supreme Ghost Flag, turning the men’s soul into ghost spirits for the flag instead of food for the Poison Corpse Scarabs.</span></p>
 <p><span>Earlier, Huang Xiaolong used the Ancient Puppetry Art and Soul Mandate to control the two men’s souls, scouring through their minds for information. However, with Huang Xiaolong’s current level of spiritual force, he could only manage a very small portion of memories, such as everything that happened in the recent two year’s time.</span></p>
 <p><span>From Tan An and Li Feng’s most recent memories, Huang Xiaolong found out that Shi Xiaofei and two of her maid that followed her to Starcloud Continent were all captured and brought to the Cosmos God Cult headquarters by Cosmos God Cult’s Young Lord, Xie Hui.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Xie Hui.” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes glinted with a cold light, disappearing into the night’s darkness in a flicker.</span></p>
 <p><span>Because Huang Xiaolong blocked the space around the back garden using the God Binding Ring, the commotion that happened in the back garden went unnoticed by Peng Zhuang and everyone else in the manor.</span></p>
 <p><span>Next morning, when Peng Zhuang strode into the hall, he ordered one of the maids, “Go call Steward Tan An here.” Since last night, there was a strong feeling of unease that wouldn’t go away no matter what, thus Peng Zhuang planned to have Tan An make a trip to the Cosmos God Cult headquarters.</span></p>
