 <p><b>Chapter 397: Archaic Peak Appraisal Firm</b></p>
 <p><span>Iron-Skinned Dog! All of Aowu Shop’s guards! Including Aowu Shop’s Supervisor Lin!</span></p>
 <p><span>All killed!</span></p>
 <p><span>Tu Xiong and the group of young men were shocked. </span></p>
 <p><span>Could it be…?! A thought struck Tu Xiong’s mind, looking once more in the direction Huang Xiaolong disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Who was it? Who actually dared to kill all of Aowu Shop’s guards?” Tu Xiong asked to verify his suspicion.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Rumors say that a black-haired young man went to the Aowu Shop to buy pill refinement ingredients and there was a seven or eight-year-old small child with him that killed those people!” That person who ran out said.</span></p>
 <p><span>“A, a seven or eight-year-old child?!” One of the young men exclaimed, “Impossible, right? The Aowu Shop’s guards are all Xiantian realm experts!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The other young men also showed disbelieving expressions. A seven, eight-year-old small child could kill Xiantian experts?!</span></p>
 <p><span>In their eyes, this was nothing but fantasy.</span></p>
 <p><span>That young man that ran out with the news said, “Don’t say you don’t believe, I myself cannot believe, but there are witnesses. It really was a small kid that killed all those guards, furthermore, he used one punch! That small kid killed those Xiantian guards with one punch!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The young men looked at each other, finding it harder to believe such a tale.</span></p>
 <p><span>A seven to eight-year-old killed a Xiantian realm expert with just one punch? That was just ludicrous!</span></p>
 <p><span>By this time, Huang Xiaolong’s group arrived at a long food street after leaving the pill refinement trading market.</span></p>
 <p><span>In this South Oblast City, there was a unique street where shops offered a variety of food and snacks, whereas big and small restaurants lined the street side by side.</span></p>
 <p><span>Entering the Food Street, various tantalizing scents teased the senses of passersby. Lil’ Tian’s eyes were sparkling like stars in the night sky.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Big brother, I want that one!” Lil’ Tian cried out, a small finger pointed at a small shop not far away that was selling a snack that looked like some kind of bird’s egg. Just that its size was bigger than normal bird eggs.</span></p>
 <p><span>The few of them walked towards that stall.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What kind of eggs are these?” Huang Xiaolong asked the elderly in front of the stall.</span></p>
 <p><span>The elderly introduced enthusiastically, “These eggs are from a kind of bird called greenwind bird, we marinate it in our own special way, it’s a little salty, but it’s delicious. One for one silver coin only.”</span></p>
 <p><span>One gold coin was equivalent to one hundred silver coin. Thus, one silver coin was considered very cheap.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong took out a dozen gold coins saying, “Then we’ll take all of them.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Although there were quite a lot of these bird eggs, they would only cost three to four gold coins at most. When the elderly old man wanted to return the extra gold coins back to Huang Xiaolong, Huang Xiaolong stopped him, telling the elderly to keep them. Then, Huang Xiaolong looked at Lil’ Tian, indicating that he can start eating.</span></p>
 <p><span>Hearing the word ‘eat’, Lil’ Tian couldn’t wait to wolf down the eggs, stuffing his mouth full as incomprehensible noises sounded: “Del-mm-ss, mm-li-cious!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong laughed watching Lil’ Tian. He turned to Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu, “We should also try one.” Picking one of the eggs, Huang Xiaolong took a bite, and indeed, it was savory, as some liquid oozed out in between, the texture wasn't bad either, reminding him of </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tea+eggs&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1yIPhrJrYAhXDrI8KHYgvC5YQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1163&amp;bih=536#imgrc=nUNHp2QEMmCNgM:" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>tea leaf eggs </span></a><span>back on Earth.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu each took one egg, nodding in agreement that it tasted good. As high-level Saint realm experts, as well as Asura’s gate Left and Right Custodians, Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu’s identities and standing were different, hence, they had never tasted these commoner snacks. Taking a bite, both felt that it was quite good, a distinctive flavor compared to the usual big restaurants.</span></p>
 <p><span>The elderly at the stall was genuinely frightened watching Lil’ Tian stuffing more than thirty greenwind bird eggs into that small mouth, urging Lil’ Tian, “Little brother, eat slowly, eat slowly, don’t choke!”</span></p>
 <p><span>To that elderly, he couldn’t afford to be responsible if that eight-year-old kid choked and died due to stuffing himself with more than thirty greenwind bird eggs. Though the incident of someone dying from choking on food had yet to happen on Food Street, then again, who could guarantee that it would never happen.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong saw through the elderly commoner’s worry and laughed, reassuring him, “Elder, no need to worry, my younger brother looks small, but he’s very strong. He can even eat ten Tyrant Boar in one go with no problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Ten Tyrant Boars? The stall elderly was stunned, it was obvious that he didn’t believe Huang Xiaolong’s words. Two to three hundred strong adult men could hardly finish ten Tyrant Boars, what more a little kid?</span></p>
 <p><span>Yet, a brief moment later, before the elder’s shock-widened eyes, Lil’ Tian swept clean close to four hundred greenewind bird eggs in a single breath. One couldn’t tell that there were four hundred eggs inside his little stomach, not to mention the not-yet-satisfied look on Lil’ Tian’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span>After that stall, Huang Xiaolong’s group strolled leisurely along the Food Street while sampling food and snacks that took their fancy. In every stall, the owners’ jaw dropped aghast witnessing Lil’ Tian’s capacity.</span></p>
 <p><span>While Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and Lil’ Tian were enjoying these unique street foods, the upper levels of South Oblast City exploded in a storm.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Aowu Shop, including that Supervisor Lin, fifty-eight Xiantian realm guards were all killed!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“The attacker was actually an eight-year-old kid!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The news spread quicker than wildfire, shaking the forces dwelling in South Oblast City.</span></p>
 <p><span>Castellan Manor, in a hall on the south side of the compound, more than a dozen middle-aged men paced back and forth in anxiety, exchanging words in fearful whispers.</span></p>
 <p><span>The people present in this hall were all Elders of the Aowu Shop. </span></p>
 <p><span>“What should we do? Lord Chief Steward is in still closed-door practice, who knows when he will come out?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“That person not only took away millions worth of pill refinement ingredients, he even dared to kill all of our Aowu Shop guards! This is simply a slap in our face! Blatant provocation! Regardless of who they are, they cannot be allowed to leave South Oblast City alive!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“That’s right, if they leave, where would that put our Aowu Shop’s face!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The Elders agreed unanimously on one point: no matter who it was, regardless of their identity, they must end that person’s life!</span></p>
 <p><span>While everyone was still in heated discussions, a young man in a blue robe walked into the hall. Seeing that young man, everyone in the room quieted down.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Elder Chen, when will Lord Chief Steward come out from his closed-door practice?” One of the Elders inquired as he took a step forward.</span></p>
 <p><span>This young man was Castellan Manor Chief Steward Lio Yun’s disciple, Chen Ding, also one of Aowu Shop’s Elder.</span></p>
 <p><span>Chen Ding scanned the hall, saying, “This time, Master is in closed-door practice to breakthrough to Second Order Saint realm, he should be out in another five to six hours. The matters regarding Supervisor Lin and the guards being killed, we need to wait until Master comes out before making a decision.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Everyone exchanged glances, none of them voiced any objections.</span></p>
 <p><span>Chen Ding went on to say, “Elders please rest assured, I’ve already sent people out to investigate those people’s whereabouts, right now, they’re having a good time eating and drinking on Food Street. Within a few hours, they would still be in South Oblast City.”</span></p>
 <p><span>At this time, Huang Xiaolong’s group was inside a big restaurant called Good Taste Restaurant, seated at a table laden with their best dishes and wine, eating while waiting for Chief Steward Luo Yun to arrive.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu were baffled, four to five hours had passed, but they had yet to see anyone from the Aowu Shop making any movements.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Sovereign, that Luo Yun still hasn’t acted until now, could they be afraid?” Zhang Fu guessed.</span></p>
 <p><span>“We just need to ask to know what’s taking them so long.” Huang Xiaolong extended his hand out, grasping at empty space, in the blink of an eye, a young man was caught in his grasp.</span></p>
 <p><span>This young man was the tail Luo Yun’s disciple, Chen Ding, sent to spy on Huang Xiaolong’s group. Needless to say, this young man shadowing them did not go unnoticed by Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span>Coerced by Huang Xiaolong, the young man quickly spilled the beans on the reason.</span></p>
 <p><span>“In closed-door practice to breakthrough to Second Order Saint realm…” Huang Xiaolong scoffed; so, this was the reason.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Then, Sovereign, are we heading straight to South Oblast City’s Castellan Manor?” Zhao Shu inquired.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “No need.” Huang Xiaolong was confident that Luo Yun would come look for them on his own, saving them a trip to the Castellan Manor.</span></p>
 <p><span>“We’re going to the Archaic Peak Appraisal Firm.” Huang Xiaolong’s tone sounded cold as he spoke, “Coincidentally, I have a few items that I wanted to let the Archaic Peak Appraisal Firm appraise.”</span></p>
 <p><span>After all, all of Aowu Shop’s pill refinement ingredients were appraised and verified by this Archaic Peak Appraisal Firm.</span></p>
