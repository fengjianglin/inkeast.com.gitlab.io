 <h4 style="text-align: left"><u>Chapter 131: Kill Southern Cliffs City Castellan</u></h4>
 <p></p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong understood that this old man in his eighties said this out of kindness. Therefore, he didn’t mind and simply nodded his head: “Very well, I understand.”</p>
 <p>A short while later, the village tribesmen cleaned up the scene and disposed of the Big Sword Sect disciples’ corpses.</p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong separated from the tribesmen. After leaving them, Huang Xiaolong did not return to the Luo Tong Kingdom immediately.</p>
 <p>He and the little violet monkey made a detour to Southern Cliffs City.</p>
 <p>The Southern Cliffs City was located at the most southern point of the Luo Tong Kingdom territory.</p>
 <p>Compared to the Luo Tong Royal City, the Southern Cliffs City was significantly smaller. Perhaps due to the frequent abrasions from the sand storms, the tall city walls seemed thin and they were mottled with obvious holes and cracks.</p>
 <p>After entering the city, Huang Xiaolong inquired about the location of the Castellan Manor and headed towards its direction.</p>
 <p>Instead of paying a visit and making his presence known, Huang Xiaolong chose a small restaurant nearby and ordered some dishes and wine, then started eating with the little violet monkey.</p>
 <p>When the meal was finished and both of them were sated, night had already descended in the city. Huang Xiaolong paid and left with the little violet monkey.</p>
 <p>In the dead of night when the sky was at its darkest.</p>
 <p>The Southern Cliffs Castellan Manor was brightly lit, and there were night duty guards on patrol around the compound.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a black shadow leaped over the tall walls of the Castellan Manor, and avoiding the patrolling guards, the silhouette sneaked into the Manor before coming to a certain courtyard.</p>
 <p>This black shadow was of course, Huang Xiaolong.</p>
 <p>Entering the courtyard, Huang Xiaolong cautiously approached one of the rooms.</p>
 <p>According to his knowledge, this courtyard was where the Southern Cliffs Castellan, Wei Yang, resided.</p>
 <p>When he got close, Huang Xiaolong gently pushed the curtains away, opening a tiny slit view into the room. He saw two naked bodies tumbling vigorously on the bed. The male was in his fifties with a robust body, whereas the female looked around twenty at most.</p>
 <p>The man was thrusting on top of the girl as she panted heavily, her generous breasts heaving dramatically.</p>
 <p>Before he traveled to the manor, Huang Xiaolong inquired about the Southern Cliffs Castellan’s facial features. This help him confirm that the man performing such vigorous actions on the bed was indeed Castellan Wei Yang. The young woman was probably one of his many concubines. Other than the main wife, Wei Yang had taken in seven younger concubines.</p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong retreated quietly from the window, and when he reappeared, both he and the little violet monkey were already in the room. Obviously, the two other people in the room were too engrossed in their ‘creation ritual’ to notice Huang Xiaolong’s presence in the room.</p>
 <p>Seeing Wei Yang had no indication to stop, Huang Xiaolong could only cough dryly to draw his attention.</p>
 <p>“Who is it?!” Wei Yang and his little concubine were surprised and they turned around instantly.</p>
 <p>But, seeing that Huang Xiaolong was just a sixteen-year-old young man, their vigilance relaxed.</p>
 <p>Recovering from his surprise at the intrusion, Wei Yang did not get up from his little concubine’s naked body, and while moving his lower body, his cold voiced questioned Huang Xiaolong: “Little brat, speak, who sent you?”</p>
 <p><em>Who sent me?</em></p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong was startled; this Wei Yang knew he came to kill him, yet he was still in the mood to continue in his pleasure. Then again, it seems Wei Yang was at the ‘critical juncture’.</p>
 <p>The little concubine was slightly embarrassed with an audience. However, seeing that Wei Yang did not stop, she cooperated obediently, moving her ass.</p>
 <p>“Your son is Big Sword Sect’s disciple?” Huang Xiaolong’s aloof voice sounded.</p>
 <p>Wei Yang grinned complacently: “That’s right. You were sent by those lowly tribes? Hey hey, those stupid pigs, don’t they know that I, Wei Yang, am a Ninth Order expert? They actually sent a baby like you over to kill me?”</p>
 <p><em>Ninth Order!</em></p>
 <p>This was the main reason why Wei Yang did not panic when he saw Huang Xiaolong in the room, and he even was in the mood to continue his ‘business.’</p>
 <p>“As a Luo Tong Kingdom’s City Castellan, you actually protected Baolong Kingdom’s Big Sword Sect disciples killing Luo Tong Kingdom’s subjects.” An angry light gleamed in Huang Xiaolong’s pupils.</p>
 <p>Wei Yang continued his vigorous thrusting actions, and he actually moved increasingly faster, getting closer to the climax.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, so what? Kid, wait till after I kill you, I’ll capture those lowly peasants and throw them into the prison. I’ll take care of them well. Coincidentally, the Southern Cliffs City’s prison emptied out a lot recently.”</p>
 <p>Then, at this point, Wei Yang let out a loud grunt, and it finally ended. He got up from the woman’s body, not bothering to cover himself as he got down from the bed.</p>
 <p>The little violet monkey on Huang Xiaolong’s shoulder actually squeaked out after looking at Wei Yang’s lower body.</p>
 <p>While Wei Yang was puzzled, Huang Xiaolong chuckled sheepishly and translated: “The little guy said, your body is so robust, yet unexpectedly, your ‘tool’ is so small!”</p>
 <p><em>“What?!”</em> Wei Yang was stunned. When the meaning sunk in, his anger soared, but before he could do anything else, Huang Xiaolong flashed and was already right in front of him.</p>
 <p>Wei Yang panicked and aimed a punch at Huang Xiaolong, but it was one step too late. Two lethal blade lights flickered in the room; one slit across Wei Yang’s throat and the other slashed down from the middle of his eyebrow.</p>
 <p>Both of Wei Yang’s eyes turned sluggish as he stared at Huang Xiaolong, and then, he crashed to the floor.</p>
 <p>On the other side of the bed, the little concubine just got up from the bed, and wanting to put on her clothes, she caught sight of Wei Yang tumbling down with his blood spurting out in a mess. Her hands flew to her mouth as she shrieked shrilly, as loud as she could. At such a time, she couldn’t be bothered with her clothes anymore as she made a dash towards the door. He had to admit, this little concubine of Wei Yang’s really had quite the figure, slim and curvaceous, with white, tender skin that could squeeze water out from it. When she ran, her breasts bounced merrily, creating a stark contrast to the thick, black bush below.</p>
 <p>However, just as she reached the door, Huang Xiaolong flickered and stood between her and the door. The Blades of Asura quietly drew a red line across her slim throat.</p>
 <p>Wei Yang’s little concubine tumbled down with her face on the ground and her perky buttocks facing the roof.</p>
 <p>At this time, footsteps thundered in the Castellan Manor with voices barking orders, and the noise grew closer and louder. Evidently, the little concubine’s high-pitched scream alerted the guards, and all of them were rushing to this location.</p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong did not linger around. Bringing the little violet monkey with him, they made their way out from the courtyard and vanished from the area.</p>
 <p>Seconds after Huang Xiaolong had left, all the Castellan Manor guards arrived, rushing into the room. Immediately after entering, their eyes went towards Wei Yang’s and this little concubine’s naked corpses.</p>
 <p>But, most of the guards’ attention were on the little concubine’s arse, and Adam’s apples contracted as these guards swallowed their saliva. Although Wei Yang’s little concubine laid face down, and they could not admire her generous bosom, her rounded buttocks with dark grass peeking out from the gaps were sufficient to make these men’s blood run hot, erecting a tent in their pants.</p>
 <p>“Go and search, the murderer must be found!” Moments later, the captain guard with a pitched tent in his pants finally regained his senses and bellowed.</p>
 <p><em>The Castellan is dead!</em></p>
 <p>If they can’t catch the murderer and Duke Wei Bi puts the blame on them, all of them would be buried together with the Castellan!</p>
 <p>At this time, all the guards also realized the grave circumstances and thinking of the consequences, their lower parts went soft as they hurried out to capture the murderer.</p>
 <p>However, they didn’t even know who the murderer was, so how were they going to make an arrest?</p>
 <p>After leaving the Southern Cliffs Castellan Manor, Huang Xiaolong also left the city and made his way back to the Luo Tong Royal City. Not long after, the news about the Southern Cliffs Castellan, Wei Yang, and his little concubine spread throughout the city. Compared to Wei Yang’s death, most of the people relished in the details of little concubine’s circumstances when they were killed − the naked body, the plump ass, and so forth.</p>
