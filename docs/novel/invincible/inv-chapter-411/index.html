 <p><strong>Chapter 411: Taking Control of Asura’s Gate</strong></p>
 <p><span>Watching Huang Xiaolong walking towards them, the Domain Leaders’ hearts jumped, the fear inside their hearts was obvious through their eyes…</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong continued to stride slowly to the group of Domain Leaders; one step at a time…</span></p>
 <p><span>A heavy pressure enveloped the several Domain Leaders, forcing them back unconsciously.</span></p>
 <p><span>Suddenly, one of the Domain Leaders fell to his knees in salute, lauding, “Subordinate greets the Sovereign, Sovereign is invincible throughout!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The rest of them were stunned, each stared stupidly at the one kneeling down.</span></p>
 <p><span>After a brief moment of hesitation, another two Domain Leaders followed and knelt in salute toward Huang Xiaolong: “Subordinate greets the Sovereign, Sovereign is invincible throughout!”</span></p>
 <p><span>More and more Domain Leaders followed the trend of things, saluting to Huang Xiaolong. Although they were loyal to Chen Tianqi before, after all, humans were afraid of death at their core. Not to mention, Huang Xiaolong already killed Chen Tianqi, there was no need for them to throw their lives away for a dead Chen Tianqi.</span></p>
 <p><span>The most crucial point of all was that Huang Xiaolong possessed the Asura Ring and cultivated the Asura Sword Skill. In accordance with Asura’s Gate rules, he was the rightful successor to the Sovereign position.</span></p>
 <p><span>Every one of the Asura’s Gate Domain Leaders was on their knees paying respects, including Chen Tianqi’s most loyal confidante, Gu Wen!</span></p>
 <p><span>Gu Wen’s silhouette knelt down amongst the other Domain Leaders, with proper etiquette and respect that left no space for criticism, but Huang Xiaolong’s sudden attack sent Gu Wen flying out.</span></p>
 <p><span>This abrupt action scared the other Domain Leaders.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Huang Xiaolong, you!” Gu Wen climbed from the ground, glowering at Huang Xiaolong, shocked and furious at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Huang Xiaolong?” Huang Xiaolong satirized, “You think I don’t know what you’re trying to scheme in your heart? Kneeling down to me was just an act, fake loyalty. In your heart, you’re plotting how to defer to Deities Templar, spying for them in the dark and scheming how to kill me?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong’s spiritual force had improved tremendously, both the Ancient Puppetry Art and Soul Mandate had reached the fifth level. As long as the other side’s spiritual force was weaker than his, Huang Xiaolong could read the other’s thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span>Gu Wen’s face flushed a deep red hearing Huang Xiaolong’s words. Showing anger, Gu Wen shouted, “Huang Xiaolong, this is just an excuse for you, you know that I am Sovereign Chen’s confidante, that’s why you are using such an excuse to kill me!” Then he turned around to the rest Domain Leaders, trying to incite a furor, “Everyone, you’ve seen it for yourselves, even if we submit to Huang Xiaolong sincerely, he will still kill us! It would be better to fight him for a way out, the chances might even be bigger than this!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Indeed, another three Domain Leaders stood up from the group after being ‘persuaded’ by Gu Wen, glaring at Huang Xiaolong with furious eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Huang Xiaolong, you try to kill our brothers using a flimsy excuse, you’re not worthy to be our Asura’s Gate Sovereign!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“That’s right, you’re not worthy!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“We’ll fight you!” All three of them started to attack Huang Xiaolong with vicious moves.</span></p>
 <p><span>Just when Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu were about to act, Huang Xiaolong’s figure shot forward at rapid speed, and six arms emerged from his back. All six arms struck out with the Godly Xumi Art at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span>Struck by the Godly Xumi Art, all three Domain Leaders wailed painfully as their bodies were thrown back, crashing down at a corner of the Asura Square.</span></p>
 <p><span>Watching six arms materializing from Huang Xiaolong’s back, all the Domain Leaders were stunned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>What kind of battle skill was this?!</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong told Chen Tianqi about the Godly Mt. Xumi before he died, however, he blocked the outside space. Because of that, he and Chen Tianqi were the only ones who knew the contents of the short conversation. None of the Asura’s Gate Domain Leaders had any idea about the Godly Mt. Xumi…</span></p>
 <p><span>At this point, Gu Wen suddenly leaped up, wanting to flee at the fastest speed, but Huang Xiaolong had expected this from the beginning. Thus, when Gu Wen leaped into the air, an Asura Demon Claw slammed down on him, accompanied by ten thousand howling evil spirits, striking down at Gu Wen’s back and sending him down to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong walked over to Gu Wen, stopping right in front of him, but he did not kill him. Instead, he sealed Gu Wen’s Sea Qi, then a palm strike sent Asura Qi into Gu Wen’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span>Chen Tianqi had the bright luminance energy and wasn't afraid of the Asura qi’s corrosive effect entering his body, but this Gu Wen wasn’t so lucky. Almost instantly, a desperate cry came from Gu Wen, trashing and rolling on the ground as Asura Qi spread to every part of his body, the feeling was worse than a million ants gnawing on his flesh. Strong as his will was, he couldn’t withstand this extent of torture.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Huang, Huang Xiaolong, kill me, me, kill me!” Gu Wen pleaded in a broken voice. With his Qi Sea sealed, he was powerless to blow himself up, he couldn’t die even if he wanted to.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Kill you?” Huang Xiaolong sneered, “You admit that you did think about conspiring with Deities Templar?”</span></p>
 <p><span>This time, Gu Wen nodded with any hesitation, “I admit, I admit, kill me, kill me!” His face was distorted with excruciating pain. The three Domain Leaders that attacked Huang Xiaolong based on Gu Wen’s instigation looked ugly at his confession.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Kill you?” Huang Xiaolong’s cold voice sounded, “Since you ask for it, I shall fulfill your wish.”</span></p>
 <p><span>A sense of deep relief washed over Gu &nbsp;Wen hearing Huang Xiaolong’s reply. To the current him, death was the best salvation.</span></p>
 <p><span>In the next moment, numerous Poison Corpse Scarabs landed on Gu Wen’s body, more and more, covering his entire body. Fear crept up his face and screams more horrible than before tore through his throat.</span></p>
 <p><span>The remaining Domain Leaders grew paler by the second watching everything unfold, even the way they looked at Huang Xiaolong changed.</span></p>
 <p><span>In their eyes, Huang Xiaolong was an Asura that broke out from hell. At first, they thought that Huang Xiaolong would bestow Gu Wen with a quick, merciful death, but he…</span></p>
 <p><span>It didn’t take long, Gu Wen’s cries subsided and completely stopped, while Huang Xiaolong looked over at the rest of the Domain Leaders.</span></p>
 <p><span>Not daring to face Huang Xiaolong, all of them had their heads lowered.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I’m a person that deals with reward and punishment clearly, those that contributed merits to Asura’s Gate will be rewarded! Whereas those who betrayed Asura’s Gate will end up just like him!” Huang Xiaolong’s cold voice reverberated in the square, a finger pointed at Gu Wen’s remains.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Domain Leaders continued keeping their heads down.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Where did Chen Tianqi detain the Elders?” Huang Xiaolong asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Replying to Sovereign, Chen Tianqi had all the Elders locked up behind the mountain’s sea prison!” One of the Domain Leaders stepped forward, reporting to Huang Xiaolong with a respectful manner.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span>Then, Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the Domain Leaders led the way, releasing all of the Asura’s Gate Elders that were imprisoned at the back mountain’s sea prison.</span></p>
 <p><span>Despite that, by the time Huang Xiaolong brought these Elders out, many of them were inflicted with unimaginable tortures by Chen Tianqi and Deities Templar, so much that hardly a fully intact person remained; some had their tongues cut out, others had their eyeballs dug out, not to mention their Qi Seas and meridians wasted.</span></p>
 <p><span>Seeing the tragic state of these Elders, Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and Huang Xiaolong all burned with wrath.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Li Molin, you stinky bitch, there will be a day when I get my hands on you, I’ll have you raped and then killed, killed and raped again!” Zhang Fu’s straightforward character couldn’t hold and roared at the top of his lungs. The extent of his fury was obvious to all.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong took out the many ten thousand years old elixirs from the Asura Ring, feeding them to the Elders one by one, helping them heal their injuries. Even so, the several Elders that had their tongues cut off and eyeballs dug out were unlucky, those body parts could not regrow.</span></p>
 <p><span>On the other hand, the message about the battle on the Asura Square, about Deities Templar miserably fleeing with Li Molin amongst them and Chen Tianqi being killed by Huang Xiaolong, spread like a hurricane to every part of Starcloud Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span>It didn’t take long to travel to Snow Wind Continent, Ten Directions Continent, or to the experts of the Bedlam Lands.</span></p>
 <p><span>Another great tremor struck the Martial Spirit World.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Huang Xiaolong killed Chen Tianqi with his own hands? His strength actually reached that extent, that’s too terrifying, right?! Chen Tianqi was a peak late-Fifth Order Saint realm!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Those Poison Corpse Scarabs can actually evolve!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Huang Xiaolong has taken over the Asura’s Gate, he’s the recognized Sovereign, this will be a big headache to Deities Templar, I wonder what will Deities Templar do next!”</span></p>
