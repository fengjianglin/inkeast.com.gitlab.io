 <p><b>Chapter 24: Protecting Loved Ones</b></p>
 <p><span style>After Li Mu had spoken, Li Cheng was feeling very nervous as he went towards the blood-soaked coffin. His palm hit the coffin cover, and it flew away, revealing the dead body of a sixteen to seventeen-year-old boy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The color of the boy’s skin had turned to a muted green, so dark that it looked almost black.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Li Cheng got a clear look at the youth’s face, his entire body trembled and&nbsp;his eyes became red-rimmed as&nbsp;tears fell from his face. “Feng’er! My Feng’er!” Li Cheng carried the boy’s body out of the coffin and hugged him tightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My Feng’er!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You cannot die, Feng’er!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Cheng’s mournful wails were heart-wrenching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And when Li Mu saw the young boy’s face, tears fell from his face. He stood there and cried, no longer caring&nbsp;about face or dignity before the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother, Brother!” At this moment, Li Lu who was standing beside Huang Xiaolong dashed out to reach the young boy, sobbing pitifully as both of her hands shook the young boy’s shoulder. “Brother, what’s wrong with you? Brother, please wake up! I don’t want you to die, I don’t want to you to die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother, please wake up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wake up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Lu’s sobs were choked, unable to come out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, the guards, maids, and experts of the Li Residence all knelt down and cries filled the area. The young boy who died was Li Lu’s brother, Li Feng and&nbsp;Li Cheng’s only son. Li Feng’s was very talented and,&nbsp;like Li Lu, he possessed top grade nine martial spirits. Three years ago, he was spotted by Distinct Cloud Sect, one of the most prominent sects of Luo Tong Kingdom, and was taken as an inner court disciple. No one could have imagined that he would be killed and sent back to Li Residence as Li Mu’s birthday gift!</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the patriarchs of the other families and experts who were present shook their heads. They came to congratulate Old Patriarch Li on his eightieth birthday, but instead this scene unraveled before them!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Feng’er, this is Grandfather’s fault. Grandfather has harmed you!” Li Mu knelt down, both of his hands trembled as he touched his grandson’s face. His tears fell on on his grandson’s body, but his grandson could no longer move, and could no longer hear his voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rest assured, Grandfather will definitely avenge you! Absolutely!” Determination showed in Li Mu’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From afar, Huang Xiaolong’s eyes were red as he watched the scene before him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All around was silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long time has passed, Li Mu carried his grandson’s body into Li Residence, and everyone followed. Inside the&nbsp;Li Residence, the once festive and colorful decorations with the red clothes were now offensive to the eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The birthday banquet did not happen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And not long after, the patriarchs and experts who came to convey congratulatory wishes left. The initially festive and lively Li Residence became gloomy and deadly silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, only Huang Xiaolong’s group of five was the last to remain in Li Residence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Li, I’m sorry for your grief.” Huang Qide came beside Li Mu and said in barely a whisper. “If there’s anything, all you need is to send a message, our Huang Clan Manor will be the first to assist!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Huang Qide didn’t imagine such a thing would happen; given the circumstances, it no longer made sense for them to stay any longer at Li Residence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Huang, thank you!” Li Mu said in a sorrowful voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Qide nodded for there was nothing more that could be said; he turned around and was about to leave with Huang Xiaolong and the rest, but Li Lu suddenly ran over to Huang Xiaolong, sobbing, ”Xiaolong, don’t go, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All present turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong blanked. He hesitated for a moment, and then he patted Li Lu’s shoulder gently, and&nbsp;said, “Don’t worry. I will come and visit you often. I will kill whoever is responsible&nbsp; and avenge your brother.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s words, everyone smiled while shaking their heads; they took his words as something naïve children would say, and none of them took Huang Xiaolong’s words seriously. Even Li Mu wasn’t confident to kill the other party, not to say an eight-year-old child?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you definitely must come and see me.” Li Lu said as tears ran down her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong could only nod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Mu got up and personally saw Huang Xiaolong’s group out of the Li Residence and only went back in when the five silhouettes vanished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By evening, Huang Xiaolong’s group of five reached Huang Clan Manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong did not practice that night. He stood on a peak in the back mountain, looking at the twinkling stars in the evening sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two meters behind Huang Xiaolong, stood Fei Hou, keeping watch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Out of nowhere, Huang Xiaolong suddenly asked,“Fei Hou, when people die, do you think they will become a star in the night sky?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Hou was&nbsp;stunned, for he didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong would ask such a question. “Stars in the night sky?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In my previous hometown, someone once said that when a person dies, they become a star in the night sky to protect their loved ones.” Huang Xiaolong explained softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Become a star in the night sky? To protect their loved ones?” Fei Hou shook his head, smiled. “In this world, only those with power and strength can guard and protect their loved ones.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Power and strength!” Huang Xiaolong repeated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, power and strength!” Fei Hou nodded.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s right, power and strength!</span></i><span style> Huang Xiaolong clenched his fists tightly. Under the night sky, his eyes shone like the stars– only the strong have the power to guard and protect loved ones.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He must become strong! He had to grow stronger quickly!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Only this way could he guard and protect his loved ones!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>An invisible aura emanated from Huang Xiaolong, scaring Fei Hou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go back!” Huang Xiaolong said lightly a moment later while withdrawing the aura emanating from his body.&nbsp;He turned around and headed downwards towards Huang Clan Manor and Fei Hou followed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once back at Huang Clan Manor, Huang Xiaolong took out the cold jade bed, sat down, and started practicing Asura Tactics as the&nbsp;spiritual aura from the netherworld gushed down like an endless waterfall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time flies and quickly&nbsp;ten months went by.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Peng noticed that his son had increased his effort in training ever since he came back from Li Residence. Every day, his son stayed inside the small courtyard to practice, hardly stepping out. His parents’ hearts ached to see their son’s crazed training regimen, so they decided to go to the small courtyard and visit Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past ten months, Huang Xiaolong’s battle qi increased at a monstrous rate. Half a month after he came back from Li Residence, he advanced to mid-Fourth Order from peak early-Fourth Order, and two months later, late-Fourth Order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After ten months, not only did Huang Xiaolong breakthrough to the&nbsp;Fifth Order, he actually advanced to peak late-Fifth Order!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for the Body Metamorphose Scripture, he had reached the fifth stage – Power to Haul Nine Bulls Like One.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That morning, the weather was&nbsp;sunny. At the back mountain, Huang Xiaolong swung his blades and a hundred rays of light appeared, forming&nbsp;two five meters tall cyclones circling nonstop. As Tempest of Hell rotated, every tree and bush in its path was cut into a&nbsp;hundred pieces, when&nbsp;suddenly the two cyclones swerved to the left, and then swerved again to the right!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In ten months, not only had Tempest of Hell’s power increased ten times, but Huang Xiaolong could already control the direction according to his will. Now, his Tempest of Hell could last twelve to thirteen breaths of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tempest of Hell has reached major completion and now it only lacks power!” Huang Xiaolong mumbled to himself as he surveyed the surrounding. He has already grasped the mood of Tempest of Hell and its power would continue to increase along with&nbsp;his battle qi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was stated on that piece of paper that once there was someone who used this move, it&nbsp;would annihilate everything within a ten thousand li radius and not even a blade of grass would survive!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are only twenty more days to the next Clan Assembly.” Huang Xiaolong thought to himself as he recalled Blades of Asura and they flew back into his arms.</span></p>
