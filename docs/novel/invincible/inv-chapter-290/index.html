 <p><b>Chapter 290: Meeting Yao Fei Again</b></p>
 <p><span style>Three hours later, Huang Xiaolong made it back to the City of Myriad Gods from Broken Tiger Mountain, it was already midnight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Lord!” Qin Yang, Lifei, and the rest waited in front of a small courtyard for quite some time, when they spotted Huang Xiaolong, all of them hurried up to greet him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong nodded and entered the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taking into consideration the time needed to explore the Four Seas Mountain’s dwelling, they would be spending quite a few days in the City of Myriad Gods, hence Huang Xiaolong decided to purchase a courtyard. The courtyard wasn’t large, but the price reached millions in units, although gold coins were the thing that Huang Xiaolong lacked the least of all. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong had lost count of the amount of gold coins the Nine Tripod Commerce earned these years, adding the riches acquired from the spatial rings of the Xiantian realm experts he killed on the way, these built up to a substantial wealth. Especially the band of exterminated Poison Saint Sect Elders and disciples.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Entering the yard, Huang Xiaolong excused Qin Yang and the other three people, reappearing in the Xumi Temple in a muted flash. Once there, he took out the two manuals, Great Void Divine Fist and Great Demonic Yin Sound, and started practicing. In recent days, ever since he had gotten these two manuals, Huang Xiaolong allocated some time to practice both skills and managed to achieve favorable results.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the Xumi Temple, Huang Xiaolong’s silhouette was seen constantly jumping and shifting positions, both hands forming firm fists as they punched out many times over, creating a series of intangible and surreal giant fist imprints that pierced through the air, striking onto the void. Intangible one moment and solid the next, mystical and strange. This was the Great Void Divine Fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time elapsed, then Huang Xiaolong flicked his wrists, changing the energy circulation in his body as his pupils suddenly glowed dark, his mouth opened and soundwaves burst forth from Huang Xiaolong’s mouth like surging tidal waves, hitting the walls of Xumi Temple and bouncing out in all directions. The echoes lasted for a long time in the Xumi Temple hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to that Poison Saint Sect Elder Jin Zhong’s display of the skill, the power of Huang Xiaolong’s attack had doubled the damage. By the time he was done with practicing these two skills, the sky already started to brighten, Huang Xiaolong stopped and exited the Godly Mt. Xumi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he came out of the Godly Mt. Xumi, Qin Yang, Lifei, Jie Dong, and Liu Chong were already waiting for him in a humble manner. Not wasting more time, the group of five headed to the auction house.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to the auction’s attraction this time around, people rushed from all over to the City of Myriad Gods, the crowd heading towards the auction house was like an endless river of people flowing in one common direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the distance wasn’t far, Huang Xiaolong’s group still used no less than half an hour to pass through the crowded doors. The message related to the Great Thousand Technique mid-grade Heaven rank cultivation technique, Peerless Wind Breaking Finger battle skill, and also the Herculean King’s jade had spread far and wide in the Bedlam Lands. Experts of different forces were rushing into the city to attend the auction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look, that is Sin City’s Young Noble, Zhao Chen!” A sudden ruckus swept the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attracted by the noisy crowd, Huang Xiaolong turned over to look, following the gazes of the crowd. A small path opened by itself between the initially crowd packed entrance, where a handsome young man dressed in a rich brocade robe walked in, escorted by a team of bodyguards. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t expect that even Young Noble Zhao Chen would come here! I heard the Sin City’s Castellan has thirteen children, Young Noble Zhao Chen possesses the highest talent and is most favored by the Sin City’s Castellan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder what Young Noble Zhao Chen’s strength is, there were rumors about him breaking through the Saint realm as early as thirty years ago!” Boisterous discussions happened all at once amongst the crowd, many disciples of families and sects were looking at Zhao Chen with burning eyes full of worship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong was a little surprise hearing the surrounding peoples’ discussions; the handsome young man in black brocade robe was actually one of the Sin City Castellan’s children?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sin City, one of the top ten hegemony forces in the Bedlam Lands, in fact, it stood at the top of the list.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, protected by his guards, Zhao Chen was passing in front of Huang Xiaolong. Unsure whether it was intentional or not, when Zhao Chen was passing by Huang Xiaolong, he glanced at Huang Xiaolong from the corner of his eyes. Their eyes met, and at the same time, an invisible pressure swiftly enveloped Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong’s soul shuddered, but it was only for the briefest moment, and he managed to recover almost instantly. When he did, Zhao Chen and his guards had already entered into the auction hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Lord?” Qin Yang moved closer to Huang Xiaolong, venturing cautiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong looked unblinkingly at Zhao Chen’s back: “Let us go in too.” Although it was only a split second collision, it was enough for Huang Xiaolong to have an estimate of Zhao Chen’s strength: without a doubt, Zhao Chen was genuine Saint realm expert, that kind of momentum couldn’t lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only that, Huang Xiaolong could see it in Zhao Chen’s eyes: </span><i><span style>he knew who he was?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Arriving at the auction house’s entrance, Huang Xiaolong paid a million gold coins and entered the auction hall with Qin Yang and the rest. Going up to the first floor, Huang Xiaolong scanned around, choosing a slightly secluded corner, and sat down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were a total of three floors in this City of Myriad Gods auction house, the second and third floor were reserved private rooms, which were specifically built for Saint realm experts. Thus, Huang Xiaolong could only stay on the first floor, like most of the other guests.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the private room number nine, on the third floor, Zhao Chen sat down. Through the special crystallized walls of the room, he noted Huang Xiaolong taking a seat on a more secluded corner on the first floor below.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s Huang Xiaolong?” He questioned a guard beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A silver-haired old man that was standing to the left of Zhao Chen’s back stepped forward: “Yes, Young Lord.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chen nodded, eyes twinkling, but no one knew what was on his mind. Whereas on Huang Xiaolong’s side, noisy chatters sounded next to him just as he took a seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This time’s auction, even Millennium City’s Senior He Yunxiong is here!” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior He Yunxiong is here?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right, it was said that Senior He Yunxiong’s ancestor was the Herculean King, one of the six ancient kings. Surely, the Herculean King Jade has attracted Senior He Yunxiong over. In my opinion, Senior He Yunxiong is determined to get his hands on the piece of jade!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard that Young Noble Zhao Chen is also here this time, he must also be aiming for that Herculean King Jade, Senior He Yunxiong might not be able to have his wish come true so smoothly.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He Yunxiong? </span></i><span style>Listening in to the small talk taking place beside him, Huang Xiaolong was surprised. He didn’t expect even He Yunxiong would attend this time’s auction, all because of that piece of jade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Millennium City was one of the ten largest cities of the Bedlam Lands, but it ranked slightly to the bottom, and He Yunxiong was the Castellan of Millennium Cityㅡalso one of Bedlam Lands’ top ten experts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Any one of Bedlam Lands’ top ten experts rarely showed their faces in public in dozens of years, everyone was excited to see He Yunxiong attending the auction in person. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, Huang Xiaolong’s eyes suddenly narrowed as he stared fixedly at a figure seated in one the auction hall’s corners. This person was actually Yao Fei! Huang Xiaolong’s eyes turned icy, Yao Fei appearing here in the Bedlam Lands was probably not a coincidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if he had a feeling, Yao Fei turned his head around, his sight collided with Huang Xiaolong’s. At first, Yao Fei was stunned, then it was replaced with the wonderful joy of a hunter locking onto its prey, the desire to kill shone through his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fixing a dead stare at Huang Xiaolong, Yao Fei mouthed soundlessly: </span><i><span style>Huang Xiaolong, you’re dead now!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong’s lips pulled back into a cold sneer.</span></p>
