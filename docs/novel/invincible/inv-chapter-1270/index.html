 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Xiaolong looked away from the burly disciple’s corpse. His cold gaze swept over other disciples that were coming at him with the same intention, before he turned away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The different sects’ disciples who were rushing towards Huang Xiaolong were frightened to a halt as they saw the burly disciple’s head lying a few feet away from his decapitated body. His eyes had remained wide open in disbelief, as if he hadn’t even realized how he had died. Cold sweat dampened the other disciples’ robes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many of them recognized this burly disciple who was still holding a big blade. He was a disciple of the Ghostly Blade Door, called Liu Jin, who was an early Eighth Order Ancient God Realm master. Moreover, he was born with a unique physique, that made his physical defenses stronger than the average cultivators. Yet his head was cut off with a single sword slash by that fatty?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'What’s that fatty's strength?' Surely, it wasn’t at mid-Sixth Order Ancient God Realm cultivation that they could see on the surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distance, Shi Long was inwardly shocked that Huang Xiaolong had actually cut off the Ghostly Blade Door disciple Liu Jin’s head with a single sword slash. But he commented indifferently, “It seems like this kid’s quite strong, no wonder he dares to continue collecting these black crystalline rocks even after our arrival.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Jianfeng snickered, “That little bit of his strength is merely enough to threaten some small sects’ disciples. In front of Senior Brother Shi Long, it’s only a matter of one or two moves before this fatty would crumble down to a miserable defeat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Long nodded in agreement and reminded, “Watch that kid, make sure he doesn’t escape.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Jianfeng reassured him, “Rest assured, Senior Brother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Xiaolong’s action had successfully deterred the other disciples. He continued collecting Eidolon Crystalline Rocks with the little cow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, the bigger the Eidolon Crystalline Rocks were, the better it was. Therefore, Huang Xiaolong ignored the small ones and focused on the bigger-sized Eidolon Crystalline Rocks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Xiaolong flew towards a half-meter high Eidolon Crystalline Rock that was not far ahead. At the same time, a mid-Eighth Order Ancient God Realm Short Blade Gate’s disciple also arrived at this same half-meter high Eidolon Crystalline Rock, bearing the same intention as Huang Xiaolong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That Short Blade Gate’s disciple dazed for a second when he saw Huang Xiaolong, but he soon recovered and warned icily, "Scram, or I will have to make you scram away? Also, before you do that, I want to remind you that I am not the same as that Ghostly Blade Door disciple Liu Jin."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Xiaolong retorted nonchalantly, "I'll also remind you to scram away, before you provoke me to attack you, so SCRAM."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Needless to say, the Short Blade Gate’s disciple was enraged by Huang Xiaolong’s response. A short blade appeared in his hands and slashed at Huang Xiaolong with a thick killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waves of short blade lights surged towards Huang Xiaolong like tidal waves—this was the Short Blade Gate’s supreme technique, the Indomitable Waves Blade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Almost at the same time, Huang Xiaolong raised his right palm, his index finger and middle penetrated through the waves of short blade lights, directly clamping the original short blade between his fingers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was dumbfounded after watching this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Coldness spread in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, his two fingers exerted pressure, snapping the short blade into half. With a flick of his wrist, the broken tip of the short blade pierced into his attacker’s neck, followed by another flick of his finger, and the disciple’s head rolled off his shoulder to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dead!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;In that instant, time froze with a heavy silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Short Blade Gate, Golden Phoenix Pavilion, and other sects disciples’ movements froze. Their expressions were a little dazed with disbelief at what had just transpired before their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although they were shocked by Huang Xiaolong’s strength, they were more appalled because this fat kid had killed a Short Blade Gate’s disciple!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Long was momentarily dazed. Lightning sizzled in his dark pupils; he disappeared in a blur and in a split second appeared next to his fellow disciple’s corpse. As he looked at the decapitated head on the ground, Shi Long turned to glare icily at Huang Xiaolong, “Initially, I had planned to let you live for another hour, but now, you can go to hell!” A glaring lightning burst out of his palms and completely enshrouded him, as he struck at Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Short Blade Gate’s secret technique, the Boundless Universe Lightning Palm!” Seeing Shi Long’s attack, Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s disciple Zhang Yadong exclaimed with an earnest expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some time ago, there was a rumor in Void Sky City that Shi Long had successfully cultivated the Boundless Universe Lightning Palm technique, but it was merely a rumor. But now, they were seeing the truth—Shi Long had really succeeded!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Yadong had believed that both of their strengths were at par with one another. But now since it was confirmed that Shi Long had successfully cultivated the Boundless Universe Lightening Palm, Zhang Yadong knew that Shi Long could suppress him without much effort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Looks like this is the end for that kid!" A Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s disciple standing behind Zhang Yadong said, referring to Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Yadong nodded in agreement, "Only certain Short Blade Gate’s disciples are allowed to cultivate the Boundless Universe Lighting Palm, since its power is earth-shattering…" But he stopped abruptly, as he saw the fatty dispersing all the crackling lighting power with a single punch that sent Shi Long staggering back a dozen meters from the impact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This result stupefied Zhang Yadong and the rest of the Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s disciples. Chen Jianfeng and his fellow disciples’ eyes nearly popped out from their sockets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Other sects’ disciples who had assumed that Huang Xiaolong was a soft persimmon, felt their blood going cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Xiaolong ignored all the shocked gazes that fell upon him, after he had forced Shi Long back with a punch. His three supreme godheads spun as he fully focused on moving that half-meter tall Eidolon Crystalline Rock into his Ghost-Buddha Ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Fifty-three pieces.’ Huang Xiaolong counted in his mind. That was the number of Eidolon Crystalline Rocks he had collected so far. If he counted the Eidolon Crystalline Rocks that the little cow had collected, there would be more than a hundred pieces. This number of Eidolon Crystalline Rocks was enough for him to refine a divine artifact and temper his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Shi Long’s face turned liver-red after he was forced back by Huang Xiaolong. The killing intent in his eyes was akin to a thunderstorm as he stared at Huang Xiaolong, like a hunter looking at a prey. Violent streaks of lightning crackled around his body, portraying his wrath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boundless Universe Lightning Palm—Myriad Lightning Vortex!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lightning around his palms expanded in size, and slammed down madly at Huang Xiaolong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A great vortex was formed as divine lightning fell from the sky and merged with the vortex. The lightning vortex’s power soared as it became bigger, while it continued absorbing more divine lightning. In a split second, over a hundred streaks of lightning were merged into the vortex.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Myriad Lightning Vortex is the most powerful attack in the Boundless Universe Lightning Palm technique. It’s destructive power multiplies by absorbing divine lightning from the sky, however, based on Shi Long’s current strength, his Myriad Lightning Vortex could only absorb five to six hundred streaks of divine lightning power at the most. Then again, that was already a terrifying amount in itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Myriad Lightning Vortex had expanded over Huang Xiaolong’s head in the blink of an eye, sucking Huang Xiaolong up as it spun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Xiaolong was irritated now. Just as he was about to retaliate, the little cow let out a loud sneeze, spitting out roiling purple lightning… Nothing, simply nothing was left of the Myriad Lightning Vortex. The little cow then turned her butt towards Shi Long. With a swing of her tail, purple lightning formed into a purple lightning whip, that cracked straight at Shi Long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Long paled, and quickly began striking his palms out repeatedly, as he panicked. But to his horror, his Boundless Universe Lightning Palm was unable to suppress the force of the purple lightning whip. After seeing that the purple lightning whip was that close to striking him, he executed an ancient technique to dodge the attack and was barely successful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">PA—!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The purple lightning whip struck the spot, right where he was standing a second ago. The whole mountain shook as a several hundred li long crack opened in the ground.</span></p>
