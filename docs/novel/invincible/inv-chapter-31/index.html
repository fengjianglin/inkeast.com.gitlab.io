 <p><b>Chapter 31: Silvermoon Forest </b></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou’s figures slowly disappeared from everyone’s sight as they walked further away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Peng looked at his wife Su Yan that still stood in a daze looking towards their son’s direction, he went beside his wife and softly said, “Yan Mei, let’s go back, our son’s already gone far away.” As he rubbed Su Yan’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan nodded blankly, and Huang Peng held her as they walked back in to Huang Clan Manor with the rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whereas after Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou left Huang Clan Manor, they did not follow the usual road but entered the back mountain, moving deeper into the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crossing the back mountain a few hundred li, they would reach the border of Silvermoon Forest. The Silvermoon Forest was so vast that it traversed more than ten kingdoms’ territory, various beasts lived inside this forest. Thus, Huang Xiaolong decided to hunt some demonic beast while traveling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Fourth Stage Bara Floret Python he killed previously came from Silvermoon Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And three days later, Huang Xiaolong reached the edge of Silvermoon Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He raised his head to look at the sky, seeing the sky gradually grow darker, he said to Fei Hou, “We’ll rest here for the night, and continue our journey tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Sovereign!” Fei Hou acknowledged with respect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little violet monkey on Huang Xiaolong’s shoulder clapped its hands and squeaked. Seeing its action, Huang Xiaolong smiled, “Little guy, go see if there’s any fruits in the area, bring some back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little violet monkey nodded, with a squeak with jumped off Huang Xiaolong’s shoulder. With just a few leaps, it disappeared from sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whereas Fei Hou went to collect dry sticks and tree bark to make a fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A while later, the little violet monkey returned with lots of fresh fruits in its arms; even its mouth was biting on a piece of fruit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is Ice Fruit?!”Fei Hou exclaimed in astonishment looking at the transparent-like fruits inside the little violet monkey’s arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Fruit was rarely seen, although it brought no benefits in regards to enhancing battle qi, instead, it could strengthen the physique and it cost several tens of gold coins on the market.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the little violet monkey saw Fei Hou’s astonishment, it lifted its little head with pride. It put down around seven to eight pieces of Ice Fruit, and then it gestured and squeaked before running off again, coming back with more Ice Fruits in its arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong shook his head and laughed seeing its actions; this little guy was amusing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the journey these few days, every time the violet monkey ran off it would bring back some delicious fruits, so Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou tasted many delicious fruits the whole way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they sat next to the pile of Ice Fruits, Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou took out some dry food, and ate it together with the Ice Fruits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Icy cold and fragrant when the Ice Fruit slid down the throat, Huang Xiaolong ate three without feeling enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong said to Fei Hou, “Too bad there’s no meat, if there was meat, plus a jug of good wine, then it would be perfect.” Huang Xiaolong was a wine lover in his previous life, but he had yet to taste this world’s wine, he wondered how the wine in this world tasted like?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Hou laughed when he heard this. “Sovereign also likes to drink?” From his point of view, the Sovereign, who hadn’t even reached nine years old, actually knew how to drink? Then he added, “Wine, there’s none at the moment, but meat there will be some later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Huang Xiaolong was confused,&nbsp;suddenly the sound of a demonic beast heading their direction was heard, and from the sound of its movement, it was definitely not small.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moments later, two sharp fangs came into sight as a hog like demonic beasts appeared before Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Low-level Demonic Beast, Sandyfern Beast!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Watching as the Sandyfern Beast approach, Fei Hou laughed and stood up. “Sovereign, although this Sandyfern Beast’s meat is a little thick and tough, it is quite delicious.” He was prepared to deal with the Sandyfern Beast, but a small shadow beat him to it. It reached the Sandyfern Beast almost instantly and a ray of cold light gleamed across the Sandyfern Beast’s body as it wailed and fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the culprit, Fei Hou shook his head and, of course, it was the little violet monkey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After killing the Sandyfern Beast, the little violet monkey dragged the corpse that was bigger than its body by a few hundred folds close to the bonfire. It squeaked and gestured towards Huang Xiaolong with its little finger pointed at the massive Sandyfern Beast’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, I already know you’re a glutton.” Huang Xiaolong laughed and took out a sharp blade to skin the Sandyfern Beast, cleaned the meat and roasted it on the bonfire. Drool dripped while waiting for the meat to roast, and soon the air permeated with the smell of fragrant roasted meat and the Violet Spirit Devourer Monkey squatted right in front of the bonfire with an anxious look as its eyes fixed firmly only the meat, salivating nonstop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong smiled watching the little violet monkey’s expression. One year ago, the little guy tasted his roasting skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Hou sat nearby, and his eyes not straying from the meat on the bonfire, the look on his face the same as the little violet monkey’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when the fragrant meat suffused the air, far away, a loud yell rang out. Both Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou were startled, but Fei Hou said, “Sovereign, once we entered Silvermoon Forest, we will see many of these types of killings, and you will get used to it soon. It is better not to interfere.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the faraway fighting noise grew clearer as it grew closer, and it seemed to be moving towards Huang Xiaolong’s direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong frowned. And within seconds, he saw the fighting parties reveal themselves, accompanied by loud yelling noises.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A young girl and a man were being chased by a group of people wearing purple-colored robes; slashes made by swords apparent on the pair of youngsters as blood stained their clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cosmic Star Academy, Purple Robed Sword Sect!” Fei Hou’s brow furrowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong turned to look at Fei Hou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Hou explained: “Young Master, Cosmic Star Academy belongs to the Luo Tong Kingdom, you probably heard about it, whereby Purple Robed Sword Sect is Yunhai Kingdom’s number one sect! The pair of youngsters in front is from Cosmic Star Academy, and those behind them are from Purple Robed Sword Sect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cosmic Star Academy! Purple Robed Sword Sect!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong took another look at the parties headed his way. Cosmic Star Academy was an academy in the Luo Tong Kingdom, this he heard his father mention before. Most of the big and prominent families’ talented descendants gathered there, and in the Luo Tong Kingdom, it was a family’s glory to have their descendants or disciples successfully enroll into Cosmic Star Academy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whereby the Purple Robed Sword Sect, he had never heard of, but since this Purple Robed Sword Sect was Yunhai Kingdom’s number sect, then they must be very powerful, at the very least not weaker than the Cosmic Star Academy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And by this time, both parties were surprised noticing Huang Xiaolong, Fei Hou and the little Violet Spirit Devourer Monkey in their path; the pair of young girl and man flew towards Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou after a slight hesitation. At the same time, called out to Fei Hou in an urgent voice: “Senior, please save us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Hou frowned. He was disinclined to involve himself in this kind of matter, but now it seemed like he won’t be able to avoid it, both of them stood up and still, Fei Hou did not move, waiting for Huang Xiaolong’s decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pair of youngsters arrived beside the bonfire, panting heavily. Their expression filled with dread as they looked back at the group of people pursuing them.</span></p>
