 <p><b>Chapter 321: Battling Zhao Chen Again</b></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong listened silently to Snow Dragon City’s Li Qiuping and the others’ sardonic comments in the distance with stoic manner…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whereas Zhao Chen’s expression grew grim as he watched Huang Xiaolong, he didn’t miss the remarks coming from Li Qiuping’s side. He knew better than anyone here Huang Xiaolong’s strength. He let Huang Xiaolong escape last time, so no matter what, he absolutely mustn’t allow Huang Xiaolong to escape a second time, otherwise, in front of Li Qiuping and the other geniuses, all his face would be lost clean!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chen’s momentum increased as he narrowed the distance, a heavy pressure enveloped Huang Xiaolong. Li Qiuping, Wang Lin, and Guo Dehui, who were bantering amongst themselves, noticed there was something odd with the atmosphere, their casual remarks trailed off, exchanging a look amongst themselves. Each saw their own puzzlement reflected back from others’ expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Obviously, none of them understood why Zhao Chen acted as if he was facing a great enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t he just a little peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order kid?” Li Qiuping shook his head secretly, “Does he need to look so serious?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when Li Qiuping and the others thought that Zhao Chen was exaggerating, blue flames rose from Zhao Chen’s body, dancing wildly as an enormous two-headed blue bird materialized above his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This two-headed blue bird was Zhao Chen’s top grade twelve martial spirit, Two-headed Blue Flame Bird.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Zhao Chen actually summoned his martial spirit to deal with a peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order, Li Qiuping, Wang Lin, Guo Dehui, and the rest on the square were greatly astonished. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it did not end there. In the next moment, the blue flames shrouding Zhao Chen flashed brightly and layers of blue-colored plumage covered his body like an armor. On the sides of his arms, steel-like blue spike feathers stood on ends.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only did Zhao Chen summon his martial spirit, he even soul transformed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Qiuping, Wang Lin, and Guo Dehui’s eyes protruded in shock. Zhao Chen dealing with the kid personally was shocking enough for them, but now, even before Zhao Chen made the first move, he summoned his martial spirit and soul transformed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Saint realm expert killing a Xiantian warrior was a mere pinky raising effort, when did it come up to having to soul transform?</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the Snow Dragon City, Saber Imperial City, and Green Ghost City disciples were still in shock with Zhao Chen’s actions, another burst of blinding light shone from Zhao Chen’s body as a large blue abyssal-like cave appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Saint realm space!” Nearly everyone blurted out, flabbergasted. The look in their eyes shifted from inexplicable to disbelief. Zhao Chen even resorted to the Saint realm space! If only they knew that Huang Xiaolong managed to flee from Zhao Chen’s hand last time even after he called out his Saint realm space, what would they think?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even so, none of them could figure out or understand why Zhao Chen was behaving so excessively to the point of calling out the Saint realm space. All of them shifted their curious eyes to Huang Xiaolong, yet they could not see what was so special about this peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order lanky young man that would push Zhao Chen to this extent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at this time that Zhao Chen launched this attack. Bellowing, his palm pushed the blue flame space and it shot up to the sky, emanating scorching heat waves that engulfed Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huang Xiaolong, your death is here!” Killing intent exploded in Zhao Chen’s eyes. This time, he wanted to take Huang Xiaolong’s life in a single attackㅡto wash his shame!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like the previous time, before the scorching heatwave neared him, Huang Xiaolong already felt as if he was about to be burned into nothingness, however, this time, Huang Xiaolong did not dodge. The desire to battle danced brightly in his dark pupils like flames, he transformed into Asura Physique, the Wings of Demon extended out sharply. Without summoning his martial spirit nor soul transforming, both of Huang Xiaolong’s palms struck forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earthen Buddha Palm!</span></p>
 <p><span style>One after another, Buddha statues emerged from the ground, flying skyward in dazzling Buddha luminescence. These Buddha statues were different from the past, every Buddha statue was shrouded in powerful flames that seemed to overpower the blue flames from Zhao Chen’s Saint realm space. Shattering Zhao Chen’s scorching heat waves, the Buddha statues surged forward towards Zhao Chen’s blue flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The flames shrouding the Buddha statues were Huang Xiaolong’s true essence fire! Huang Xiaolong fused his true essence fire into the Earthen Buddha Palm, adding a cloak of flames around the statues, as if they were avatars of the Fire Buddha.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Boom!</span></i><span style> Huang Xiaolong’s Earthen Buddha Palm collided with Zhao Chen’s blue flames from his Saint realm space. The air shook with a volley of blasts and even the square floor shook violently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Steward Feng and the other subordinates that encircled Huang Xiaolong were thrown back from the shockwave, even giant ghost Feng Yang was forced to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Qiuping, Wang Lin, and the rest felt the glaring collision, and in the next second, they watched Huang Xiaolong attack with the Earthen Buddha Palm, the many fire Buddha statues breaking through the sea of blue flames and colliding with Zhao Chen’s Saint realm space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chen felt as if a heavy mountain crashed against his Saint realm space, causing it to shake intensely. The blue flames scattered as Zhao Chen was forcefully pushed back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scorching heat waves spread out, lingering in the air for a long time. A deathly silence descended on the square.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Qiuping, Wang Lin, and Guo Dehui’s eyes nearly popped out of their sockets as they stared at Zhao ChenㅡZhao Chen was actually pushed back!</span></p>
 <p><span style>ImㅡImpossible! A Xiantian actually forced a Saint realm expert back!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Saint realm expert that resorted to using his Saint realm space actually failed to kill a mere Xiantian!! Bearing witness to such mystifying sequence, none present were able to react promptly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite repelling Zhao Chen successfully, Huang Xiaolong too staggered back from the impact. From the surface it may seem that both fought equally, neither gaining an advantage over the other, but all of them were aware deep down, who was stronger and who was weaker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only did Zhao Chen soul transformed, he even used the Saint realm warriors’ trump card, the Saint realm space, whereby Huang Xiaolong did not soul transform.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Qiuping, Wang Lin, and the rest retrieved their gazes from Zhao Chen, looking at Huang Xiaolong instead. Each of them secretly drew in a sharp intake of breath; what if Huang Xiaolong soul transformed, didn't that indirectly show that Huang Xiaolong was stronger than Zhao Chen?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Xiantian warrior was more powerful than a Saint realm expert?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was insanity! The world had gone mad!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A Xiantian was stronger than a Saint realm!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You, actually…!” Zhao Chen’s face warped with anger when he managed to steady himself. Mixed within his anger was an undeniable shock as he stared at Huang Xiaolong. In the exchange earlier, he found that Huang Xiaolong’s current strength had enhanced a great deal compared to that time in the City of Myriad Gods!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother with Li Qiuping and others’ expressions directed at him. He looked coldly at Zhao Chen, “Zhao Chen, in the City of Myriad Gods you claimed that you will enlighten me on the gap between a Xiantian and a Saint realm? Is this the gap you were referring to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Qiuping and the rest were once again shocked by the message that Huang Xiaolong revealed. From Huang Xiaolong’s words, it indicated that both he and Zhao Chen battled before in the City of Myriad Gods!</span></p>
 <p><span style>They wondered what the outcome of that battle was!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, they remembered a rumor that had been going around in recent days, many people had been saying that some reckless Saint realm expert offended Zhao Chen in the City of Myriad Gods some days ago, then Zhao Chen and that Saint realm expert battled it out in the city and that person was defeated by Zhao Chen and fled in embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it be…?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It must be! The person who fought with Zhao Chen in the City of Myriad Gods must be this black-haired young man, not some reckless Saint realm expert, but a peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But then again, Li Qiuping, Wang Lin, and Guo Dehui had no idea that at that time Huang Xiaolong was still a mid-Xiantian Tenth Order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chen detected the ridicule in Huang Xiaolong’s words, a red flush crept up from his neck to his face. Zhao Chen hollered in anger, his silhouette flickered into a blur, punching out at Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Star Burst Fist!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blue flames burst like a burning meteor, exploding in front of Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong snickered as he watched this, his palms smoothly struck forward, sending circles of golden rings expanding out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God Binding Palm!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before the astounded gazes of Li Qiuping and the rest of the people around, the exploding blue flames’ trajectory froze midair several zhang away from Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong seized the time gap, he leaped up and two majestic dragon roars rendered heaven and earth, as one black and one blue primordial divine dragons emerged, winding around Huang Xiaolong’s body.</span></p>
