 <p><b>Chapter 452: And If I Don’t?</b></p>
 <p><span>Hearing the ‘order’, Huang Xiaolong looked at beastman Anton with interest, “And if I don’t?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“You don’t want to?” Anton laughed, “Try it if you think your head is harder than this tree!” Anton’s arm shot out, punching the tree closest to them that had a trunk thicker than an adult’s thigh.</span></p>
 <p><span>In a split second, the tree trunk exploded and broke out in the middle as wood splinters flying everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span>Anton pulled his arm back in exceedingly arrogant demeanor, “How about that, is your head harder than this tree?” breaking into a bout of wicked laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span>Lofty laughter sounded from all around.</span></p>
 <p><span>Anton stopped laughing, his eyes glared menacingly at Huang Xiaolong, “Puny human, get off your ass immediately if you’re smart and get one roast going for every one of us, if not, hehe, my fist will greet your feeble skull, shattering it into smithereens!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong smiled shaking his head.</span></p>
 <p><span>Even the Stellar Thunder Canyon lightning felt like a relaxing massage on his body, but this beastman wanted to shatter his skull to smithereens?</span></p>
 <p><span>Now, if a Sixth Order Saint realm’s punch at full force landed on Huang Xiaolong’s body, he would feel nothing more than a ticklish scratch.</span></p>
 <p><span>Anton watched Huang Xiaolong continuing to sit there with no intention of getting up, moreover shaking his head with a mocking smile. Anger rapidly rose in his heart; a puny human actually dared to ignore him?!</span></p>
 <p><span>In great anger, Anton raised an arm, wanting to shatter this puny human’s head, but before he could do so, he saw the puny human lift a finger and lightly tapped in the air. The long stretch of big trees in front of them tumbled one by one as if endless, all the way further than their eyes could see.</span></p>
 <p><span>Anton’s mouth was agape, his fist froze in the air while the rest of his body stiffened on the spot, staring dumbly at the endless line of tumbled trees.</span></p>
 <p><span>His several hundred comrades’ laughter halted abruptly, stuck in their throats. The only noise around came from the crackle and sizzle of fire as oil dripped down from the fragrant roast meat.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong opened his mouth, tearing a generous bite of meat, “It does taste good.”</span></p>
 <p><span>His voice was like a string that pulled all the beastmen’s attention back. Gawking at Huang Xiaolong, their eyes now held trepidation, reverence, and a hint of worship.</span></p>
 <p><span>Compared to other races, beastmen had a fervid reverence toward strength and worshipped the strong.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong took another ravenous bite, he wasn’t sure why the practice in the Stellar Thunder Canyon made him crave roast meat as if he hadn’t eaten it for many years. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Is your head harder than these trees?” Huang Xiaolong asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>Anton’s face turned pasty, falling to his knees without a second thought, his forehead kissing the forest floor as he kowtowed repeatedly in front of Huang Xiaolong, “Honorable Lord, Anton was rude and has offended you just now, please have mercy on Anton this one time!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Anton’s comrades also knelt down, showing proper respect.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong took a quick glance at the surrounding beastmen, “Stand up.” If he was really angered earlier, none of these beastmen would have the chance to stand anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span>Anton beamed with joy, respectfully complying to Huang Xiaolong’s words, as did the other beastmen, retreating to stand at the side.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Who’s the head?” Huang Xiaolong asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>At Huang Xiaolong’s question, beastmen Amier walked out from the large herd of people, stopping not far from Huang Xiaolong and introducing himself, “Lord, my name is Amier, the tribe’s small captain.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Sit.” Huang Xiaolong pointed to a nearby spot.</span></p>
 <p><span>Amier was slightly overwhelmed by Huang Xiaolong’s attention. Flustered, he waved and shook his head, “No no no, Lord, standing is fine for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“If I say sit, then sit.” Huang Xiaolong stated.</span></p>
 <p><span>At Huang Xiaolong’s domineering attitude, Amier said his thanks and sat down as if there were needles pricking his butt.</span></p>
 <p><span>“No need to be so nervous, I just have some questions.” Huang Xiaolong said.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Yes, Lord.” Even so, Amier couldn’t stop his body's minute trembling.</span></p>
 <p><span>Beastmen were innately born with burly physiques, the shorter beastmen still exceed two meters tall, whereas the taller ones reached two and a half meters.</span></p>
 <p><span>Solely based on physical advantage, humans indeed looks weak and puny next to beastmen. Moreover, the overall human race’s strength on the Ten Directions Continent was negligible, thus one could hardly blame the beastmen for looking down on the human race.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, Huang Xiaolong could tell, this herd of beastmen was among the lower rung in beastmen hierarchy.</span></p>
 <p><span>Beastmen were made up of many tribes, and the more powerful amongst them were the Lion Tribe, Tiger Tribe, Wolf Tribe, Snake Tribe, Fox Tribe, Behemoth Tribe, then it was the Cattle Tribe, Violent Horse Tribe, Goat Tribe, and the Hundred Bird Tribe.</span></p>
 <p><span>These were the ten most powerful beast tribes.</span></p>
 <p><span>This group of beastmen in front of him was not from any of those ten beastmen tribes.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The Hundred Tiger City is a little further up?” Huang Xiaolong spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span>“That’s right, Lord, less than a hundred li after crossing the Roaming Souls Grove is the Hundred Tiger City.” Amier respectfully replied. </span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong asked the next question, “Does the Hundred Tiger City belong to the Tiger Tribe?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Amier answered ‘yes’, the Hundred Tiger City belonged to the Tiger Tribe. The Tiger Tribe had twenty-five cities under their control and this Hundred Tiger City was only one of them. However, the Hundred Tiger City was a strategically important city.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Tiger Tribe was amongst the ten strongest beastmen tribes, their forces couldn’t be underestimated, this point was clear from the twenty-five cities under their control.</span></p>
 <p><span>Then, Huang Xiaolong asked about the Hundred Tiger City’s Castellan and general questions about the Tiger Tribe. In the end, Amier was merely a captain of a lower rank in a small tribe, the things he knew were very limited.</span></p>
 <p><span>Talking about the Hundred Tiger City’s Castellan, Amier’s face shone with idolization, “Our Hundred Tiger City Castellan is Lord Goodman, one of the top ten experts of the Tiger Tribe! I heard from our Family Head that Lord Goodman can flatten a mountain with a single punch!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span>Flatten a mountain with a single punch.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong chuckled in secret, anyone could do this effortlessly once they stepped into the Saint realm. Additionally, beastmen were known for their herculean strength, thus such a feat was not strange at all.</span></p>
 <p><span>After asking everything he wanted to know, Huang Xiaolong fell into deep contemplation.</span></p>
 <p><span>From Amier’s answers, although the beastmen tribes were powerful on the Ten Directions Continent, there were numerous internal struggles. For instance, the Lion Tribe and Tiger Tribe were always at war.</span></p>
 <p><span>At the same time, from Amier’s words, he once again confirmed that the Beast God was all the beastmen tribes’ sacred faith. Within the beastmen race, whoever dared to desecrate the Beast God, disrespect the Beast God, would be treated as the entire beastmen race’s sinner!</span></p>
 <p><span>The legendary Beast God Scepter represented the Beast God.</span></p>
 <p><span>For the last ten thousand years, the beastmen tribes believed that whoever got the Beast God Scepter would be the Beast God’s reincarnation, that person would once again lead the beastmen to conquer the Ten Direction Continent, capturing the glory of the past.</span></p>
 <p><span>In that short time, Huang Xiaolong reached a decision.</span></p>
 <p><span>Since the Beast God Scepter was said to hold such power, passing by the Hundred Tiger City, he wanted to see if the Beast God Scepter really was as honored by the beastmen as they claimed.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Lord,” Seeing Huang Xiaolong become silent in contemplation, Amier called cautiously, “Are you going to the Hundred Tiger City? Coincidentally, all of us here are from the Hundred Tiger City, could we travel with Lord?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Inside the Roaming Souls Grove, there was a kind of strange soul beings that had a tendency to devour their prey’s blood and flesh while alive. If they could travel along with an expert like Huang Xiaolong, their chances of getting out of the Roaming Souls Grove would increase greatly.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong knew what Amier was thinking about in a glance, but he still nodded in agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span>Seeing Huang Xiaolong agree to have the band travel with him nearly made him jump with joy. He, Anton, and the rest quickly saluted in thanks.</span></p>
 <p><span>The night passed peacefully. At daybreak, glorious sunlight began to light up the land.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, the Roaming Souls Grove remained cold and dark.</span></p>
 <p><span>The radiant sun couldn’t penetrate into this gloomy and dark piece of land.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong stood up, saying: “Let’s move!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Yes, Lord!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong walked at the front of the group as they entered deeper into the Roaming Souls Grove. In truth, the grove was not big, at most half a day was enough for the group to cut through.</span></p>
