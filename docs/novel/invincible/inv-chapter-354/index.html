 <p><b>Chapter 354: Heavenly Treasure Resurface In the World</b></p>
 <p><span style>Li Molin retrieved her gaze from Yao Fei’s body, her cold eyes turning to Huang Xiaolong, spitting each word clearly, “Huang, Xiao, Long!!” Monstrous killing intent soared to the sky, a terrifying energy wave whirled around Li Molin, forming a violent tempest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Out of nowhere, nine gigantic tails fanned out behind Li Molin, waving gently in the air. In the next moment, they spun sharply toward Huang Xiaolong, aiming to kill. But before Li Molin’s nine gigantic tails could reach Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu appeared between them in a flicker, his powerful fist punching at Li Molin’s nine tails. A fierce storm of fist imprints successfully blocked her attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get lost!” A chilling light glinted from Li Molin’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Shu issued a disdainful sneer, “Smelly b*tch, the one that should get lost is you.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Smelly b*tch?!</span></i><span style> Li Molin’s actions lagged for a moment, then she went berserk! Zhao Shu actually called her smelly b*itch just now?! <em>Smelly b*tch!!</em></span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Molin was enraged. An enormous nine-tailed fox appeared above her head and she soul transformed in an instant. Nine different colored dots emerged at the tip of her eyebrows, matching her colorful nine tails, both of her hands transformed into fox claws.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Die—!!”</span></i><span style> Li Molin’s claw slammed down on Zhao Shu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Shu scoffed. Summoning his martial spirit, he soul transformed and dove into battle against Li Molin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Molin was a powerful character. With her arrival, and joining the battle against Zhao Shu, it greatly alleviated the immense pressure on Yao Shan and the three Deities Templar Elders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Ren’s opponent was Yao Shan, while Huang Xiaolong, giant ghost Feng Yang, and the other two Duanren Institute Honorable Saint Masters fought with the three Deities Templar Elders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The weakest among the three Deities Templar Elder was a Second Order Saint realm, which was Huang Xiaolong and Feng Yang’s target.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At one point, that Elder sent Feng Yang staggering back with a powerful punch, then immediately turned his attention to Huang Xiaolong. Looking at Huang Xiaolong, he spoke coldly, “Huang Xiaolong, you indeed surprised me, to be able to kill a Saint realm warrior while being a measly Xiantian!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong showed no expression at the compliment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Watching Huang Xiaolong’s indifferent expression, not putting him in his eyes, anger rose from his heart, “Huang Xiaolong, I refuse to believe that a small Xiantian like you is my, a Second Order Saint realm expert’s opponent!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Huang Xiaolong had killed Yao Fei in front of them, he did not display his Saint realm power in public, therefore this Deities Templar Elder and the crowd still assumed that Huang Xiaolong was just a Xiantian realm warrior. Regardless, no one would believe that Huang Xiaolong, who was still a peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order warrior half a year ago, could break through to Saint realm just half a year later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” Huang Xiaolong shrugged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come and die!” The Deities Templar Elder hollered, aiming a killer punch at Huang Xiaolong. He closed the distance between them in a blink.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this precise moment, Huang Xiaolong acted, but he did not dodge. His momentum broke out like a wild horse, sweeping out in four directions, no longer concealed. The sudden outbreak of scary momentum attracted the attention of the people around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even that Deities Templar Elder looked dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Saint, Saint realm!” He gawked at Huang Xiaolong, his lips opened and closed but no more words came.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Saint realm!” The surrounding experts exclaimed as if a dynamite fell in their midst. Shock, incredulity, and disbelief took over the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Ren, who was battling Yao Shan, also looked over, the shock on his face the same as others; Huang Xiaolong actually broke into the Saint realm! He was with Huang Xiaolong the entire journey from Duanren Empire, but he was in the dark about Huang Xiaolong’s current strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This revelation was definitely a shocker for the Yao Family’s Ancestor, Yao Shan. This... was he still human?! Half a year ago still a peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order, and then six months later, Saint Realm?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not even Li Molin could disguise the shock in her eyes, but she recovered quickly, hardening her determination to exterminate Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before the eyes that were looking at him with shock, surprise, and disbelief, Huang Xiaolong attacked. His fist flew toward the Deities Templar Elder. Jolted by the sudden sense of danger, the Elder reacted by reflex, lifting his arm to block.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang! </span></i><span style>A loud collision resounded, that Elder felt his arm giving out for a split second and he was forced back several steps. When he managed to steady himself, there was an ugly look on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You!” Just as he wanted to speak, the figure in front of him shifted. Huang Xiaolong followed with another attack, golden fist imprints bloomed in the air, some intangible, some solid, profound and mysterious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is… Great Void Divine Fist?!” Though shocked, the Elder countered with a fist as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Void Divine Fist!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Great Void Divine World’s Great Void Divine Fist? Huang Xiaolong actually knows this battle skill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another commotion swept through the crowd. With the news of the Ancient Dragon Clan ruin in the Origin Forest, experts from different parts of the three continents had rushed over, including some Saint realm experts among them, thus it wasn’t strange for some to have heard of the Great Void Divine Fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the Great Void Divine Fist punched out, Huang Xiaolong’s fist stretched out in a palm, launching another attack. A palm imprint whistled through space and golden rings extended out in layers, emitting a mysterious power. The experts watching in the distance sensed the changes in the air, as if the surrounding space became stagnant. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What technique is this?!” A Saint realm expert from Ten Directions Continent exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It… it looks like the God Binding Palm?” Another person spoke yet dared not be sure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“God Binding Palm?” Some were baffled, obviously many haven't heard of this God Binding Palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The God Binding Palm is the Heavenly Treasure God Binding Ring’s heritage skill!” The earlier warrior explained. At the mention of the God Binding Ring, he couldn’t contain the lilt of excitement in his voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“God Binding Ring? The same God Binding Ring on the Heavenly Treasure List, ranked sixth?!” Someone suddenly blurted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right, it’s the sixth ranked Heavenly Treasure, God Binding Ring!” The voice rang clearly, spreading far.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Each Heavenly Treasure possessed incredible power, especially the top ten Heavenly Treasures that contained mysterious earth-shattering power. Now, Huang Xiaolong displayed the heritage skill God Binding Palm from the Heavenly Treasure God Binding Ring, how could the crowd control their excitement and awe!</span></p>
 <p><span style>From Li Molin’s expression, it was clear that she was also astounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, Huang Xiaolong pointed a finger and gray fog appeared out of nowhere, shrill shrieks of unknown creatures rang out as a finger imprint broke through space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Absolute Soul Finger!!” Another person blurted out, petrified.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Absolute Soul Finger? Ranked fourth on the Heavenly Treasure List, Absolute Soul Pearl’s heritage skill?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, the Absolute Soul Pearl!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another great shock rippled through the crowd. Most people stared aghast at Huang Xiaolong, the legendary Heavenly Treasures actually resurfaced! Heavenly Treasures ranked within the top ten, and not just one, but two! Moreover, both of them appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s body!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Deities Templar Elder was struck by Huang Xiaolong’s Absolute Soul Finger, having a hole pierced in his chest. It was said that the Absolute Soul Finger could even penetrate through hell itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Listening to the exaggerated exclamations around him, that Deities Templar Elder was confounded, temporarily forgetting the sharp pain in his chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giant ghost Feng Yang seized the opportunity to close in on the Elder. Ghost aura broke out rumbling from his body and the three-pronged blood spear appeared, glowing red in his hand, flying toward the Elder at breaking wind speed. Catching the sound of breaking wind, the Deities Templar Elder awakened from his shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Retreat!” Li Molin’s voice rang in the high air. At the same time, countless green rays of light were seen aiming at Huang Xiaolong, Duan Ren, and the others, forcing them to dodge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Molin’s silhouette disappeared in the blink of an eye, followed by Yao Shan and the three Elders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong did not expect Li Molin and the Deities Templar group to successfully break away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to chase.” When Zhao Shu made a move to pursue, Huang Xiaolong stopped him. Looking around at the disturbed crowd, he said, “Let’s leave this place first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Shu and the rest nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without another word, Huang Xiaolong’s group flew away, disappearing from the crowd’s sight in a less than a second. Of course, Huang Xiaolong did not forget to take Yao Fei’s spatial ring before leaving.</span></p>
