 <p><b>Chapter 468: Huang Xiaolong Is the Beast God</b></p>
 <p><span>A strong bloodthirst gushed out from a crimson blood dragon, shooting straight at Li Molin.</span></p>
 <p><span>Flustered and alarmed, Li Molin waved the longsword in her hand and multiple sword rays flew out, forming a great protective barrier. A thunderous bang rang in the air, ripples of shockwaves warped space as the large blood dragon rammed against the protective barrier.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Today, you must die!” Huang Xiaolong’s frigid voice was bone-chilling.</span></p>
 <p><span>Even if Li Lu was here today, Huang Xiaolong was resolved to reap Li Molin’s life on the spot! Not only Li Molin, he was determined to slaughter all Deities Templar’s people!</span></p>
 <p><i><span>All of them must die!</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Half an hour passed. Inside the Devils and Ghosts Flag, a sole Li Molin remained, shrouded in thick death aura.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Huang Xiaolong, I’ll not spare you even if I turn into a ghost!” knowing that her life would end here, Li Molin screamed, her face distorting with resentment, “Also, our Temple Preceptor has taken a liking to Li Lu a long time ago, Li Lu and our Temple Preceptor find each other congenial, you will never have any chance with Li Lu, not ever!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Li Lu will kill you to avenge me! She’ll slaughter your entire family!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Annihilate all your Asura’s Gate disciples!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Everything you have!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Molin shouted in a deranged manner, her eyes shining with a manic light.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Tiger Tribe Patriarch Chuck landed a palm strike on Li Molin’s back at this point. Li Molin stumbled forward, right into the swarm of Poison Corpse Scarabs. Excited, the Poison Corpse Scarabs rushed up, some about to start from Li Molin’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>However Huang Xiaolong did not allow the Poison Corpse Scarabs to touch Li Molin, instead, he retrieved them and the Devils and Ghosts Flag. As he approached Li Molin, the Blades of Asura appeared in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Huang Xiaolong, you...!” Barely a few words in, the Blades of Asura in Huang Xiaolong’s hands swung down, and Li Molin’s head flew to the sky. Her voice abruptly cut off.</span></p>
 <p><span>Blood rained down where Li Molin was.</span></p>
 <p><span>Looking at Li Molin’s corpse with a cold expression, he transferred the headless body into the Linglong Treasure Pagoda as food for the Poison Corpse Scarabs.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Liege Lord Beast God is mighty!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The beastmen experts’ voices thundered in the square.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong collected all the &nbsp;Deities Templar experts’ spatial rings into his Asura Ring. Looking at the beastmen experts around, his raised an arm to calm the excited crowd as his powerful voice resonated, “Begin the Beast God Sacrificial Rite!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Another sonorous reply came from the beastmen experts, complying with Huang Xiaolong’s command and collecting Li Molin and other Deities Templar experts’ heads. More than sixty human heads were placed on the sacrificial altar.</span></p>
 <p><span>When Huang Xiaolong ordered the Poison Corpse Scarabs to kill Liu Yang and the Deities Templar experts, he made them leave the heads intact.</span></p>
 <p><span>When all the heads were lined on the sacrificial altar, Huang Xiaolong proceeded step by step according to the beastmen sacrificial rite, lasting over an hour before the ceremony was done.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Salute the Liege Lord Beast God!” Tiger Tribe Patriarch Chuck took lead. The Beast God Sacrificial Rite was completed, therefore Huang Xiaolong was, beyond any doubt, the new beastmen tribes’ Beast God.</span></p>
 <p><span>In a blink, the mass of beastmen experts fell to their knees in worship, each of them showing reverence, worship, and great ardor.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong briefly scanned over the mass of prostrating silhouettes before telling them to rise. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Bring forth Andrew!” Huang Xiaolong ordered.</span></p>
 <p><span>Although Huang Xiaolong pierced the Beast God Scepter through Andrew’s forehead, shattering a large hole in his skull, Andrew was still alive.</span></p>
 <p><span>Two Lion Tribe Elders half carried half dragged Andrew before Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span>Everyone watched quietly, waiting for Huang Xiaolong to speak. “Andrew conspired with Deities Templar, luring the beastmen tribes to submit under another, according to the beastmen tribes’ law, what is the penalty for this?!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Death by a thousand swords piercing the heart!” Tiger Tribe Patriarch Chuck stepped forward in reply.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong nodded, battle qi gathered around his palm, forming into sharp swords. With a flick, the sword energy pierced into Andrew’s heart. Andrew let out a hoarse, blood-curdling scream as the sword energy pierced through his chest, coming out from his back.</span></p>
 <p><span>Just like this, the sword energy repeatedly pierced through Andrew’s heart ten thousand times before stopping.</span></p>
 <p><span>The heart was the body’s most essential organ, regardless if one was a Saint realm expert or a God Realm master, the heart was still considered a weakness. Ten thousand times pierced by a sword, one could hardly imagine the torment.</span></p>
 <p><span>After the punishment was dealt with, Huang Xiaolong took out the Devils and Ghosts Flag, allowing it to swallow Andrew’s soul.</span></p>
 <p><span>The beastmen experts felt a chill in their hearts witnessing the cruel punishment that Andrew subjected to, and in the end, not even his soul was spared, being swallowed into a wicked flag.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feeling worse than anyone present was the Snake Tribe’s Patriarch, Danny.</span></p>
 <p><span>A few days earlier, he actually said that that he would ‘play’ Huang Xiaolong to death! Even declaring out in the open that he would let Huang Xiaolong taste the pleasure of being bitten by ten thousand snakes.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Danny!” Huang Xiaolong’s voice boomed like a thunderclap in Danny’s brain.</span></p>
 <p><span>A violent shiver ran down Danny’s back as he walked forward a few steps before kneeling on his knees, “Liege Lord Beast God, have mercy ah! This small one wasn’t aware of Liege Lord’s identity, please spare my life!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Don’t worry, I won’t kill you.” Huang Xiaolong drawled, not &nbsp;showing any emotion on his face, “Upon returning to the Snake Tribe, enter the Thousand Snake Cave. Come out after you’ve been bitten ten thousand times!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The words Danny spurted after leaving that night, Huang Xiaolong heard every word clearly with his spiritual sense.</span></p>
 <p><span>Danny turned deathly pale, yet he dared not raise the slightest objection, kowtowing in gratitude toward Huang Xiaolong for sparing his life.</span></p>
 <p><span>Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong held a small discussion on the spot, re-establishing certain rules as well as assigning some tasks to the many beastmen Patriarchs.</span></p>
 <p><span>Several hours later, Huang Xiaolong excused all the tribes back to their territories. One of the tasks Huang Xiaolong gave them was to spread the word of what took place in the beastmen tribes congregation to the outside.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong would hang Li Molin and all the Deities Templar experts’ heads upon the Sacred Tiger City’s gates. He was curious to see if the Deities Templar would be sending people to come collect their heads.</span></p>
 <p><span>If they dared not, then Deities Templar would be reduced to nothing but Martial Spirit World’s biggest laughing stock!</span></p>
 <p><span>If Deities Templar really sent someone over to collect those heads… Huang Xiaolong sneered, he would make sure that the heads of the people that came would decorate the Sacred Tiger City walls together.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong returned to the Sacred Tiger City with the group of Tiger Tribe experts, bringing the heads with him. As for the rumored Beast God heritage within the Beast God Shrine, Huang Xiaolong planned to return after refining the primordial divine dragons with the Dragon God Grass he had.</span></p>
 <p><span>After all, he was now the Beast God that united the beastmen tribes and could enter the Beast God Shrine any time.</span></p>
 <p><span>While Huang Xiaolong and the Tiger Tribe experts were back in the Sacred Tiger City, hanging the heads along the city walls, the whole Martial Spirit World was driven into a furore!</span></p>
 <p><span>“What?! The Beast God Scepter has resurfaced! Huang Xiaolong has the Beast God Scepter and became the beastmen tribes’ Beast God!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Huang Xiaolong is reigning over the beastmen tribes!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Deities Templar’s Li Molin and more than sixty experts were all killed by Huang Xiaolong! Their heads are hanging on top of the Sacred Tiger City walls at this very moment!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Akin to an enormous meteor crashing into its soil, the whole Martial Spirit World was shaken, forces big and small found it hard to believe it, they were shocked and dumbfounded by the news!</span></p>
 <p><span>Trepidation gradually spread among the experts and disciples of Cosmos God Cult, every family and forces that was at odds with Huang Xiaolong fell into a foreboding doom.</span></p>
 <p><span>When Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the Asura’s Gate experts and disciples heard the news, excited cheers sounded in every corner of the Asura’s Gate, brimming with anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span>On the Snow Wind Continent, within the palace walls of the Blessed Buddha Empire, Shi Fantian’s hearty laughter echoed through the corridors hearing the news. “I didn’t expect, ah, that Junior Brother got the Beast God Scepter! Uniting the beastmen tribes! The next time I see Junior Brother, it seems I also need to greet him respectfully as Lord Beast God!”</span></p>
 <p><span>How powerful the united beastmen tribes were, anyone could imagine it even using their toes. Without a doubt, in the Martial Spirit World, they were the strongest force! In front of the united beastmen tribes, the Cosmos God Cult was nothing but a smelly fart!</span></p>
 <p><span>Shi Xiaofei was cultivating in her yard when her maid Xiaorou ran in flushed with giddy excitement. Baffled why Xiaorou was acting this way, before Shi Xiaofei could ask, Xiaorou blurted out, “Princess, Young Noble Huang, he, he’s now the beastmen tribes’ Beast God!”</span></p>
