 <p></p>
 <p><strong><u>Chapter 128: Meeting Jiang Teng Again</u></strong></p>
 <p><span style>A while later, Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu arrived in the Holy Hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like in previous years, after both of them arrived, one of them would speak words of encouragement and explain the rules of the competition before declaring the start of the competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And the two candidates that Chen Feirong recommended for Second Year Class Six were still Huang Xiaolong and Lu Kai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During last year’s annual competition, Lu Kai was a peak late-Seventh Order warrior, and this year this little rascal finally managed to break through to the Eighth Order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Standing on the stage, Lu Kai called out his Sky Peng martial spirit and soul transformed in the blink of an eye. Without saying a word, an attack of Colossal Decimate Fist struck out at full force towards Huang Xiaolong. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Lu Kai knew he would lose, as the Prince of Luo Tong Kingdom, Lu Kai still needed to challenge and battle with Huang Xiaolong despite knowing how much stronger Huang Xiaolong was. Otherwise, it would create an adverse effect on the kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Watching Lu Kai’s Colossal Decimate Fist coming at him after soul transforming, Huang Xiaolong stood quietly on the stage without moving. Before everyone’s dumbstruck eyes, Lu Kai’s fist landed on Huang Xiaolong squarely in the chest.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Whoom! </span></i><span style>A loud muffled blast resounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Kai and the crowd were shocked and bewildered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While everyone around was still in confusion about why Huang Xiaolong neither dodged nor attacked, Lu Kai was shocked to discover his fist felt like it hit against a solid iron wall when it landed on Huang Xiaolong’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong stood there, immovable like a mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This!” Lu Kai’s eyes widened with shock and amazement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, a terrifying energy gushed out from Huang Xiaolong’s body, and with a shake of his right shoulder, Lu Kai was knocked back, stumbling all the way until he fell off the stage powerlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mouths were agape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Lu Kai felt stupefied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had already stepped into the Eighth Order, and in addition to his soul transformed physique, he was using an Earth rank battle skill, even an average peak late-Eighth Order wouldn’t dare to take his fist attack head on like Huang Xiaolong just did!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only did Huang Xiaolong take his Colossal Decimate Fist at full force without soul transforming, he even successfully repelled him off the stage with a </span><i><span style>shake of his shoulder?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style> Lu Kai shook his head: “This freak, has he broken through to the Ninth Order?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Maybe he really has stepped into the Ninth Order!</span></i><span style> Lu Kai thought as his eyes widened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Having the same thought as Lu Kai, everyone who was watching was sure Huang Xiaolong had advanced in his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Up on the main platform, watching this result, Sun Zhang chuckled: “This little guy already broke into the Ninth Order? He was faster than what we estimated by half a year!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes ah, there’s still a month away before this little guy reaches sixteen.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiong Chu looked enviously at Huang Xiaolong’s silhouette on the battle stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A sixteen-year-old Ninth Order warrior!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was an unprecedented event in the entire Duanren Empire’s history!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Freak or monster was a lackluster definition to describe Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Super freak, super monster!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After defeating Lu Kai, Huang Xiaolong became the Class Six winner as expected and the event moved on to the Second Year competition. Again, Huang Xiaolong defeated his opponents from the other classes effortlessly, taking the championship for the Second Year. However, Huang Xiaolong’s final opponent last year, one of the three big beauties of Cosmic Star Academy, Chen Caixiu, had advanced to the Ninth Order and had passed the assessment test to advance to the Third Year class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few hours later, the year’s Academy competition ended smoothly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the tradition goes, other than the usual competition rewards, Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu each gifted a high Grade Five Spirit Dan to Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The main reason Huang Xiaolong participated in the Academy’s competition was not for cultivating in the Dragon Flame Valley, but for these Grade Five Spirit Dans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These three spirit dans were given to his parents and siblings every year.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Huang Xiaolong’s Nine Tripod Commerce earns more than several thousands gold coins every year, high Grade Five Spirit Dans were not something that could be bought with sacks of gold coins.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu were giving him the two high Grade Five Spirit Dans, Huang Xiaolong inquired about the class advancement assessment test for the Third Year.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Zhang laughed and said: “You have broken through to the Ninth Order, and the level of your strength has surpassed most of the Third Year students. Still, to advance to the Third Year class you must go through the Academy’s test. This rule, even the two of us must adhere to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiong Chu added: “The year has ended, so if you want to apply for the assessment test it can only be carried out next year. When the new term starts, come to us and we will arrange it for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong nodded: “Okay then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu both believed he had just broken through to the Ninth Order, Huang Xiaolong did not correct them by saying that he had in fact stepped into the Tenth Order, for it is too frightening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During last year’s competition when he defeated Chen Caixiu, he was only an Eighth Order. If people knew he already broken through to the Tenth Order in no more than one year’s time, perhaps the million li away Duanren Empire would be alerted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then again, when Huang Xiaolong revealed his grade twelve superb talent martial spirits, the Primordial Divine Black Dragon, the Duanren Empire should’ve been made aware of this. The progress of a young and talented youth such as Huang Xiaolong is usually given top priority.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the Duanren Empire wouldn’t deliberately protect or cultivate people like Huang Xiaolong unless they participated in the Battle of the Imperial City and successfully entered the top one hundred places, qualifying to enroll into Duanren Institute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong returned to Tianxuan Mansion with his younger sister and brother, Huang Min and Huang Xiaohai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His sister, Huang Min, indeed won the class competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back in Tianxuan Mansion, Huang Xiaolong entered the ancient battlefield to practice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, another month passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In another two days, it will be New Year.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire Tianxuan Mansion was decorated vibrantly, immersed in a cheerful, festive atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like every New Year, Huang Xiaolong would stop practicing to accompany his parents and younger siblings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had already been sixteen years since he was reborn in this world, but most of his time was spent on practicing and cultivation and the time he had to talk with his family was very little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pity that Li Lu is not here.” In the main hall, everyone was happily chatting when Su Yan suddenly remarked: “This New Year could have been even better and livelier.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Min also agreed: “Right ah, if Sister Li Lu was here, how wonderful it would be!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The atmosphere in the main hall took a sudden drop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong stood up and left the main hall. Coming to the streets, he strolled without a specific destination in mind, just wanting to take a breath of fresh air. The weather was cold, yet there were many people on the streets, and it was bustling and lively. There were noises everywhere of common folk buying things for the upcoming New Year celebration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong observed these common folk preparing to welcome the New Year in a jovial mood and in turn, it made his mood better. The truth was, a person doesn’t seek much-- as long as they could stay together with their family and be happy, this was also a blessing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After taking a stroll around the city, Huang Xiaolong went back to Tianxuan Mansion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Night descended and Tianxuan Mansion lit up brightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead of practicing, Huang Xiaolong provided constructive advice to Huang Min and Huang Xiaohai on the problems they encountered in cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Very quickly, the New Year passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Cosmic Star Academy academic year had started.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong headed towards the Cosmic Star Academy and immediately went straight in the direction of the Principal’s office. What Huang Xiaolong did not expect was that Jiang Teng was inside the room when he walked in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few years had passed and Jiang Teng had grown into a young man over five feet tall. With Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu’s attentive nurturing, Jiang Teng who possessed the superb talent martial spirit, Sacred Bright Tiger, had advanced to late-Seventh Order. The gap between him and Huang Xiaolong was like heaven and earth. Huang Xiaolong had turned into an existence he could only admire from afar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Obviously, Jiang Teng also did not think he would run into Huang Xiaolong at this time and place because he had actively avoided Huang Xiaolong. Thus, it had been two to three years since they last met face to face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Se, Senior Brother Huang!’ Seeing Huang Xiaolong walk in, Jiang Teng practically jumped out from his seat, stammering out a greeting.</span></p>
