 <p><strong><u><b>Chapter 161: No Escape for Huang Xiaolong</b></u></strong></p>
 <p>“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong’s admission was aloof.</p>
 <p>Sun Qing shuddered hearing this. In front of the guards and Steward Liu Wen, Sun Qing suddenly fell to his knees, “This little one deserves death! It was due to a moment of confusion, and I did not realize it was Young Master Huang! I should die! I should die!” He was beginning to speak incoherently, unable to string a proper sentence.</p>
 <p>As he carried on, Sun Qing slapped the left side of his own face fiercely.</p>
 <p>Moments later, blood was trickling down from the corner of his mouth.</p>
 <p>The Castellan Manor guards were stupefied watching what was happening with Castellan Sun Qing.</p>
 <p><em><i>Young Master Huang?!</i></em></p>
 <p>All the guards and Steward Liu Wen looked at Huang Xiaolong.</p>
 <p>However, not one of them could recognize who Huang Xiaolong was. Even so, the reaction of their Castellan explained enough to tell them that they were in big trouble!</p>
 <p>Liu Wen and the rest of the guards swiftly knelt down like Sun Qing, not daring to even breathe loudly.</p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong looked at Sun Qing kneeling on the floor and said, “You’re not in the wrong, stand up.”</p>
 <p>Only then did Sun Qing stop punishing himself, thanking Huang Xiaolong profusely before getting up.</p>
 <p>“All of you go back now, I’m just passing through this place and don’t want to attract attention.” Huang Xiaolong spoke.</p>
 <p>“Yes, yes, Young Master Huang!” Sun Qing nodded his head vigorously, then saluted towards Huang Xiaolong, and hurried out. All the Castellan Manor guards swiftly followed behind him with unease on their faces.</p>
 <p>The night was calm again.</p>
 <p>Daybreak gradually brightened the sky, and Huang Xiaolong’s group of four exited Southern Cliffs City, crossed over the Luo Tong Kingdom’s border, and entered Baolong Kingdom.</p>
 <p>Stepping onto Baolong Kingdom’s soil, Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, Yu Ming, and Fei Hou wasted no time and headed directly to Big Sword Sect’s headquarters.</p>
 <p>On the way, Fei Hou explained the ‘connections’ to Zhao Shu and Yu Ming between Huang Xiaolong and Big Sword Sect, the Martial Ning Family, and Clear Cloud Pavilion.</p>
 <p>Violent Dragon County was located at the most northern point of Baolong Kingdom, and it was full of meandering hills and mountains. Atop this mountain range stood a huge palace-like building. This was the headquarters to one of the Baolong Kingdom’s prominent sects: Big Sword Sect.</p>
 <p>Main hall of Big Sword Sect’s headquarters.</p>
 <p>Yu Chen was listening to a disciple report about matters in Southern Cliffs City, and after that, he asked, “Wei Xiaodong was actually murdered, what’s everyone’s opinion on this?”</p>
 <p>Wei Xiaodong was one of Big Sword Sect’s core disciples, and this time, it was Yu Chen himself that sent him to Southern Cliffs City. He did not expect that Wei Xiaodong would meet his end there, together with all the other Big Sword Sect disciples that were also killed.</p>
 <p>“According to the report, the person that saved Sun Lin was a young man around seventeen or eighteen, and there were four in his group altogether. Castellan Sun referred to him as “Young Master Huang” with great respect. Could that Young Master Huang be Huang Xiaolong?” On the main seat, Lin Zhiren’s sullen voice asked.</p>
 <p>Someone that could raise fear from Castellan Sun with the surname Huang, and coupled with the description of that person, it was not difficult to guess Huang Xiaolong’s identity.</p>
 <p>“It should be Huang Xiaolong. He took the Cosmic Star Academy’s overall championship and is probably traveling to Duanren Empire to participate in the Imperial City battle. Most likely, he was passing through Southern Cliffs City on the way.” One Big Sword Sect Elder agreed.</p>
 <p>“Huang Xiaolong wants to head to Duanren Empire to participate in the Imperial City Battle, but he must travel across our Baolong Kingdom. In my opinion, he would pass by our Big Sword Sect territory within a month or two. Old Sect Leader, at that time we should lay a siege and kill Huang Xiaolong!” Another Big Sword Sect Elder suggested.</p>
 <p>“That’s right Old Sect Leader, this time we absolutely must kill Huang Xiaolong! Otherwise, if he were allowed to grow, this monstrous freak will break into the Xiantian realm within the next two years. Once he’s broken through into the Xiantian realm, it would be difficult for our Big Sword Sect to annihilate him at that time!”</p>
 <p>“And this time around, he won’t have Marshal Haotian protecting him, only that Fei Hou is beside him. This is a golden opportunity!”</p>
 <p>The Big Sword Sect Elders voiced their opinions.</p>
 <p>Yu Chen’s gaze sharpened. He raised his hand to silence the Elders, and when everyone quieted down, his cold voice sounded, “Pass down my order, all Big Sword Sect disciples move out, and stake out the possible routes Huang Xiaolong would take—cut him off!”</p>
 <p>All Big Sword Sect disciples moved out; this time, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t escape!</p>
 <p>“Yes, Old Sect Leader!” The Big Sword Sect Elders replied.</p>
 <p>However, several painful howling sounds were heard as Big Sword Sect disciples were seen flying into the main hall.</p>
 <p>Everyone in the huge hall was startled and looked over quickly.</p>
 <p>“Huang Xiaolong!” Yu Chen’s eyes narrowed and he jumped up from his seat. Lin Zhiren and the Elders also stood up from their seats.</p>
 <p>“Huang Xiaolong, I didn’t expect you would have the guts to step into my Big Sword Sect’s headquarters!” Yu Chen slowly walked out from the main hall, and step by step, he was fully releasing his battle qi as his gaze locked onto Huang Xiaolong.</p>
 <p>The Elders spread out in the huge hall, encircling Huang Xiaolong’s group of four in the middle.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the sound of a clear bell ringing cut through the tense atmosphere.</p>
 <p>In that moment, all of the Big Sword Sect’s disciples rushed to the main hall.</p>
 <p>One hundred thousand Big Sword Sect disciples came whistling through the air.</p>
 <p>In no time at all, all one hundred thousand disciples arrived, blocking all exits of the main hall to a point where not even water could leak out.</p>
 <p>Lin Zhiren looked at Huang Xiaolong and sneered coldly, “Huang Xiaolong, I want to see how you will run this time?!”</p>
 <p>“Run?” Huang Xiaolong showed indifference, “Who said I wanted to run?”</p>
 <p>Yu Chen quickly glanced over the four people on Huang Xiaolong’s side. At the end, his eyes fell onto Zhao Shu and Yu Ming’s body. He was filled with doubt; could these two people be Huang Xiaolong’s trump card?</p>
 <p>Both Zhao Shu and Yu Ming had their aura hidden. Of course, Yu Chen could not tell their cultivation levels with his pitiable level of strength.</p>
 <p>“Huang Xiaolong, do you think that just the four of you can go against the entirety of my Big Sword Sect disciples?” Lin Zhiren smirked conceitedly, and glanced over the four faces, “Do you think you have a Saint realm expert amongst you?”</p>
 <p>Relying on one person’s power to exterminate a prominent sect of a kingdom, only a Saint realm expert had the ability to do so.</p>
 <p>But, just as Lin Zhiren’s voice ended, Zhao Shu reached out and made a twisting action. Over the distance of hundreds of meters, countless shadows of gigantic hands were seen grasping at Lin Zhiren, lifting him up in midair.</p>
 <p>An earth shattering aura exploded from Zhao Shu.</p>
 <p>The weather within ten thousand li of the Big Sword Sect headquarters changed as clear blue skies darkened gloomily and thunderbolts struck simultaneously. An overwhelming pressure locked onto every corner of the Big Sword Sect headquarters.</p>
 <p>Lin Zhiren, Yu Chen, and the Big Sword Sect Elders were flopping like fish out of water under the pressure. Their eyes protruded out of their sockets, and their mouths were agape as if they were on the verge of taking their last breath at any moment.</p>
 <p>All the spiritual energy within that ten thousand li dissipated!</p>
 <p>“Saint…Saint realm expert!” Lin Zhiren was scared out of his wits, shivering from head to toe. His throat moved with much difficulty to utter those words.</p>
 <p><em><i>Saint realm expert!</i></em></p>
 <p>Only a Saint realm expert could release such terrifying pressure. Only a Saint realm expert could ignore space distance to control a Xiantian expert like Lin Zhiren.</p>
 <p>Only a Saint realm expert could manipulate the law of space to control certain spatial areas.</p>
 <p>Zhao Shu’s cold eyes glanced at Lin Zhiren and immense pressure swept across space. Lin Zhiren’s neck was then snapped right in front of everyone’s eyes. Following that, his body was released and he fell limply to the floor.</p>
 <p>A Xiantian expert died!</p>
 <p>Zhao Shu turned around, looking at Yu Chen and the others of the Big Sword Sect.</p>
 <p>“Se, Senior, mercy, mercy ah!” Fear and panic warped Yu Chen’s face as he pleaded.</p>
 <p>Zhao Shu snorted, and suddenly Yu Chen spurted blood from his mouth as if he took a heavy blow, and just like that, he tumbled to the floor. It was then that the Big Sword Sect Elders realized there was a wound deeply ingrained in Yu Chen’s chest, but no one knew when it happened.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, Lin Zhiren and Yu Chen, two of Big Sword Sect’s strongest Xiantian experts had fallen.</p>
 <p>An atmosphere fraught with death spread throughout the surrounding space.</p>
