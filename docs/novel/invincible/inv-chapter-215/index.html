 <p><b>Chapter 215: Guo Family’s Ancestor Exits</b></p>
 <p><span style>Before everyone’s rounded and shocked eyes, they saw Zhao Shu grip at the ethereal void. In the next moment Xiao Teng, who stood close to Yao Fei, exploded!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pop!</span></i><span style> A resounding crisp noise cut through the silence. Pieces of flesh and blood splattered in all directions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood fell to the ground like rain from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order expert had fallen!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood drops rained down from above, and they landed on Yao Fei, Gu Ziming, Du Lan, and the people in Yao Fei’s camp. Their faces and bodies were covered with what seemed to be bits and pieces of Xiao Teng’s flesh. It was even stuck in their nostrils!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scent of blood quickly filled the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the teachers and students spectating from afar felt their hearts twitched at the bloody scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Teng―Yao Fei’s left and right-hand man, a peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order expert, someone who was one of the existences closest to breaking into Saint Realm, died just like that!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Fei stared at the tiny pieces of Xiao Teng’s flesh on his nose, breathing in the thick scent of blood coming from the air through his nostrils. While terrified, a wave of nausea shot up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had always maintained high standards of cleanliness, not even the edges of his robe were ever dirty. In short, he was slightly obsessed with hygiene. Feeling the sticky blood running down his face, body, staining his robe, and especially with pieces of unknown parts of flesh on his nose, it wasn’t hard to imagine the disgust he felt!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Next, Zhao Shu’s right hand gripped at the void and Gu Ziming’s body exploded. Another shower of blood and pieces of flesh splattered down from high altitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order warrior had fallen!</span></p>
 <p><span style>More pieces of flesh fell on Yao Fei’s face. In fact, a piece of exploded flesh hung on his lips, causing Yao Fei’s nerves to twitch unceasingly. He wanted to scream yet his voice wouldn’t cooperate. He was shaking from the inside out as if he had swallowed thousands of flies into his stomach.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The look in Zhao Shu’s eyes grew increasingly sharp and cold, one of his hands made another gripping twist. This time, Du Lan exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The last of Yao Fei’s peak late-Tenth Order subordinates had also fallen!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if Zhao Shu’s actions were instructed by Huang Xiaolong, unhurried in his killing of Yao Fei’s people. Instead, he allowed Yao Fei the honor of watching his subordinates die one by one, awaiting the impending steps of the Death God as it approached. Providing him with the fear of being cornered and having nowhere to run.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Huang Xiaolong signaled to Zhao Shu with a look. Nodding, Zhao Shu sealed Yao Fei and the rest of the people’s voices with a wave of his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Fei screamed before that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me-, meat, quickly remove this damn minced meat from me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piercing screams sounded in the square.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first sentence coming out from Yao Fei’s mouth wasn’t to curse Huang Xiaolong, and wasn’t to beg for mercy. Instead, it was to order someone to remove the blood and flesh on his eyes, nose, and lips!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Yao Fei was careless. In the midst of his screams, the piece of flesh hanging on his lips slipped into his mouth and got stuck in his throat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Fei turned deathly pale, once again opening his mouth but the piece of flesh was stuck there. He became unnaturally purple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, that piece of flesh slid down Yao Fei’s throat and into his stomach. Only then did he glared viciously at Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong you mongrel, you damn mongrel I want to kill you! I’ll definitely kill you!” His pernicious gaze fixed on Huang Xiaolong as if he would swallow him whole.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” Without much change to his expression, Huang Xiaolong directed his words at Zhao Shu: “Continue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Young Lord!” Zhao Shu nodded at Huang Xiaolong and extended his hands out, this time clapping instead of using a gripping motion. Two of the subordinates behind Yao Fei exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bloody rain bloomed in the air like fireworks, dispersing a bloodied omen of death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huang Xiaolong, Young Noble Huang, please spare us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, that’s right Young Noble Huang, spare our measly lives. We, we’re willing to submit to you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The remaining experts belonging to Heartless Hall were terrified. One by one they began to beg Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Huang Xiaolong remained cold and indifferent. Zhao Shu clapped a second time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every time he clapped, two of Heartless Hall’s experts would die from their bodies exploding. Even the observing teachers and students had stepped back unconsciously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These fallen experts of Heartless Hall were all high-level Xiantian experts. In Duanren Empire, high-level Xiantian experts were considered scarce. Therefore, each of them possessed a noble status and identity, yet in front of Zhao Shu their death was swift and they appeared to be worthless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Scarlet blood painted the square.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The students that trailed after Huang Xiaolong to Heartless Hall with the aim of watching him be played with and tormented by Heartless Young Noble like a toy had faces that were paler than white.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thank God they did not mock or throw insults at Huang Xiaolong when they followed him, otherwise… !</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, the thirty to forty Xiantian experts behind Yao Fei exploded until none were left, leaving Yao Fei alone, standing in the square.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every time his subordinates exploded, the blood and flesh would fall on Yao Fei, causing him to shriek and holler like a crazed madman. The usual proud, noble, arrogant, condescending demeanor that held others’ fates in his hands vanished from sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Witnessing this Yao Fei, the crowd shook their heads inwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Standing amongst the crowd was one of the Five Young Nobles of Duanren Empire, someone of the same status as Yao Fei. Demon Sword Young Noble had a pensive expression on his face as he watched the scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When all the experts of Heartless Hall were dead, Zhao Shu stopped and retreated behind Huang Xiaolong. Looking at Yao Fei, Huang Xiaolong slowly took a few steps forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak, where are my parents?” Huang Xiaolong stopped in front of Yao Fei, a biting chill in his voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By this time, Yao Fei was no longer screaming like a madman, but he laughed maniacally as he glared at Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong, if you kill me your parents will accompany me in the afterlife! Moreover, my Yao Family Ancestor will be coming very soon, kill me now if you have the guts! Otherwise, when my Yao Family’s Ancestor and experts arrive, I will make you regret that you ever came to this world!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Fei laughed with reckless abandon, his face twisting with venomous hatred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes scanned the area and they fell on the big wooden barrel Xiao Teng had ordered people to bring out earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huang Xiaolong, what do you want to do?? You dare?!” Noticing Huang Xiaolong’s sudden interest being peeked, Yao Fei had a bad feeling. His face paled as he shouted at Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong pointed calmly at the big wooden barrel, “Nothing much. Didn’t you want me to eat everything in there? Then, I shall let you have a taste first. Remember to tell me how it tastes later!” Huang Xiaolong flicked his hands the moment he finished talking, and from within the big wooden barrel, a piece of feces flew in Yao Fei direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, in the Guo Mansion’s secret underground chamber, a powerful aura soared into the sky with great momentum, influencing even the weather.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Shiwen sensed the sudden burst of energy and joy filled his face, “Father finally succeeded in breaking through to Saint realm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Guo Family’s Chief Steward, Zhang Yue, stepped up with a smile, “Congratulations Patriarch, Old Ancestor successfully broke through to the Saint realm! The Guo Family will prosper better than ever in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Shiwen laughed heartily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Zhi was also in the main hall at this time, “Dad, since Grandfather succeeded in breaking into the Saint realm, you must ask Grandfather to avenge us. Kill Huang Xiaolong and Zhao Shu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right Dad, you must tell Grandfather to avenge us!” Guo Fei echoed his big brother’s sentiment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Shiwen snorted coldly, “Don’t worry. This time, Huang Xiaolong and that Zhao Shu can’t escape!”</span></p>
