 <p><b>Chapter 193: Investigating the Absolute Soul Pearl’s Whereabouts</b></p>
 <p><i><span style>Reserved all of it!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Both young men had an ugly expression on their face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When one of them was about to speak, his companion held him back while shaking his head slightly. He then turned around with a faint smile towards Xie Puti, “Since Younger Brother Puti has reserved the remaining Sapidity Wine for today, then us brothers will visit another day!” He pulled his companion up and out from the restaurant in front of Huang Xiaolong, Xie Puti, and Chen Cheng after ending his sentence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Watching the two silhouettes leaving, Xie Puti spoke, directing his words at Huang Xiaolong, “Those two have some relation to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Related to me?” Huang Xiaolong was baffled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Puti nodded, “They are members of the Guo Family.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Family!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong instantly understood that the Guo Family Xie Puti referred to was one and the same as Guo Tai’s Guo Family. Guo Family’s Million Treasure Firm was one of Duanren Empire’s three biggest firms, thus it was no wonder the two people acted like some parvenus the moment they entered the restaurant, reserving all of the Sapidity Wine before they were formally seated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The portly one is called Guo Zhi, the other is Guo Fei. They are brothers and their father is Guo Shiwen, Guo Shiyuan eldest brother. He also happens to be the recognized next in line as the Guo Family’s Patriarch.” Xie Puti added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong nodded, this meant Guo Zhi and Guo Fei were Guo Tai’s elder cousin brothers. Later, when his younger sister married into the Guo Family, she would be referring to him as Eldest Uncle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By this time, the restaurant waiter had already sent all the remaining over one hundred jugs of wine to their table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Puti laughed, “Come, have a taste of this Sapidity Wine. I can guarantee after today, you’ll be wanting to come here every day!” Xie Puti opened a jug and passed it to Huang Xiaolong. Immediately, a scent of aromatic wine filled the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong took the jug, sniffed lightly and took a sip. A piquant flavor filled his mouth as the liquid slid down his throat, so extremely smooth that he was already savoring the taste before it disappeared. Just as Xie Puti claimed, this Sapidity Wine was way better than the Beauty Allure Wine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not too long after, the restaurant waiter returned with some delicious side dishes for Huang Xiaolong’s table. In the Sapidity Wine House, guests that bought more than three jugs of wine were served a table of good dishes free of charge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, sounds of wine cups clinking sounded continuously from Huang Xiaolong’s table. The three of them drank every last drop of the one hundred and twenty-three jugs of wine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong and Xie Puti did not think too much about it. Chen Cheng’s heart, however, was bleeding at the damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One hundred twenty-three jugs of Sapidity Wine was equivalent to one million two hundred and thirty thousand gold coins ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Chen Cheng’s family was considered a large force in the Luo Tong Kingdom, they would be incapable of gathering so many gold coins even if they had sold all the pots and pans in their mansion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long after, the trio left the restaurant, returning to the dormitory yard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Midway there, Chen Cheng separated from them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back in the first yard of area ninety-eight, Huang Xiaolong looked around his room carefully for the first time. The room was not big, roughly about twenty square feet. Decorating the room was a cold jade bed and some simple furniture, such as a dresser with a couple of drawers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A cold jade bed… although cultivating on it could increase the speed of gathering spiritual energy, it no longer had the same effect for Huang Xiaolong. Not to mention the cold jade bed inside his Asura Ring was many times better than this one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a brief tour of his room, Huang Xiaolong separated from Xie Puti and took a look around Duanren Institute by himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course he would remember his most important aim when enrolling into Duanren Institute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number four on the Heavenly Treasure List, Absolute Soul Pearl!</span></p>
 <p><span style>For now he had the number nine, Linglong Treasure Pagoda, and the number six, God Binding Ring. If he could acquire and refine the Absolute Soul Pearl as well, his cultivation speed would increase again. He needed to speed up his cultivation to reach the Saint realm as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to what Zhao Shu said, his Senior Brother Chen Tianqi probably had broken through to Saint realm Sixth Order. Even if he hadn’t reached Saint realm Sixth Order, at the very least, he stood at peak late-Saint realm Fifth Order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong ‘strolled’ about Duanren Institute for two hours, but the Linglong Treasure Pagoda and God Binding Ring inside his body had no reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By this time, the sky outside had darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead of going back to the dorm yard, Huang Xiaolong left Duanren Institute, heading towards Southern Hill Estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Walking to the great hall, Huang Xiaolong sent the slave servant to call Zhao Shu and Fei Hou over. When both arrived, Huang Xiaolong asked about the progress of Nine Tripod Commerce’s relocation and the disciples’ arrangement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Hou said he spotted a suitable courtyard, and it was not far from Southern Hill Estate. the Nine Tripod Commerce disciples that were relocated could be arranged there. But the matter was pending negotiations with the owner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He told Fei Hou to continue watching Yao Fei’s movements, recounting what happened at the Wind Facing Hall this morning to Fei Hou and Zhao Shu. He then reminded them to be vigilant about Yao Fei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, Zhao Shu snorted with disdain, “Just a skinny brat that is still wet behind the ears. Truly ridiculous! He dared to tell Sovereign to kneel before him and apologize? Not only that, but to surrender to him above all?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sovereign, should we teach that Yao Fei a memorable lesson?” Fei Hou asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A memorable lesson? Huang Xiaolong pondered,”Is Yao Fei still searching for that black-clad old man?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is, Sovereign.” Fei Hou confirmed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For anyone coming to investigate that person’s whereabouts, capture and kill them on the spot!” Huang Xiaolong looked over at Zhao Shu as he was saying this. People that Yao Fei sent to investigate the old man’s whereabouts were all high-level Xiantian realm experts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t mind having the materials to refine a few more grade seven pellets. He could give them to his parents, Huang Peng and Su Yan, if he didn’t use them for himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Limited by their martial spirit grade, the possibility for them to successfully break into the Xiantian realm was almost nil, but swallowing some grade seven pellets would enhance their physical condition and increase their longevity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Sovereign!” Zhao Shu stood up and acknowledged Huang Xiaolong’s order with respect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A short while later, both withdrew from the great hall whereas Huang Xiaolong initiated the God Binding Ring and entered the ancient battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the ancient battlefield, Huang Xiaolong continued attempting to cultivate Asura Tactics and Body Metamorphosis Scripture simultaneously, then moved on to training God Binding Palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God Binding Palm was the heritage battle skill from the God Binding Ring. It was extremely profound, linking elemental laws of time and space. Every time Huang Xiaolong trained, he gained enlightenment on a new level. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>One night passed, and morning came.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong exited the ancient battlefield, leaving Southern Hill Estate for Duanren Institute. After arriving, Huang Xiaolong forwent classes in favor of roaming around Institute grounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Duanren Institute’s grounds were enormous, divided into an inner division and outer division. Exploring the outer division alone would take Huang Xiaolong eight to ten days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duanren Institute ran differently from Cosmic Star Academy. Here, there were neither compulsory classes nor differentiation by year.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every day in the Boundless Hall, a teacher would be present to guide student’s cultivation. The students were free to decide their attendance. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ten days passed quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong had covered every inch on the outer division yet the Linglong Treasure Pagoda and God Binding Ring inside his body stayed quiet. In other words, the Absolute Soul Pearl was not located anywhere within the outer division’s grounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it isn’t in the outer division, then it can only be in the inner division grounds?” Huang Xiaolong frowned as speculated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Students were free to come and go around the outer division grounds but the inner division was different, only an inner division student was allowed to go in.</span></p>
