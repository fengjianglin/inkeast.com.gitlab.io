 <p><b>Chapter 10: Thousand Year Old Leirion Heart Grass</b></p>
 <p><span style>“Buy from where?” Listening to his sister’s gleeful scream, Huang Xiaolong shook his head and laughed, thinking that this Violet Devourer Spirit Monkey is a rare spirit beast, something you can’t buy even if you have lots of money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo Hoo Haa!” The little violet monkey squeaked shrilly in protest at Huang Min for calling him ‘little monkey’, startling Huang Min whose hand was reaching out wanting to pet it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After being startled momentarily, Huang Min widened her eyes and stared angrily at the Violet Devourer Spirit Monkey; it was the beginning of a staring contest between a little monkey and a little girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With much difficulty, some time later, Huang Xiaolong managed to escape from Huang Min and, looking back towards Huang Min’s departing silhouette, he breathed out a heavy sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back in his room, removing the little monkey from his shoulder, he took out the cold jade bed from the Asura Ring’s space, and sat cross-legged atop it, starting his first practice according to Asura Tactics first layer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shortly after running the Asura Tactics technique, a nefarious cold chill broke out as if it came from the deepest nether of hell, shrouding Huang Xiaolong within. This spiritual energy was continuously being swallowed by his double-headed serpent martial spirit and then channeled into Huang Xiaolong’s meridians.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the nefarious frigid cold entered Huang Xiaolong’s body, he couldn’t help but shiver, feeling like he was being buried under a thousand feet glacier. Huang Xiaolong’s heart tightened, quickly forging his mind and will, he persisted in running Asura Tactics to refine the cold frigid energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This frigid energy moved extremely slow alongside Huang Xiaolong’s meridians, every inch it passed, his blood felt like it was about to freeze up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gritting his teeth, Huang Xiaolong persevered; running the Asura Tactics’ first layer cultivation technique, repeating it over and over. After a long time, the frigid cold sensation lessened and the energy inside his body was refined into pure battle qi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the cold frigid energy successfully converted into battle qi, Huang Xiaolong realized that it only took half an hour’s time. Compared to the Xuan Qin cultivation technique, the results were ten times better!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This discovery was much to Huang Xiaolong’s liking: “Looks like what the note says is true. Although the netherworld’s spiritual energy is hard to refine, once successful, the benefits are huge!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The note kept in the spine of Asura Tactics book stated that practicing the Asura Tactics was akin to building a connection with the netherworld’s spiritual energy that tempers the physique. That frigid cold air was, without a doubt, the so-called netherworld’s spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Netherworld spiritual energy was one of the superior energies between heaven and earth, the higher the quality of spiritual energy was, the better it was to temper the physical body, and the converted battle qi was much purer and more powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the gap between cultivation techniques.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The higher the rank of a cultivation technique, the quality of spiritual energy absorbed is higher, the converted battle qi is stronger. In the Martial Spirit World, the ones practicing high-rank cultivation techniques were capable of jumping levels to challenge stronger opponents, it was due to this factor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Martial spirits determine a person’s strength and future achievements, and the quality of cultivation technique was equally important.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time flies and soon one month passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this one month’s time, apart from practicing, Huang Xiaolong still practiced. The only difference was, instead of the XuanQin cultivation technique given to him by Huang Peng, Huang Xiaolong switched to practicing the Asura Tactics and the Body Metamorphose Scripture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After replacing his cultivation technique, Huang Xiaolong’s practice speed increased tremendously. One month after returning from the valley, he had reached the peak of late-Second Order, anytime soon he would be able to breakthrough to Third Order warrior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the bewitching darkness of the night, silvery moonlight streamed down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong sat cross-legged on the cold jade bed, spiritual energy from the netherworld poured down from the void and was devoured by the double-headed serpent martial spirit with its jaws wide open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The battle qi within Huang Xiaolong’s body kept swirling violently like raging waves crashing, the same way he felt when he was in peak-First Order breaking through to Second Order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, breaking through to Third Order warrior was much harder, the resistance barrier was thicker but Huang Xiaolong persisted. His battle qi continued to crash against the barrier, not knowing how much time had lapsed, suddenly a minute crack appeared in the third-order barrier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aware that the third-order barrier was loosening, Huang Xiaolong felt excited and pushed against the barrier more aggressively as the barrier’s minute crack grew bigger when, finally, a sound of explosion resounded inside his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like a flash flood, battle qi rushed into the third layer meridians in triumph!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Order! Finally, he broke through to the Third Order warrior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes, unable to hide the jubilation in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once breaking through Third-Order, the Fourth Order wasn’t far away!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Once I advance to the Fourth Order, I can start practicing battle skills; and once I reach the Fourth Order, my martial spirit will evolve. At that time, a skill from my martial spirit’s innate talent will appear!” Huang Xiaolong thought inwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At age seven, the martial spirit awakened; however, the awakened martial spirit was just in its infancy. Only when the battle qi reached the Fourth Order would the martial spirit evolve to become stronger, while the owner of the martial spirit would gain the martial spirit’s innate talent, ability or skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The higher the grade of the martial spirit, the innate talent after evolving would be more powerful!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the Fourth Order was only a general indication. People with low-level martial spirits ranging from grade one, two, and three, due to their martial spirits’ natural limitation, more often than not, failed to breakthrough to the Fourth Order and without some fortuitous adventure, breaking through to Fourth Order would be a tedious challenge. That was why people with low-level martial spirits never gained any martial spirit’s innate talent or skill in their lifetime for they were unable to reach the Fourth Order. Thus, their martial spirits were unable to go through evolution.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Getting down from the cold jade bed, Huang Xiaolong stepped out from his room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time of the night, the air was foggy under the moonlight and Huang Xiaolong’s silhouette disappeared in a flash, appearing again in the back mountain. Running the Asura Tactics, his eyes turned a blood-red color and his jet-black hair turned fully white. At the same time, a black aura of slaughter flowed around his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This physique was attained after practicing the Asura Tactics – the Body of Asura, but this was only the initial stage transformation. According to the explanation on the piece of note, once Huang Xiaolong mastered the highest level of Asura Tactics, he could transform into a real Asura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After transforming into the Body of Asura, Huang Xiaolong’s movement under the moonlight was akin to a floating black cloud. Waving his hands out suddenly, a palm carrying traces of frigid air struck towards a huge tree ahead, piercing through the thick tree trunk and coming out from the other end, through a second and a third tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the fourth tree trunk, a child’s palm print dented a few inches into the trunk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at the palm print on the fourth tree trunk, Huang Xiaolong nodded his head in satisfaction. Entering the Third Order combined with the netherworld battle qi, the damage power of Ethereal Palm had increased about four times and with his current strength, he was capable of killing a late-Third Order warrior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, after advancing to Third Order and due to the tempering benefits from the netherworld spiritual aura, Huang Xiaolong physique was firmer and stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Spending some time to practice the Body Metamorphose Scripture in the back mountain, Huang Xiaolong only returned to Huang Clan Manor when the sky began to brighten.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once back in Huang Clan Manor, Huang Xiaolong was called to the Eastern Courtyard hall by Huang Peng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, Mom, you were looking for me?” Entering the Eastern Courtyard’s hall, Huang Xiaolong asked as took a seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Peng and Su Yan looked complicated and hesitant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yesterday, Huang Wei had broken through to the First Order warrior.” Huang Peng eventually opened his mouth and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Huang Xiaolong understand his parents’ purpose in calling him over. In short, they were still worried about the end of the year’s Clan Assembly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, in less than two months’ time, Huang Wei actually advanced to First Order, so fast?! Logically speaking, even though Huang Wei possessed a grade ten martial spirit, the Three-Eyed Black Tiger, it was still impossible to advance to First Order in such short time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father spent a huge sum of money in the county’s auction house to procure a stalk of thousand years Leirion Heart Grass!” Huang Peng went on to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A thousand years Leirion Heart Grass!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong was shocked and then he sneered; no wonder in less than two months’ time Huang Wei was able to advance to First Order warrior. It was all due to Grandfather Huang Qide spending a huge sum of money to get a thousand-year-old Leirion Heart Grass for Huang Wei’s practice. One stalk of one thousand-year-old Leirion Heart Grass wasn’t something cheap, and it was obvious enough that Grandfather Huang Qide thought of Huang Wei as the future pillar of the Huang Clan Manor. Thus spending all resource and effort to cultivate him, whereas him, though a grandson of the same person, disregarding the Leirion Heart Grass, Huang Xiaolong did not even get a Battle Qi Dan!</span></p>
