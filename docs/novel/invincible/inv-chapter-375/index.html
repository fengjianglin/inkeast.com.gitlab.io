 <p><strong>Chapter 375: Soft Tofu</strong></p>
 <p><span>Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong’s group of three arrived at Blessed Buddha City.</span></p>
 <p><span>Several years earlier, Huang Xiaolong came to the Blessed Buddha Empire to look for the Godly Mt. Xumi, but he didn’t have the opportunity to see the Blessed Buddha Imperial City.</span></p>
 <p><span>Just as he stepped into Blessed Buddha City, Huang Xiaolong instantly felt the rich Buddhism energy in the air. This Buddhism energy did not originate from the people, it was naturally formed by years of Buddhism energy accumulation.</span></p>
 <p><span>Rows of shops lined the streets, but nearly all of them were related to Buddhism in one way or another, some sold Buddha statues, some Buddha religion-related items, and others battle skills based on Buddhism energy. Of course those battle skills were common low grade.</span></p>
 <p><span>The grades of battle skills couldn’t enter Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, however, due to curiosity, he entered a random skill shop with Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu, flipping over some battle skill manuals.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was close to noon after a few hours strolling around the city. When they walked by a big restaurant called Buddhist House, the three of them went inside the premise.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong had already tasted Luo Tong Kingdom’s Snow Moon Wine, Duanren Empire’s Sapidity Wine, and Rising Sun City’s Origin Wine, but he had yet to sample the wine made by Buddhists.</span></p>
 <p><span>A fragrant aroma teased their noses the moment they walked into the restaurant. It was different from any wine Huang Xiaolong had smelled before, purely based on this fragrance alone, one could already be sure that the wine sold here in this Buddhist House was going to be good.</span></p>
 <p><span>Due to the two large ancient puppets trailing behind Huang Xiaolong, they immediately attracted the crowd’s attention when they appeared inside, curious whispers and gazes were inevitable.</span></p>
 <p><span>Although both puppets converged their Saint realm aura, the four-meter height and sturdy physique alone put enough pressure over the other customers inside.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Are those the Beastmen from the Ten Directions Continent?” A person stared at the two large silhouettes behind Huang Xiaolong, somewhat awed.</span></p>
 <p><span>“No, Beastmen have some similarities with the Demonic Beast race, clearly these two people aren’t Beastmen.” The person same table as he stated.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It’s hard to imagine there would be someone so tall in this world.” A customer was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong merely smiled and shook these comments away as he, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu found a table close to the window and sat down. The two giant puppets stood behind Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span>Moments later, the restaurant waiter approached Huang Xiaolong’s table, “What would several Lords like to order?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong spoke: “A table of dishes, your best ones; first bring three jugs of your restaurant best wine.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“First bring three jugs?” The waiter was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong didn’t say another word seeing the waiter’s reaction, placing an opened spatial ring on the table without another word. Inside the ring, gold coins piled mountain high, nearly blinding the waiter with their sparkle. Huang Xiaolong encountered the same situation too many times.</span></p>
 <p><span>Sure enough, once the waiter saw the glittering mountains of gold inside the spatial ring, his legs shook as if he was on the verge of pissing himself. No another word of nonsense, the waiter excused himself and sped away to bring Huang Xiaolong’s order. It didn’t take long for the waiter to return with a tray full of their best dishes and three jugs of their best wine.</span></p>
 <p><span>This wine followed the name of the restaurant and was called Buddhist House.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong broke open the seal, banging wine bowls with Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu. Sliding down, the deep smoky fragrance of the wine teased their taste buds, spicy yet mellow, carrying a quiet serene aftertaste that made people yearn for it.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This wine is not bad.” Huang Xiaolong praised. Although it didn’t compare to Rising Sun City’s Origin Wine, it was good wine nonetheless.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu nodded their heads in agreement, the three chatted as they drank.</span></p>
 <p><span>At some point, a large pot-bellied man entered, with four guards following behind him. What tickled Huang Xiaolong’s funny bone were this pot-bellied man’s features—small beady eyes, big nose, wide mouth, and thin brows that resembled a woman's. Not to mention that huge pot-belly probably could hold a big water barrel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>After entering the premise, the pot-bellied man picked a table and sat. However, his beady eyes swiftly scanned around and when he spotted the two giant puppets behind Huang Xiaolong, the pair of small beady eyes lit up as he saw some great treasure.</span></p>
 <p><span>The fatty man stood up and walked toward Huang Xiaolong’s table.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong noticed the fatty walking toward him with beady eyes staring fixedly at the two giant puppets behind him and was puzzled; did this chubby man recognize the puppets behind him?</span></p>
 <p><span>Those giant puppets from the Linglong Treasure Pagoda were refined from the Ancient Golden Giant Tribe, the people who had the keen sight to recognize them were scarce in number.</span></p>
 <p><span>Even Zhao Shu and Zhang Shu were baffled by the man’s actions.</span></p>
 <p><span>In a few strides, the fatty reached in front of Huang Xiaolong, “Brother, are these two your guards?” he asked, a finger pointed at the two giant puppets.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong was stumped, then he nodded, “That’s right.” he couldn’t figure out the intention of this question.</span></p>
 <p><span>The fatty laughed, &nbsp;“I wonder if this brother would be willing to sell these two guards, I want to buy them.”</span></p>
 <p><span>This sent Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu in a daze.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong looked at the fatty’s small eyes that narrowed into fine lines as he smiled, feeling amused, he asked, “Are you sure you want to buy?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Many thoughts passed through Huang Xiaolong’s mind when he saw the fatty walking over to him, but he didn’t expect the man to have his eyes set on his giant puppets.</span></p>
 <p><span>“That’s right.” The fatty man chuckled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Why do you want to by these two guards of mine?” Huang Xiaolong asked. He was really curious why this fatty wanted to buy his giant puppets, the other side was merely a Houtian Eighth Order, therefore it was impossible for him to see that the two giant puppets behind him had the strength of Tenth Order Saint realm experts. If he could see it, he wouldn’t dare to be having such thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span>The fatty man smiled, “Because these two guards of your look so cool!”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>So cool!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu could no longer hold in their laughter. Still, one had to admit, two four-meter tall giant puppets indeed looked really cool standing there.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong shook his head in laughter, “You cannot afford these two giant guards of mine.” What Huang Xiaolong said was a fact. A Saint realm expert, not even an empire could afford to buy, not to mention a Tenth Order Saint realm.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, it seemed like the fatty failed to understand Huang Xiaolong’s meaning, his sonorous voice offered: “One million, how about it?”</span></p>
 <p><span>One million!</span></p>
 <p><span>The customers around turned over, eyes wide with surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span>One million, even in Blessed Buddha Empire’s Blessed Buddha Imperial City, it was a large number.</span></p>
 <p><span>Seeing the reaction of people around him, fatty showed a complacent look.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span>Watching Huang Xiaolong’s reaction, the fatty man stunned, adding: “What I meant was one million for one, two for two million.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong was still shaking his head in refusal, if it weren’t because this fatty had no malicious intent, he would have sent him away early on.</span></p>
 <p><span>Seeing Huang Xiaolong still refused him, disappointment flashed in his eyes, just as the fatty was about to turn back and return to his table, a voice sounded out of nowhere, “Being tall doesn’t mean things, who knows, maybe these guards only good on the surface, but have no strength. Bringing out guards like this, one can only pretend to be cool for a short time, if a real fight breaks out, perhaps they are nothing but soft tofu and die in one strike!” The voice was full of sarcasm. Without a doubt, the soft tofu being referred to was Huang Xiaolong’s two giant puppets.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong and everyone else looked over, the person who spoke was a young man dressed in luxurious brocade robe, heavily greased hair, and a pale white face.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It’s Chen Family’s eldest young master, Chen Luoguang!” Someone blurted.</span></p>
 <p><span>Hearing this, most of the customers' faces tightened, obviously this Chen Family’s Eldest Young Master had quite a reputation in Blessed Buddha City.</span></p>
