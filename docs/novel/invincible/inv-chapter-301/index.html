 <p><b>Chapter 301: </b><b>Eminent Holiness Halberd Sutra</b></p>
 <p><span style>Four days later, the little Daoist man was fully refined by Huang Xiaolong, ‘his’ consciousness was slowly eroded away by the Heaven and Earth Origin Reverting Array.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the divine grade little Daoist man’s consciousness was erased, Huang Xiaolong swallowed the pellet into his body, sat down and started to run the Asura Tactics, refining its medicinal properties.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The energy within a divine grade spirit pellet was comparable to the spiritual energy fish. The instant it entered his body, the medicinal energy surged like angry waves through his four limbs and the rest of his body. Huang Xiaolong’s Qi Sea and dantian absorbed the medicine energy in a frenzied manner. A faint herb fragrance wafted out from Huang Xiaolong’s body spreading to the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Half a month passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes as he ended his cultivation session. He had fully refined the little Daoist man after half a month’s time. Now, not only had he stabilized his recent breakthrough to Xiantian Tenth Order, his cultivation improved as well, closer to peak early-Xiantian Tenth Order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immersing his perception internally to check his condition, he noted that his meridians expanded once again and became tougher, even the true essence in his dantian was denser.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong once again ran the Asura Tactics, attracting the surrounding spiritual energy, swirling speedily towards him. </span><i><span style>‘At this speed, perhaps not even a Saint realm expert’s speed of absorbing spiritual energy can contend with my own.’</span></i><span style> Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A short moment later, Huang Xiaolong stood up, his attention on the remaining three jade bottles on the drawer. The first jade bottle he checked contained a divine grade spirit pellet, what about the others? He could barely hold his excitement in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Walking over, he opened all three jade bottles, and indeed, all three jade bottles contained divine grade spirit pellets. The second bottle Huang Xiaolong opened contained a divine grade spirit pellet that had taken the form of a winged-tiger, the third pellet was a golden flood dragon, and the fourth bottle held a purple fox.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The strength of these three, a winged-tiger, a golden flood dragon, and a purple fox, were much weaker compared to the little Daoist man earlier. Thus, not wasting any more time, Huang Xiaolong refined and swallowed them one by one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Huang Xiaolong was busy refining the divine grade spirit pellets, inside a manor on the south side of the City of Myriad Gods, an extremely ugly expression hung on Zhao Chen’s face; </span><i><span style>it had been almost half a year! Huang Xiaolong, that useless punk, was still hiding inside the city!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure Huang Xiaolong, that punk, has been inside that yard all this time?” Zhao Chen’s asked gloomily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The silver-haired man, Steward Feng, stepped forward, answering humbly, “Our people are watching the yard twenty-four hours a day, Huang Xiaolong has never stepped out of the courtyard, only his several followers come out occasionally. Even so, they only came out to buy some daily necessities, none of them exited the city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A light glinted in Zhao Chen’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the silver-haired Steward Feng spoke cautiously, “Young Lord, this subordinate has a question, I'm wondering if it is appropriate to ask?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chen took a quick glance at Steward Feng saying, “You’re wondering why I’m acting against Huang Xiaolong when there is no feud between us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Steward Feng was surprised having his thoughts seen through, but he nodded, “Yes, this slave’s heart has doubts. Moreover, Huang Xiaolong is just a nameless junior, with Young Lord’s identity, there is no need to act in person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, just like what Steward Feng said, with Zhao Chen’s background, he needn’t take this matter into his own hands, as long as he spoke the words, there would be many people willing to be of service.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chen said, “I have my reason to handle this matter personally. Don’t ask what you shouldn’t ask, you will know in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Young Lord. This slave spoke too much.” Steward Feng acknowledged respectfully, but after hesitation, he ventured again, “However, if Huang Xiaolong continues to hole himself in City of Myriad Gods, we…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The look in Zhao Chen’s eyes sharpened, “There are three months remaining until the opening day of the Ghost City, two more months, if that Huang Xiaolong still doesn’t show up, then I can only take him away forcefully!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ghost City, one of six main cities during the ancient era, a monument left behind by one of the six ancient kings, the Ghost King, appearing once every one thousand years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Days passed and it was over a month, in the secret dwelling beneath the cold spring lake, Huang Xiaolong succeeded in refining the last of three divine grade spirit pellets, bolstering his cultivation to mid-Xiantian Tenth Order.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Mid-Xiantian Tenth Order!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong stood up and initiated his battle qi. A simple breath gathered the airflow into a spiral, turning into a howling wind dragon that roared endlessly, rotating above the space for a long time before dissipating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was Huang Xiaolong’s current level of strength! Every breath he drew in and out contained the force of a dragon. Then Huang Xiaolong stepped out from the straw grass hut to an open space close by and started practicing the Asura Tactics, displaying the moves one after another from the very beginning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whirls of fierce winds rotated above the space, followed by a lightning-filled sky as buds of strange flowers bloomed in the air, then glaring red eyeballs appeared out of nowhere, releasing terrifying light beams.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A short while later, Huang Xiaolong stopped, but it took longer for the fierce winds, powerful lightning, and scarlet red eyeballs to dissipate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Displaying the Asura Sword Skill from the first move after breaking into Xiantian Tenth Order, Huang Xiaolong found his comprehension of them deepens. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘I wonder what’s inside the rest of the grass huts?’</span></i><span style> Huang Xiaolong focused again on the present, his eyes strayed to the remaining grass huts. With a flicker, he entered a random third grass hut.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside, other than a long halberd, there was nothing else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The long halberd was entirely a metallic dark-gold, on its body were inscribed numerous mythical beasts of ancient times, each looking vividly alive. Trailing the length of the long halberd, Huang Xiaolong noticed dense ancient text at the bottom of the halberd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eminent Holiness Halberd Sutra.” Huang Xiaolong translated the words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to what was written, as long as he refined the Eminent Holiness Halberd, he would be able to inherit the full Sutra heritage. This Eminent Holiness Halberd Sutra was left behind by the owner of this space, Supreme Eminent Holiness, this halberd Sutra was his strongest battle skill.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘By refining this Eminent Holiness Halberd, one can actually gain the Eminent Holiness Halberd Sutra, this is an unexpected harvest.’</span></i><span style> Huang Xiaolong’s eyes lit up. Although he wasn’t lacking in terms of cultivation techniques and battle skills, these were things that no one would deem as having too much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Judging from the situation, this Eminent Holiness was a great master himself. Only those who had reached the God Realm could inscribe their cultivation techniques or battle skills into non-living items so that it could remain for many years, a heritage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, following the method of refining inscribed on the body of the Eminent Holiness Halberd, Huang Xiaolong initiated his battle qi, slowly refining the halberd to become his own.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dozen hours later, when Huang Xiaolong finished refining the halberd, a scene suddenly appeared in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that scene, a person reaching three zhang tall stood high above a mountain peak. His halberd slashed down and the sea in front of him receded without resistance! Then, his halberd swung out, halberd intent reaching ten thousand miles cut right across the huge mountain through and through, straight in the middle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This giant person displayed one attack after another continuouslyーthe Eminent Holiness Halberd Sutra! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Witnessing the Eminent Holiness Halberd Sutra’s power of shaking mountains and flipping seas, Huang Xiaolong was greatly shocked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, the scene in his mind ended and vanished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a total of nine moves in the Eminent Holiness Halberd Sutra, every move was just as powerful and strong.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘I must find time to ask Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu about this Supreme Eminent Holiness, he shouldn’t be someone nameless.’ </span></i><span style>Huang Xiaolong made a note.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at the long halberd, with a thought, it shrunk smaller and smaller in size, in the end, it submerged into Huang Xiaolong’s right arm. On Huang Xiaolong’s right arm, the Blades of Asura made their home there long ago, now, beside the tattoos of the twin dark blades was a totem-like pattern of a golden halberd.</span></p>
