 <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
 <p><b>Chapter 09: Blades of Asura</b></p>
 <p><span style>Flipping to the first page of Asura Tactics, a pair of blood-red eyes seemed to jump out from the page. A humanoid illustration of an Asura standing upright with its upper body bared, revealing taut muscles, and a head of white hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Studying the humanoid Asura illustration, a sensation of being in hell crept up his skin, mad slaughter and an endless sea of bodies awash Huang Xiaolong’s senses, and his eyes turned blood-red; confused and in pain, Huang Xiaolong starts to lose his consciousness in the blood-thirst frenzy when suddenly behind him the double-headed serpent martial spirit appeared roaring towards the sky – a roar so thunderous that it shook the heaven. The red bloodlust slowly faded from his eyes as he regained his conscious. Waking up, his heart pounded like it was going to burst out from his chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, the humanoid Asura illustration flew out from the book page, in a bright flash, it entered between Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows. Inside mind emerged the details of a cultivation technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first layer of Asura Tactics.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Origin of Hell, the beginning of evil……” reciting the first layer of Asura Tactics’s battle qi cultivation technique, Huang Xiaolong found it deeply profound and mysterious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Martial Spirit World, battle qi cultivation techniques were categorized into four ranks, namely Heaven, Earth, Mysterious, and Yellow and each rank was further divided into different grades; low, mid and high-level. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder what rank is Asura Tactics cultivation technique?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, Huang Xiaolong turned to the second page. On it, there was another humanoid illustration of Asura, but this one was slightly different. On the second illustration of Asura’s back was a pair of devilish black wings that spread open, exuding a domineering aura and a taste for massacre.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Same as the previous page’s experience, when he turned to the second page, an atmosphere that seemed originated from hell surrounded Huang Xiaolong and his double-headed serpent martial spirit once again appeared behind him, suppressing the blood-thirsty desire deluding Huang Xiaolong’s consciousness and the second layer of Asura Tactics was successfully imprinted inside his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The third page, fourth page, fifth page…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong turned the pages one by one, with every page turned, inside his mind emerged another upper layer of Asura Tactics cultivation technique. As his page turning speed was slow, it took him more than two hours before he manage to reach the last page.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One last page, instead of an illustration, a line of flamboyant calligraphy filled the page.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Encumbered with Hell’s aura of slaughter, the one receiving Asura Tactics is accepted as my pro-disciple, governing over Asura’s Gate. When Asura appears, invincible throughout the world!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This line of words was left behind by the First Sovereign of Asura’s Gate, Ren Wokuang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Asura appears, invincible throughout the world!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong was stunned! &nbsp;This Asura Gate’s First Sovereign, Ren Wokuang was a little too mad, right? &nbsp;Between heaven and earth, who dared to declare themselves as invincible throughout the world, but this Ren Wokuang wrote after practicing Asura Tactics, he will be invincible against all?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A simple line of words, but it was extremely arrogant and domineering!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, a piece of paper fell out from the spine of the book. Apart from the piece of paper there was also a dark-colored ring. Surprised, Huang Xiaolong picked up both items from the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the explanation written on the paper, he got to know that the ring was called the Asura ring, and the two sharp black blades hanging on the wall were called the Blades of Asura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Huang Xiaolong did not expect was, the Asura ring was actually a spatial ring that only existed in legends; according to his father, in the whole of Luo Tong Kingdom, only the Emperor had one, even his grandfather Huang Qide didn’t own one!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The appearance of a spatial ring could cause bloody contention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moments later, suppressing the excitement in his heart, Huang Xiaolong did according to the instruction stated, pricked his finger and dripped a drop of blood onto the Asura ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the drop of fresh blood fell, a bright light burst out from the dark-colored ring as it floated up and slipped onto Huang Xiaolong’s ring finger on his left hand by itself; then it seemed to submerged into his body, disappearing from view. When Huang Xiaolong thought of it, it appeared again on his ring finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sensing the large space within Asura ring, Huang Xiaolong was delighted – it was more than a few hundred cubic meters wide and with this Asura Ring it would be more convenient for him to carry things around without having to worry about others finding out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, he turned around, gazing at the pair of shiny black blades on the wall and with a small leap he took down the pair of blades. The sabers’ bodies seemed to emanate a strange buzz that could penetrate into people’s minds, causing a cold prickly sensation that creeped people out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong examined the Blades of Asura in his hands, noticing on the bodies of the blades a black fiendish current flow faintly, indirectly forming blurred images of terrifying horror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The longer Huang Xiaolong held the Blades of Asura in hands, the fonder he grew of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blades of Asura, the blades of slaughter; great, from here onwards you will accompany me to slaughter all my enemies!” Huang Xiaolong said as he caressed the ridge of the sabers. As if able to understand the meaning of his words, the blades issued a cheerful hum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong only grew fonder. Then, using the same method of recognizing owner, he dripped a few drops of blood onto the blades and as the drops of fresh blood meld, a blood-red light burst out from the blades as they hovered in the air, one flew to the left and the other to the right of Huang Xiaolong. On Huang Xiaolong’s arms emerged two tiny tattoo-like Blades of Asura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong placed the piece of paper and Asura Tactics book into the Asura ring for safekeeping and prepared to leave the room, however, he paused just as he reached the door and turned back looking at the jade bed. He took the cold jade bed away too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stepping out from the third room, Huang Xiaolong circled once around the cave. After confirming that he did not miss anything he walked to the exit. &nbsp;He did not plan to remove the inlaid Water Dispersing Pearl at the cave’s entrance, for he planned to use the cave in the future for his practice, for the cave’s well-hidden location in the valley. That was the reason why he did not take the Water Dispersing Pearl, there were benefits to keeping this cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Emerging from the lake, Huang Xiaolong swam to the side and put on his clothes, transferring the Yang fruits into his ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo Hoo Haa” Exactly at this moment, the little violet monkey had finished absorbing the spiritual energy from the Yang fruit came running towards Huang Xiaolong in a cheerful gait.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong noticed that after absorbing two Yang fruits, the Spirit Devourer Violet Monkey’s fur became glossier, and its eyes brighter, however, its body size remained the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little guy, I have to go back now, I’ll come to see you again.” Huang Xiaolong leaned forwards and said to the little violet monkey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, as he turned around to leave, the little violet monkey cried out and in a flash appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s shoulder, perching comfortably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong was dazed for a moment, and jokingly said: “Little guy, don’t tell me that you want to follow me home?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, the little violet monkey squeaked and nodded its little head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong did not expect that this little violet monkey will be willing to follow him home, after a brief consideration, he said with a smile: “Very well, let’s go.” &nbsp;A boy and a monkey departed from the valley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Passing through the green turf and the mountains of white bones, Huang Xiaolong wondered to himself “</span><i><span style>Were all these people killed by Ren Wokuang</span></i><span style>?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leaving the valley, HuangXiaolong did not take any detours, heading straight to Huang Clan Manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time he reached Huang Clan Manor, it was already noon. Just as he stepped into his small courtyard, he ran into Huang Min, his little sister who had just stepped out from his small courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother, where did you go?” Huang Min asked, but it was only up till here, as her eyes widened in surprise when she saw the little violet monkey on Huang Xiaolong’s shoulder. Clapping her hands gleefully, she almost shouted out loud: “What a cute little monkey! Big brother, where did you buy it from?”</span></p>
