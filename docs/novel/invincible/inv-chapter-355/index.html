 <p><b>Chapter 355: Poison Corpse Scarabs</b></p>
 <p><span>Rising Sun City’s Castellan, Wang Cong, had half his life flown away seeing Li Molin and the Deities Templar Elders escape. If they were gone, what about him? Even Yao Fei was not enough for Huang Xiaolong to ‘play’ with. If Huang Xiaolong wanted to kill him, blowing a few breaths was sufficient to reap his life…</span></p>
 <p><span>Fortunately, however, it seemed like Huang Xiaolong had forgotten about him and left.</span></p>
 <p><span>Wang Cong breathed in relief watching Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and the rest of the group fly away, his knees buckled as if he continuously ran a hundred thousand li, panting heavily. Only at this moment did he realize that the back of his robe was soaked by cold sweat, as for the wet patch at his crotch, the source was undetermined.</span></p>
 <p><span>The surrounding crowd watched as Huang Xiaolong’s group left, dumbstruck. A long time later, noises filled the air again, one higher than the other.</span></p>
 <p><span>Astounded! Amazed!</span></p>
 <p><span>Half-Saints in general needed to accumulate more than a dozen years of cultivation to advance to the Saint realm, whereas Huang Xiaolong, from peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order to Saint realm, it was a mere six months!</span></p>
 <p><span>The legendary top ten Heavenly Treasures resurfaced—the God Binding Ring and Absolute Soul Pearl! The crucial point was, Huang Xiaolong possessed both Heavenly Treasures.</span></p>
 <p><span>The awe, astonishment, and excitement lasted a long time. Before sundown, the news spread to every corner of Rising Sun City and traveled out of the city walls with terrifying speed. In just a few days’ time, every person in the High Sun Empire knew that Huang Xiaolong had broken into the Saint realm, as well as the fact that he possessed two Heavenly Treasures, the God Binding Ring and Absolute Soul Pearl.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong was the hottest discussion topic for both warriors and commoners. Barely any word exchange could be completed without the two words—Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong’s name rang louder than any Emperor on the Snow Wind Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span>…</span></p>
 <p><span>Two days later, in the north side of the Origin Forest, on one of the many hill peaks. Space distorted, several figures emerged out of nowhere. This group was none other than Li Molin, Yao Shan, and the three Deities Templar Elders.</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Molin stood in the air, staring in one direction with frigid cold eyes. The incident in Rising Sun City had spread out. For the past two days, everyone talked of Huang Xiaolong and Deities Templar.</span></p>
 <p><span>Of course, when discussing Huang Xiaolong, there were only positive compliments, whereas when talking about Deities Templar, harsh words cut deep. Such as, Deities Templar was only so-so, even their Elders were killed, and in the end, they ran away with their tails between their legs.</span></p>
 <p><i><span>Ran away with their tails between their legs!</span></i><span> Every time Li Molin heard this phrase, uncontrollable killing intent would erupt in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><b><i>Huang Xiaolong!</i></b><span> If it weren’t because of that Huang Xiaolong, Deities Templar would not turn into a joke!</span></p>
 <p><span>“When will Elder Zhou and the others arrive?” Seconds later, Li Molin spoke. After what happened at Rising Sun City, Li Molin sent a message back to Deities Templar to send more experts to Origin Forest. The Temple Preceptor placed great importance on this matter, sending ten Elders over.</span></p>
 <p><span>Yao Shan quickly replied, “Probably another two days until Elder Zhou Chang will be able to arrive at the Origin Forest.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Hearing that, Li Molin’s expression turned slightly better.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Any news about the Ancient Dragon Clan ruins’ location?” Li Molin asked another Elder.</span></p>
 <p><span>That Deities Templar Elder shook his head, “Not yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Molin’s brows creased into furrows.</span></p>
 <p><span>…</span></p>
 <p><span>At the same time, Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, Duan Ren, and the others were flying over the south side of the Origin Forest. After leaving Rising Sun City, Huang Xiaolong’s group decided to venture into the Origin Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span>These two days, they had been searching for the Ancient Dragon Clan’s ruins’ location, but like other experts before them, there was not much of a result.</span></p>
 <p><span>Two days passed and Duan Ren had come to terms with the fact that Huang Xiaolong had advanced to the Saint realm. He watched Huang Xiaolong’s back, recalling that split second early Saint realm aura that he sensed back in Duanren Imperial City. At that time, he was able to determine that it came from the Southern Hill Estate’s direction, but he did not make the link to Huang Xiaolong. However, he could confirm now that it was Huang Xiaolong, without a doubt.</span></p>
 <p><span>While flying, Huang Xiaolong tried to sense the reaction of the black and blue martial spirits inside him, but the lack of any reaction from them since he entered the Origin Forest disappointed him.</span></p>
 <p><span>After the incident at Rising Sun City, Huang Xiaolong felt that he still wasn’t strong enough, he could handle First and Second Order Saint realm experts, but not a Third Order Saint realm. That was why he wanted to find the Ancient Dragon Clan ruins as soon as possible, it would allow him to enhance his strength even more.</span></p>
 <p><span>He killed Ao Baixue first and later Yao Fei, Deities Templar would definitely not spare him.</span></p>
 <p><span>As for revealing the existence of the God Binding Ring and Absolute Soul Pearl, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t concerned. Relying on the level of strength he had shown, he believed that there were only so many people who would dare to take advantage of him.</span></p>
 <p><span>As Huang Xiaolong’s group flew across the Origin Forest in search of the Ancient Dragon Clan ruins, from some distance away came woeful screams, similar to the last struggle before impending death.</span></p>
 <p><span>The group’s actions stopped, exchanging glances among them.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Head over and have a look.” Huang Xiaolong said in a grave tone. Humans couldn’t help but be curious about things unknown.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhao Shu, Duan Ren, and everyone else nodded in agreement. Thus the group headed in the direction of the screams. </span></p>
 <p><span>Very soon, Huang Xiaolong’s group arrived at the scene. Seeing the scene before them, they, including Huang Xiaolong, drew a sharp intake of breath.</span></p>
 <p><span>Several hundred meters up ahead, more than a dozen people were entirely submerged in a giant swarm of black beetles, being eaten alive! Parts of their arms and legs were bitten off cleanly, leaving only white bones., others were already showing the empty eye sockets in their skulls. The scene was eerie and devastating.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What exactly are these things?!” One of the Duanren Institute’s Saint realms blurted the question, the slight tremor in his voice unmistakable, pointing toward those carnivorous black beetles feasting on the dozen people.</span></p>
 <p><span>From afar, the place where the dozen people stood was like an island with the black beetles swarming in from every direction, covering the ground in a black mass of shiny critters, tens of thousands, millions, a terrifying and appalling sight.</span></p>
 <p><span>Duan Ren shook his head, he had never come across this black scarabs before.</span></p>
 <p><span>“These are probably Poison Corpse Scarabs from the ancient times.” It was Zhao Shu who spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span>Ancient times, Poison Corpse Scarabs!</span></p>
 <p><span>The rest of Huang Xiaolong’s group was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhao Shu went on, “These Poison Corpse Scarabs carry corpse poison all over their bodies, it only needs to bite you once and you will feel your entire body going numb. Furthermore, this kind of corpse poison could permeate into one’s Qi Sea, denying the victim the use of battle qi. These Poison Corpse Scarabs’ armor is extremely hard and difficult to break, the terrifying thing is, they do not fear even high-level Saint warriors’ battle flame.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Doesn’t that mean that these Poison Corpse Scarabs are nearly invincible?” The other Duanren Institute Saint realm warrior exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhao Shu shook his head, “It’s very difficult, unless you have some godly weapon that could hack them into halves. There was once a high-level Saint realm expert who was delusional enough to think of exterminating these Poison Corpse Scarabs relying on his strength, but in the end, he turned into food for these Poison Corpse Scarabs.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“High-level Saint realm expert turned into food for the Poison Corpse Scarabs!” Duan Ren was flabbergasted. The rest didn’t look so good either.</span></p>
 <p><span>In the short time that Zhao Shu spoke, several people in front stopped struggling and fell to the ground, leaving only the</span><i><span> ‘zhi zhi’</span></i><span> noises coming from their flesh being eaten by the scarabs.</span></p>
 <p><span>Suddenly, the swarm of Poison Corpse Beetles was stirred, turning around and moving in Huang Xiaolong’s direction.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhao Shu ashen, “Damn, they detected us, quickly run!”</span></p>
 <p><span>But just when everyone turned around, preparing to flee, Huang Xiaolong’s hands clenched into a fist, and the surrounding space was locked, barricading the Poison Corpse Scarabs. This was space manipulation.</span></p>
 <p><span>In the process of breaking into the Saint realm, Huang Xiaolong had his own comprehension of the space law.</span></p>
 <p><span>Yet Zhao Shu urged anxiously, “Young Lord, we must leave at once, space manipulation cannot stop these scarabs!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Sure enough, just as Zhao Shu’s last word fell, from the scarabs’ bodies, thick fumes of corpse poison were released and they broke free from Huang Xiaolong’s space confinement.</span></p>
