 <p><b>Chapter 39: Marshal’s Not In?</b></p>
 <p><span style>The Luo Tong Kingdom’s Marshal remained the same even after three generations of rulers and he had saved the Luo Tong Kingdom from disasters a few times. Because of this, he had an exalted status and he followed only one person’s order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was exempted from kneeling before the king and had supreme prestige in the military.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Fei Hou was stopped when he wanted to enter the Marshal Mansion: “Who dares to trespass into the Marshal’s Mansion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Hou didn’t say anything, but took out a gold plate. The soldier’s face changed drastically when he saw the gold plate; the arrogance he had on his face earlier vanished as he knelt down immediately, saluting, “I greet the Lord!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gold plate on Fei Hou’s hand was given to him by the Luo Tong Kingdom’s &nbsp;Marshal Haotian, more than a decade ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You may stand up. I want to see your Marshal.” Fei Hou said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldier stood up, and hesitated before he respectfully replied, “My Lord, The Marshal was summoned to the palace not long ago, and is currently not in the mansion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? He is not in?” Fei Hou’s brows wrinkled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is so, my Lord,” The soldier lowered his head when he answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Send someone to the palace now and inform the Marshal that his Junior Brother came to visit and will wait for him at the Delicious Restaurant!” said Fei Hou.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Junior Brother! </span></i><span style>The soldier didn’t expect that this ordinary-looking middle-aged man, who wore clothes no different from that of ordinary folks, would be the Marshal’s Junior Brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the soldiers stationed at the entrance hesitated to go to the palace to inform the Marshal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take my gold plate and go, I’ll take responsibility if anything happens! But, if you were to delay the matter, and something happens, your lives won’t be guaranteed!” Fei Hou threw the gold plate at the soldiers, and the Captain quickly rushed forward to catch it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, my Lord!” The Captain didn’t dare disagree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Hou turned around and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Fei Hou turned around and headed back to the Delicious Restaurant, Meng Chen, leading a group of experts from his mansion, had gotten to the Delicious Restaurant and bulldozed their way through the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the customers on the first floor were frightened and shocked when they saw Meng Chen and his men barge in aggressively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, it is Lord Duke, does the Duke have matters with our restaurant?” When the restaurant owner saw Meng Chen, he quickly went forward and asked politely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meng Chen ignored the owner and instead, he turned to a guard beside him, asking, “Are they upstairs?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Lord Duke!” the guard replied immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A cold glinted flashed across Meng Chen’s eyes, and his hands signaled the men behind him: “Rush up and surround the second floor, leave some of your guards below; not even a fly should be able to fly out of here!” He pushed the restaurant owner away and surrounded by his many experts, he rushed up to the second floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, that’s him! It’s that kid!” Shouted Meng Xia. They had just gotten to the second floor, and the bald Meng Xia instantly spotted Huang Xiaolong who was seated near the window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meng Chen was surprised when he noticed that Huang Xiaolong was alone, frowning he asked, “Where is the other one?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Duke, this is better! If we catch the younger one first, the older one certainly won’t escape!” said the Chief Steward, Xie Fei with a smile as he got to Meng Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong slowly stood up and looked coldly at the Duke’s Mansion guards and experts who had the second floor surrounded. Truth was, Huang Xiaolong had spotted them from the window as they made their way towards the Delicious Restaurant early on. But despite being surrounded by so many experts of the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and even some Tenth Order, he still wore a calm expression because he was confident that he could escape unharmed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong’s martial spirit’s supernatural talent – Space Concealment could last for ten breaths from the initial six breaths after he broke through to the Fourth Order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In ten breath’s of time, combined with Huang Xiaolong’s speed, he could vanish from Meng Chen’s sight without a trace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His gazed fell on the bald Meng Xia and snickered. “I didn’t expect that you would have the guts to show up, aren’t you afraid that I will cut off your scalp, layer by layer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meng Xia and the people with him were surprised; How could this kid still maintain his calmness before all of them? To the point where he even dared to say he would cut off Meng Xia’s scalp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anger followed surprise, and Meng Xia’s expression became ugly as he roared: “Cut off this kid’s arms and legs for me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Young Lord!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Seventh Order warriors dashed towards Huang Xiaolong, and just as one of the guard’s sword was about to slash down on Huang Xiaolong, a voice thundered from afar, saying, “Who dares hurt my Young Master!” The air seemed to ripple, and formed into a streak of lightning. The guards who had been struck by the lightning-like energy felt their bodies turn numb and they stopped moving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Hou, who went to the Marshal Mansion, had finally returned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While still at some distance to the restaurant, when Fei Hou saw the scene in Delicious Restaurant’s second floor, he used a battle skill that he hadn’t used in a long time – Sound of Lighting Fall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sound of Lightning Fall was similar to Li Mu’s Sky Lion’s Roar. However, Sound of Lightning Fall was a high-grade Mysterious rank battle skill, and its power was much stronger than Sky Lion Roar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When all the Seventh Orders guards were numbed from the lightning strike, the remaining experts of the Duke’s Mansion could see a Silver River (still far away) streaking towards them like silver lightning. It arrived before them in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Duke, careful!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heavenly Serpent Sword!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Border Fist!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>By this time, Fei Hou who had transformed into Silver River stood before them, and the Duke’s Mansion’s strongest experts, Mister First and Mister Second made their moves at the same time, launching fierce strikes at Fei Hou. A huge Heavenly Serpent appeared, jaws wide open intending to swallow Fei Hou; simultaneously a fist imprint also spun towards Fei Hou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, when both the Heavenly Serpent and the fist imprint hit Fei Hou, it was if they fell on a vast sea, and sunk into the depths of the sea without leaving any ripples.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Fei Hou’s Silver River continued to constrict the guards of the Duke’s Mansion. Agonizing screams echoed throughout the second floor for a moment before all the guards tumbled to the floor, painting the second floor’s floorboards red with their blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Fei Hou wasn’t as merciful like the first time, where he only cut off his opponent’s arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ignoring the fallen bodies, Fei Hou appeared beside Huang Xiaolong, but his eyes stared at Meng Xia like sharp blades.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he spared his opponents, however, he didn’t expect that they would gather the courage to retaliate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time round… Fei Hou’s icy-cold eyes zoomed towards Meng Xia’s scalp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, it’s him! He’s one who shaved off all my hair!” Seeing Fei Hou, Meng Xia shrieked with fear and hid behind the Duke’s Mansion’s two Tenth Order experts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The expressions of the two Tenth Order experts from the Duke’s Mansion were somewhat ugly. Their combined attacked just now was actually unable to stop Fei Hou; this meant that Fei Hou was a peak late-Tenth Order warrior!</span></p>
 <p><span style>One had to know that one of them was late-Tenth Order, while the other was peak-mid Tenth Order!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meng Chen stared at the bodies of his guards fallen on the floor, feeling fear and shock at the same moment. “You, you dared to kill this Duke’s guards?!”</span></p>
