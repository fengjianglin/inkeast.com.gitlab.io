 <p><strong>Chapter 384: Twelve Forms of the Dragon God&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><span>Although Huang Xiaolong lacked the capability to oppose the mammoth called Deities Templar in terms of overall strength, he would find ways to curb their forces’ expansion. A sharp glint flickered in his eyes and he summoned Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Sovereign, what orders do you have for your subordinates?” Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu respectfully asked when they stood in front of Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong’s voice was somber, “Relay my order, any family, kingdom, or sects on Snow Wind Continent and Starcloud Continent that submitted to Deities Templar is my enemy. I, Huang Xiaolong, am bound to annihilate them!” At the end, killing intent exploded in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>Once this news spread out, those forces harboring thoughts of submitting to Deities Templar would need to think twice and more before doing so.</span></p>
 <p><span>If Huang Xiaolong had said this in the past, these families’ Patriarchs, sects, and kingdoms would have treated it as passing wind, however, after the incident in Luo Tong Kingdom, where Huang Xiaolong killed seven Deities Templar Elders, no one would dare claim that Huang Xiaolong was overreaching.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Yes, Sovereign!” Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu complied in unison.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong waved his hand, sending Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu out.</span></p>
 <p><span>There were many Asura’s Gate disciples on the Snow Wind Continent itself, Huang Xiaolong believed that his declaration would spread to the ears of these forces soon.</span></p>
 <p><span>After Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu retreated, Huang Xiaolong entered the Xumi Temple.</span></p>
 <p><span>Inside the Xumi Temple, the twelve primordial divine dragon corpses were still sealed inside the crystal pillars, lined up at one side of the temple hall.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong observed these twelve primordial divine dragons, each of them was different. Every time Huang Xiaolong observed their postures, he would gain some insight into a skill.</span></p>
 <p><span>Lined up in a row, these twelve primordial divine dragons’ postures revealed a Dragon Clan unique skill. This was Huang Xiaolong’s conclusion after studying these twelve crystal dragon statues for so long, which was why Huang Xiaolong was in no hurry to refine them. It wouldn’t be too late to do so after he learned the hidden skill.</span></p>
 <p><span>Moreover, in one of the old records that he read in Duanren Institute, it was mentioned that the energy force contained within primordial divine dragons’ true dragon essence and dragon blood was too huge and violent, warriors below the God Realm wanting to refine them should &nbsp;prepare and first take Dragon God Grass.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Dragon God Grass could calm the energy contained inside the primordial divine dragon’s true dragon essence and blood, greatly reducing the risk during the process. It also noted that the effect was even better with the Dragon God Grass.</span></p>
 <p><span>Thus, Huang Xiaolong had decided to wait until he procured some Dragon God Grass. This was one of the tasks he gave Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu, to search for Dragon God Grass’ whereabouts.</span></p>
 <p><span>After observing the twelve dragons’ postures for a while, Huang Xiaolong closed his eyes, the postures of the twelve dragons flashed repeatedly in his mind. The images overlapped and changed in sequence.</span></p>
 <p><span>With his eyes still closed, Huang Xiaolong began to move, both hands formed into claws, flexing out. From claws, they turned to palms, pressing down. Huang Xiaolong’s hands moved and changed with fluidity and flow, filling the large hall with looming claw imprints, palm imprints, and fist imprints. As his movements picked up speed, faint echoes of dragon roars reverberated throughout the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span>Several hours later, Huang Xiaolong was still practicing with his eyes closed, yet the dragon echoes within the temple hall grew more sonorous. Suddenly, Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes. With a shake of his arms, two dragon shadows flew out.</span></p>
 <p><span>These two dragon shadows mimicked the fire dragon and ice dragon sealed inside the crystal statues. The instant the fire and ice dragons appeared, the overbearing momentum of dragon might filled the entire space.</span></p>
 <p><span>A brief moment later, both dragons turned into strands of dragon qi, returning to Huang Xiaolong’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong was elated. The short moment of insight earlier enhanced his battle qi and true essence energy worth months of cultivation. This set of Dragon Clan’s unique skill could actually enhance one’s battle qi strength?</span></p>
 <p><span>Pondering for a moment, Huang Xiaolong decided to name this skill Twelve Forms of the Dragon God.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>‘Pity, the remaining twelve crystal statues were looted by Deities Templar, Ten Directions Continent, and the Bedlam Lands.’</span></em><span>&nbsp;Huang Xiaolong lamented a little in his heart. The complete set of this unique skill was contained in all twenty-four primordial divine dragon corpses. No doubt, its power would magnify if he could learn the complete set.</span></p>
 <p><span>He continued to observe and practice for a while, and then sat down to meditate, swallowing a Sky Dragon Pill.</span></p>
 <p><span>His cultivation had been progressing steadily in recent days, and there was a feeling that he was close to breaking into Fourth Order Saint realm.</span></p>
 <p><span>Breaking into Fourth Order Saint realm meant that he was a mid-level Saint realm expert, it was a dividing line. Once Huang Xiaolong crossed over the line, his strength would take another great leap forward. One of Huang Xiaolong’s aim was to break through to Fourth Order Saint realm before arriving at Asura’s Gate headquarters. This would add to his chances of fighting for the Asura’s Gate Sovereign position.</span></p>
 <p><span>When Huang Xiaolong had fully refined the Sky Dragon Pill, he exited the Godly Mt. Xumi. Outside was already bright, and the palace buildings reflected the dazzling morning sunlight, shining like a golden dome.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong admired the sunrise, quiet, beautiful, and magnificent. If time was to stop at this moment, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t mind. However, this feeling lasted no more than a fleeting thought, for he knew that it was not possible.</span></p>
 <p><span>At this time, one of the giant puppets came to inform Huang Xiaolong that Princess Shi Xiaofei was here to visit.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Let her in.” Huang Xiaolong instructed, but he was baffled, why was this Shi Xiaofei coming to see him?</span></p>
 <p><span>It didn’t take long for the giant puppet to return with Shi Xiaofei behind it.</span></p>
 <p><span>Today, Shi Xiaofei wore a pastel green long dress, her small cherry lips looked moist and tender. She had exquisite features, a natural beauty even without any makeup. Her mirthful eyes hinted at shyness, one couldn’t help but be moved seeing her.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong was stunned momentarily at Shi Xiaofei’s appearance. When Shi Xiaofei stood in front of him, a soft scent teased Huang Xiaolong’s senses, waking him up.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong laughed at himself, it seems like his temperament was not strong enough?</span></p>
 <p><span>“What matter does Princess have to look for me?” Huang Xiaolong took the initiated to ask.</span></p>
 <p><span>Shi Xiaofei looked at Huang Xiaolong, the corners of her lips lifted up slightly, “Does it mean that I cannot look for you if there are no matters?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong choked a little, shook his head saying, “Not true.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Why don’t you just call me Xiaofei?” Shi Xiaofei hesitated a little before speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span>Xiaofei? Huang Xiaolong nodded, he was Shi Fantian’s Junior Brother, there was nothing wrong in referring Shi Xiaofei by her given name.</span></p>
 <p><span>Shi Xiaofei’s eyes brightened seeing Huang Xiaolong’s agreement, “Big brother Xiaolong, are you going to Starcloud Continent?”</span></p>
 <p><span><span>Big brother Xiaolong? <a href="#footnote-1" id="footnoteref-1">[1]</a> Huang Xiaolong blanked for a moment, but he still nodded, “Yes, no matter what, this time I must win the Asura’s gate Sovereign position.” Rumors about this had been flying for months, thus there was nothing to be concealed.</span></span></p>
 <p><span>“Can you bring me along?”Shi Xiaofei asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Bring you along?” Huang Xiaolong was taken by surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Up until now I have never stepped out of the Blessed Buddha Empire, I also want to go to Starcloud Continent to have a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong disagreed, “No.” The journey he was making to Starcloud Continent was littered with danger, if something unexpected happened to Shi Xiaofei, how should he account to his Senior Brother Shi Fantian?</span></p>
 <p><span>“You’re afraid that I will be a burden?” Shi Xiaofei persuaded, “I’m already a Saint realm expert, I can protect myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong was adamant, speaking with a finality in his tone, “Don’t bring up this matter anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Shi Xiaofei pouted, looking extremely lovable and hard to refuse, but despite that, Huang Xiaolong did not change his decision. Watching Shi Xiaofei’s angelic angry expression, Huang Xiaolong laughed inside, thinking of Xie Puti. If that guy knew that he had just rejected Shi Xiaofei, it was unknown know how long that guy would cry ‘unjust’, hitting his chest.</span></p>
