 <p><b>Chapter 220: Yao Manor’s Annihilation</b></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the secret chamber, the several Yao Manor guards faces turned ashen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s happening?!” The first guard whose eyes leered over Su Yan and Huang Min licentiously&nbsp;jumped to his feet in panic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another resounding crash rang out as if answering his question. Violent tremors ran through the ground beneath their feet. The Yao Manor guards were surprised to see the secret chamber that was made out of one of the most adamant steel, splintered inch by inch as cracks spread out like a spider-web.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, the cries of many Yao Manor servants and guards begging for mercy rang out crisp and clear in their eardrums.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guards within the secret chamber exchanged a look amongst themselves and saw fear reflected in each other’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although they could not see what was happening outside, even a fool could guess that Yao Manor was under attack!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Duanren Empire’s hegemony family that had a heritage of more than two thousand years was actually under attack!</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was denial in their hearts, refusing to believe what was happening. Yet, another loud explosion hammered into their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Outside, Huang Xiaolong watched the fleeing servants and guards of Yao Manor from midair with a calm expression. He asked Zhao Shu, “How is it? Can you sense them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Shu, who was utilizing space manipulation to detect Huang Peng, Su Yan, and the rest’s presence opened his eyes with a gladdened expression. Answering Huang Xiaolong’s question, he said, “Young Lord, just now when Subordinate cast the power of space, I sensed House Master Huang’s presence. They are held in a secret chamber at the north corner of Yao Manor!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong’s face lit up at this news, “Is that true?! Great, let’s head there now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His parents and siblings were really being locked up in Yao Manor by Yao Fei!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong’s hanging heart finally relaxed somewhat. If any mishap happened to Huang Peng, Su Yan, or his little siblings, he would carry a heavy guilt for the rest of his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Next, Zhao Shu flew, leading Huang Xiaolong and the rest towards the secret chamber that was located at the northern corner of Yao Manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the chamber, the guards looked at each other. Due to Zhang Fu and Zhao Shu halting their attacks, the noises outside died down just as abruptly as they started.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do we do now?” The skinny and slightly taller guard asked in a grave tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first guard said, “It should be some small characters thinking they could shake our Yao Manor. Our experts must have dealt with them, there’s nothing for us to worry about!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right, with our Yao Manor’s power and strength, not even Duan Ren dares to act brazenly. What are we frightening ourselves for?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at this point, the tied-up Huang Min snickered, “My big brother’s here, no doubt about it. Your end is near!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The licentious guard was angered by Huang Min’s words, he stomped right in front of her and the back of his hand flew across her face, “Motherf*cker, you think that I don’t dare touch you? Believe it or not, I’ll strip every thread from your body and play with you till you beg for mercy! Your big brother came to rescue you? Hmph, stop daydreaming. It’s more likely that your big brother’s been squashed to death by our Young Noble!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as his voice ended, an icy voice sounded from somewhere in the vicinity, “Oh really?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was so abrupt that everyone was startled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who?!” The several Yao Manor guards shouted almost instantaneously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sturdy chamber door was blasted open by someone with their bare hand, revealing several figures in the light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Long’er!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big brother!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Peng, Su Yan, Huang Min, and Huang Xiaohai cried out in joy when seeing the faces of these people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ‘guests’ were none other than Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and the rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong stepped into the dim chamber, his eyes scanned around the room and stopped on Huang Min’s face-or precisely, the handprint on her face. His chilling gaze then fell onto the several Yao Manor guards, “How do you want to die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Shu, Yu Ming and Fei Hou hurried over to Huang Peng and the rest, snapping the thick golden rope that bound them. While they were doing this, one of the Yao Manor guards lunged out, aiming an attack at Huang Xiaolong’s chest. However, with a flick of Zhao Shu’s sleeve, that guard was akin to a broken plank in the stormy sea after jumping mere inches off the ground, crashing into a chamber wall. When the guard fell to the floor, all his bones and internal organs were crushed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The remaining Yao Manor guards had shadows of death clouding their faces, they were petrified with fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huang Xiaolong, you actually dared to attack our Yao Manor?! Wait till our Young Noble and Ancestor arrive, I’ll see how you can escape!” One of the guards tried to bolster his courage by attempting to intimidate Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the guards shouted his words so confidently, Yu Ming, Fei Hou, and the others couldn’t help breaking into a laugh. Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu too were shaking their heads with a sheepish smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Ming looked at that Yao Manor guard, “Your Young Noble and Ancestor? If it weren’t because your Young Noble and Ancestor’s legs were longer than most, allowing them to run that much faster, we’d have slit their throats long ago. Tsk, to still dream of relying on your dog fart shit Noble and Ancestor...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That guard was stupefied. Their Young Noble and Ancestor fled?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, impossible!” His companions refuted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong didn’t care to debate nonsense with these people, signaling Yu Ming with a look. Yu Ming understood and nodded. Approaching the several guards, he ended their lives with a palm strike straight to their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they fell to the ground, none were breathing, and their bodies turned soylent green on the surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father, Mother-” Huang Xiaolong approached Huang Peng and Su Yan, opening his mouth, wanting to say something. Su Yan cut him off: “Xiaolong, we’re fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, Huang Xiaolong nodded quietly. Concealing the slight redness in his eyes, he turned around. Eyes glowing red with fierce bloodlust, he commanded: “Kill!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes Young Lord!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few hours later, the Yao Manor that had been standing in Duanren Imperial City for over a thousand years suddenly crumbled to the ground, ruined. All of Yao Manor’s guards were killed, including the main and side branch families left behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Yao Family had a foundation dating back two thousand years. In Duanren Empire, its existence as one of the hegemony families was truer than gold. Yet, at this moment, the main symbol of the Yao Family, the Yao Manor, was scraped off Duanren Empire’s Imperial City landmark forever!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Emperor Duanren, Duan Wuhen, empire experts, and the Duanren Institute students and teachers who came to Yao Manor following Huang Xiaolong sighed as they watched the ruin of Yao Manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for Guo Shiwen, Guo Chen, and all the Guo Family members, they were breaking out into cold sweat profusely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it weren’t for Guo Tai’s engagement to Huang Xiaolong’s younger sister, perhaps Guo Mansion’s ending would be the same as the Yao Manor in front of them—desolate ruins.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Very quickly, the news about Yao Fei and Ancestor Yao fleeing, along with Yao Manor’s destruction, spread like an enormous hurricane throughout the entire Duanren Empire. When the over one thousand fealty kingdoms under it found out, the news shocked countless families and forces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And the Saint realm experts’ battle within Duanren Institute became a hot topic for the commoners for a very long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Yao Manor’s demise, Huang Xiaolong’s name traveled far and wide to every corner of Duanren Empire. Every kingdom within Duanren Empire, every big and small family, and every big and small sect knew of this name.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong, an existence that even Emperor Duanren needed to show respect and courtesy to!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deep in the night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong stood in his yard, his brows locking together tightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he managed to bring his family back safely and he destroyed Yao Manor, Yao Fei and Yao Shan escaped. The person who appeared at the end that took Yao Fei away should be Ao Baixue’s Master, who was also Lin Molin’s Senior Apprentice Brother. If even Ao Baixue’s Master had come to rescue Yao Fei, it could easily be seen how deep the connection was between the Yao Family and Deities Templar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Lu.” Huang Xiaolong inevitably thought of Li Lu.</span></p>
