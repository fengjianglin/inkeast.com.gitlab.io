 <p><b>Chapter 376: Still Soft Tofu?</b></p>
 <p><span>Chen Luoguang? Watching the surrounding customers’ reaction, Huang Xiaolong guessed that this so-called Chen Luoguang’s status wasn’t low.</span></p>
 <p><span>Chen Family? Suddenly, something flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s mind, this Chen Luoguang was most likely the same Chen Family’s disciple. Chen Family, one of Blessed Buddha Empire’s super families, parallel with the Yao and Xie Families in Duanren Empire.</span></p>
 <p><span>That year, when Huang Xiaolong was here in search of the Godly Mt. Xumi, during the Blessed Buddha Altar’s baptism with Buddhism energy, he came across a Chen Family disciple, Chen Dingyuan.</span></p>
 <p><span>At that time, Chen Dingyuan was jealous of Huang Xiaolong being chosen by the Blessed Buddha Altar and sneakily shot poisonous needles at Huang Xiaolong in the dark, but failed. Later, after Huang Xiaolong found the Godly Mt. Xumi, he paid a visit to the Chen Mansion and killed Chen Dingyuan before leaving the Blessed Buddha Empire.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Who is Chen Dingyuan to you?” Huang Xiaolong looked at Chen Luoguang, asking out of nowhere.</span></p>
 <p><span>Chen Luoguang dazed for a moment, he didn’t expect the young man would ask this question.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Cheng Dingyuan is my younger brother.” Chen Luoguang added, “Since you know my younger brother, to give him face, I will give you a chance.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Judging from his attitude, it seemed he thought Huang Xiaolong and Cheng Dingyuan was an associate of his brother’s.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong revealed a little smile hearing that, “What chance?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Chen Luoguang said, “What I hate most is others pretending to be cool in front of me!” In his eyes, Huang Xiaolong’s purpose in bringing two such giant guards outside with him was nothing more than showing off. Watching others showing off in front of him only soured his good mood. He proudly pointed a finger at one of the guards behind him saying, “As long as the two guards behind you can accept one attack from my guard, I will let you go.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong shrugged shoulders nonchalantly, “What if my guards receive your guard’s one palm unharmed?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Chen Luoguang couldn’t resist exposing a smirk at Huang Xiaolong’s question, he looked over to the back at his guard, “This kid just said that his two soft tofu guards can easily take your attack.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The guards around Chen Luoguang chuckled sinisterly.</span></p>
 <p><span>The guard Chen Luoguang selected earlier stepped out from the group, looking at Huang Xiaolong with a haughty expression. An abrupt surge of energy erupted from his body, enveloping the restaurant, alarming the customer crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Such a terrifying aura, a Xiantian Tenth Order expert?!” Inside the restaurant, a high-level Xiantian expert exclaimed out loud.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Xiantian Tenth Order expert!” The rest was astonished by this revelation.</span></p>
 <p><span>The fatty that intended to buy Huang Xiaolong’s two giant puppets was so astonished that he hastily moved far away from Huang Xiaolong, seeking safety at the side in case disaster befell fish of the same pond, angering Chen Luoguang.</span></p>
 <p><span>Listening to the surprised exclamations coming from all around, Chen Luoguang’s ego ballooned. In this trip to the Blessed Buddha City with the family's Elders, they had arranged six high-level Xiantian realm experts at his side as guards, amongst them were two Xiantian Tenth Order experts.</span></p>
 <p><span>What a Xiantian Tenth Order expert represented, he and everyone present were well aware of.</span></p>
 <p><span>Chen Luoguang spoke, “That’s right, Xiantian Tenth Order expert, moreover, he’s a mid-Xiantian Tenth Order.” Responding to the crowd’s awed reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Mid-Xiantian Tenth Order!” Another wave of exhilarating gasps sounded.</span></p>
 <p><span>Chen Luoguang looked at Huang Xiaolong, “How about it? Do you still think that your two soft tofu guards can take one palm from my guard? I’ve already said early on, born stalwart doesn’t mean anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong was too lazy to bother with so much nonsense, he signaled one of the giant puppets with a look. The giant puppet stepped forward to face the Chen Luoguang’s guard.</span></p>
 <p><span>Seeing this, Chen Luoguang snickered, “Kid, I would advise you let both of your guards attack together, otherwise it would be too late for regret later.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The giant puppet came to a stand in front of Chen Luoguang’s guard, yet Chen Luoguang’s guard stood condescendingly hugging his arms, “Well, I’ll let you make the first move.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The instant his voice ended, the giant puppet raised its hand, slamming down the guard’s head, and Chen Luoguang’s guard looked like he was dumbfounded, standing there without dodging.</span></p>
 <p><span>The giant puppet’s attack connected in one strike. In the blink of an eye, a tragic scream rendered the air.</span></p>
 <p><span>The crowd inhaled sharply at the scene before them, Chen Luoguang’s Xiantian Tenth Order guard was driven into the ground with a single palm! From the neck down, the guard’s body was inserted into the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span>As for the guard’s head, it exploded from the impact, blood, bones and gray matter splattered in the air, staining Chen Luoguang’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span>A mere palm killed a mid-Xiantian Tenth Order!</span></p>
 <p><span>The crowd’s eyes nearly fell from their sockets looking at the giant puppet.</span></p>
 <p><span>Things indeed happened as Chen Luoguang predicted, dead with a single palm! However, the positions between the two sides shifted.</span></p>
 <p><span>A heavy silence filled the restaurant, to the point that dripping water sounded louder than one’s heartbeat.</span></p>
 <p><span>Eyes filled with fear and worship looked at the giant puppet. Able to kill a mid-Xiantian Tenth Order with just a slap, half-Saint expert?! Only half-Saint experts, the existence closest to the revered Saint realm had that ability!</span></p>
 <p><span>Of course, no one dared to imagine that the giant puppet had Saint realm strength. In the entire Blessed Buddha Empire, the number of Saint realm experts could be counted on one hand. Even so, half-Saint experts were a strong deterring force.</span></p>
 <p><span>At this point, a drop of blood rolled down Chen Luoguang’s face across his eyes lid, down to the corner of his mouth. Raising a hand to wipe the warm liquid away, staring at his hand, other than red blood, there was some sticky gray matter sticking to his finger, nausea rose up in Chen Luoguang.</span></p>
 <p><span>Looking at the wrinkly white sticky stuff, Chen Luoguang didn’t react at first, it was a second later did it strike him; brain?!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Ah—!” The color drained from Chen Luoguang’s face as he jumped back, screaming at the top of his lungs as if someone hammered his buttocks with a steel hammer.</span></p>
 <p><span>As he jumped away, Chen Luoguang frantically wiped his face, with a swipe, pieces of the same white sticky stuff smudged his hands, making him scream again and again.</span></p>
 <p><span>He was fastidious toward personal hygiene. From childhood until now, he had never encountered anything like this.</span></p>
 <p><span>Watching Chen Luoguang jumping around shrieking like a woman, Huang Xiaolong sneered and got up. Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu followed.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong walked up to Chen Luoguang.</span></p>
 <p><span>Chen Luoguang was still screaming. When he saw Huang Xiaolong approaching, he stopped jumping and started to retreat in panic, “You, what do you want to do?” Looking the part of a frightened little girl and not some suave young noble.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Is my guard still soft tofu?” Huang Xiaolong asked, his expression deadpan.</span></p>
 <p><span>“No, no, he’s not!” Chen Luoguang frantically waved his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span>One of Chen Luoguang’s Xiantian realm guards stepped in between Chen Luoguang and Huang Xiaolong, shielding Chen Luoguang and saying, “This brother, our Young Lord is Chen Family’s successor, this time we came to the Blessed Buddha City with our Patriarch and two Grand Elders. Our Patriarch and both Grand Elders are Saint realm experts, at the moment they’re guests at Tai Gan Prince Palace. How about we end this matter at this point?”</span></p>
 <p><span>The guard’s words sounded polite, but the underlying threat to Huang Xiaolong was clear as day. In short, if something happened to their Young Lord, their Patriarch and two Grand Elders were in this Blessed Buddha City, Huang Xiaolong wouldn't be able to escape.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong sneered coldly at the guard’s threat.</span></p>
 <p><span>One of the giant puppets took a large stride forward, one palm slammed forth, striking the guard’s chest. It was too quick for him to defend and the guard’s body flew out, when the guard fell to the street outside, his chest was blasted open, no longer breathing.</span></p>
 <p><span>Chen Luoguang turned even paler watching this, stammering, “Brother, for my younger brother’s sake, don’t, don’t kill me.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Hearing the other side bringing up Chen Dingyuan, Huang Xiaolong sneered; this Chen Luoguang really thought that he is friends with that Chen Dingyuan.</span></p>
