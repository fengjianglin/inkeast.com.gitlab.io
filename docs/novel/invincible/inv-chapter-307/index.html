 <p><b>Chapter 307: Ghost City Appeared</b></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chen, who was in the midst of attacking Huang Xiaolong, was stunned by the surreal giant fist imprints overcasting the sky, a thought struck his mind at lightning speed…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘This…! This seems like the rumored legendary Great Void Divine World’s Great Void Divine Fist!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The blue flames emitted from Zhao Chen’s body transformed into blue flowers, blossoming in the air. From afar, it was a mesmerizing view.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Void Divine Fist imprints crashed into the many blossoms of blue flame flowers. One by one the flowers were destroyed, blasted into smithereens, yet once again they blossomed, filling the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sparks and flames flew in every direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chen stood in midair, fixing a deadly stare at Huang Xiaolong: “The move you made just now, was it the Great Void Divine Fist?!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Great Void Divine Fist! That was a top-grade battle skill from the Great Void Divine World!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As Sin City’s Young Lord, Zhao Chen lacked neither cultivation techniques nor battle skills, however, he did not possess something of the same grade as the mythical Great Void Divine Fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong didn’t expect Zhao Chen to recognize the Great Void Divine Fist, but he did not conceal it, “Correct.” There was nothing to conceal after all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hand over the Great Void Divine Fist technique, I can make a concession, letting you die more comfortably!” Zhao Chen’s eyes were burning with desire.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘The Great Void Divine Fist, it was really the Great Void Divine Fist!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong sneered sarcastically. In a split second, a vertical slit appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s forehead, the Eye of Hell opened, shooting out two crimson red light beams. Zhao Chen suddenly felt something impacting his mind, causing him to go blank.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Blades of Asura appeared in Huang Xiaolong’ hands and quickly swung out. Two grand blade lights flew out, similar to volcano eruption awakened after a millennium of slumber, like a stampede of a million beasts, a storm covering the Nine Heavens, arriving in front of Zhao Chen faster than the eye could blink.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asura Sword Skill’s third move: Wrath of the Nether King!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chen’s clarity recovered almost instantly, however, the Wrath of the Never King already penetrated through his blue flames, aiming for his heart. But before the blade lights could pierce his skin, a blinding light burst forth from Zhao Chen’s body. A large blue-colored black hole emerged, blocking the attack, when the blades lights fell into the black hole, it was no different from droplets of water swallowed by the vast sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed. Saint realm’s space!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When one advanced into the Saint realm, they were able to manipulate the Laws of Space and an individual space would open in the Saint realm warrior’s Qi Sea. Facing an enemy in battle, a Saint realm expert could summon that space from the Qi Sea into the real world, both for attack and defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chen looked at Huang Xiaolong with mockery in his eyes, “Huang Xiaolong, with this level of attack you expect to penetrate through my defense? I’ll open your eyes now to the real extent of the gap between a Saint realm and a Xiantian!” Exuberant battle qi surged profusely, the blue glow around the Saint realm space before Zhao Chen shook the heavens, releasing a terrifying heat that enveloped Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before the heat wave arrived, Huang Xiaolong felt like he was about to turn into ashes at any moment, even with the toughness of his physical body, it was difficult for him to truly withstand the scorching heat. If he was really hit by this hot wave, he would very likely be turned into gray ashes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong did not dally or hesitate, with a leap, he vanished from the spot. At the same time that Huang Xiaolong vanished, Qin Yang, Lifei, Jie Dong, and Fen Encheng also disappeared where they stood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>....</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moments later, the sound of Zhao Chen’s enraged roar reverberated in the entire City of Myriad Gods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Search, get that kid in front of me even if you have to flip over the whole Bedlam Lands!” Blue flames danced wildly, turning everything inside the courtyard to ashes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Half an hour later, on a small hill a hundred miles outside the City of Myriad Gods, Huang Xiaolong’s group of five appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he had broken through to Xiantian Tenth Order, Huang Xiaolong knew that with his current level of strength he was far from being able to defeat a Saint realm expert. The previous battle with Zhao Chen was a mere test to gauge where he stood against an actual early Saint realm expert.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Comparatively, in terms of strength and defense, he was of a lower rung. Of course, Huang Xiaolong had the Space Concealment and Phantom Shadow martial abilities, Zhao Chen couldn’t really harm him if he truly wanted to run. Furthermore, Huang Xiaolong did not display the Godly Xumi Art, soul transform with his twin dragon martial spirits nor bring out the Godly Mt. Xumi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He realized that he didn’t have enough strength for self-preservation if rumors about him having the Godly Xumi Art and Godly Mt. Xumi were made known.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘There’s no other way but to break into the Saint realm as soon as possible.’</span></i><span style> Huang Xiaolong thought to himself. Once he broke through to the Saint realm, defeating Zhao Chen was only a matter of a breath’s time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Huang Xiaolong was contemplating all these things, the four, Qin Yang, and the rest stood quietly behind him, but in truth, great waves of shock were hitting their hearts. Qin Yang initially assumed that, at most, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation would rise to peak late-Xiantian Eighth Order from the last adventure, never did he imagine that Huang Xiaolong could battle with an early Saint realm expert like Zhao Chen and still retreat safely!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Recalling the scenes of Huang Xiaolong battling Zhao Chen one after another, their emotions could hardly calm down even after a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This… had far exceeded their scope of imagination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I asked you to investigate that Yao Fei, what’s the result?” At this point, Huang Xiaolong suddenly looked at them and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Huang Xiaolong left the City of Myriad Gods, he ordered the four to keep an eye on Yao Fei. Due to Zhao Chen and his men’s interference earlier, Huang Xiaolong hadn’t had the opportunity to ask until this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Yang was pulled out of his trance, quickly stepping forward to answer, “Young Lord, according to our investigation, that Yao Fei headed to the Ghost Domain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ghost Domain?” Huang Xiaolong’s brows creased into furrows, </span><i><span style>‘What is this Yao Fei doing, going to the Ghost Domain?’</span></i><span style> Huang Xiaolong knew of the Ghost Domain, being one of the largest forbidden lands in the Bedlams, mostly occupied by ghosts and evil spirits. The lower level Xiantian warriors that entered the Ghost Domain would only end up as nourishment for those ghosts and evil spirits. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even some early Saint realm experts needed to think twice before venturing deeper into the Ghost Domain. In the deeper parts of Ghost Domain lived demons that had been alive for several thousand years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These evil spirits had evolved into demons, each one had earth-shaking power, some even comparable to high-levels of human Saint realm experts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Replying to Young Lord, according to the rumors, a Ghost City would appear above the Ghost Domain in the near future, this subordinate’s guess is that Yao Fei’s objective in the Ghost Domain might be the Ghost City that is about to appear.” Lifei stepped up, reporting the information.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ghost City?” Huang Xiaolong was slightly baffled, he had heard of the Ghost Domain, but not about a Ghost City. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Ghost City is a time old city left behind by one of the six ancient kings, named after the Ghost King himself, appearing only once every thousand years. Inside, the Ghost City is rumored to store many rare treasures, from cultivation techniques, top battle skills, spirit pellets and elixirs, even magical weapons, armors, and the like crafted by divine level craftsmen during the ancient era. Every time the Ghost City appears, warriors from all over the Bedlam Lands would rush to seize this opportunity.” Qin Yang explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong’s eyes flickered with anticipation. This came as a surprise for him, he didn’t expect that something like the Ghost City was left behind by the Ghost King. During the ancient era, six ancient kings ruled the earth, each one of them a tyrannical hegemony that covered one direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amongst the six ancient kings, the Ghost King was considered the most mysterious of all and the most impalpable, commanding a ghost army of billions; his own body was part human, part ghost, and part God. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Interesting.” Huang Xiaolong merely uttered a single word. Originally, he planned to return to Black Demon City and start his move of conquering the Blood River City as well as the surrounding cities. However, since he coincidentally chanced upon the appearance of the Ghost City, he should definitely take a look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you return to Blood River City first, I’ll make a trip to the Ghost Domain. We’ll attack the Five Poison Cult when I return.” Huang Xiaolong commanded solemnly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The four of them dared not disobey Huang Xiaolong’s order, each answered with the utmost respect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a step, Huang Xiaolong’s silhouette disappeared in front of them in a blur.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say, do you think the Young Lord is a Heaven God’s reincarnation?” Sending Huang Xiaolong away with her gaze, Lifei suddenly spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was an old legend in the Martial Spirit World that every ten thousand years, a human reincarnation of a Heaven God would appear. Qin Yang and the other three exchanged a look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let us go.” Qin Yang said after a while. Hence, the group of four flew off in the direction of Blood River City.</span></p>
