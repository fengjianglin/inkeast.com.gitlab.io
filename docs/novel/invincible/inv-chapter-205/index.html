 <p><b>Chapter 205: Are You Alright?</b></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Zhi spun around to see the person who spoke and then his body instantly stiffened. The anger on his face dissipated like a puff of smoke but he failed to smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A person wearing a golden-yellow robe embroidered with eight mighty yellow dragons strided towards him. It was none other than Duan Wuhen, and he had a group of the Institute's top students behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lackeys who were standing behind Guo Zhi and Guo Fei turned ashen with fright when they saw Duan Wuhen, immediately falling to a salute: "Greeting to His Second Imperial Prince Highness!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Wuhen's expression looked frosty as he stopped in front of Guo Zhi, "What did you say just now?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fear and trepidation rose in the hearts of the brothers and their lackeys.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Misunderstanding, it was a misunderstanding, that is, just now was a misunderstanding!" Guo Zhi forced a smile while waving his hands frantically, "I did not realize it was you. If I knew, how would I dare?! I wouldn't!" He did feel that the voice sounded familiar, but he did not link it to Duan Wuhen. If he honestly knew earlier, even if he was dealing with the pain of a gallstone, he wouldn't dare snap at Duan Wuhen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Wuhen's eyes were like sharp blades as they swept across both brothers' faces. And before Guo Zhi and Guo Fei's frightful faces, he walked over and came to a stop in front of Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of Huang Xiaolong, the difference on Duan Wuhen's expression was like night and day. He then asked Huang Xiaolong with a blooming smile: "Brother Xiaolong, are you alright?"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Brother Xiaolong, are you alright!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone around felt like they were struck with heavenly lightning from the ninth heaven, each person turning dazed and stiff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Zhi and Guo Fei's eyes were wide-eyed with shock as they stared at Second Imperial Prince Duan Wuhen with disbelief. What did the Second Imperial Prince Duan Wuhen say just now? Brother Xiaolong? He, he actually called Huang Xiaolong… brother?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Wuhen's voice sounded again, "They did not frighten you, right?" Just as the question came out, Duan Wuhen hurried to explain himself, "No, no, no, what I meant was, did they disturb you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Watching the flustered manner Duan Wuhen displayed while trying to explain to Huang Xiaolong, the Guo Brothers felt their knees become so weak that it was as if they were about to blackout.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the while the rest of the people in the surrounding area, including the top students who arrived with Duan Wuhen were stunned, their faces agape. </span></p>
 <p><span style>What situation was this?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Wuhen was Duanren Empire's Second Imperial Prince, and Huang Xiaolong? If comparing identities, Huang Xiaolong was only an ordinary new student of the institute!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone’s minds went blank, unable to figure out what was happening right in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'm alright." Huang Xiaolong said to Duan Wuhen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next moment, the crowd saw Duan Wuhen seemingly breathe in relief at Huang Xiaolong's answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Initially, Duan Wuhen wanted to refer to Huang Xiaolong as 'Young Noble' as per his father, Duanren Emperor’s order, but Huang Xiaolong was concerned it would be too shocking if others heard it. Hence, he suggested Duan Wuhen call him brother when in public. Even so, it was enough to jarr Guo Zhi and Guo Fei to the core.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Brother Xiaolong, in your opinion, how shall we deal with them?" </span></p>
 <p><span style>The eyes of the crowd couldn't help but look at Huang Xiaolong while Huang Xiaolong looked at Guo Zhi and Guo Fei, causing the brothers' hearts to tighten with unease.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong strode slowly towards the frightful brothers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huang, Huang, Huang!" Guo Zhi panicked, stammering as he tried to speak yet no words seemed right. After all, Duan Wuhen called him brother, and it didn't seem as though he was qualified to call Huang Xiaolong ‘brother’ the same way Duan Wuhen did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Fei wasn't faring much better than Guo Zhi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stopping before them, Huang Xiaolong's words were icy, "I already gave you a chance yesterday."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The color drained from Guo Zhi and Guo Fei's already pale faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But in the next moment Guo Zhi suddenly fell to his knees sobbing, "Brother Xiaolong, it's our wrong. Please give us another chance!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Right, right, we won't dare antagonize you anymore in the future!" Guo Fei followed suit and fell on his knees, begging desperately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Pity, it's too late." Huang Xiaolong's cold voice cut through the sobbing cries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Zhi and Guo Fei froze, then when they wanted to say something more, Huang Xiaolong's palm snaked out and struck squarely on their chests. The Guo Brothers wailed as their body arched in the air then fell to the ground, rolling until they crashed into two ancient looking trees one hundred meters away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A deafening 'boom!' resounded, both ancient trees shook and swayed as if they were about to fall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few breaths later, the two ancient trees gave out and fell... right onto the two people beneath them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Young Lord!" The Guo Brothers' lackeys cried out. However, when they rushed out to help, a terrifying sword intent slashed in their path, cutting a long thin rift on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lackeys jumped back swiftly in fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The terrifying sword intent came from Duan Wuhen. Retrieving his hand, Duan Wuhen stated coldly: "Whoever dares to approach any closer, die!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Die!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Since that was the case, none of the Guo Brothers' lackeys dared to move forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"My Qi Sea!" The Guo Brothers who were pinned under the two ancient trees suddenly screamed shrilly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong's earlier palm attack struck accurately and had affected their Qi Sea, crushing them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Qi Sea was where battle qi was stored and gathered within the body. If the Qi Sea was crushed, the damaging consequences were not hard to imagine!</span></p>
 <p><span style>By this point, the crowd had finally discovered that Guo Zhi and Guo Fei's Qi Sea had been crippled. This result increased the budding fear in the brothers’ lackeys.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even as he watched the shrieking Guo Zhi and Guo Fei, Huang Xiaolong's face was unperturbed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A deadly air filled the area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Brother Xiaolong, we… ?" At this time, Duan Wuhen came up and inquired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let's go."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Wuhen was stunned but inwardly, he sighed in relief. He thought Huang Xiaolong was really going to kill both of the Guo Brothers. Guo Zhi and Guo Fei's identities differed from the average Guo Family disciple’s. If both of them really died, the troubles that followed would not so easily be resolved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only after Huang Xiaolong and Duan Wuhen had left did Guo Zhi and Guo Fei's lackeys scramble to their sides and brought them away to seek help.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before long, the news about Guo Zhi and Guo Fei's Qi Sea being crushed by Huang Xiaolong had spread like wildifre in Duanren Institute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In less than a day, this news had rattled the Institute like a tsunami.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You heard it right, Second Imperial Prince actually referred to Huang Xiaolong as a brother!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is this Huang Xiaolong's real identity? Didn't they say he comes from a small family within Luo Tong Kingdom? Also, that bodyguard of his, Zhao Shu, was actually someone with strength infinitely close to the Saint realm!" </span></p>
 <p><span style>"Now that Guo Zhi and Guo Fei's Qi Sea has been crushed, I wonder how the Guo Family will react?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Voices from discussions echoed in almost every corner of Duanren Institute. As time wore on, the big families of Duanren Empire also came to receive this piece of news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Mansion. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Xiao Teng's report, Yao Fei was also slightly taken aback; but it wasn't because Huang Xiaolong crushed Guo Zhi and Guo Fei's Qi Sea. Rather, it was because Duan Wuhen called Huang Xiaolong brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Young Noble, it seems this Huang Xiaolong's identity is not so simple." Xiao Teng broached the subject hanging in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even with Duan Wuhen's identity and status, he had actually called Huang Xiaolong brother. Anyone would surmise there was more to Huang Xiaolong’s identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Fei broke out in a sudden laugh when hearing the remark, "Isn't it more meaningful that way? It would be extremely dull if everyone was weak and useless."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Where has the Huang Family reached now?" Yao Fei suddenly asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"They should be arriving in Grand Beginnings Kingdom in another two days." Xiao Teng answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grand Beginnings Kingdom." A light gleamed in Yao Fei's eyes.</span></p>
