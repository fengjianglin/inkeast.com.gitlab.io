 <p><b>Chapter 11: How Did You Advance&nbsp;to the First Order?</b></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if Huang Wei possesses a grade ten martial spirit, Father’s action is too partial to him!” Su Yan argued in a dissatisfied manner. “Could it be at the end of the year’s Clan Assembly our Xiaolong will really…?!” The words choked in her throat as Su Yan’s eyes turned red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to have a talk with Father!” At this moment, Huang Peng stood up in anger and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, it’s not necessary!” Huang Xiaolong stopped Huang Peng abruptly, saying “It’s not necessary to look for Grandfather!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Peng and Su Yan turned to look at their son.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when Huang Peng opens his mouth about to say something, on his son’s body, he saw a burst of battle qi’s bright radiance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Battle qi, outward projection of battle qi?” After being dazed for a moment, Huang and Su Yan blurted out in shock, a look of disbelief evident on their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The outward projection of battle qi, does this mean…?’ A thought flashed through Huang Peng and Su Yan’s mind, First Order warrior! Only after reaching the First Order warrior one can project battle qi outside the body; someone who had just successfully condensed battle qi was unable to project battle qi outwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaolong you, could it be that you have advanced to First Order?” Huang Peng asked in a trembling voice, although he witnessed the proof with his own eyes, he dared not be sure, for it might turn out to be an illusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right, Dad, Mom, I have already advanced to First Order!” Huang Xiaolong nodded, he did not wish to see his parents worrying endlessly about matters related to the Clan Assembly, so he decided to reveal part of his strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing their son’s confirmation, Huang Peng and Su Yan finally believed the truth in front of them. Joy took over their faces, especially Su Yan, after going through surprise and excitement she ran over and hugged Huang Xiaolong tightly: “Wonderful, my son finally advanced to the First Order!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tears of joy rolled down Su Yan’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan’s was quite a voluptuous woman, being hugged so tightly made Huang Xiaolong feel like he was about to suffocate; he finally managed to break free with much difficulty after a moment. ‘It is only the First Order, is it necessary to make such a big fuss?’ Huang Xiaolong thought dejectedly in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he could truly feel the love Huang Peng and Su Yan had for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Peng and Su Yan gradually calmed down from their joy and excitement a short while later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaolong, how did you advance to the First Order?” Huang Peng voiced out the doubt in his heart. With Huang Xiaolong’s grade seven martial spirit talent, to advance to the First Order would take at least a year or more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan also turned to look questioningly at her son, obviously, she too has some doubts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead of speaking, Huang Xiaolong withdrew two bright red fruit from his chest under the astonished gaze of Huang Peng and Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bright, succulent redness of the fruits bedazzled people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These, these are Yang fruits?!” Huang Peng and Su Yan both exclaimed in amazement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.” Huang Xiaolong laughed. “One month ago, I accidentally found these Yang fruits in a valley at the back mountain. There were five fruits in total, and I took three of them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were truly five pieces of Yang fruit in the beginning, but Huang Xiaolong only ate one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three fruits!” Huang Peng and Su Yan looked at each other. They finally understood the ‘real reason’ their son advanced to the First Order in such a short amount of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good! Haha, Xiaolong, unexpectedly you have such good fortune. The Yang fruit is a wonder fruit; its benefits are no less compared to the Leirion Heart Grass your Grandfather bought for Huang Wei.” Huang Peng laughed merrily: “It is also beneficial to your future cultivation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Su Yan was smiling from ear to ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, Mom, these two Yang fruits, both of you take one each and cultivate.” Huang Xiaolong said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Peng and Su Yan’s smiles stiffened on their faces and were about to refuse when Huang Xiaolong interrupted, “I have already taken three fruits, any more will only waste it and will not bring more benefits to me. It is better if Dad and Mom take it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, Huang Peng and Su Yan could no longer say anything. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seconds later, Huang Peng nodded his head in agreement: “Fine.” Taking the two Yang fruits from Huang Xiaolong’s hand, he inhaled deeply looking at them, making an effort to suppress the excitement in his heart. He had been stuck at late-Sixth Order for more than a year, with this piece of Yang fruit he would able to breakthrough to the peak-Sixth Order in two months’ time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, he really needed this Yang fruit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at the small red succulent fruit in her palm, Su Yan’s expression wasn’t much different from Huang Peng’s. With this piece of Yang fruit, there was hope for her to advance to the Sixth order. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaolong, about your breakthrough to the First Order, for the time being, don’t let others know.” Huang Peng said to his son after regaining some clarity, and continued, “Although you managed to breakthrough after swallowing the Yang fruits, you still need to make an effort in your practice, strive to reach mid-First Order by the end of the year.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Huang Peng’s opinion, as long as his son could reach the mid-First Order, even if Huang Wei was late-First Order at that time, to cripple both of his son’s hands would be difficult.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gap between mid-First Order and late-First Order was almost negligible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, Mom, rest assured that I will not disappoint you.” Huang Xiaolong said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Peng and Su Yan were comforted with those words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A short while later Huang Xiaolong left the Eastern Courtyard hall back to his small courtyard and directly went into practice mode. After advancing to the Third Order, the double-headed martial spirit’s speed in absorbing the netherworld spiritual aura had again increased, the battle qi inside his body grew ever more powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Almost at the speed of every other day, the battle qi inside his body became thicker and more powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The small courtyard Huang Xiaolong resided in was located at the easternmost part of Huang Clan Manor, that was why other than his parents and his sister Huang Min, rarely any people passed by, which made it&nbsp;all the more convenient for Huang Xiaolong to concentrate on practice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Huang Xiaolong practicing in a crazed manner regardless of day or night, his battle qi and internal force increased exponentially.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The peak of early-Third Order, mid-Third Order, peak mid-Third Order, late-Third Order!</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time three months had passed, Huang Xiaolong’s battle qi had reached peak late-Third Order, at any moment he could breakthrough to Fourth Order, and there were only less than two weeks until the end of the year’s Clan Assembly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the Fourth Order was a dividing line, the fourth order’s barrier was much thicker compared to the previous second and third order, the difficulty was incomparable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Huang Clan Manor there were disciples possessing grade seven martial spirits stuck at peak late-Third Order for more than two years, unable to achieve the desired breakthrough to the Fourth Order. Even those possessing grade eight martial spirits spent more than one year’s time at peak late-Third Order before advancing further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two weeks passed quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the approaching Clan Assembly, the Huang Clan Manor was filled with a lively and festive atmosphere because two days after the Clan Assembly was the dawn of a New Year. The entire Huang Clan Manor was decorated lavishly. In contrast with the rest of the Huang Clan Manor, Huang Xiaolong’s small courtyard seemed desolate and lonely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tomorrow’s the annual Clan Assembly.” Huang Xiaolong left his room after more than a dozen days of hard practice, eventually encountering a bottleneck at peak late-Third Order. From the looks of it, it would take a while before he could cross over to the Fourth Order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong walked out from the small courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tomorrow’s the Clan Annual Assembly, did you hear, this time Old Manor Lord will make an appearance!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This year is Young Lord Huang Wei’s first time participating in the Clan Assembly after awakening his martial spirit, of course Old Manor Lord will be joining the gathering. Not only that, I heard that Old Manor Lord even invited the Li Family’s Old Patriarch over!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then it means the Li Family’s Old Patriarch will be coming over?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Li Family and the Huang Clan Manor were considered as Canglan County’s major forces. The relationship between Old Patriarch of the Li Family, Li Mu and Huang Xiaolong’s Grandfather, Huang Qide, had always been good.</span></p>
