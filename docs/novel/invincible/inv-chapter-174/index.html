 <p><b>Chapter 174: Imperial City Battle (6)</b></p>
 <p>Yanggang sat there listening quietly and smirked sardonically to himself when he heard that Huang Xiaolong actually dared to refuse Heartless Young Noble’s invitation. In his esteemed opinion, Huang Xiaolong would definitely suffer an agonizing death for offending Yao Fei!</p>
 <p>Duanren Empire had five famous Young Nobles. Each of them had such immense influential power that they could easily cover half the sky with their palm. This especially applied to the top two, Second Imperial Prince Duan Wuhen and Heartless Young Noble Yao Fei.</p>
 <p>Amongst the five Young Nobles, Duan Wuhen and Yao Fei were the strongest of the bunch. In addition to their strength, Yao Fei belonged to the magnificent Yao Family which had existed for over two thousand years. In fact, the Yao Family’s history went further back than Duanren Empire itself.</p>
 <p>Even Duanren Emperor himself had to be wary when dealing with the Yao Family’s Ancestor.</p>
 <p>At this point, Yanggang seized the chance to voice some words of flattery, “That Huang Xiaolong has no idea how high the heavens are, daring to decline Heartless Young Noble’s invitation. However, please rest assured Heartless Young Noble, if I come across Huang Xiaolong on the stage, I will definitely defeat him and humiliate him to help ease Heartless Young Noble’s dissatisfaction.” Yanggang ended his declaration with a flattering smile.</p>
 <p>Yao Fei swept a glance at Yanggang as his mood returned to normal, his face remaining expressionless, “He’s nothing but a little greenhorn, this doesn’t qualify as something that can dampen my mood.”</p>
 <p>“And he’s even more unqualified to make me angry.”</p>
 <p>Yanggang stiffened.</p>
 <p>When Pang Yu saw Yanggang suddenly hesitate to speak, he jumped in with his own attempt to flatter, “Heartless Young Noble is right. With Heartless Young Noble’s strength and identity, how can that Huang Xiaolong even compare to you? He doesn’t even qualify to carry your shoes or hold your bath water!”</p>
 <p>Dai Shanni and Cui Li listened and kept quiet. Both did not utter a sound.</p>
 <p>In fact, Dai Shanni was reluctant to participate in such festivities, but due to the ‘pressure’ of Heartless Young Noble’s name and reputation, she felt that she had no other choice but to attend. Although the Dai Family was also one of Duanren Imperial City’s big families, it could not compare to the giant known as the Yao Family. Comparing the two was like comparing the heavens to the earth.</p>
 <p>The night sky outside gradually gave way to dawn as the sun rose, spreading warmth and light over the land.</p>
 <p>The sky was bright and clear, similar to the day before. The only difference compared to the previous day was that the excitement wafting through air had grown in intensity. Huang Xiaolong left the inn together with Zhao Shu, Yu Ming, and Fei Hou and the streets seemed packed, moving at a snail’s pace in the same direction.</p>
 <p>Today was the battle for the top ten!</p>
 <p>“Huang Xiaolong!”</p>
 <p>“It’s Huang Xiaolong!”</p>
 <p>Someone suddenly screamed his name in recognition just as Huang Xiaolong took a step out of the inn.</p>
 <p>The scream was harmless but it attracted many people’s attention. Heads quickly turned and many others caught sight of Huang Xiaolong. Each person dashed over in excitement as they tried to get closer to him. It was like a pack of wolves aiming for a single lamb, pouncing at Huang Xiaolong.</p>
 <p>They came from all four directions!</p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong furrowed his brows.</p>
 <p>Seeing this, a terrifying momentum broke out from Yu Ming’s body. An invisible vigor qi created a protective sphere in a three hundred meter radius around Huang Xiaolong. No one could get close to Huang Xiaolong within that boundary of three hundred meters.</p>
 <p>The frantic crowd felt like they crashed into an invisible wall.</p>
 <p>Watching this result, Huang Xiaolong sighed in relief and then headed towards Duanren Square with Zhao Shu, Yu Ming, and Fei Hou. Yu Ming’s vigor qi wall may have fenced off the crowd, but it could not deter them from following behind Huang Xiaolong and talking excitedly.</p>
 <p>Therefore, when Huang Xiaolong reached Duanren Square, he brought a mass gathering of more than ten thousand people with him!</p>
 <p>Watching the sight of Huang Xiaolong’s arrival and the mass of heads behind him, the Duanren Empire guards that were guarding the battle arena were shocked. Luckily they knew who Huang Xiaolong was, otherwise they would have thought an enemy army of the Empire had come to attack the city!</p>
 <p>Arriving at the square, Huang Xiaolong entered the battle arena area while Zhao Shu, Yu Ming, and Fei Hou waited on the outside.</p>
 <p>When he came to the arena area, Xie Puti was already sitting there in the same spot as the day before.</p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong also chose to sit on the same seat he had previously, and when he walked by, Xie Puti spoke without looking at Huang Xiaolong, “I hope there’s a chance that we meet on the main battle stage!”</p>
 <p>Tomorrow would be the last day of the Imperial City Battle and was also when the main battle stage opened. The main battle stage was where these geniuses would battle it out for first place. Only the top ten contestants were eligible to stand there. It was the last hurdle required before one could emerge victorious!</p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong looked over to the main battle stage without any change in his expression, “I also hope we can meet on the main battle stage at that time!”</p>
 <p>In Huang Xiaolong’s opinion, Xie Puti was the only person worthy to be his opponent in this Imperial City Battle. The only person qualified to be his opponent. As for Yanggang, Pang Yu, and the rest, he couldn’t be bothered.</p>
 <p>And this feeling was mutual for Xie Puti!</p>
 <p>After yesterday’s battles, Xie Puti listed Huang Xiaolong as his opponent, a real opponent. Only Huang Xiaolong was qualified to compete for the number one spot with him.</p>
 <p>Of course, he had full confidence in his own strength.</p>
 <p>Whether it was in regards to a martial spirit or strength, he believed his abilities greatly exceeded Huang Xiaolong. He believed that as strong as this Huang Xiaolong might be, he would thoroughly dominate him.</p>
 <p>Not long after Huang Xiaolong arrived, Cui Li walked in.</p>
 <p>However, compared to yesterday, Cui Li was obviously in a tangle. Yesterday she was full of sweet smiles, and today those smiles seemed somewhat forced.</p>
 <p>Walking into the arena area, she noticed the same empty seat beside Huang Xiaolong. In the end, she still walked over and sat down after a slight hesitation.</p>
 <p>The first words that came out of her mouth the moment she sat down was, “Yesterday, you really shouldn’t have refused Heartless Young Noble’s invitation.”</p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong had a ‘I-do-not-care’ expression on his face, “So what?”</p>
 <p>Coincidentally, Yanggang was walking over some distance away from outside the arena area.</p>
 <p>Watching Huang Xiaolong’s lackadaisical attitude towards what happened, her heart sighed as she continued, “You don’t understand. What I’m trying to say is that you need to be careful.”</p>
 <p>She had a little knowledge about Heartless Young Noble’s methods of handling things, and his power. Even though it was only the tip of the iceberg, it was enough to scare her.</p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong took a look at Cui Li and he could tell she was being sincere as she tried to provide him with some advice.</p>
 <p>Could it be… <i>this Cui Li was truly interested in him?</i> Then he shook his head in disbelief.</p>
 <p>“I will.” Huang Xiaolong replied.</p>
 <p>By this point, Yanggang had already entered the arena area. His eyes swept over Cui Li’s face as she sat beside Huang Xiaolong, snickering secretly to himself. After the banquet ended the night before, he expressed his interest towards this little tramp, but he did not expect her to dismiss him altogether.</p>
 <p>But today she still dared sit next to Huang Xiaolong? This angered him. This tramp was really a contemptible wretch. If comparing both status and identity, which of his aspects was not better than Huang Xiaolong’s? It was clear Huang Xiaolong had no interest in her, yet she continued to attach herself to him.</p>
 <p>This caused his dislike and dissatisfaction towards Huang Xiaolong to increase.</p>
 <p>But, Yanggang did not purposely make snide or crude remarks towards Huang Xiaolong. Instead, he shot Huang Xiaolong an icy gaze before taking the same seat he previously used.</p>
 <p>After Yanggang, Pang Yu, and Dai Shanni entered and sat down. Pang Yu had an intense look in his eyes as he stared at Huang Xiaolong, almost like he was gloating.</p>
 <p>To him, it didn’t matter if Huang Xiaolong became famous and stole all the limelight in this year’s Imperial City Battle, there was no good ending for someone who offended Heartless Young Noble.</p>
 <p>A lot of geniuses disappeared this way, dying in vain without knowing the way the world works. Soon after that, people would forget about them, vanishing from everyone’s memory.</p>
 <p>Shortly after that, all one hundred participants for the day’s battle arrived and gathered at the arena area. Duan Wuhen and Duanren Empire’s ministers appeared on the main viewing platform to preside over the day’s event, then announced the start of the battles.</p>
