 <p><b>Chapter 337: Back To Duanren Imperial City</b></p>
 <p><span style>After the battle, Huang Xiaolong and Lu Kai were no longer in the mood to talk about old days. Looking at the ruined shops and streets due to his battle with Ao Baixue, especially the destroyed Delicious Restaurant, Huang Xiaolong waved his hands and a shower of gold coins rained down, falling right in front of the Delicious Restaurant boss. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at the pile of gold coins the size of a small hill, the restaurant boss was stunned. Then, he trembled with excitement, both hands shaking visibly. From afar, he kowtowed endlessly in gratitude toward Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Watching this, Lu Kai laughed at Huang Xiaolong, “Damn, you kid shouldn’t be such a spendthrift even if you’re rich.” Even though Huang Xiaolong wanted to compensate the restaurant boss, that small hill pile of gold coins was enough for ten Delicious Restaurants. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong smiled and retorted, “I’ve always been this spendthrift.” To Huang Xiaolong, gold coins were just figures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Merely the number of gold coins he had gotten from the spatial rings of the Xiantian realm warriors he killed throughout this journey was enough to pave all the streets in the Luo Tong Royal City. Especially the two spatial rings belonging to the Blood Dragon City’s Li Li and Du Huagang that Huang Xiaolong killed in the Ghost City, the amount of gold coins inside their spatial rings was piled mountain high and several miles long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Huang Xiaolong stayed one night in the Luo Tong Royal City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next day, Huang Xiaolong and Feng Yang moved separately to clean out all the Wind God Cult remnants around the Royal City. When that matter was settled, he regrouped with giant ghost Feng Yang and continued on their way back to Duanren Imperial City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the way, Huang Xiaolong decided to check Ao Baixue’s spatial ring. Inside, other than mountains of gold coins, there were a lot of grade eight, grade nine, and even grade ten spirit pellets. There were even three heaven grade spirit pellets, but none were of divine grade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What came as a pleasant surprise to Huang Xiaolong were the sixty plus grade one spirit stones that he found amongst the items. Although Huang Xiaolong’s battle qi had enhanced significantly in the recent months, the consumption still too large to enable the Godly Mt. Xumi to fly, as well as initiate the Thousand Beast Cauldron inside the Linglong Treasure Pagoda. With those grade one spirit stones he would have an easier time. Sixty plus pieces weren’t much, but it was sufficient for a period of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After leaving the Luo Tong Kingdom, Huang Xiaolong traveled at a moderate pace, while practicing the Godly Xumi Art, Asura Tactics, and other techniques while attempting to use the Thousand Beast Cauldron to refine Ao Baixue’s corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Huang Xiaolong did not relax his practice of the Ancient Puppetry Art and Soul Mandate. After battling with Saint realm experts like Zhao Chen and Ao Baixue, Huang Xiaolong realized ever more the crucial importance of a strong soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After one broke through to the Saint realm, as long as the soul was not destroyed, one would be immortal, so to speak. Therefore, Huang Xiaolong made every effort to continuously enhance his spirit and soul. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Amidst all these, what baffled Huang Xiaolong was that the Thousand Beast Cauldron was unable to refine Ao Baixue’s body. There were no changes to Ao Baixue’s corpse in the last few days except for one thing: it became translucent, resembling crystal, and Huang Xiaolong actually felt that Ao Baixue’s physical body was stronger than it was before…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This…?” Huang Xiaolong was astonished when he found out. Did this mean that the Thousand Beast Cauldron could also be used to temper one’s physique?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, Huang Xiaolong had only used the Thousand Beast Cauldron to refine pellets, it had never crossed his mind that the cauldron could be used to temper his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sensing the change in Ao Baixue’s corpse, Huang Xiaolong appeared inside the Linglong Treasure Pagoda in a flicker, dived into the Thousand Beast Cauldron, and used a grade one spirit stone as energy source to activate the Heaven and Earth Origin Reverting Array inside the cauldron.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One day later when Huang Xiaolong emerged from the Thousand Beast Cauldron, he confirmed that his flesh was much stronger. From his meridians to his Qi Sea and internal organs, every part of him was strengthened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This discovery came as a pleasant surprise to Huang Xiaolong. Although he didn’t manage to refine Ao Baixue’s corpse, he accidentally discovered a new function of the Thousand Beast Cauldron. If he continued to use the Thousand Beast Cauldron to temper his body, his flesh, defense, and strength could be enhanced continuously, becoming more powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although a strong soul and spirit were at the top of Huang Xiaolong’s list before breaking into the Saint realm, the body was equally important.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cultivating as he made his way towards the Duanren Imperial City, it merely took Huang Xiaolong seven days to reach his destination, otherwise, with his speed, he would barely need three days to travel the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seven days later, Huang Xiaolong stood before the gates of Duanren Imperial City, a wash of nostalgia tugged at his heart looking at the grand city gates. A while later, Huang Xiaolong passed through the gates with giant ghost Feng Yang and led him to the Southern Hill Estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been close to two years since he left home. Time flowed by so quickly, he felt as it was only yesterday when he left Duanren Imperial City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, when Huang Xiaolong walked along the Imperial City streets, he noticed that it was livelier than usual, people filling every street, carts and carriages looked like a hundred miles long dragon, crowds made their way in groups after groups towards the north side of the Imperial City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong became curious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This brother, what is happening? Why are there so many people moving towards the north side?” He called out to a passerby young man and inquired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man scrutinized Huang Xiaolong up and down with a strange expression on his face, “Don’t you know? Today is the last day of this year’s Imperial City Battle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Imperial City Battle?” Huang Xiaolong was slightly stunned, then he shook his head as a faint smile emerged on his face. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘I wonder how Xie Puti, that guy, is doing...’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The young man that was stopped by Huang Xiaolong to ask questions noticed that Huang Xiaolong stood there daydreaming, so he went off in a huff, ignoring Huang Xiaolong after throwing a word at Huang Xiaolong: “Idiot!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Idiot...? Huang Xiaolong smiled bitterly, this was his first time being labeled as an idiot. Alas, Huang Xiaolong left the place, heading straight to the Southern Hill Estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Very soon, Huang Xiaolong and giant ghost Feng Yang stood in front of the doors of the Southern Hill Estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The main entrance of the Southern Hill Estate was twice as big compared to the time he left two years ago. Most likely it was renovated after Huang Xiaolong left, the two lion statues on each side of the gates looked imposing and domineering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s Young Master, it’s the Eldest Young Master, Eldest Young Master is back~!!” At this point, the guard stationed in front of the Southern Hill Estate recognized Huang Xiaolong and started announcing happily at the top of his lungs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The instant the guard’s voice rang out, the whole Southern Hill Estate boiled up with excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A flurry of footsteps sounded from afar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Peng and Su Yan were seen rushing haphazardly towards the main door, right behind them were Huang Xiaohai, Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and a group of loyal guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong watched the overjoyed expression on his parents face as they rushed out as fast as they could, and inexplicably, his eyes moistened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s Long’er, it’s Long’er, really, Long’er is back!!” Su Yan beamed the moment she spotted Huang Xiaolong, rushing to be the first one to arrive at the door before anyone else, pulling Huang Xiaolong into a hug.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Long’er you’re finally back!” She sobbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong’s sight was slightly hazy, he nodded. Ardently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a long time before Su Yan was willing to let go of Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father.” Huang Xiaolong turned to his father at the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Peng’s eyes were slightly moist and red: “It’s good you’re back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big brother.” Huang Xiaohai stepped up, calling out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong patted his younger brother’s shoulder. His younger brother had grown much taller.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Lord!” When all the family members finished their greetings, Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu stepped forward, saluting Huang Xiaolong respectfully. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Watching everyone presentーhis parents, younger brother, Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the rest, a warm feeling flowed into his heart.</span></p>
