 <p><b>Chapter 38: At The Delicious Restaurant!</b></p>
 <p><span style>Two people and a little monkey strolled around the Royal City. Undeniably, this was the Royal City of the Luo Tong Kingdom, prosperous, lively and bustling on the long wide streets. Some of the streets were fifty to sixty meters wide, with an endless stream of horses and carriages that trotted along and if Cangnan County City were to be compared, it could only be described as a rural backwater.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From time to time, there were people in strange clothes who passed by Huang Xiaolong. There were over thirty counties ruled by the Luo Tong Kingdom’s royal family, and under each county were many cities so the many different cultures between the cities were apparent. This was similar to Hua Xia, which had many different ethnicities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they strolled about the city, a two-meter tall muscular man whose entire body was covered in coarse hairs and on his face were tiger-like whiskers passed by Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that a Beastman?” wondered Huang Xiaolong as he looked at the muscular man who just walked past them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the Martial Spirit World, other than the human race, there existed many others races and beast people were one of them. There were also, half-beast humans – the offspring from the coupling between humans and beast people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the streets were crowded, Huang Xiaolong just went along with the flow, the little monkey on his shoulder squeaking nonstop in excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou strolled casually, sometimes to the left, sometimes to the right.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few moments later, as he walked by a restaurant called Delicious Restaurant, Huang Xiaolong came to a stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fei Hou, let’s go in and eat something.” Huang Xiaolong said. Having spent four months training in Silvermoon Forest, his tongue was already coated black from eating roasted meat every day, so he planned to eat to his heart’s content today.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Huang Xiaolong finished speaking, the little monkey perched on his shoulder immediately clapped in agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Glutton!” Huang Xiaolong teased.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&nbsp;They went into the restaurant and saw that it was full.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&nbsp;“Let’s go to the Second floor.” But as Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou were about to climb up the stairs, the restaurant’s waiter quickly rushed up to them to stop them from going to the second floor and politely explained,</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little brother, my apologies, but our second floor is reserved for nobles.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nobles again.” Huang Xiaolong frowned, then he looked at Fei Hou. Fei Hou replied by throwing a gold coin to the waiter saying, “This is Young Master’s tip.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The restaurant servant blanked out for a moment staring at the gold coin in his palm: “This, this is for me?!” His monthly salary was one gold coin and the nobles that frequent here usually reward him with a few silver coins.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now we can go up?” Fei Hou asked indifferently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, certainly!” replied the waiter as he regained his senses, with his face sporting a wide smile he said “This way, please!” and respectfully led Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou to the second floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the second floor was said to be reserved for nobles, it was not necessarily true, for as long as the customer could pay, the second floor was open to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Evidently, Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou were people with money. Thus, the restaurant waiter led them to a good seat close to the window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou sat down, the waiter asked politely with a smile plastered on his face, “Masters, what dishes would you like to order?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bring us about ten or more dishes that your restaurant is most famous for. And three of the biggest jugs of the best wine available!” Huang Xiaolong said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ten or more dishes! Three urns of the best wine!” The restaurant waiter was stunned and his mouth agape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>More than ten dishes and three urns of wine!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you still standing there? Not moving?” asked Fei Hou but seeing that the restaurant waiter still was standing there, he frowned a little then he took out a small pouch and threw it to the waiter. The restaurant waiter caught the small pouch, opened it and looked inside. A beautiful golden glow shined before his eyes, that small pouch held about sixty gold coins.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is enough, right?” asked Fei Hou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The restaurant waiter nodded his head vigorously: “Enough, enough. There will be plenty left over too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The rest is your reward. Go quickly and get the dishes.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The rest is your reward!!</span></i><span style> When the restaurant waiter heard this sentence, his eyes seemed to turn gold-colored, his head nodded like a chick pecking grains. “Two Masters, rest assured, I will be very fast and quick in sending the dishes up!” He hurried down while his hand wiped away the sweat on his forehead, not sure whether the sweat is due to fright or delight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, the dishes were sent up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The table was laden with fragrant dishes, enticing the appetite.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Masters, these three urns are our restaurant’s best wine called Snow Moon Wine, our restaurant’s special brew.” Said the restaurant waiter respectfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Snow Moon Wine?” Fei Hou nodded and waved the restaurant waiter away, “Good, you can go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes, please call me if there’s anything you need.” The waiter said and withdrew with a smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the waiter left, the little violet monkey leaped off Huang Xiaolong’s shoulder and went straight at one of the wine urns. With a light slap from its little hands, the cover flew off and instantly the scent of fragrant wine wafted through the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little monkey’s eyes lit up, it lifted the urn of wine up and drank greedily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After which it grinned and squeaked at Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both of them laughed at the little monkey’s antics, and each took an urn and started drinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The instant the wine was swallowed, a refreshing icy cold feeling filled their mouths, full of the wine’s fragrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Huang Xiaolong, Fei Hou, and the little violet monkey were enjoying themselves, at the Duke Fu Mansion’s Main Hall, Meng Xia, who was shaved bald by Fei Hou, was shouting in anger: “Dad, you must kill these two darned commoners! Cut off their arms and legs! Cut off their arms and thighs, and then I want to parade then around the city, I want everyone to know the consequences of going against our Duke Mansion!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at his son’s miserable appearance, the murderous intent in Meng Chen’s heart soared; his son was actually beaten right in front of the city gates!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, the mansion guards’ hands were all cut off!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was naked humiliation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still haven’t found those two?” asked Meng Chen in a cold tone as he turned to look at his Chief Steward, Xie Fei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Chief Steward Xie Fei was about to speak, without warning, from outside the Main Hall one of the guards who had been sent to investigate ran in, “Reporting to Lord Duke, we have found the two people, they are at Delicious Restaurant!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Delicious Restaurant!” Meng Chen stood up in anger, a cold glint flitted across his eyes, and he said: “Good, very good! Hit my son, and hurt this Duke’s guards yet still dare to enjoy yourselves at Delicious Restaurant!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other side was practically looking down on the Duke Mansion!</span></p>
 <p><span style>&nbsp;“Gather all the experts above Seventh Order in the mansion and follow me to Delicious Restaurant!” Meng Chen yelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&nbsp;“Yes, Lord Duke!” Chief Steward Xie Fei acknowledged respectfully, but then hesitated before asking, “Then, should I call First Mister and Second Mister?” Meng Chen said, “That’s fine! Do so. I don’t care what tricks the other side has, I want them to die miserably!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While all this was going on, Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou were wolfing down delicious dishes. Moments later, Fei Hou stopped eating abruptly, stood up and said to Huang Xiaolong, “Young Master, I’m going to see a person, he’s here in Luo Tong Kingdom and is also a disciple of our Asura’s Gate. I will bring him over to greet Young Master! If he knew that Young Master is in Luo Tong Kingdom, he would be very happy!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>An Asura’s Gate disciple?</span></i><span style> Is this the reason why Fei Hou dared to hit a Duke’s son? Huang Xiaolong nodded, “Okay, go and come back quickly!” He didn’t ask for the identity of the Asura’s Gate disciple in Luo Tong Kingdom because when Fei Hou returned, he would naturally find out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Young Master!” Fei Hou answered respectfully then turned and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long after, Fei Hou appeared before an enormous mansion, and written above the main entrance was a sign: Marshal Mansion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the Luo Tong Kingdom, there were Generals, Dukes, Marquises, but there was only one Marshal!</span></p>
