 <p><b>Chapter 168: Can I Sit Here?</b></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Sovereign!” Zhao Shu and the other two acknowledged Huang Xiaolong’s words in unison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong turned around and stepped out from the inn with Zhao Shu and the rest in the direction of Duanren Imperial Palace’s main entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Walking into the streets, there were heads bobbing along everywhere in the packed crowd, flowing to one destination point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The main entrance of Duanren Imperial Palace!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duanren Square!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong’s group of four walked patiently, following the flow of the crowd to the square’s direction. Half an hour later, the four arrived at Duanren Square.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ginormous was not an apt enough description to describe Duanren Square. Duanren Empire’s military parade that was held every decade took place in that very square. Thus, one could imagine the monumental size of Duanren Square.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Straight across Duanren Square was Duanren Imperial Palace’s formidable high walls. The Imperial Palace walls were about the same height as the Imperial City walls, but the difference was in the majestic aura emanating behind the Imperial Palace walls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Teams of intimidating soldiers were stationed around the perimeter of the square.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, Yu Ming, and Fei Hou walked into the arena where ten battle stages were erected, as well as a guest platform.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The outer edge of the battle arena was also heavily guarded by soldiers barricading the crowd from getting too close to the stages. Only geniuses representing their kingdom like Huang Xiaolong were eligible to enter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time Huang Xiaolong arrived, Duanren Square was already filled with people, but luckily the kingdom’s representative geniuses had a special tunnel entrance to the battle arena</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stopping before the special entrance, Huang Xiaolong said to his three companions, “Wait for me outside.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes Young Lord!” The three answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Walking along the tunnel, Huang Xiaolong emerged at the front section of the battle arena, taking out the participation token which Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu had given him. Seeing the token, the soldiers on guard opened up a small gap, allowing Huang Xiaolong to enter the battle arena area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Entering within, Huang Xiaolong made his way to the rest area prepared for the participating talents coming from all kingdoms. When he arrived, Huang Xiaolong noticed that quite a number of them were already there, and after sweeping a cursory glance around, he made a rough estimate that there were seven to eight hundred people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His arrival, however, attracted quite a commotion when geniuses from other kingdoms noticed him walking into the rest area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This kid is also a participant in the Imperial City Battle? Please don’t joke, he looks like he’s no older than eighteen years old!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Barely eighteen and this kid came to participate in the Imperial City Battle; if it’s not him having great confidence in his strength, then he’s probably an arrogant idiot!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The genius disciples from Duanren Empire’s fealty kingdoms looked at Huang Xiaolong with different meanings to their gazes. One of the requirements for participating in the Imperial City Battle was being at or under thirty years old. Therefore, most of these geniuses would cultivate until the age of thirty or close to thirty before coming to participate in this event.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An ounce stronger meant a slightly higher chance to achieve a more favorable result.</span></p>
 <p><span style>People who came to participate in the Imperial City Battle before reaching the age of twenty were scarce, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say it had never happened before. As high as Huang Xiaolong’s talent might be, these other kingdom’s geniuses were reluctant to believe that a seventeen-year-old ‘boy’ was strong enough to shake them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, behind these gazes, contempt swirled within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, amongst this group of geniuses, there was a young man in white robes around twenty-seven to twenty-eight years old who was looking solemnly at Huang Xiaolong ever since his appearance.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Huang Xiaolong! It’s actually Huang Xiaolong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This little punk also came to participate in this year’s Imperial City battle?! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Why, why so fast?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-robed young man was traumatized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two years ago, in the Yuwai Kingdom, the white-robed young man saw the entire scene where Huang Xiaolong defeated Yang An on the street.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two years’ ago at that time, Huang Xiaolong should have only been a Ninth Order warrior, not even breaking through to a Tenth Order warrior! He remembered that day clearly, the talent Huang Xiaolong had shown greatly impacted him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He previously thought, </span><i><span style>give Huang Xiaolong ten years’ time to cultivate, and at that time, the first place of Duanren Empire’s Imperial City Battle would be none other than him, Huang Xiaolong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, it did not take ten years. In just two short years, Huang Xiaolong was here, participating in the Imperial City Battle!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two years, how much did his strength increase? Tenth Order? The white-robed young man contemplated inwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This white-robed young man was Yuwai Kingdom’s representative for this year, Zhou Jie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just a mere Tenth Order warrior and he dares come take part in the Imperial City Battle?” Zhou Jie furrowed his brows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the white-robed young man’s opinion, a mere two years was too fast even with Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation speed. At most, he should only be a Tenth Order warrior; moreover, he probably just had a recent breakthrough to the Tenth Order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Tenth Order cultivation base in all the kingdoms’ academies could be considered an expert, but in the eyes of the many geniuses that came to participate in the Imperial City Battle, that was the bottom rung as cannon fodder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, since Huang Xiaolong clinched Cosmic Star Academy’s overall championship, his strength was definitely not limited to a Tenth Order warrior’s level. This was Zhou Jie’s final assessment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong listened to the discussions around him, ignoring the gazes directed at him as he walked up to an empty seat. He sat down quietly and waited patiently for the battles to begin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Huang Xiaolong arrived, many geniuses from other kingdoms also arrived in succession, when suddenly, there was a commotion in the crowd of people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xie Puti! Xie Puti is here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“According to rumours, Xie Puti has a top grade thirteen martial spirit, Black Flame Phoenix! And he supposedly broke through to Xiantian Second Order a year ago!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiantian Second Order! Black Flame Phoenix martial spirit! This Xie Puti is too scary, no doubt this time’s first place is his! Most of the big families and forces in Duanren Imperial City are betting that Xie Puti will take first place this time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing endless praises of admiration towards this Xie Puti, Huang Xiaolong became curious and looked over. A young man in fire-red battle gear was walking in his direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This young man had a tall stature, as if every muscle in his body contained unimaginable explosive power. Even his eyebrows were fire-red in color. As he walked, a faint ember glow seemed to trail his movements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was Xie Puti!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aggressive and domineering!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Xie Puti?</span></i><span style> The name flickered in and immediately passed through Huang Xiaolong’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Judging the from the crowd’s reaction, this Xie Puti was likely the strongest participant in this year’s Imperial City Battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Top grade thirteen martial spirit, Black Flame Phoenix? Xiantian Second Order!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Undoubtedly, this Xie Puti would be a strong opponent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Walking into the resting area, Xie Puti made his way to the empty seats close to Huang Xiaolong and chose a seat five meters away from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Xie Puti sat down, a burst of hot air rushed out. The geniuses originally sitting in that area exclaimed in surprise, all scurrying far away from their seats, recoiling from the sudden burst of heat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hot air rushed towards Huang Xiaolong, but when it was still one meter away, it stopped like it met with an invisible barrier of resistance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong sat in a meditative pose, calm as day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“En?” Xie Puti uttered a surprised sound. Looking over at Huang Xiaolong, a fiery-red spark glinted in his eyes because he did not expect his Phoenix fire qi would actually be resisted by some youth aged no more than eighteen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The faces of possible top ten candidates flashed one by one in his mind, yet none of them matched the features of this young man near him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Interesting</span></i><span style>, Xie Puti thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other geniuses present were also surprised seeing Huang Xiaolong stop Xie Puti’s Phoenix fire qi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? That little kid actually stopped Xie Puti’s Phoenix fire qi!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where did this kid come from?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, those geniuses that had just avoided Xie Puti’s fire qi sneered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was because this little punk cultivates in cold element battle qi, coincidentally restraining Xie Puti’s Phoenix fire qi. Moreover, Xie Puti was kind enough to hold back. Do you really think this little kid is so great that he can withstand the heat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right, that must be the reason!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong remained calm even as the ridiculing words continued.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s Yanggang, Yanggang’s here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, another wave of commotion swept the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yanggang, peak-late Xiantian First Order, his martial spirit is a top grade twelve, Celestial Yin Beast! </span></p>
 <p><span style>A young man in a green brocade robe was seen walking in. Yanggang!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong glanced at the new arrival, unperturbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another superb talent martial spirit possessor. He did not expect that in this year’s Imperial City Battle, so many of them would appear. And to top it off, even meet two geniuses in succession that had superb martial spirits above grade eleven.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Including Huang Xiaolong, it totaled at three!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, the Imperial City Battle had only gathered grade eleven martial spirits. At most, the number of those applicants maxed out at two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yanggang’s appearance sent the surrounding geniuses into another bout of whispers; this Yanggang was the most probable candidate for second place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Walking in, Yanggang was dumbfounded by Xie Puti’s presence, and strong flames of war burned in his eyes as he headed straight towards Xie Puti’s position. Yanggang’s actions instantly attracted the attention of many geniuses, and they turned to watch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Coming to a stand before Xie Puti, Yanggang said, “As for this year’s Imperial City Battle... I will definitely get the first place! Xie Puti, I will absolutely defeat you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Puti laughed calmly after hearing these words, “Defeat me? We’ll see after you defeat him.” His eyes hinted at Huang Xiaolong five meters away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yanggang looked over in the same direction, and seeing Huang Xiaolong’s face, he was stunned and turned back to face Xie Puti angrily, “What do you mean?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>In Yanggang’s opinion, Xie Puti was comparing him with a seventeen-year-old greenhorn, and there was a strong feeling that he was being underestimated, or worse, disdained!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Puti did not bother to answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And that made Yanggang’s face darken gloomily, glaring at Huang Xiaolong. “Little punk, I hope you won’t run into me on the stage. If you do, I’ll make sure you get off the stage sideways!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yanggang directed all his rage onto Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” Huang Xiaolong reacted placidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Huang Xiaolong dared to retort him in public, the temperature in his eyes dropped dangerously, fierce light glinted in his eyes. However, before the Imperial City Battle began, it was forbidden to fight below the stage. Even he dared not break this rule.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yanggang’s icy gaze cut across Huang Xiaolong’s face, then let out a harrumph and sat down in an empty chair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Heihei</span></i><span style>, that brat offended Yanggang, if lady luck is not on his side, and he really runs into Yanggang later on the stage, he’ll end up truly miserable!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Some of the geniuses that ran away unable to withstand Xie Puti’s Phoenix fire qi turned schadenfreude at Huang Xiaolong’s impending misfortune.</span></p>
 <p><span style> A short while later, the crowd became worked up again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time around, it was not a young man, but a beautiful young woman dressed in a flowy turquoise long dress. Her name was Cui Li. She appeared to be in her late twenties and had a sweet smile hanging on her ruddy lips, along with a pair of glistening bright eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The commotion raised by Cui Li’s appearance was comparable to Xie Puti’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of the geniuses participating in the Imperial City Battle this year were men, and this was the obvious attraction of the opposite sex.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can I sit here?” Arriving, Cui Li seemed to make a beeline towards Huang Xiaolong, and as she stood in front of him, one delicate finger pointed to an empty seat beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong became dazed for a moment before nodding, “Feel free.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sending Huang Xiaolong a sweet-honeyed smile, she said her thanks, “Thank you,” and sat down next to Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her alluring fragrance wafted into Huang Xiaolong’s nose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that moment, the surrounding kingdom geniuses were all staring at Huang Xiaolong. The many pairs of eyes seemed to spew a strong fire of jealousy.</span></p>
