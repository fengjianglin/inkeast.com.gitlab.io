 <p><b>Chapter 467: Have All of Them Remain Here Forever!</b></p>
 <p><span>“You lot’s curiosity is really morbid.” Huang Xiaolong’s words were filled with sarcasm.</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Molin giggled, “Our Deities Templar has always hoped that the beastmen tribes could unite, becoming stronger, and bring back the splendor of their past glory. Now that this warrior found the Beast God Scepter, and you are fated to unite the beastmen tribes, our Deities Templar is happy for the entire beastman race.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong sneered inwardly listening to Li Molin’s display of ‘goodwill.’</span></p>
 <p><span>Deities Templar hoped that the beastmen tribes could unite, become stronger?</span></p>
 <p><span>Hoping the beastmen tribes would submit under Deities Templar was the real truth.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Since this warrior possesses the Beast God Scepter, then we shall take our leave first. We shall return later with congratulatory gifts.” Li Molin looked over at Liu Yang, “Let us leave.” Finished saying that, she turned to leave with Liu Yang and the experts from Deities Templar.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Beast God Scepter resurface in the world, the person they betted on, lion king Andrew, was no different than a dead man. Li Molin knew that with all these staggering changes, it was impossible for the Deities Templar to control the beastmen tribes.</span></p>
 <p><span>Therefore, she acted decisively, first return to report the situation to the Temple Preceptor and await his decision.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Not so fast!” Just as Li Molin and the large group of Deities Templar experts prepared to leave, Huang Xiaolong spoke: “Make sure none of them leaves this place!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Yes, Liege Lord Beast God!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The beastmen present acknowledged his command, their voices rumbled in the square, shaking the heavens.</span></p>
 <p><span>In the blink of an eye, several thousand experts lunged forward, attacking with zeal.</span></p>
 <p><span>All Deities Templar experts’ faces tightened.</span></p>
 <p><span>A volley of blasts sounded, forcing Li Molin and the sixty-plus experts back to their original spot.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This warrior, what is the meaning of this?!” Li Molin’s face distorted with anger, her eyes glared fiercely at Huang Xiaolong. Up to this point, she still hadn’t realized that she was facing an old friend, Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Meaning?” A faint satirical smile flitted past Huang Xiaolong’s face, “ There’s no other meaning; today, I’m succeeding the Beast God’s position, in a little while we need to perform the Beast God Sacrificial Rite, thus are in need of some sacrificial offerings. I want to use your heads as my offerings!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Use the over sixty Deities Templar experts’ heads as sacrificial offerings!</span></p>
 <p><span>This offering was earth-shaking!</span></p>
 <p><span>“What do you lot say, is it good if we use their heads as offerings?!” Huang Xiaolong scanned the numerous faces of the beastmen experts.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Good! Great! Liege Lord Beast God is mighty!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Liege Lord Beast God mighty!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Hearing those words, the beastmen experts felt their blood boil with excitement, hollering their agreement, the sound of their voices pierced the sky. Animalistic instinct for blood shone from their eyes. Truth be told, the majority of the beastmen felt antagonistic toward these Deities Templar experts from the moment they appeared. Huang Xiaolong’s call instantly stimulated the ferociousness embedded deep within their bloodlines.</span></p>
 <p><span>Just the mere thought of using over sixty Deities Templar experts as their sacrificial offerings to the Beast God made their hearts race! Only a Beast God of this caliber was qualified to be their beastmen’s Liege Lord!</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Molin, Liu Yang, and all the Deities Templar experts paled slightly looking at the layers of beastmen experts encirclement around them on the square.</span></p>
 <p><span>Taking some time, Li Molin made an effort to compose herself. Her eyes spit fire glaring at Huang Xiaolong, “I truly admire your courage, but do you really think you can keep all of us here?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Despite having thousands of beastmen experts surrounding them, Li Molin was confident in her strength. If she wanted to flee, she had a high chance making it out of there.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Although you might be the new Beast God, do not assume that after uniting the beastmen tribes you can do as you like in the Martial Spirit World. If you dare to kill even one of our Deities Templar people today…!” Li Molin left her threat hang in the air for a second, “At that time, our Deities Templar’s experts will come out in full force to annihilate every single beastman tribe!” The taste of threat intensified at the end.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “Li Molin, you escaped the several times before, do you really think you’ll be able to escape this time as well?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span>Several times before?</span></i><span> Li Molin frowned at those words, confusion in her eyes as she stared intently at Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span>Did they know each other from before?</span></p>
 <p><span>“On this day, not only will I use your head as offering for the Beast God Sacrificial Rite, I will also use your head to worship my brother, Lu Kai!” Huang Xiaolong’s cold voice reverberated in the square.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Lu Kai?” An image flashed in Li Molin’s mind, that measly insignificant Luo Tong Kingdom Prince Lu Kai?</span></p>
 <p><span>“You, you’re Huang Xiaolong!” Li Molin blurted the name before she could stop herself.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Huang Xiaolong!” Both the Deities Templar and the beastmen experts’ attention focused on Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span>Before the crowd’s intense focus, Huang Xiaolong’s facial features and body slowly changed, reverting to his original features.</span></p>
 <p><span>“That’s right, it’s me!” Huang Xiaolong’s expression was grim and cold facing Li Molin.</span></p>
 <p><span>Watching Huang Xiaolong’s features reverting back to his original face, the Deities Templar experts subconsciously shifted to the back in fear, whereas the beastmen grew more fanatic, feverish, worshipping, and reverent looking at Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span>So their Beast God was actually the stalwart persona whose name had spread throughout all three continents, hailed as the Young Noble Divine Dragon, Huang Xiaolong!</span></p>
 <p><span>Present in the square were experts of each beastmen tribes, they were no stranger to Huang Xiaolong’s ‘Young Noble Divine Dragon’ reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Liege Lord Beast God’s might spans through the ages!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The Tiger Tribe Patriarch Chuck lauded.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Liege Lord Beast God’s might spans through the ages!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Following Chuck’s lead, all the beastmen experts lauded the same words at the top of their lungs, the terrifying sound waves crashed against Li Molin’s heart. She suddenly leaped into the air, obviously seizing the chance to escape alone.</span></p>
 <p><span>Unfortunately, Huang Xiaolong had locked onto her every moment from the beginning, the second Li Molin moved, his arm made a waving motion releasing a swarm of Poison Corpse Scarabs baring their razor sharp teeth at Li Molin.</span></p>
 <p><span>After that Asura Square battle, his Poison Corpse Scarabs had continued to evolve, their speed reached a horrifying level, being able to catch up to Li Molin in a mere instant.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Poison Corpse Scarabs!” Li Molin exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span>In the last battle at the Asura’s Gate headquarters, Li Molin tasted the terror of the Poison Corpse Scarabs, watching with her own eyes as several Deities Templar Elders were gnawed alive by those critters. That battle left a deep fear that penetrated into her soul toward the Poison Corpse Scarabs.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Divine Dragon Armor immediately on Li Molin, the same azure longsword tightly gripped in her hands, slashing out with mad ferocity.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Deities Templar experts below regained their senses, quickly joining in the attack toward the Poison Corpse Scarabs.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong waved his arm again, and the Devils and Ghosts Flag was laid out instantly. An endless tide of ghost auras submerged Li Molin and the other Deities Templar experts. Evil ghosts and devils came howling baring their fangs as they entangled the living prey inside the array.</span></p>
 <p><span>The experts made frenzied attacks with their palms, fear deeply etched on their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Attack!” Huang Xiaolong commanded the beastmen experts.</span></p>
 <p><span>All the beastmen experts complied with anticipation on their faces, rushing to attack with vigor. </span></p>
 <p><span>The Devils and Ghosts Flag was no longer the Supreme Ghost Flag it once was, with the additional of twenty Saint realm souls, the evil spirits within now had the strength of a Third Order Saint realm expert.</span></p>
 <p><span>Powerful as those Deities Templar experts may be, in a short time, they would be hard pressed to break out from that Sea of Ghosts and Devils Array.</span></p>
 <p><span>On top of being trapped in the array, with the Poison Corpse Scarabs and thousands of beastmen experts attacking, very soon, close to half of the sixty over Deities Templar experts had fallen.</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Molin and Liu Yang watched helplessly as the experts they brought died, one by one, under the beastmen experts’ attacks, then were turned into nourishment for the Poison Corpse Scarabs, their faces lost all color, shackled with fear.</span></p>
 <p><span>Lo Molin’s senses ebbed away, replaced by the aura of impending death that seized her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span>Two hours later, from the sixty plus high-level experts, only a small dozen remained. Li Molin knew very well, if nothing was done, sooner or later all of them would end up as food for those Poison Corpse Scarabs, including herself!</span></p>
 <p><span>Thinking of those little black things crawling all over her body, eating her flesh little by little, that sight was enough to make her lose strength, quivering.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Huang Xiaolong, I’m Li Lu’s Master!” Li Molin’s shrill shriek cuts the air, “If Li Lu finds out that you killed me, she will definitely kill you to avenge me!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong’s brows creased slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Molin tried again, “Let me go, I can speak good words for you once I return to Deities Templar, I can even tell you the latest news about Li Lu!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Then, the Great Dragon Saber appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s hand, slashing down…</span></p>
