 <p><b>Chapter 291: Life Soul Grass</b></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong’s and Yao Fei’s eyes met briefly and then both looked away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since this Yao Fei came here, to the Bedlam Lands, then he should stay here forever. A flash of killing intent flitted in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A short while later, the doors to the auction firm hall closed, signaling the start of the auction. The auction was presided by an old man with spirited dark pupils and a full crown of white hair, the only high-grade auctioneer in the City of Myriad Gods, named Fang Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Standing on the stage, Fang Dong explained some auction rules and things to note in a candid manner, then swiftly proceeded with the first auction item. The first auction item wasn’t an elixir of any type nor was it spirit pellets or spirit stones, it was a sharp cutlass named Demon Blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cutlass was short in length, with a dark maroon-black body, as if it was smeared with a layer of black-colored blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to Fang Dong’s introduction, this Blood Demon cutlass was a weapon left behind by a Saint realm warrior called Chen Fei from a thousand years ago. The cutlass was extremely sharp and it's most terrifying ability was that it could suck blood! Sucking the enemy’s blood. The victims that fell under this cutlass, when they died, all the blood in their bodies would be sucked dry, akin to a mummified corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the warriors present in the auction hall heard that Demon Blood had the terrifying ability to suck the blood of the enemies, their eyes lit up noticeably. For them, who lived in the Bedlams where killings happened every day, a good weapon was essential for a higher chance of survival.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when Fang Dong revealed the bidding price for the cutlass, the majority of the warriors below drew a sharp intake of breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fifty million!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fifty million gold coins, and it was only the starting price!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although for some big forces and families the sum of fifty million wasn’t a lot, it still wasn’t like pebbles on the mountains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Fang Dong’s voice stopped, there were already people bidding: “Sixty million!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sixty million!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>An increase of ten million in an instant, the warriors turned to look at private room six.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sixty-one million!” While everyone was still in shock, another voice rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seventy million!” Private room six again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The price continued to go up and soon it broke one hundred million! Regardless what price others bid, the guest in private room six increased it by ten million each time. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire time, Huang Xiaolong sat calmly. Although the Blood Demon Cutlass seemed like a good weapon, to him, who possessed the Blades of Asura, bidding for Demon Blood was redundant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, the Demon Blood cutlass was bought by the private room number six for one hundred and ten million.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second auction item after the Demon Blood cutlass was a jade box containing three stalks of spirit herbsㅡLife Soul Grass, an extremely rare spirit herb. Every single one of those stalks of Life Soul Grass was above one thousand years old. The value of a stalk of Life Soul Herb older than one thousand years was immeasurable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Watching the three stalks of Life Soul Grass of the stage, Huang Xiaolong’s eyes brightened. If he took these three stalks of Life Soul Grass, his Ancient Puppetry Art and Soul Mandate cultivation could definitely have another breakthrough, doubling his spiritual force power, perhaps triple it or even more!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For these three stalks of Life Soul Grass, the starting price is thirty million each, all three are auctioned together at the starting price of ninety million.” Auctioneer Fang Dong briefly described the many uses of Life Soul Grass, at last stating that all three stalks of Life Soul Grass would be auctioned together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, unlike the previous time, the hall was silent. No one made any quick bid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the Life Soul Grass was a spirit herb greatly beneficial for the soul, one needed to complement its dosage with a spiritual force cultivation technique to reap any actual benefits. Otherwise, its effect would barely reach the minimum, moreover, there weren't many spiritual force cultivation techniques available. Therefore, not many people had any interest towards Life Soul Grass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One hundred million.” After a short silence, someone finally made a bid. Everyone in the hall turned to look, once again it was private room number six.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One hundred and ten million.” came a raise from the private room number seven.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One hundred fifty million.” private room number six.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One hundred fifty million! Private room number six spiked the price forty million higher, scaring everyone in the hall below. Shocked voices erupted in the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong remained taciturn, not showing any impatience to join in. However, at one hundred fifty million, private room number seven quieted down. It was clear that the expert within did not feel the three stalks of Life Soul Grass were worth one hundred and fifty million, despite their rarity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anyone else wishes to offer a higher price?” A short silence lapsed, auctioneer Fang Dong scanned the crowd and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All Fang Dong received was silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One hundred fifty million, once.” Seeing that no one was responded, Fang Dong declared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One hundred fifty million, twice.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>When the people present thought there won’t be anyone bidding, a voice suddenly rang out: “One hundred sixty million.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stunned, the people turned over to look at the source. Huang Xiaolong, who wanted to bid, was also surprised, for that person was Yao Fei!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong sneered coldly, he didn’t expect that Yao Fei would also be interested in these three stalks of Life Soul Grass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One hundred seventy million!” Huang Xiaolong’s voice sounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s voice, Yao Fei turned around, two pairs of eyes locked with ill-will.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One hundred eighty million.” Yao Fei made a bid, his eyes filled with frost glaring opposite him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One hundred ninety million.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Two hundred million.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong and Yao Fei’s voice sounded in the auction hall tit for tat, each increasing the bid by ten million every time, quickly hiking the price to two hundred million. By this time, private room six had stopped bidding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people in the hall were left dumbstruck as each expert tried to guess Huang Xiaolong and Yao Fei’s identities. After all, most big forces couldn’t simply chuck out two hundred million just to bid for three stalks of Life Soul Grass. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Two hundred and ten million!” Hearing Yao Fei increased the bid price to two hundred million, Huang Xiaolong called out, unperturbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strong killing intent flickered across Yao Fei’s eyes, his fingers dug into his palm, but they gradually relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Surprisingly, Yao Fei did not continue to bid, thus, in the end, Huang Xiaolong got the three stalks of Life Soul Grass for two hundred and ten million gold coins.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong kept the Life Soul Grass in the Asura Ring after he paid for them. His eyes looked at Yao Fei’s without much expression, he could naturally guess what Yao Fei was scheming. Most likely, Yao Fei planned to kill him after the auction, grabbing the Life Soul Grass at that time was just the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the Life Soul Grass, roughly twenty items were auctioned. Every item was rare and precious and bidding voices rang out endlessly in the auction hall, but despite that, neither Huang Xiaolong nor Yao Fei bid for anything else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Next, our auction item is grade one spirit stones.” After sealing the deal for some spirit wood, Fang Dong introduced the next item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grade one spirit stones!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong’s eyes lit up. Finally, they have brought up the grade one spirit stones, this was Huang Xiaolong’s main objective in attending this City of Myriad of Gods auction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grade one spirit stones’ value and usage, I believe everyone here already knows and I don't need to explain; this time, there is a total of fifty-nine pieces of grade one spirit stones, the bidding price starts at five hundred million.” Fang Dong’s voice rang out in the hall.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Five hundred million!</span></i><span style> Many experts in the auction hall couldn’t help but shudder when the amount was mentioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Five hundred million was considered a sky high price in the Bedlam Lands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Six hundred million.” At this time, Zhao Chen’s voice came from private room number nine.</span></p>
 <p><span style><em>Six hundred million!</em> The auction hall fell into immediate silence hearing Zhao Chen’s voice. &nbsp;</span></p>
