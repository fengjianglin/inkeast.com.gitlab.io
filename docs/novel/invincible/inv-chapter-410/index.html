 <p><b>Chapter 410: Such A Nice Fragrance!</b></p>
 <p><span>“Sovereign Chen won!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Our Sovereign Chen won!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Exuberant cheers erupted from the Asura’s Gate Domain Leaders, whereas Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu’s figures flickered, appearing where Huang Xiaolong was before, immediately searching for traces of Huang Xiaolong using their spiritual senses. Neither of them believed that Huang Xiaolong would be killed just like that.</span></p>
 <p><span>More accurately, they did not believe that Huang Xiaolong would be killed!</span></p>
 <p><span>Chen Tianqi snorted coldly at their reaction, “There’s no need to waste your effort to search, I can tell you straight, that Radiant World Destruction move of mine has killed an early Sixth Order Saint realm before this! I don’t believe that Huang Xiaolong has an immortal body, that a Fourth Order Saint realm is stronger than a Sixth Order Saint realm!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu’s faces were ashen at his words. A Sixth Order Saint realm died under Chen Tianqi’s Radiant World Destruction?! Yet, they could see that Chen Tianqi wasn’t bluffing.</span></p>
 <p><span>Did that mean… that Sovereign was really dead?!</span></p>
 <p><span>They had witnessed too many miracles happening on Huang Xiaolong’s body when they were with him, but still, Huang Xiaolong was no God, moreover, even God Realm masters in the ancient times had fallen.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu!” Chen Tianqi barked, “Now Huang Xiaolong is dead, I am the true Asura’s Gate Sovereign, kneel down and pay the proper salute to a Sovereign!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“No, Big brother won’t die! Big brother is not dead!” At this point, Lil’ Tian’s angry voice resounded, his face overtaken by grief. Then, Lil’ Tian suddenly struck a punch out at Chen Tianqi.</span></p>
 <p><span>Watching Lil’ Tian, Chen Tianqi thrust the angel spear in his hand toward him, a bright luminance energy beam shot out, hitting Lil’ Tian until he staggered back.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Little one, if you want to die I can fulfill your wish.” Chen Tianqi’s tone was filled with sarcasm, and the angel spear in his hand poised to strike Lil’ Tian again.</span></p>
 <p><span>Suddenly, a sharp light flashed in front of his eyes, the speed was nearly too quick for Chen Tianqi to react. His face paled, for the angel spear in his hand couldn’t make a counter in time.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Angel’s Almighty Shield!” A surge of bright holy power burst out from Chen Tianqi’s body, however, before the shield could fully form, that sharp light already arrived, slitting across his throat.</span></p>
 <p><span>His half raised spear halted in midair, feeling a coldness at his throat, a slight pain. His other hand reached up to touch his throat, blood was spurting like a gurgling spring.</span></p>
 <p><span>A light flickered and a silhouette appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Huang Xiaolong!” Chen Tianqi stared at the figure in front of him. Huang Xiaolong actually did not die after taking a hit from his Radiant World Destruction?!</span></p>
 <p><span>Below, on the Asura Square, the exuberant cheers from the Domain Leaders halted abruptly, all staring in Huang Xiaolong’s direction, watching their Sovereign Chen have his throat slit by someone else.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What, &nbsp;are you very disappointed that I didn’t die?” Huang Xiaolong cooked coldly at Chen Tianqi.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong had to admit that Chen Tianqi’s Radiant World Destruction was formidable. If he was really hit, tough as his physique was, he would still be gravely injured to the point of losing his life, but Huang Xiaolong had the Godly Mt. Xumi!</span></p>
 <p><span>The number one treasure on the Heavenly Treasure List, Godly Mt. Xumi!</span></p>
 <p><span>At the most critical moment, Huang Xiaolong entered the Godly Mt. Xumi, and borrowing the power from the Ten Buddha Formation, he withstood Chen Tianqi’s Radiant World Destruction.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Impossible!” Chen Tianqi roared with anger through gritted teeth. He refused to believe that Huang Xiaolong was able to live under his Radiant World Destruction attack! Practically unharmed at that!</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong sneered; in a flicker, his hands once again gripped the Blades of Asura.</span></p>
 <p><span>Chen Tianqi was startled, but he managed to react quickly, the battle angel spear stabbed toward Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Angel’s Kingdom!”</span></p>
 <p><span>As the spear raised, holy power burst out from it, transforming into an angel silhouette, spinning around, dispersing and restraining Huang Xiaolong’s attack.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong’s body shook, a shocked Chen Tianqi and a group of astonished Domain Leaders saw strands of true dragon energy flowing out from Huang Xiaolong’s body, turning into divine dragons.</span></p>
 <p><span>Ice, fire, winged, white, black, and Buddha; six divine dragons, six brilliant lights filled the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span>The angel formed from Chen Tianqi’s bright luminance power was immediately broken by the six dragons, its power dispersed.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong continued forth, the Blades of Asura in his hands slashed out, slitting Chen Tianqi’s throat a second time.</span></p>
 <p><span>Earlier, Huang Xiaolong saw it clearly, although his blades successfully slit Chen Tianqi’s throat, his healing power gradually spread around his throat, dispersing the Asura qi from the blades, fully healing the injury. Thus, Huang Xiaolong would not allow Chen Tianqi to heal a second time.</span></p>
 <p><span>This time, Huang Xiaolong beheaded Chen Tianqi. This slash totally separated Chen Tianqi’s head from his shoulders, throwing it high up in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span>Watching Chen Tianqi’s separated body, a sneer emerged on his face, he wanted to see how Chen Tianqi can recover this time! </span></p>
 <p><span>Both Chen Tianqi’s head and body plummeted to the Asura square from high up, his head rolled shakily towards the Domain Leaders’ feet.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Sovereign Chen!” They exclaimed in unison.</span></p>
 <p><span>Just as one of the Domain Leaders wanted to step forward to pick up Chen Tianqi’s head, the Poison Corpse Scarabs attacked him. Before the horrified faces of the other Domain Leaders, in barely a few breaths’ time, that man’s body was entirely submerged in the mass of Poison Corpse Scarabs, gnawed to the bones.</span></p>
 <p><span>Every one of them inhaled sharply, no one dared to take another step forward. </span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong flew back to the Asura Square, walking slowly toward Chen Tianqi’s head with a frigid cold gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span>A Saint realm warrior could remain alive as long as their soul was intact, and although Chen Tianqi’s head was cut off, he did not die, his head and body slowly moved toward each other, trying to combine again.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong did not speak, the Blades of Asura in his hands waved again, the true essence fire imbued within the attack pierced straight through Chen Tianqi’s eyebrows. A loud scream sounded as Chen Tianqi’s head bounced skyward from the impact. A moment later, Chen Tianqi’s scream grew weak.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Curious, aren’t you, why I didn’t die under your Radiant World Destruction attack?” Huang Xiaolong looked at Chen Tianqi’s eyes, his vitality dissipating rapidly, desperately hanging onto his last breath. Huang Xiaolong sniggered.</span></p>
 <p><span>Chen Tianqi both eyes stared intensely at Huang Xiaolong’s face. Up until this moment, he couldn’t understand how Huang Xiaolong withstood his most powerful attack, the Radiant World Destruction.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Because of the Godly Mt. Xumi.” Huang Xiaolong soft voice drawled in a whisper.</span></p>
 <p><span>Chen Tianqi’s eyes widened in surprise, shock, and astonishment, relying on his last feeble breath, Chen Tianqi’s words came out in short gasps, “Xu, God, you posses the Godly Mt. Xumi?!” Before getting an answer from Huang Xiaolong, his consciousness fell forever into darkness. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Looking at the dead Chen Tianqi, a relief spread through Huang Xiaolong as he secretly breathed out; finally, Chen Tianqi was dead!</span></p>
 <p><span>Chen Tianqi was his biggest obstacle in taking full control over the Asura’s Gate. Once Chen Tianqi was dead, the rest of the matter would be easier.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong’s expression remained impassive. He kept away Chen Tianqi’s corpse inside the Linglong Treasure with a hand wave, as food for the Poison Corpse Scarabs.</span></p>
 <p><span>Then, Huang Xiaolong came beside Lil’ Tian, that attack from Chen Tianqi earlier had gravely injured the little guy.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Big brother!” Seeing Huang Xiaolong, Lil’ Tian cried out happily. He was overjoyed that his Big brother was alive, he didn’t want to think about the future days without roast Tyrant Boar meat.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong smiled, “Little one, swallow this Nine Leaves Purple Grass.” He said as he took out a Nine Leaves Purple Grass from the Asura Ring.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Such a nice fragrance!” Lil’ Tian’s eyes lit up immediately as he sniffed the fragrant scent, little hands reached out and stuff the elixir into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong smiled helplessly at Lil’ Tian’s antics. This tens of thousands of years old rare herb was eaten like a dessert?</span></p>
 <p><span>Only after this did Huang Xiaolong turn around, looking at the group of Asura’s Gate Domain Leaders.</span></p>
