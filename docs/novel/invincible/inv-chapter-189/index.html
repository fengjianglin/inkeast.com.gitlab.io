 <p><b>Chapter 189: Duanren Institute Term Begins!</b></p>
 <p><span style>There were about twenty days or so before Duanren Institute’s new term began. Huang Xiaolong planned to swallow the Grade Seven Spirit Dan as well as the two high Grade Six Spirit Dans from the Imperial City Battle’s reward and cultivate to enhance his strength a little bit more before the term started.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without hesitation, Huang Xiaolong threw the grade seven, little round pellet into his mouth. An abundant source of battle qi essence instantly rushed into Huang Xiaolong’s meridians and Qi Sea. He swiftly ran Asura Tactics to refine and absorb them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Huang Xiaolong refined this grade seven pellet, the Black and Blue Dragon emerged, hovering above him and devouring spiritual energy while cultivating as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once Huang Xiaolong had broken into the Xiantian realm, his martial spirits condensed into solid entities, they could fight and cultivate too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only that, but in the last two days Huang Xiaolong had noticed it was possible for his twin dragon martial spirits to connect to the ancient Dragon Realm, absorbing ancient true dragon qi!</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the Black and Blue Dragon cultivated in the void above Huang Xiaolong, absorbing energy into their bodies, a golden reddish colored energy was seen rolling out from above. This was the aforementioned qi of a true dragon from ancient times!</span></p>
 <p><span style>True dragon qi gushed down from the void, half was absorbed by the twin dragons and the other half was transferred into Huang Xiaolong’s body, refined and absorbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>True dragon qi was one of the top grade innate spiritual energies formed in this world. It could be said to have the same grade as the netherworld spiritual energy from the underworld and was perhaps even higher by a small margin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the true dragon qi entered Huang Xiaolong and spread to every part of his body, Huang Xiaolong could detect significant changes. Whether it was his flesh or meridians, bones and tendons, or even his internal organs, everything was strengthening rapidly at a visible rate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The netherworld spiritual energy was also gushing down from the void simultaneously, being absorbed and refined by Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Huang Xiaolong continued to absorb more and more true dragon qi, it transformed into true dragon battle qi, coexisting in Huang Xiaolong’s meridians and Qi Sea with the netherworld battle qi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong’s meridians and Qi Sea once again expanded in size.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Huang Xiaolong’s meridians before stepping into the Xiantian realm were akin to a small creek of water, then his current meridians were like a creek that had expanded ten times into a big river. It was the same with his Qi Sea, expanding more than ten times the size it was before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he succeeded in breaking through to the Xiantian realm, the gas-like battle qi had fully converted into liquid form. The energy contained in one drop of battle qi easily surpassed one hundred cubic feet of gaseous battle qi by several-fold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three of them: Huang Xiaolong, Black Dragon and Blue Dragon, continued to absorb energy, refine it, and cultivate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time flowed by, one day passed. Then two days passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the blink of an eye, half a month had gone by. It took that much time for Huang Xiaolong to fully refine the grade seven pellet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the course of that half month, Huang Xiaolong was initially close to breaking through to mid-Xiantian First Order strength. But with the aid of the grade seven pellet, he then had successive breakthroughs into mid-Xiantian First Order, peak mid-Xiantian First Order, and finally, late-Xiantian First Order!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Late-Xiantian First Order!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The grade seven pellet was refined from a Xiantian Eighth Order expert. In short, it could be said Huang Xiaolong </span><i><span style>devoured</span></i><span style> a Xiantian Eighth Order warrior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, Huang Xiaolong was disappointed. He expected that he would at least reach peak late-Xiantian First Order after refining that grade seven pellet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However in the next moment Huang Xiaolong shook his head wryly, feeling that he was too greedy. How long had it been since he had broken into the Xiantian realm? No more than two months! If it was someone else, it would probably take them ten years, maybe even longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taking a deep breath, Huang Xiaolong adjusted his mood and took out the two high Grade Six Spirit Dans rewarded from the Imperial City Battle competition. He popped both of them into his mouth at once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even so, the combined energy from these two pellets was considerably weaker than that single grade seven pellet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Night turned to day and day into night. Ten days came and went by the time Huang Xiaolong had finished refining the two high Grade Six Spirit Dans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Huang Xiaolong remained at late Xiantian FIrst Order even after consuming the pills, unable to succeed in breaking through to the peak late-Xiantian First Order stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Grade Six and Seven Spirit Dan were very rare and valuable, as well as beneficial towards one’s increase in battle qi and cultivation, there were limits to its advantages. Otherwise, wouldn’t younger generations of those superfamilies be swallowing Grade Five and Grade Six Spirit Dan’s to enhance themselves endlessly?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The various disciples and geniuses that enhanced their cultivation by relying heavily on taking a large number of spirit pellets forsook a solid foundation. Moreover, every stage of battle qi breakthrough was difficult. Most of these superfamilies geniuses were stuck at peak late-Xiantian First Order or peak late-Xiantian Second Order, unable to step into the Third Order for the longest time. This was mainly due to their weak foundation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he ended his meditation session, Huang Xiaolong counted to himself. There were two more days until the start of the new term at Duanren Institute. Thus he did not exit the ancient battlefield. Once again, Huang Xiaolong continued his attempt to cultivate Asura Tactics and the Body Metamorphose Scripture simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another two days passed amidst Huang Xiaolong’s attempt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Running both techniques together was much smoother for Huang Xiaolong than before. If things continued to progress in this manner, it wouldn’t take long before he could fully run them at the same time unimpeded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfied, Huang Xiaolong exited the ancient battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Outside of the ancient battlefield dimensional space, the sky began to brighten as the sun slowly rose on the horizon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong strode towards the estate manor’s great hall, instructing one of the slave servants to call Zhao Shu, Yu Ming, and Fei Hou to the great hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moments later, the three of them arrived at the great hall. Huang Xiaolong motioned them to sit after their greetings. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>When all four of them were seated, Huang Xiaolong asked Fei Hou about the progress of the Huang Family’s migration to Duanren Imperial City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sovereign, members of the Huang Family are already on the way to the Imperial City, passing the Baolong Kingdom. But with their speed, they will need a few more months before arriving in Duanren Imperial City.” Fei Hou replied respectfully. “They are being escorted by Senior Brother Haotian and a group of Marshal Mansion’s guards. Their safety is in good hands.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong nodded. Then, he looked over towards Yu Ming, “Yu Ming, I must trouble you to rush over and join up with them.” Despite the fact that Marshal Haotian and the Mansion guards were with his family, Huang Xiaolong was not reassured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Sovereign!” Yu Ming acknowledged the order with the usual respect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the situation on Yao Fei’s side?” Huang Xiaolong continued.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Hou laughed as he answered, “Yao Fei is still looking for that black-clad old man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Shu added, “If he knew that old man was already ‘eaten’ by Sovereign, he’d surely vomit blood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Shu’s comment triggered a burst of laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong stood up and said, “Today’s the start of Duanren Institute’s new term. I’m going over to have a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sovereign, I shall go with you.” Zhao Shu stood up and stated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong shook his head: “No need.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There wouldn’t be any big danger within the Duanren Institute’s grounds. Furthermore, Huang Xiaolong didn’t wish to rely on Zhao Shu’s protection all the time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, Zhao Shu no longer said anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hence, Zhao Shu and Fei Hou stayed behind in Southern Hill Estate to handle the Nine Tripod Commerce’s shift to the Imperial City while Yu Ming set off to meet up with the Huang Family group so as to ensure they arrived safely in Duanren Empire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Exiting Southern Hill Estate, Huang Xiaolong made his way to Duanren Institute by himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duanren Institute was located in the center of Duanren Imperial City. Because he was walking, Huang Xiaolong took a little over an hour to arrive at the Institute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he reached the main gates of the Institute, a sea of people were already waiting there. After all, it was the first day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duanren Institute was Duanren Empire’s top academy. Herein gathered the most talented geniuses from over one thousand of Duanren Empire’s fealty kingdoms. Each person from these kingdoms was an extraordinary talent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huang Xiaolong!” Just as Huang Xiaolong arrived at Duanren Institute’s square, a happy voice called his name.</span></p>
