 <p><b>Chapter 221: Journeying to the Blessed Buddha Empire</b></p>
 <p><span style>Faint pain snaked through Huang Xiaolong’s heart as he thought of Li Lu!</span></p>
 <p><span style>His hands clenched into tight fists as sharp determination flashed in his eyes. An intense energy exploded from Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Yao Family blocked him, he destroyed the Yao Family!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Deities Templar blocks his path, he will destroy them just the same!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A day will come when he will make sure Deities Templar ends the same way as the Yao Family!</span></p>
 <p><span style>That day will come! Huang Xiaolong was resolute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If things went according to his previous plan, he would enter Deities Templar’s ranks during their disciple selection in about seven years time and then slowly gain control from within. If it went well, not only could he be with Li Lu, he would have the chance to enter and cultivate in the Divine World!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he now vowed to destroy Deities Templar one day!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yao Fei, even if you have Deities Templar behind you, you’d better flee to the ends of the world. I will kill you with my own hands!</span></i><span style> Huang Xiaolong’s murderous aura peaked as the thought reverberated in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The priority now was to enhance his strength, frantically, as fast as he could. Otherwise, before he could even destroy Deities Templar, a mere Yao Fei was enough to pulverize him into nothing!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He must break through to the Saint realm!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first step, break into the Saint realm, then kill Yao Fei!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless of the uphill battle on the path leading to the Saint realm, then the God Realm, he was determined to walk down that road!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Saint realm! </span></i><span style>Huang Xiaolong repeated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong was jolted by one hard fact while witnessing the battles in Duanren Institute with his own eyes between Zhao Shu, Li Molin, Emperor Duanren, as well as the other Saint realms experts―all was futile before a Saint realm warrior. The Saint realm was a paramount strength. In the eyes of those people, you were nothing but an ant on the ground even if you were a peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order expert!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now that Mom and Dad are safe, I should journey to the Blessed Buddha Empire in the next few days!” This trip to the Blessed Buddha Empire was inevitable and, like the Absolute Soul Pearl, he absolutely had to find and rein in the Godly Mt. Xumi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Converging his thoughts and emotions, Huang Xiaolong initiated the God Binding Ring and entered the ancient battlefield to practice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One month had passed since the Yao Manor was razed to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Huang Xiaolong exited the ancient battlefield and came to the great hall, his parents, Huang Peng and Su Yan, and both younger siblings, Huang Min and Huang Xiaohai, were there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Other than them, there were six other guestsㅡGuo Tai, Guo Shiyuan, Guo Chen, Guo Shiwen, Guo Zhi, and Guo Fei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amiable sounds of chatter and laughs sounded in the great hall, which halted awkwardly the instant the people within saw Huang Xiaolong walking in. Nearly everyone jumped to their feet, and the six members of Guo Family were apprehensive, including their Guo Family’s Ancestor, Guo Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young, Young Noble Huang!” Guo Family’s Ancestor, Guo Chen stepped forward, greeting Huang Xiaolong in a deferential manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong glanced at Guo Chen and nodded indifferently. However, Guo Chen was feeling flattered that Huang Xiaolong was willing to nod at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong approached Huang Peng and Su Yan, greeting: “Father, Mother.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both exposed a brilliant smile on their faces, “Xiaolong, you’re here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong nodded and persuaded them to sit as he walked towards the master seat in the hall. Only after he had sat down did Guo Chen and the Guo Family’s side, Huang Min, and Huang Xiaohai return to their places.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaolong, the Guo Family came over today to discuss Guo Tai and Huang Min’s wedding.” After sitting down, Su Yan broached the topic with a smile on her face, “Senior Guo Chen said everything related to the wedding, from time, to other preparations will follow our wishes. What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Chen swiftly emphasized his willingness, “Yes, yes. The purpose of our visit today is to discuss the preparations for Guo Tai and Huang Min’s wedding, what does Young Noble Huang think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Tai stood up from his seat with completely tensed nerves..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong observed his younger sister Huang Min and noted that she too was looking at him nervously, hope and anticipation apparent on her small face as she waited for him to speak. She had heard about the conflict between the Guo Family and her Big brother. She also knew about Guo Tai’s father, Guo Shiyuan, announcing the dissolution of her engagement with Guo Tai due to coercion from Guo Shiwen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Min was fearful the word coming out from Huang Xiaolong’s mouth would be no.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If her big bro Huang Xiaolong disagreed, her relationship with Guo Tai would end without question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the silent hall, Guo Tai suddenly fell to his knees and kowtowed before Huang Xiaolong, “Big bro Huang, I implore you, I’m sincere towards Huang Min. If you allow us to be married, I swear I will treat her well and protect her with all my heart. I will use my life to love and protect her and definitely won’t allow Huang Min to be wronged or unhappy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Shiyuan also dropped onto his knees, “Young Noble Huang, the wrongdoer was me. You can punish me, but this matter is not related to Tai’er.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Guo Shiwen followed suit. Seeing their father’s action, Guo Zhi and Guo Fei also knelt down on their knees in a frantic manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big brother... Guo Tai, he… ” Huang Min couldn’t resist speaking up as she looked pleadingly at Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong sighed in his heart, barely nodding as he replied to Huang Min. “This matter, you decide with Dad and Mom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, both Huang Min and Guo Tai’s face lit up. Huang Xiaolong’s meaning was evidentㅡhe agreed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This also eased the heavy boulder weighing on Guo Chen’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Huang Xiaolong looked at Guo Tai, “However, if you fail to do what you claim and make Huang Min unhappy in the future, you know the consequences!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big brother Huang, be rest assured that I will love and take care of Huang Min with my life and will not let her feel aggrieved!” Guo Tai vowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong nodded then remained in the great hall for a short while before heading back to his yard. There, he called for Zhang Fu, Zhao Shu, Yu Ming, Fei Hou, and Marshal Haotian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When all were gathered, Huang Xiaolong spoke of his plans to travel to Blessed Buddha Empire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>What?</span></i><span style> Sovereign, you plan to go to Blessed Buddha Empire alone?!” Zhang Fu, Zhao Shu, and everyone else was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Correct.” Huang Xiaolong nodded, attesting his decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sovereign, this- !” Zhang Fu and Zhao Shu exchanged a glance and wanted to dissuade but Huang Xiaolong shook his head and spoke decisively, “Say no more, I’ve made my decision. I’ll travel to Blessed Buddha Empire alone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, Zhang Fu and the rest no longer said anything. The things Huang Xiaolong came to a decision on would not change. Neither Zhang Fu nor Zhao Shu could make him change his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m leaving the Southern Hill Estate and the rest in your hands.” Huang Xiaolong continued, “Yu Ming and Fei Hou, both of you handle the Nine Tripod Commerce. If there’s anything you cannot decide, then leave it to Zhang Fu and Zhao Shu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please rest assured Sovereign!” The five answered in unison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haotian, I’ve troubled you in taking care of them all the way from Luo Tong Kingdom till here.” Huang Xiaolong said to Marshal Haotian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sovereign, this is something Subordinate should do.” Haotian insisted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong nodded and delegated a few more tasks to them. A short while later, everyone dispersed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When everyone had left, Huang Xiaolong thought of the little violet monkey. According to Marshal Haotian, the little violet monkey had traveled with them all the way from Luo Tong Kingdom. However, when they were attacked by Yao Fei’s subordinates, the Huang Family were abducted, whereas the little violet monkey went missing.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I hope the little guy is alright. </span></i><span style>Huang Xiaolong thought inwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three days passed quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In these three days, Huang Xiaolong tried to spend more time with his parents and siblings, only then did they find out Huang Xiaolong would be journeying to Blessed Buddha Empire. Although they were reluctant to part, especially Huang Peng and Su Yan, they knew there was something important their son needed to do, thus neither said anything more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Min and Guo Tai’s wedding was set for the next year, at the end of the yearㅡa day before the Chinese New Year.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Huang Xiaolong’s plan went smoothly, he could very likely make it back in time to attend Huang Min and Guo Tai’s wedding at the end of the next year.</span></p>
