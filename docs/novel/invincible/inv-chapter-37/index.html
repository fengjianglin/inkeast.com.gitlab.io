 <p><b>Chapter 37: Notify The Duke’s Mansion</b></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that both Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou had ignored his loud warning and remained standing in the middle of the pathway, the captain of the guards stopped yelling and decided that he couldn’t be bothered. The lives of two penniless commoners didn’t matter even if they died. Things like this happened every other day in the Luo Tong Kingdom, it was nothing new.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A blood-thirsty light flickered in the eyes of the yellow-robed young man, Meng Xia, and he urged his mount to go even faster when he saw that two people were blocking his way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the guards looked on with frightened expressions on their faces, Meng Xia’s Horned Rhino had gotten to Huang Xiaolong, and in just a matter of seconds, Xiaolong would have been sent flying from the impact. At the last second, Fei Hou moved. A long sword had already appeared in his hand, and with a swing of his arm, many rays of sword light danced out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Roar!” the bloodcurdling screams from the Horned Rhinos were heard and then everyone noticed that the Horned Rhino was no longer charging forward; its legs could no longer support its weight and it tumbled forward. Blood spurted from its body like a geyser eruption and Meng Xia was thrown off its back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Horned Rhinos following behind were no exception; once they had reached within ten meters of Huang Xiaolong, they all tumbled with blood spurting from their wounds and their riders were thrown off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The beasts wails lasted for a short while and as the tremors ceased, only the moans of the yellow-robed young man could be heard. The Guard Captain and the other guards were stunned at the sight of the fallen Horned Rhinos’ twitching in a pool of their own blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Guard Captain felt his throat dry up as he stared at Fei Hou in horror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, Meng Xia, the yellow-robed young man, got up with difficulty and was extremely angered when he saw his beloved mount lying in a pool of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pointing at Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou in anger, he yelled, “Rebels! Rebels! You cheap lowly commoners dared to kill my mount, you deserve to die! Kill them for me! No, wait! First, cut off their hands, then their legs and feed them to the dogs!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The yellow-robed young man’s guards crawled up, and when they heard their young master’s order, they quickly pulled out their swords and rushed up together. In Royal City, only they harassed the commoners and never the other way round; yet today, they didn’t know where these two crept out from that they actually dared to kill their mounts!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The attacks from the guards were ruthless; each slash was intended to maim. It seemed that they planned to first cut off Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou’s arms and then the legs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Hou’s eyes turned cold and snorted. He stood still as he raised up his sword and once again waved it sending out sharp rays of sword light which snaked through the group of incoming guards. An agonizing scream sounded every time a light flickered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before the very eyes of the city gate guards, a flurry of arms shot up to the sky and before falling to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My hand, my hand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My hand’s cut off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guards cried out in pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Initially, the angered yellow-robed young man who ordered his guards to dismember Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou stiffened, followed by fear, and panic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Hou walked slowly walked over his direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Terrified, the yellow-robed Meng Xia retreated, saying “You fellows are just a bunch of dirty, worthless nobodies, what do you think you’re doing?! I am the young master of the Duke’s Mansion! If you dare hurt even a strand of my hair, you will die like dogs!” He wasn’t bluffing, someone once wounded him just slightly, and both the man and his entire family of more than a hundred people were killed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurt a strand of your hair?” Fei Hou expression remained unchanged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without warning, Fei Hou’s sword suddenly slashed out and a ray of sword light swirled around Meng Xia’s head. &nbsp;Meng Xia shrieked in fright, his body quivering, as Fei Hou sheathed his long sword; then, Huang Xiaolong noticed an acrid smell. Looking at the yellow-robed young man, Huang Xiaolong saw the lower half of his body was wet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Urine flowed down as he screamed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing a Duke Mansion disciple act so cowardly, he smirked saying, “Little brat, don’t worry, I won’t kill you. You aren’t dead yet!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the young man heard that, he opened his eyes and realized that his head was still attached and his was neck is fine too. Only his hair was shaved off by Fei Hou’s sword and he had become bald!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A breeze blew past, and his scalp felt cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meng Xia’s heart seemed to shiver uncontrollably like it was going to burst out from his chest, his back dampened by cold sweat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The next time you insult my Young Master, calling him a dirty commoner, it won’t be just your hair. I will cut away your scalp layer by layer!” said Fei Hou as he stared coldly at the young man, letting the words sink in one by one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meng Xia stood there dazedly; he had been frightened senseless by Fei Hou using a sword to shave off his hair. Fei Hou went back to Huang Xiaolong, and asked, “Young Master, are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m okay.” Huang Xiaolong nodded and said, “Let’s go, we’re entering the city!” He turned and walked towards the city gates. When he passed by the Guard Captain, he stopped and with a cold expression, he asked, “Do you still want admission fees?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Guard Captain immediately knelt down, begging for mercy: “No no no no, don’t want! Little Ancestor, mercy, spare my life!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was so frightened that he even used the honorific ‘Little Ancestor’ when addressing Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong asked yet another question, “Am I still a lowly, dirty commoner?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Guard Captain shook his head vigorously, shaking his hands: “No, no, no, Little Ancestor, you are </span><i><span style>the</span></i><span style> highest of nobility, a true noble!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I’m a noble, then what about him?” asked Huang Xiaolong as he suddenly pointed at the yellow-robed young man whose robes were still dripping with piss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Guard Captain face reddened not knowing how to answer and Fei Hou glared at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The glare made the Guard Captain weak with fright, his butt muscles loosened and he let out a loud fart, before quickly saying, “He, he is the dirty, cheap commoner!” The moment the words left his mouth he almost wanted to die; as a Guard Captain he actually dared utter such blasphemy against a young master of the Duke household! If the matter spread to the Duke’s ears, he would definitely lose his job, but he wondered if his life could be kept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about you?” asked Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m a dog; I’m just a dog!” With his face as a pale as a white sheet, the Guard Captain answered and kept repeating it, over and over again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong expression turned indifferent as he turned around and walked away, continuing towards the city with Fei Hou following at his side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou’s silhouettes had gone far away, the Guard Captain’s legs gave out, he sat his arse on the ground with an ugly expression, as if he had just swallowed dog shit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other guards looked at him with concern; one them came to his side and whispered, “Captain, about Young Master Meng Xia… Should we inform the Duke’s Mansion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All this time, the yellow-robed young man still stood in a daze on the same spot and around him were all the guards who lost their arms still moaning in pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Inform the Duke’s Mansion?” Hearing this, the Guard Captain jumped up: “Yes, yes, yes, inform the Duke’s Mansion!” At this time the Guard Captain’s eyes burned with hatred staring at Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou’s receding figure. “You dirty commoners actually dared to hurt the Duke Mansion’s Young Master; I will let you taste the consequences!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou had already stepped into the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master, don’t worry. A Duke’s Mansion? Nothing will happen.” Fei Hou assured Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. He knew that since Fei Hou had acted like this, it meant that he had aces under his sleeves. Even though he didn’t intend to rely solely on Fei Hou’s strength, since Fei Hou said so, then he was sure nothing would happen.</span></p>
