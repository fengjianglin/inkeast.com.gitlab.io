 <p><b>Chapter 200: Just Now Was A Misunderstanding</b></p>
 <p><span style>A paltry little Huang Family smelly pissant!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The instant Guo Zhi’s voice fell, a silhouette flickered in front of him and the next thing he knew was that his neck was being strangled by a powerful hand!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The owner of the hand was none other than Huang Xiaolong. Huang Xiaolong’s right hand stretched out and clawed onto Guo Zhi’s neck, lifting him off the street. Emotionless eyes looked at Guo Zhi as a terrifying wave of killing aura whorled unrestrained from Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Zhi was a peak mid-Xiantian Second Order expert, and he never expected Huang Xiaolong to be foolish enough to attack him. In close proximity and caught off guard, he was denied the chance of dodging.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You!” Guo Zhi’s face turned maroon from having his neck pinched and cutting off his airway. His eyes bulged out of their sockets akin to a desiccated fish pulled out of water that could flip over and die at any second. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Fei and the rest of the Guo Family guards and servants watched dazedly as Guo Zhi was lifted off the street by Huang Xiaolong, failing to respond to the situation. After all, they had never encountered this kind of incident.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, when Guo Zhi and Guo Fei roamed around the Imperial City with the guards and servants while looking for entertainment, the commoners and even some of the noble families’ younger generation would avoid them, moving as far away as possible. It had always been the brothers clutching others by the throat. A reverse situation had never happened, disregarding the fact that even a single hair on their body was deemed so precious that no one even dared to touch them!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big brother!” Moments later, Guo Fei finally reacted. Calling out to his brother, he then turned angrily towards Huang Xiaolong, screaming, “Huang bastard, how dare you! Why are you not releasing my Big brother this instant?! If you don’t, I will annihilate your nine generations!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Annihilate your nine generations!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Big words may have been spoken but Guo Fei wasn’t lying. For a large family like the Guo Family in the Duanren Empire territories, to annihilate the nine generations of a small family was nothing more difficult than releasing a fart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Almost in the same moment Guo Fei’s voice ended, a shadow flickered. Huang Xiaolong’s left palm stretched out, clenching Guo Fei’s neck and raising him up in the air the same way he did with Guo Zhi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like Guo Zhi, Guo Fei’s neck and face turned a deep shade of burgundy in less than a second with protruded eyes nearly leaving their sockets. Overwhelmed and scared, Guo Fei’s arms and legs swung wildly, he wanted to speak but the words were stuck in his throat. No logical words could be made out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Guo Family guards and servants saw Huang Xiaolong holding Guo Zhi and Guo Fei in each hand, raised to the air. All of them were first stupefied, then angered, but at the same time afraid Huang Xiaolong would hurt their Young Lords, thus no one dared to make bold actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, these guards bellowed a rain of empty threats at Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little brat, do you know who our Young Lords are? If you know what’s good for you, immediately release them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If a single hair from our Young Lords is hurt, be prepared to die without a burial place!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guards clamored and threatened, they could only repeat the same few sentences.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the Guo Family guards and servants passionately shouted threats, Huang Xiaolong’s gaze sharpened like a sacred blade cutting through them. A single glance and the Guo Family side’s lackeys curled up in fright, effectively shutting them up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Huang Xiaolong exerted a little more pressure in his hands. Both Guo Zhi and Guo Fei kicked even more desperately, eyeballs straining out as their hands flailed and grasped Huang Xiaolong’s hand at their throat. It was apparent to those present that they were suffering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But this time, none of the people from the Guo Family camp dared to say anything, realizing at this point that all their clamor had been a futile effort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pedestrians on the streets started to slow down, congregating into a small crowd that stared flabbergasted at Huang Xiaolong… and the two people in his hands that were lifted up in the airㅡGuo Zhi and Guo Fei, the Guo Brothers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of the commoners and noble families recognized Guo Zhi and Guo Fei, and because they recognized the two brothers they were flabbergasted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was actually someone daring enough to lift the Guo Zhi and Gui Fei brothers up in the air by their necks?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s that brat? He dares hit both of the Guo Brothers?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He seems to be Huang Xiaolong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huang Xiaolong?! The champion of this year’s Imperial City Battle,</span><i><span style> that Huang Xiaolong?”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Discussions broke out from the surrounding crowd on the street.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ignoring the crowd of people, Huang Xiaolong looked at Guo Zhi and Guo Fei. Their eyes were starting to roll back, mostly showing the whites. Without a doubt, they were drawing their last breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he felt the timing was right, Huang Xiaolong swung his arms, throwing the two outward in midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miserable cries sounded as Guo Zhi and Guo Fei crashed into the street, rolling for more than a dozen meters before coming to a stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Lord!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Guo Family guards and servants had their nerves stretched tautly, each swiftly running to Guo Zhi and Guo Fei’s side, helping them up from the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to the extreme pressure Huang Xiaolong exerted on their throats, after being helped up by the guards and servants, their complexions were white and green for a while. Both coughed nonstop as they stood up. On each of their necks was a clear bruise of a purple-green handprint.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For Guo Tai’s sake, I won’t kill you today, so scram!” Huang Xiaolong glared at them, his cold voice that sent a chill down the spine rang in the street.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And what Huang Xiaolong said was the truth. If it wasn’t for the fact that he’d be looking at Guo Tai’s face as his future brother-in-law, he’d erase them without hesitation here and now. But, Huang Xiaolong’s words in Guo Zhi and Guo Fei’s ears were an insult to them, an unforgivable insult.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were downright being humiliated!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rubbing the bruise on their necks, their eyes glowered venomously at Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill him, kill this fucking dog bastard for me!” When his throat eased a little, Guo Zhi roared as he pointed at Huang Xiaolong, akin to a rabid dog.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t care who does it, but kill Huang Xiaolong and you’ll be rewarded with ten million gold!” Guo Fei followed, hollering his reward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Guo Fei’s words were spoken, the people on the streets looked astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some of the passersby were tempted. Kill Huang Xiaolong, and you get ten million gold!</span></p>
 <p><span style>To the smaller forces and family, ten million gold was an astronomical wealth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By this point, the Guo Family guards and servants had drawn their weapons on them, attacking Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Watching this group of people coming at him, Huang Xiaolong snickered. When these Guo Family guards reached Huang Xiaolong and wanted to attack, Zhao Shu and Fei Hou moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Hou leaped up and in a flicker, a dazzling silver river materialized in the air above. Spiraling in the air, an enormous battle qi energy rushed out, blocking the Guo Family guards and servants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Shu stood where he was, raised his arm and struck out a palm. The crowd watched as the Guo Family guards and servants were sent flying like they were hit by a great tidal wave, vomiting blood in large amounts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a split second, the entire street was dead silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A sharp intake of breaths ensued as the attention shifted onto Zhao Shu who was standing behind Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of these Guo Family guards were Xiantian experts. It was a given that most of them were only Xiantian First and Second Order experts, but they had coordinated a combined attack! Nonetheless, they were defeated by the unassuming middle-aged man standing behind Huang Xiaolong; sent flying with just one palm, there were no exceptions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The earlier experts that were tempted to take on Guo Fei's reward of ten million gold had cold sweat trickling down their foreheads, a chilly breeze brushed passed their backs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Zhi and Guo Fei were as shocked as the rest of them. An indescribable disbelief covered their faces as they surveyed the street littered with the guards and servants that came out with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong’s countenance grew colder than ever as his gaze fell on the brothers. His feet raised, and step by step, he walked towards Guo Zhi and Guo Fei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only in this moment did reality hit them. Watching Huang Xiaolong approach, fear filled them, causing them to retreat subconsciously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaolong, Bro Xiaolong, it’s a misunderstanding. Just now was simply a misunderstanding.” Guo Zhi forced an ugly smile on his face, waving his hands in emphasis. The quiver in his voice was noticeable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes, that’s right, a misunderstanding. We didn’t really mean that.” Guo Fei too forced himself to smile amiably, it was just that the expression on his face looked uglier than crying.</span></p>
