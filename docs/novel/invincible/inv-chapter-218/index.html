 <p><b>Chapter 218: Deities Templar Appearing Again</b></p>
 <p><span style>In the same moment that other people considered this possibility about the Golden Token in Huang Xiaolong’s hand, the same thought hit Yao Fei! His heart raced with unease.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If the Golden Token in Huang Xiaolong’s hand was truly given by Emperor Duanren, then… ?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong nodded towards Emperor Duanren and Duan Wuhen, “No need to be overly courteous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Emperor Duanren breathed in relief at those words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it only made the others sweat even more. In their eyes, it seemed like Emperor Duanren was afraid Huang Xiaolong and Zhao Shu would blame him?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong’s attention returned to Yao Fei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this time Yao Fei’s reaction was calmer than before, laughing he said, “Huang Xiaolong, I didn’t expect for the Golden Token in your hands to be given to you by Emperor Duanren.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no hatred, no killing intent, and no surprise on Yao Fei’s face. It seemed as if Huang Xiaolong and Zhao Shu were still nothing in his eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong felt a little strange about Yao Fei’s sudden change in demeanor but he wasn’t concerned about it. He sneered coldly, “This is your last chance, speak, where are my parents!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Fei sneered coldly in reply, “I’m also saying for the last time, kill me and your parents will accompany me to hell! Moreover, Huang Xiaolong, do you think you’ve won now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Killing intent peaked in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. With a twist, the Blades of Asura emerged in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since it’s like this, then you, go die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blades swung out. Sharp cold blade lights glinted, aiming at Yao Fei’s neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Watching as the slash was about to draw blood on Yao Fei’s neck, a change suddenly occurred. Some distance away, a green light pierced through the air at terrifying speed as the wind howled, causing ripples across space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Shu’s face tightened as he moved himself to block in front of Huang Xiaolong. At the same time, one hand struck out to counter the incoming bright green light and he cautioned, “Young Lord, careful!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Shu’s palm strike crashed against the bright green light, the impact shook the space, raising turbulent air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong swiftly retreated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the blink of an eye, seven unfamiliar silhouettes appeared on the square.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed when he saw them. Standing at the front of the seven person group wasㅡLi Molin!</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were six people behind Li Molin, and one of them was the very same Ao Baixue he previously encountered! Another one of the six wore the Yao Family’s robe but there was something different compared to the rest of the Yao Family’s disciples. On the chest area of this person’s robe was a double-headed</span><a href="http://www.baike.com/wiki/%E8%B5%A4%E7%84%B0%E5%85%BD" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style> Scarlet Flame Mythical Beast</span></a><span style>. Judging from his attire, this person should be the Yao Family’s Ancestor, Yao Shan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The instant Li Molin and her group stepped foot on the square, an overwhelming pressure enveloped the entire Heartless Square. It was so powerful that the weaker students and teachers couldn’t help but to withdraw far away in fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Shan surveyed the surrounding and frowned when he saw Yao Fei’s face in various shades of dark green feces. A spark of killing intent flew across his eyes; he lifted his hands and wanted to disperse Zhao Shu’s space manipulation around Yao Fei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, when his Saint power came into contact with Yao Fei’s body, a spiral of dazzling light shone out from Yao Fei’s body, instantly repelling Yao Shan’s power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Fei was dumbfounded at the result.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Molin acted, waving her hands and successfully breaking the space law restriction on Yao Fei’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Able to move again, Yao Fei hurried forward to salute Li Molin, “Greeting Elder Li and other Seniors!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stand up.” Li Molin said without any expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Fei got up and walked over to Yao Shan: “Ancestor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Shan nodded, his eyes looked over at Huang Xiaolong, “This brat did it?” he asked, a finger indicated at the colorful beard of feces on Yao Fei’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Ancestor!” Yao Fei glared viciously at Huang Xiaolong, “It was this punk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong watched on. He didn’t expect for the Yao Family to be connected to Deities Templar, and from the looks of it, the connection wasn’t shallow?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Otherwise, it wouldn’t be possible for the Yao Family’s Ancestor to be capable of requesting help from Li Molin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huang Xiaolong, I didn’t expect that we would be meeting again so soon.” Li Molin spoke with the same indifferent tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong used the same tone, “I didn’t expect it either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Molin’s gaze moved to Zhao Shu, Emperor Duanren, Guo Chen, and the other Saint experts, stating, “I want to take Yao Fei and leave here now, no objections right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone kept silent, not one person spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Emperor Duanren’s brows furrowed but held his silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the Saint realm experts present were very well aware in their hearts of what Deities Templar represented. Even Duan Ren hoped that Duan Wuhen would be selected as a Deities Templar disciple in their coming selection.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yao Fei must die today, here, in this place!” In the heavy silence, a sharp voice cut through.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was stunned. The person who spoke was none other than Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Molin was stunned for a second before giggling vigorously, but her chest was lacking in volume, therefore, there wasn’t much of a tremor no matter how hard she giggled herself silly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Molin’s giggles subsided and she smiled faintly at Huang Xiaolong, “Little one, do you know who you’re talking to? Young man, sometimes you must consider carefully before speaking out, or you’ll only end up being seen as an idiot spouting nonsense! Or you’ll provoke a disaster upon yourself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong looked the sheepish smile on Li Molin’s face, a strong feeling of disgust gave rise in his heart. Even though Li Molin suddenly appeared and took Li Lu away from the terrible situation she was in, Huang Xiaolong did not exactly feel at ease. However, at this moment, he was truly disgusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only did he feel disgust towards Li Molin, but rather Deities Templar as a whole!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This feeling of disgust increased rapidly!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill!” Huang Xiaolong gave an order, his cold voice echoed in the silent square.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The instant Huang Xiaolong spoke, Zhao Shu moved. In a flicker, he blurred and disappeared without the slightest fluctuation. When Zhao Shu disappeared, Li Molin also disappeared. In the next second, thunderous impacts resounded in the space high above, spreading down to the square.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every clash sounded like an angry thunderbolt, causing sharp pain to everyone’s shaking eardrums.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Apprehension filled the people below.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seizing the opportunity, Ao Baixue and the Yao Family’s Ancestor leaped out, targeting Huang Xiaolong with a lethal palm attack. The force from the palm flooded out like tidal waves. Seeing that Huang Xiaolong was about to be hit a silhouette flickered, blocking their path. Raising both hands, that person repelled both of Yao Shan and Ao Baixue’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taken by surprise, both were thrown back from the force of the impact. Failing to land steadily on their feet, both of them wobbled unbecomingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duan Ren, you actually dared to interfere in Deities Templar’s matters, aren’t you afraid Duanren Empire will face destruction?!” Ao Baixue bellowed in fury.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person who stood out to block them was none other than Emperor Duanren.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Duan Ren scoffed, “Yes, Deities Templar is very strong, but it’s not so easy to annihilate my Duanren Empire!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Angered, Ao Baixue flew out attacking Emperor Duanren whereas Yao Shan and the other four Deities Templar’s experts each fought with one of Duanren Institute’s Saint realm experts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the people fighting were Saint realm experts. Each attack brought with it a powerful force of destruction that whirled out in all directions and crumbled building structures, causing Duan Wuhen and the other student experts to retreat in haste. A battle between Saint realm experts was not something they were qualified to take part in. This even included someone like Yu Ming who was left with no other option but to retreat while protecting Huang Xiaolong, forced to watch the fight from a distance away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the aftershocks originating from Zhao Shu’s fight, the crumbled Heartless Hall had already turned to dust and disappeared with the wind. The stones that overlaid the square flipped over, shattering into sand and dust, pulverized into powder. Cracks and fissures started to line the grounds surface and gas spewed out from beneath the surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cracks even appeared in the fabric of space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong stared at Yao Fei and said to Yu Ming, “Don’t bother with me, go kill Yao Fei!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes Young Lord!”</span></p>
