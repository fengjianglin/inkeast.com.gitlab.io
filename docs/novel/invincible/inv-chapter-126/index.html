 <p><strong><u>Chapter 126: Huang Min and Li Lu Missing</u></strong></p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong endured the waves of acute pain that came from attacking the tenth order barrier, and by persevering he continued to run Asura Tactics while absorbing spiritual energy from the ancient battlefield.</p>
 <p>A coruscating light flickered endlessly from Huang Xiaolong’s body.</p>
 <p>The netherworld battle qi in his meridians and Qi Sea were surging in a frenzied manner. Even though Huang Xiaolong made every effort to control them, he was unsuccessful.</p>
 <p>Excruciating pain hit him like strong waves across the shore.</p>
 <p>From experiences gained with his previous breakthroughs, Huang Xiaolong knew that he was close to success so there was no way he could give up at this stage!</p>
 <p>If he failed on the first try, there would be a smaller chance during the second attempt to break through to the Tenth Order and it would be much harder.</p>
 <p>The third and fourth attempt barely had any chances of success anymore.</p>
 <p>Due to the pain, Huang Xiaolong had a film of sweat on his forehead.</p>
 <p>Time passed slowly this way when suddenly, Huang Xiaolong shuddered within, like a new life puncturing the shell and coming into the world. The netherworld battle qi in his meridians cheered, breaking free of their shackles to enter the meridians’ route of the Tenth Order.</p>
 <p>The tenth order's barrier finally crumbled!</p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong was ecstatic!</p>
 <p>Entering the Tenth order meridians’ route, the nether battle qi rolled, surged, and flowed to every corner of his veins. After one complete cycle, the netherworld battle qi entered the Qi Sea, expanding to another degree.</p>
 <p>The black and blue twin dragons hovering behind him grew bigger, becoming more real and corporeal. They were no longer vague shadows.</p>
 <p>When Huang Xiaolong entered the Xiantian realm, both of the black and blue dragons would evolve a third time, turning into real solid entities. Into true dragons!</p>
 <p><em>Real life dragons!</em></p>
 <p>The netherworld battle qi continued to course through the new meridians’ line. Huang Xiaolong finally stopped running Asura tactics after three complete turns then opened his eyes.</p>
 <p>“I’m a Tenth Order warrior now.” Huang Xiaolong breathed out some turbid qi. By simply relying on the toughness of his physique, combined with the Blades of Asura, the Asura Sword Skill, and his martial spirits’ ability, and even without a soul transformation, Huang Xiaolong was confident he could kill the average peak late-Tenth Order warrior.</p>
 <p>If he soul transformed, he would definitely be invincible beneath the Xiantian realm.</p>
 <p>Repressing the excitement in his heart, Huang Xiaolong walked out of his courtyard. The first thing he saw was an anxious Fei Hou running towards his yard in a flustered manner: “Sovereign, Second Miss and Miss Li Lu are missing!”</p>
 <p>“What?! What happened exactly?” Huang Xiaolong’s face darkened.</p>
 <p>Fei Hou quickly replied: “In the morning, Second Miss and Miss Li Lu went out, but they haven’t returned after one hour’s time so Subordinate ordered people to go and look for them. On Peaceful Street, they found four Marshal Mansion guards’ bodies whereas Second Miss and Miss Li Lu were nowhere to be found!”</p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank.</p>
 <p>The four guards Marshal Haotian sent to protect Li Lu and Huang Min were all Tenth Order warriors. To be capable of killing four Tenth Order guards without alerting anyone... only a Xiantian realm expert could achieve that!</p>
 <p>“How did the four guards die?” Huang Xiaolong asked.</p>
 <p>“They were hit by a Poison Blood Palm!” Fei Hou answered without delay.</p>
 <p>It really <em>is</em> the Poison Blood Palm!</p>
 <p>The other side has come!</p>
 <p>The killer disappeared for five months after annihilating the Li Residence, only to resurface now.</p>
 <p>“En, go inform Haotian, tell him to blockade the city and find the killer!” Huang Xiaolong ordered: “Now, bring me to see the four guards bodies!”</p>
 <p>Haotian, as the Luo Tong Kingdom’s only Marshal, had the power to blockade the city.</p>
 <p>“Yes, Sovereign!” &nbsp;Fei Hou acknowledged respectfully and led Huang Xiaolong to the main hall.</p>
 <p>On the floor in the main hall, the four bodies of the Marshal Mansion guards were arranged neatly. Fei Hou brought them back after finding their bodies on Peaceful Street.</p>
 <p>When Huang Xiaolong walked into the main hall, his Mom and Dad, Huang Peng and Su Yan, were there along with his younger brother, Huang Xiaohai, as well.</p>
 <p>Seeing Huang Xiaolong had arrived, Huang Peng and Su Yan hurried beside him.</p>
 <p>“Xiaolong, you must save your little sister and save Miss Li Lu!” Su Yan pleaded through her sobs, words choking in her throat.</p>
 <p>“Mom, don’t worry. I will!” Huang Xiaolong promised, but the main problem was that he didn’t know where they were.</p>
 <p>What if both of them were already…?!</p>
 <p>Thinking of this possibility, Huang Xiaolong felt a tugging pain in his heart.</p>
 <p>Only now did he realize that whether it was his sister or Li Lu, both occupied an important place in his heart.</p>
 <p>Inhaling deeply, Huang Xiaolong forced himself to calm down and walked towards the four Marshal Mansion guards’ bodies. Observing the muted green palm print that was imprinted on their chests, Huang Xiaolong wore a grave and livid expression on his face.</p>
 <p>The other side daring to do this meant that they were simply not putting Tianxuan Mansion and the Marshal Mansion in their eyes!</p>
 <p>If he found them, Huang Xiaolong will have that person pay a very, very miserable price for this!</p>
 <p>By this time, Marshal Haotian had rushed over from the Marshal Mansion after getting the news.</p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong looked at Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou both, saying: “Go, we’re going to Peaceful Street now!”</p>
 <p>“Yes, Young Lord!”</p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong led Marshal Haotian, Fei Hou, and the rest out from Tianxuan Mansion and sped towards Peaceful Street. When Huang Peng and Su Yan wanted to follow him, he told them wait at Tianxuan Mansion in order to avoid any unforeseen incidents from happening.</p>
 <p>A short while later, Huang Xiaolong and the group of people arrived on the scene – Peaceful Street.</p>
 <p>Upon arrival, they could see several puddles of blood on the ground, however it had dried up a little. Huang Xiaolong closed his eyes and stood in silence, sensing his surroundings.</p>
 <p>Then, from a certain direction, Huang Xiaolong caught a trace of his little sister, Huang Min’s, and Li Lu’ scents.</p>
 <p>Everyone has a scent unique only to them.</p>
 <p>Since he broke through to Seventh Order and the twin dragon martial spirits evolved the second time, his sense of smell has been greatly heightened.</p>
 <p>Moments later, Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes and looked towards a certain direction and disappeared in a flash as he moved that way. Sprinting towards the south side of the Royal City, Marshal Haotian, Fei Hou, and the rest felt something was strange, but no one dallied as they quickly followed behind Huang Xiaolong.</p>
 <p>Rushing towards the south section, Huang Xiaolong did not conceal his strength. His speed shocked Marshal Haotian, Fei Hou, and everyone behind him.</p>
 <p>Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou secretly exchanged a look between them.</p>
 <p>Sovereign... he already broke through to the Tenth Order?!</p>
 <p>Tenth Order!</p>
 <p>It hasn’t been that long since Sovereign broke through into the Ninth Order-- not even a year has passed! &nbsp;Leaping to the Tenth Order in one fell swoop... what cultivation level was this? Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou shuddered thinking of this.</p>
 <p>If Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou had that kind of reaction, the Marshal Mansion guards and Tianxuan Mansion guards were dumbstruck as they stared at Huang Xiaolong’s back.</p>
 <p>Speeding towards the south, they soon left the Luo Tong Royal City behind.</p>
 <p>More than an hour later, they came before a mountainous area.</p>
 <p>“Everyone split up and search.” Huang Xiaolong turned back and issued an order.</p>
 <p>“Yes, Young Lord!”</p>
 <p>Everyone replied and split up, heading to search in different areas.</p>
 <p>After a moment, in the distant mountain forest, one of the guards exclaimed in surprise: “Young Lord, the Second Miss is here!”</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Huang Xiaolong and the rest of the guards sprinted towards that forest area. Huang Xiaolong saw Huang Min there. Someone used some method to bind his little sister to that spot since she was clearly unable to move. But, there was no sign of Li Lu.</p>
 <p>Seeing it was Huang Xiaolong and the Tianxuan Mansion guards, surprise showed in Huang Min’s eyes followed by anxiousness, but she was unable to move or speak.</p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong hastened to his little sister’s side.</p>
