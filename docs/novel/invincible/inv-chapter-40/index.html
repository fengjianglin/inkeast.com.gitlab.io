 <p><b>Chapter 40: Junior Brother’s in Trouble!</b></p>
 <p><span style>As always, Fei Hou kept silent, so it was Huang Xiaolong who replied with a sneer, “Dare to kill your Duke Mansion’s guards? Don’t tell me that we should’ve stood here, and waited for you to kill us? We shouldn’t have moved a finger in retaliation, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the eyes of dukes like Meng Chen, commoners were supposed to stand still and be killed by them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meng Chen’s face became darkly sullen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, I don’t care who’s supporting you; today, you’ve killed this Duke’s guards! It doesn’t matter who it is, they won’t be able to save you!”</span><span style>Meng Chen’s killing intent soared as he spoke in a cold voice, then he stepped back after and said to the two Tenth Order warriors (First Mister and Second Mister) “It doesn’t matter what method you use, today, you&nbsp; absolutely must chop off their arms and legs!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please rest assured, Lord Duke!” First Mister and Second Mister exchanged a look and acknowledged Meng Chen’s order. And the Ninth and Eighth Orders also replied loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meng Chen and his son then moved to the sides, expecting to see a good show.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meng Chen coldly observed the scene before him, although he had already guessed that if a little kid like Huang Xiaolong had a Tenth Order bodyguard, surely, it meant that he had an unusual background. However, he wasn’t worried. As a Duke of the Luo Tong Kingdom he had a high status within the kingdom, and the people he feared were very few, so few that they would total less than ten!</span></p>
 <p><span style>First Mister and Second Mister cautiously walked towards Fei Hou and Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Both of us will deal with him (Fei Hou), while the rest of you go and break both of that kid’s arms and legs!” First Mister instructed the Ninth and Eighth Order Duke Mansion guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, First Mister!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>First Mister made his move before they could reply and a great serpent emerged behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This serpent had a large head, but a small body and its entire body was a sickly white color; this was his martial spirit, the Heavenly Serpent!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Heavenly Serpent belonged to the snake beast category of martial spirits and snake martial spirits were generally ranked as grade seven. However, some powerful snake martial spirits were categorized as grade eight and this Heavenly Serpent was one of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First Mister immediately soul transformed after his martial spirit emerged, his body turning into the same pale white, with layers of serpent scales. His eyes became entirely red as he pounced on Fei Hou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whereas Second Mister’s martial spirit was something rarely seen – a vine type plant! The vines were a purple so dark that it looked as black as ink and it had thorns on it, as sharp as knives.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This is a type of special plant martial spirit and was highly toxic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Second Mister’s action was as swift as First Mister’s; he immediately soul transformed after releasing his martial spirits and leaped towards Fei Hou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, the other guards of the Duke’s Mansion moved quickly towards Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master, you must be careful!” Fei Hou said as he looked sharply at the flood of oncoming people rushing at them. Suddenly his Silver River martial spirit emerged turning tens of meters long and enclosed Huang Xiaolong, protecting him. His hands were deflecting the many attacks coming from the Duke Mansion’s guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little violet monkey on Huang Xiaolong’s shoulder was unusually quiet. Its pair of gemstone like blue eyes stared at the Meng Chen and his son.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bang! Bang! Bang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Battle qi clashed, and the shock waves spread through the air of the small restaurant space. All the furniture had turned into dust, and the customers had all run for their lives.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First Mister and Second Mister never imagined that Fei Hou could block all the attacks from more than ten people while not moving a single step. This made their faces warp in fury.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Hou’s strength had exceeded their assumptions, and most surprising was his martial spirit, which had evolved to the extent that it could strengthen its owner five times. In general, a Tenth Order warrior with Silver River martial spirit could only enhance their strength to a maximum of four times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The warriors from the Duke Mansion were both shocked and angry at the same time, which motivated them to attack unceasingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Fei Hou was very strong, he couldn’t last very long against so many experts at once, and in the end, each time he blocked an attack, his face lost a little color.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Hou’s body had strengthened till his Silver River was so dense that it looked close to being mercury.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Meng Chen and Meng Xia saw this, a wide smile blossomed on the faces of both father and son.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You will regret it if my Young Master is harmed!” Seeing the father and son’s disgusting smile, Fei Hou reminded them while his hands continued to block attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meng Chen smirked, “Regret? I, Meng Chen don’t have the word regret in my dictionary. Not only do I want to chop off your arms and legs, after I have you both paraded around the city streets, I will also have you beheaded in public! I want to see who can save the two of you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>And at this point, Marshal Haotian had just returned from the palace and was surprised when he sensed bursts of battle qi energy coming from the direction of the Delicious Restaurant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the Delicious Restaurant was not far from the Marshal Mansion, and because Fei Hou’s was a peak late-Tenth Order warrior, the energy vibration could travel the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Peak late-Tenth Order?” Marshal Haotian’s brows furrowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although fights are very common in the Royal City, however, it rarely involved a Tenth Order warrior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Marshal, it seems to come from the Delicious Restaurant’s location.”A guard beside Haotian remarked. And at this time, the guard captain who was guarding the main entrance of the Marshal Mansion saw that the Marshall had returned, quickly went up to report. “Marshal, a few moments ago, someone came and said that he was your Junior Brother and he took out Marshal’s gold plate here, wanting to see Marshal.” The guard’s captain then took out the gold plate and showed it Marshal Haotian. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Junior Brother!” Haotian took the gold plate from the guard captain, pleasure evident on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the gold plate he gave to his Junior Brother more than a decade ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s my Junior Brother?” He asked. It had been a very long time since he had seen Junior Brother, Fei Hou, and he didn’t expect that his Junior Brother would be here. When they meet up, they must drink together again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guard captain hesitated for a moment, then honestly reported, “Replying to Marshal, when he was here, I informed him that you were summoned to the palace and he left this gold plate and left, saying that he would wait for you at the Delicious Restaurant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Delicious Restaurant!” Haotian’s face sank, as he continued to sense the ever increasing battle qi energy coming from the direction of Delicious Restaurant, could it be…?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Junior Brother’s in trouble!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Junior Brother Fei Hou is in Delicious Restaurant, and there was a clashing battle qi emitted from there! There aren’t so many coincidences in this world; it must be Junior Brother! In less than a heartbeat’s time, Haotian was sure of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why didn’t you say so earlier?!” Haotian roared at the guard captain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guard captain was so terrified that his liver nearly cracked– he had never seen the Marshal in such a big temper!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Marshal, I, I…” The guard’s captain tried to explain, but Haotian didn’t want to listen. Instead, he shouted loudly towards the sky: “Ironclaw Condor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>High up in the air the sharp cry of an eagle rang out following Haotian’s holler and a huge gray condor appeared, about five meters long, its grayish wings looked like it was made out of iron reflecting a sharp light under the sunlight. Its big claws looked like it could tear apart an elephant with ease.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Haotian leaped up onto the Ironclaw Condor’s back, and they disappeared towards Delicious Restaurant’s direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In all of the Luo Tong Kingdom, other than the kingdom’s ruler, only Marshal Haotian was permitted to fly in the Royal City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The captain guard’s knees gave out in fear and slid to the ground when he saw Marshal call out the grade four Ironclaw Condor to rush towards Delicious Restaurant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Fei Hou had given him the gold plate and asked him to send someone to the palace to inform the Marshal, he did not!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment he thought that since there was no war going on, there was no point to it as the Marshal would return very soon from the palace. That’s why he did not go and did not send anyone! He didn’t expect that an accident would happen. And from the looks of things, it was a grave matter! If something really happened to Marshal’s Junior Brother, what would happen to him?</span></p>
