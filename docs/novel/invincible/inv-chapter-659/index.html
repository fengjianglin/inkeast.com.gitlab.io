He had been coming here daily for the last ten years, learning alchemy every day from the old man. Suddenly hearing that the old man was leaving, he did feel reluctant and out of sorts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing this, the Ascending Moon Old Man’s wrinkled of face split into a wide grin, “What is it, little disciple, are you reluctant to see this old man leave?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Xiaolong decisively rolled his eyes at the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ascending Moon Old Man chuckled proudly, “Actually, this old man is also very reluctant to leave you brat, your parents, and everyone else, but every banquet must come to an end. I know you’re prone to troublemaking, but I’ve already had a word with that Feng Yang boy. If something happens to you while I’m gone, I’ll peel off a layer of his skin when I come back!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A surge of warmth filled Huang Xiaolong’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the same day, Huang Xiaolong had everyone gathered over a bonfire party as a farewell for the Ascending Moon Old Man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was obvious that the Ascending Moon Old Man was extremely happy during the bonfire party. Of course, according to the old man’s childish behavior, many times throughout the night his little disciple Huang Xiaolong was the target of his jokes. Taking advantage of his ‘drunkenness’ the old man announced loudly that he hoped Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei would give birth to a hundred little grand-disciples.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A hundred?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Huang Xiaolong’s pulled a bitter face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if he was willing, who knows if Shi Xiaofei would agree. Even then, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t sure they could achieve that figure. A person wasn’t a Tyrant Boar, able to birth more than a dozen in one go…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, to Huang Xiaolong’s knowledge, the more a powerful a person was, the more their reproduction rate was reduced. This was also the reason why some God Realm cultivators, and even Highgod Realm masters only had one child even after ten thousand years or more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">God Realm and Highgod Realm masters' lifespans were much longer. They lived several thousand years to several tens of thousands of years, &nbsp;thus they couldn't be like mortals, giving birth every few years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The night came to an end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the break of dawn, the Ascending Moon Old Man left the Golden Dragon Peak. Before leaving, the old man did not forget to take away some of the wine that Huang Xiaolong brew, but he did not want Huang Xiaolong to send him off. With an instant Great Space Shift, he was thousands of miles away from the Black Warrior Institute. As for where he teleported to, which world surface, Huang Xiaolong was left wondering to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Xiaolong stood where he was for a long time even after the Ascending Moon Old Man left before walking back to his own yard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Days continued to pass as seasons changed. Just like that, another year went by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite knowing the several thousand pill formulas of the Thousand Worlds Sect like the back of his hand, in the past one year, Huang Xiaolong religiously dedicated the morning of every day to alchemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Xiaolong would spend the latter part of the day cultivating his battle skills. In over a decade’s time, he had started practicing the other moves of the Asura Sword Skill, and although he had yet to reach major completion, their attack power could not be underestimated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At night, Huang Xiaolong continued to refine the godforce and God’s Law contained within the godhead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this one year, Huang Xiaolong, who was already a peak mid-Sixth Order God Realm finally broke into late-Sixth Order God Realm!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having godforce from the godhead continuously tempering Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique over the years, his originally freakish True Dragon Physique was now even more monstrous, causing his power and defense to reach a shocking level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To test his physique, Huang Xiaolong tried to draw blood from his finger using the Mulberry Sword, but his skin withstood it. Only when he exerted full force to penetrate the layer of skin did it leave a tiny wound. Striking a punch at a palm-sized lump of Divine World ore, he could shatter it into over a hundred smaller pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From time to time, Huang Xiaolong would visit his parents and others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In these years, Huang Peng, Su Yan, Huang Xiaohai, Huang Min, and the others’ strength had increased at a shocking pace. Eleven years ago, Huang Peng, Su Yan, and most of the others had just broken into the Saint realm, and now, eleven years later, most of them had reached Third Order Saint realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though their rapid improvement was due to consuming Hailstone Divine Pellets every day when cultivating, as well as the abundant spiritual energy gathered by the Five-colored Divine Banner, it was still an amazing progress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Xie Puti, he spent his days and nights cultivating inside his own yard, hence his strength enhancement exceeded Huang Peng and the others, reaching late-Third Order Saint realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On this day, Huang Xiaolong was practicing his pill refining skills when his Eldest Senior Apprentice-brother Liu Yun and Third Apprentice-sister Qi Wen came to visit him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Over the years, both of them had made several visits to the Golden Dragon Peak, however, worried that they might be disturbing the Ascending Moon Old Man when he was guiding Huang Xiaolong in alchemy, they would always leave after a brief stay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Xiaolong was extremely happy as he welcomed them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meeting again after a long time, it was inevitable to exchange some perfunctory greetings. While they were talking, Liu Yun suddenly asked, “Fourth Junior Apprentice-brother, I heard from Master that Senior Ascending Moon wants you to participate in the Alchemist Grandmaster Competition?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and admitted, “Yes, I heard from the old man that this time’s Alchemist Grandmaster Competition will very likely have an additional reward for the first place winner, a godhead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Yun and QiWen exchanged a smile, probably only Huang Xiaolong dared to call Senior Ascending Moon ‘old man’, if any other person dared to do so, that was like lamenting they had lived for too long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fourth Junior Apprentice-brother, I heard that Xiang Mingzhi is also participating in this Alchemist Grandmaster Competition.” Qi Wen spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, Xiang Mingzhi that guy is also participating?” Huang Xiaolong was surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Yun nodded, “Yes. Xiang Mingzhi is the Azure Dragon Institute Principal’s personal disciple, not only is his cultivation talent is amazing, even his alchemy talent is astonishing. From the rumors going around, it is said that his alchemy talent is by no means weaker than his cultivation talent. He also stated confidently that he will win the first place of this term’s Alchemist Grandmaster Competition.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corner of Huang Xiaolong’s lips curved into a sly devious smile, “Is that so? It’s been some years since I last saw him, I still remember how I burst his little birdie with one kick. I think he wouldn’t forget either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qi Wen couldn’t resist bursting into laughter hearing that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That year, &nbsp;Huang Xiaolong directed a merciless kick at Xiang &nbsp;Mingzhi’s lower part before the audience during the inner disciples’ assessment. Qi Wen remembered that scene clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Yun also couldn’t help laughing, “I’m sure he did not forget, and he also knows that you learned alchemy from Senior Ascending Moon. This time, he let out word&nbsp;that he will win the Alchemist Grandmaster Competition's first place, it is obvious that he’s aiming to defeat you. But, other than the Azure Dragon Institute’s Xiang Mingzhi, there’s also the Vermillion Bird Institute Principal’s personal disciple He Feifan, and the White Tiger Institute Principal’s personal disciple Wan Zhengxing, all of them will be participating in the competition. The latter two people are also skilled in alchemy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Xiaolong nodded, he had met that Vermillion Bird Institute Principal’s personal disciple He Feifan once before when he went to visit Shi Xiaofei in the land of new moon. At that time, He Feifan was visiting Shi Xiaofei’s Master, Yang Yi.</span></p>

Despite having seen He Feifan only once, Huang Xiaolong did not have a good impression of him. He remembered clearly that He Feifan unknowingly exposed his killing intent at that time.</span></p>

In the last Highgod Advancement Tournament, I exchanged a few moves with him, he’s slightly stronger than me.” Afraid that Huang Xiaolong might have a misconception about these people’s strength, Liu Yun explained, “As for that Wan Zhenxing, he is also a peak late-Tenth Order God Realm with unfathomable strength, if Fourth Junior Apprentice-brother runs into them, act with caution, especially when facing that He Feifan.”</span></p>

I’ve been waiting for a long time to drink at your banquet.”</span></p>
