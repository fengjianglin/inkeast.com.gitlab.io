 <p><strong>Chapter 437:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Our President Invites <em>Thee</em></strong></p>
 <p><span>Initially, many people in the reception lobby were aiming for that Golden Jadesea Dragon Pill, but watching Huang Xiaolong display a small portion of his strength, those individuals suppressed the greed that sprung in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What is going on?” All of a sudden, a dignified voice boomed in the lobby, attracting everyone’s attention. Turning their heads to look at the source, the employee that ran off earlier to report was walking out from the inner hall with two men in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span>Leading in front was a middle-aged man clad in a large brocade green robe, thick brows, big face, and brilliant shrewd eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>The pot-bellied man whose hand was crushed by Huang Xiaolong, Su Family’s Elder Su Ming, hastened toward this middle-aged man with a look of deference, and flattery, “Elder Zhang.”</span></p>
 <p><span>This newly arrived person was the Golden Pavilion Chamber of Commerce’s Elder, Zhang Jingfeng.</span></p>
 <p><span>When the employee ran to report to the steward, the steward felt this matter was above his authority, and brought the matter to Elder Zhang Jingfeng instead.</span></p>
 <p><span>The people around the reception lobby also greeted Elder Zhang with a respectful demeanor.</span></p>
 <p><span>As an Elder of the Golden Pavilion Chamber of Commerce, Zhang Jingfeng oversaw the transactions made in the headquarters, and thus held an esteemed status within the ranks of Golden Pavilion Chamber of Commerce. Even the Birchleaf Castellan was polite and courteous toward Elder Zhang.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhang Jingfeng nodded his head, returning the greeting from the people in the lobby.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Su Family Elder Su Ming seized this small gap saying, “Elder Zhang, this punk brought out some unknown low-grade medicinal pellet and claimed it’s a top-grade divine Golden Jadesea Dragon Pill. I know a little about medicinal pellets, out of the kindness of my heart I wanted to help him distinguish the pellet, but I didn't imagine that this punk would suddenly sneak an attack on me, crushing the bones of my hand!”</span></p>
 <p><span>He positioned himself as the kind victim and Huang Xiaolong became the villain that attacked indiscriminately.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Oh…” Elder Zhang looked over at Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It’s evident he’s feeling guilty, that’s why he dared not let me take a look. That medicinal pellet is surely a fake!” Su Ming emphasized, his eyes glowered at Huang Xiaolong, filled with grudging hate.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhang Jingfeng lightly nodded, no changes can be seen in his expression as he approached Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span>In a few quick steps, Zhang Jingfeng reached in front of Huang Xiaolog’s group. After a mere glance at the Golden Jadesea Dragon Pill placed on the table, a golden light flashed in Elder Zhang’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>Although he had yet to examine it closely, relying on his many years of experience and eyesight, this spirit pellet was undoubtedly a top quality divine grade spirit pellet.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, Zhang Jingfeng glanced at Huang Xiaolong’s group. All four sat there, and from their demeanor it was obvious that none of them had any intention of standing up. This slightly annoyed Zhang Jingfeng. After all, his status necessitated even the Birchleaf City’s Castellan to stand up and greet him.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This guest is saying this is the legendary Golden Jadesea Dragon Pill?” Zhang Jingfeng spoke, of course he did not show his dissatisfaction on the surface.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Yes.” Huang Xiaolong was nonchalant.</span></p>
 <p><span>“May I examine it?” Zhang Jingfeng asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Yes.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhang Jingfeng pointed at the pellet and it gently fell into his palm. The moment the Golden Jadesea Dragon Pill landed on his palm, his hand sank a little from the weight, this startled him.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was said that one of the ingredients needed to refine a Golden Jadesea Dragon Pill was Golden Jade Sand, thus after successful refinement, one small pellet of Golden Jadesea Dragon Pill would weigh a thousand catties.</span></p>
 <p><span>This made Zhang Jingfeng take a second look at the small pellet, inspecting it seriously. The more he saw, the more surprised he became, for the medicinal properties of this Golden Jadesea Dragon Pill in his hand were extremely well preserved. All the preservations of top-grade divine spirit pellets he had examined in the past were sorely lacking in comparison.</span></p>
 <p><span>Su Ming and the people around the lobby held their breaths as they focused intently on Zhang Jingfeng’s every move. Detecting the changes in Zhang Jingfeng’s expression, ripples of shock crossed these people’s hearts. Did this mean that it was really a top-grade divine spirit pellet?!</span></p>
 <p><span>Then, a light glimmered from Zhang Jingfeng’s palm, his battle qi ambled along the medicinal pellet’s vein, entering its core, instantly, multiple dark jade green lights shone out from its core, issuing faint echoes of dragon roars.</span></p>
 <p><span>Watching this, Su Ming and everyone present were taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span>Moments later, Zhang Jingfeng retrieved his battle qi, the dark green lights vanished, as did the faint dragon roars.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This medicinal pellet is indeed a genuine Golden Jadesea Dragon Pill.” Zhang Jingfeng announced the result of his examination.</span></p>
 <p><span>The people in the reception lobby had their eyes rounded the size of a fist, fixing their eyes on the Golden Jadesea Dragon Pill.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhang Jingfeng placed the pellet back to the table once again, in front of Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span>“May I ask how this brother is planning to sell this Golden Jadesea Dragon Pill?” Zhang Jingfeng inquired, his tone mellowed down.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Are you the Golden Pavilion Chamber of Commerce’s President?” Huang Xiaolong asked in return.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhang Jingfeng was stumped, and his expression turned unsightly. The meaning of Huang Xiaolong’s words was loud and clear, he would only speak to the Golden Pavilion Chamber of Commerce’s President and no one else.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Although the Golden Jadesea Dragon Pill is the Dragon Clan’s legendary divine spirit pellet, I am still more than sufficient to handle the value of this transaction.” Zhang Jingfeng said, his tone slightly hardened.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhang Jingfeng’s meaning was clear as well, this Golden Jadesea Dragon Pill was indeed valuable, but not enough to disturb their Golden Pavilion Chamber of Commerce’s President. In short, Huang Xiaolong was still far from qualified to meet their President based on one Golden Jadesea Dragon Pill.</span></p>
 <p><span>Su Family’s Elder Su was gloating on the side watching the even play out.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong’s expression remained nonchalant, and he didn’t miss the meaning behind Zhang Jingfeng’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span>Before the gloating eyes of Su Ming and other individuals in the lobby, a dazzling light glowed from Huang Xiaolong’s hand, and another burst of fragrance suffused the air.</span></p>
 <p><span>Everyone in the hall, including Su Ming, was surprised seeing another spirit pellet in Huang Xiaolong’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This is a Water Fire Dragon Pill, top-grade divine spirit pellet.” Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang in the lobby.</span></p>
 <p><span>Then, another spirit pellet appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This is a Reverse Dragon Pill, top-grade divine spirit pellet.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“This is a Divine Dragon Pill, top-grade divine spirit pellet.”</span></p>
 <p><span>In front of the dumbstruck Su Ming and the rest, Huang Xiaolong successively took out nine spirit pellets. Without exception, all of them were top-grade divine spirit pellets, lined up on the table in a straight line.</span></p>
 <p><span>The medicinal fragrance coming from these pellets assaulted the nose, the entire lobby was transformed into an ocean of spirit pellet fragrance.</span></p>
 <p><span>Even as an Elder of the Golden Pavilion Chamber of Commerce Elder, Zhang Jingfeng couldn’t help inhaling a sharp breath.</span></p>
 <p><span>These were ten top-grade divine spirit pellets!</span></p>
 <p><span>It was a heaven and earth difference between one pellet and ten pellets.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>If the remaining nine pellets were also genuine top-grade divine spirit pellets, then…!</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhang Jingfen’s hand reached out and began to examine the spirit pellets one by one, and by the end of it, his hands were visibly trembling.</span></p>
 <p><span>Although Zhang Jingfeng did not announce his result like the first time, it was obvious to everyone from his expression that the remaining nine spirit pellets were, without a doubt, top-grade divine spirit pellets.</span></p>
 <p><span>“How is it? Can I see your President now?” Huang Xiaolong asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong’s voice pulled everyone back to the present, the way Zhang Jingfeng looked at Huang Xiaolong completely took a hundred and eighty degrees turn.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I have to trouble Young Noble to wait here for a moment, I shall notify the President immediately!” Zhang Jingfeng said, his demeanor was much more polite and respectful.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong nodded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Seeing that, Zhang Jingfeng turned around and left.</span></p>
 <p><span>After Zhang Jingfeng left, the way others around looked at Huang Xiaolong brewed something within, everyone was guessing Huang Xiaolong’s group’s identities. Not even the big families in Birchleaf City could casually take out ten top-grade divine spirit pellet in one breath.</span></p>
 <p><span>One such example was the Su Family.</span></p>
 <p><span>Hiding amongst the people, Su Ming became more honest, traces of fear flashed in his eyes as he cautiously sneaked glances at Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span>A short while later Zhang Jingfeng emerged from the inner hall, respectfully informing Huang Xiaolong, “Young Noble, our President invites <em>thee</em> in.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong once again nodded, retrieved all the spirit pellets on the table with a simple motion, and followed Zhang Jingfeng together with Shi Xiaofei and her two maids into the inner hall.</span></p>
 <p><span>Watching Huang Xiaolong’s group disappear from view, the people in the lobby broke out in a ruckus.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I wonder who that person is, just like that he could take out ten top-grade divine spirit pellets!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Perhaps he belongs to some hidden family that hasn’t appeared in a thousand years, he might even be an Elder!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong’s group of four followed Zhang Jingfeng, ignoring the loud ruckus outside, passing through the Phoenix Hall and arriving at an elegant courtyard.</span></p>
