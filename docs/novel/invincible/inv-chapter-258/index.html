 <p><b>Chapter 258: Battling Chen Xiaotian</b></p>
 <p>[/expand]</p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?!” The question flew from Chen Xiaotian’s mouth as he studied Huang Xiaolong warily. His gut instinct told him that Huang Xiaolong didn’t belong to the Blood Swallow School or Nine Fiend Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong faced Chen Xiaotian, indifferently saying, “Who I am is not important,” after a slight pause, Huang Xiaolong continued, “I think you would best understand that there is no escape for you today. You have two options in front of you; submission, or death.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong wasted no time with nonsense, laying down two choices on the table for Chen Xiaotian in a straightforward manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Xiaotian chanced another furtive glance in Geng Ken, Du Xin, and Deng Guangliang’s direction as they stood behind Huang Xiaolong. Suddenly, a cold, desolate feeling of despair rose from his heart. Was this how it felt being betrayed and abandoned?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you plan on letting them attack me together, or one by one?” Pushing down the feelings of despair, Chen Xiaotian asked Huang Xiaolong in a stiff, cold voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong shook his head, waving a hand at Geng Ken, Du Xin, Deng Guangliang, and the other Sky Magi Sect Elders back, “All of you step back. No one is allowed to make a move without my order.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When these words were spoken, all present were stunned by Huang Xiaolong’s decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Lord, this...!” Geng Ken took a step forward, wanting to dissuade Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one here knew Chen Xiaotian’s true strength better than him. Although he had to admit that Huang Xiaolong was strong, Chen Xiaotian was a late-Xiantian Seventh Order after all. Moreover, if his estimation was correct, Chen Xiaotian’s real strength was higher than that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Step down!” Huang Xiaolong snapped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Geng Ken trembled, swiftly saluted respectfully and retreated to the back line where Du Xin, Deng Guangliang, and the rest were standing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong looked at Chen Xiaotian, “If you can defeat me, you can leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Xiaotian glanced at the line up of Sky Magi Sect Elders at the back and then back to Huang Xiaolong, “For real?” Looking skeptical on the surface but his heart was delighted at Huang Xiaolong’s arrogance. He wasn’t sure of Huang Xiaolong’s actual strength, but judging from Huang Xiaolong’s aura, Chen Xiaotian was sure Huang Xiaolong hadn’t broken through to Xiantian Seventh Order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Correct.” Huang Xiaolong affirmed coolly, catching the flicker of joy in Chen Xiaotian’s eyes;</span><i><span style> it seems this Chen Xiaotian thinks he will win over me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The instant Huang Xiaolong’s reply came, one azure and one red light flew out from Chen Xiaotian’s body, merging into a tree above his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A giant tree materialized, shrouded in an azure colored gale and dark red flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First-rank grade eleven martial spiritーWindfire Tree!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The power of the wind and fire elements instantly filled the grand hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Xiaotian wasted no time in merging with his Windifre Tree martial spirit immediately after summoning it. After soul transforming, both of Chen Xiaotian’s arms were crackling and burning with dark red flames; at the same time, azure colored wind swished up and down and around his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soul transformed Chen Xiaotian seized the initiative, launching an attack on Huang Xiaolong. He dashed forward in a blur of azure light with streaks of dark red, at amazing speed, as if he was the embodiment of wind. Not only were Du Xin and Deng Guangliang unable to capture Chen Xiaotian’s movements, even the strongest amongst them, Geng Ken, a peak late-Sixth Order Xiantian could only see vague afterimages. This filled everyone with apprehension. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Careful, Young Lord!” Geng Ken and the others couldn’t help exclaiming out loud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong branded a soul mark in each of their souls. Being connected at soul level, if Huang Xiaolong died, they too would follow, their souls facing destruction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Watching Chen Xiaotian coming at him, Huang Xiaolong released his Asura Physique. Black, ebony Wings of Demon spread, and displaying Phantom Shadow at the same time, Huang Xiaolong’s figure disappeared, leaving only a faint shadow in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Xiaotian’s fist struck, piercing through the shadow left behind in Huang Xiaolong’s place, the afterimage shadow puffed away like wisps of smoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His attack fell on empty air, Chen Xiaotian spun around with a horrified expression, looking at Huang Xiaolongㅡthis black-haired young man actually dodged his attack! His actual strength was not what the outside rumours claimed to be, he had long ago advanced into the peak of late-Xiantian Seventh Order, and with the power of the wind element added onto his body after soul transformation, his speed greatly surpassed warriors of the same strength. Despite all of this, Huang Xiaolong managed to dodge his attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Having avoided Chen Xiaotian’s attack, Huang Xiaolong rounded back with the Blades of Asura in his hands, slashing out at Chen Xiaotian from midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Asura Sword Skill’s Fourth Move: State of Abundant Lightning!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A lightning storm descended on the grand hall, countless lightning flood dragons formed as they hit the floor, roaring at the targeted Chen Xiaotian. In the short blink of an eye, Chen Xiaotian was surrounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Xiaotian’s face became ashen at the abrupt grave situation he found himself in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Windfire Flowing Physique!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a bellow, Chen Xiaotian twirled his body around like a flaming cloud and floated to the air, barely escaping the attacks of several lightning flood dragons. But he didn’t expect that the flood dragon-shaped lightning could turn into rotating gales, dogging his steps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After so many years, Huang Xiaolong had perfected the combination of Asura Sword Skill’s first move, Tempest of Hell and the second move, Tears of Asura, into the fourth move, State of Abundant Lightning. When attacking, the lightning streaks were unpredictable, turning into an angry thunderstorm in the next moment. It evolved into quite a powerful move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Xiaotian ‘floated’ from one side to the other, endlessly ‘flowing’ with the air current, dodging the attacks of the lightning flood dragons repeatedly. Time elapsed and the State of Abundant Lightning dissipated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he was hit directly by the lightning, Chen Xiaotian appeared awkward and miserable, parts of his robes were singed and tattered, with burnt black holes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Windfist Flowing Fire Palm!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>When Huang Xiaolong’s attack dissipated, Chen Xiaotian vented his wrath. Chen Xiaotian struck with his left fist and a hurricane of wind formed in front of it, whereas his right hand struck a palm that pierced through space, dancing with dark red flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A punch and a palm fused into one attack, violently influencing the airflow of the grand hall, so much that Geng Ken and the group of Elder standing at the edge felt like they were being melted in a heated furnace, yet at the same time, blades of wind cut against their skin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even for Huang Xiaolong, it was the first time he came across such a battle skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a brief moment of surprise, Huang Xiaolong’s eyes turned sharp and cold, swinging the blades in his hands. Countless blade lights spun in peculiar circular motions, as a deep hued red eyeball &nbsp;materialized out of nowhere, it too spinning in the same direction. Icy blade lights flew out from the red eyeball, crashing into the enemy’s wind fist and fire palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>High above in the grand hall space, a chain of blasts rang out. Aftershocks of wind and fire rolled out as remnants of blade lights ricocheted in all directions, leaving spine-chilling cut marks on the walls of the grand hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the deep red eyeball appeared, Chen Xiaotian felt dizzied from shock at the scene before him. Unable to control himself, his body wobbled as he looked at Huang Xiaolong with shock and trepidation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What kind of battle skill was this?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>By now, it was apparent to him that Huang Xiaolong had yet to break through to Xiantian Seventh Order, but the cultivation technique he practiced was undoubtedly high. Therefore, Huang Xiaolong’s battle qi grade exceeded his by more than a grade or two. On top of that, the battle skill he practiced was much stronger too, perhaps it might even be a legendary Heaven grade battle skill!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that even the Eye of Reincarnation failed to resolve Chen Xiaotian, Huang Xiaolong realized it would difficult to defeat the opponent if he didn't summon his martial spirit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the end of the day, Chen Xiaotian’s strength was a peak late-Xiantian Seventh Order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Chen Xiaotian, Geng Ken, and the rest watching, a coruscating light burst out from Huang Xiaolong’s body. Roars of dragons shook the heavens as twin dragons materialized in midairㅡa black and a blue dragon! Overwhelming dragon might flooded the hall like the rushing currents of the Milky Way, spreading to every corner of the spacious grand hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black and blue dragons wound themselves around Huang Xiaolong, akin to a Dragon God reincarnation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Twin Primordial Divine Dragon martial spirits!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Geng Ken, Du Xin, and Deng Guangliang’s bodies trembled, staring at Huang Xiaolong with feverish eyes.</span></p>
