 <p><b>Chapter 393: The Age Definitely Can’t Be Wrong </b></p>
 <p><span>“Oh, you even sell pill refinement tactics here?” Huang Xiaolong’s interest was piqued. Although pill refinement tactics were rare, some bigger shops did indeed sell them. Of course, these pill refinement tactics were usually low level, ordinary ones.</span></p>
 <p><span>Noticing that Huang Xiaolong’s interest was piqued, Supervisor Lin smiled warmly, “Of course, not only do we have the low grade pill refinement tactics, we can even offer intermediate pill refinement tactics.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong was slightly disappointed, low and intermediate pill refinement tactics were of no use to him, but if they had high level pill refinement tactics, he wouldn’t mind buying them, hence, Huang Xiaolong did not asked anymore questions.</span></p>
 <p><span>But he took out a piece of paper from the Asura Ring, handing it to Supervisor Lin, “This is the list of ingredients that I want to buy.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Supervisor Lin took the piece of paper. With a glance, he saw that the piece of paper was full of words, line after line. It listed more than a hundred types of pill refinement ingredients.</span></p>
 <p><span>Moreover, every item, Huang Xiaolong wanted one hundred of them.</span></p>
 <p><span>This greatly shocked Supervisor Lin. Many ingredients listed by Huang Xiaolong were rare, even if the requirements were merely one-hundred-years-old, the total of these this could cost up to ten million!</span></p>
 <p><i><span>Ten million!</span></i></p>
 <p><span>This was still Supervisor Lin’s conservative estimation.</span></p>
 <p><span>It wasn’t like he hadn’t done transactions worth ten million and above, but still, it was only a once or twice.</span></p>
 <p><span>Recovering from his shock, Supervisor Lin’s heart was blooming in all colors, he didn’t expect this black-haired young man to be a super, extra large fat sheep.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong spoke at this time, “The items that I want, does your Aowu Shop have them?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Supervisor Lin concealed his excitement with a wide smile, reassuring Huang Xiaolong, “This Brother, please rest assured. These things that you want, we definitely have them in our Aowu Shop, may I know which variety you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Select the best variety you have in your shop for me.” Huang Xiaolong said.</span></p>
 <p><span>The smile on Supervisor Lin’s face stretched from ear to ear, “No problem.” But then he paused slightly here, “It’s just that our shop requires customers to pay a certain amount of deposit before the transaction is concluded. This is a rule. So, little Brother…?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong’s face was impassive: “How much?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Supervisor Lin chuckled, “Not much, one hundred thousand.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu exchanged a look, sneering coldly in their heart, they had never heard of any pill refinement ingredients shop to practice taking deposit from customers, furthermore, it was a one hundred thousand gold coins deposit!</span></p>
 <p><span>It was obvious that this Aowu Shop had quite the big appetite!</span></p>
 <p><span>However, Huang Xiaolong did not refuse. Maintaining the same impassive expression, he answered, “Sure.” With a wave of his hand, one hundred thousand gold coins flew out, sparkling gold coins rained down in a pile on the hall floor.</span></p>
 <p><span>Supervisor Lin’s eyes reflected golden light, his hand made a swift wave, transferring the one hundred thousand gold coins into his spatial ring. “Little Brother, please wait a moment. I will go tell people to prepare the ingredients on your list.” He left instructions to Iron-Skinned Dog to serve Huang Xiaolong before turning around and disappearing into the back hall.</span></p>
 <p><span>Under Iron-Skinned Dogs enthusiastic care, Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu were seated down, but Lil’ Tian was an active one, roaming around the shop, touching here and looking there.</span></p>
 <p><span>Seeing that Huang Xiaolong had a seven or eight year old child with him, Iron-Skinned Dog couldn’t help but be curious, “Young Noble, this little one is your brother?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“He can be considered so.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span>This made Iron-Skinned Dog observe Lil’ Tian a little more, however, he couldn't find any resemblance between Lil’ Tian and Huang Xiaolong. Moreover, that little kid’s clothes were neither here nor there, with bare feet, he was no different than a wild child from the forest. But Huang Xiaolong didn’t look like someone that would kidnap small children. According to his opinion, someone that could easily tip a spatial ring, their status must be high, it was impossible for someone like that to be trading children.</span></p>
 <p><span>Furthermore, he could see that the little kid genuinely liked Huang Xiaolong and willingly followed him. Iron-Skinned Dogs brain churned extra hard as possibilities ran through his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span>Of course, no matter how he guessed, he never would have thought that this seven or eight year old child was actually a human-shaped Saint realm demonic beast. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Iron-Skinned Dog continued to make idle small talk as Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu made themselves at home, savoring tea.</span></p>
 <p><span>The amount of ingredients that Huang Xiaolong wanted to buy was a lot, the Aowu Shop would need some time to prepare them and Huang Xiaolong was in no hurry.</span></p>
 <p><span>A little more than one hour later.</span></p>
 <p><span>Supervisor Lin emerged from the back hall with a dozen people following behind him, their hands laden with pill refinement ingredients.</span></p>
 <p><span>In the hall, the group of people arranged the ingredients in a corner, turned around and went to the back hall again, bringing out more ingredients.</span></p>
 <p><span>This group of people went back and forth more than ten times, nearly filling the hall to the brim with ingredients.</span></p>
 <p><span>When it was done, Supervisor Lin approached Huang Xiaolong with a big smile, “Little Brother, the pill refinement ingredients that you wanted are all here.” He said while pointing at the large pile of ingredients.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu all stood up and walked over. With a quick glance over the materials, Huang Xiaolong sneered inwardly. Even though it was just a quick glance, Huang Xiaolong was clear that the ages of these ingredients were inconsistent. Some were two to three hundred years old, and mixed within were those of forty to fifty years old. Not to mention, his requirement for each type of ingredient was one hundred, but in this pile, none fulfilled the stated quantity, there were, at most, only eighty to ninety for each pill refinement ingredient.</span></p>
 <p><span>But Huang Xiaolong deliberately questioned, “Supervisor Lin, this are your shop’s best quality pill refinement ingredients?”</span></p>
 <p><span>The smile never left Supervisor’s face, “That’s right, these are our shop’s best quality pill refinement ingredients.” He walked over to a particular ingredient called Wind Bison Blossom and picked up a stalk, explaining patiently, “Little Brother, see, this Wind Bison Blossom is over three hundred years. Not that I’m blowing my own trumpet, but a Wind Bison Blossom that is over three hundred years old, only our shop has such ingredients in stock.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Hearing that, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t resist a cold snicker in his heart, this Supervisor Lin was practically lying without feeling shame, that Wind Bison Blossom that he was holding was slightly over a hundred years old at most. How could Huang Xiaolong not tell?</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong took the Wind Bison Blossom from Supervisor Lin’s hands, looking as if he was checking the stalk of flower very seriously. After a while, Huang Xiaolong said, “Supervisor Lin, are you sure that this Wind Bison Blossom is over three hundred years? From what I see, at most, it’s only a hundred and fifty years old.”</span></p>
 <p><span>A trace a embarrassment flickered past Supervisor Lin’s face listening to Huang Xiaolong’s comment, surprised that the young man could determine that the Wind Bison Blossom was one hundred and fifty at most, realizing that Huang Xiaolong was someone experienced.</span></p>
 <p><span>In fact, Huang Xiaolong was right. That Wind Bison Blossom was a little over one hundred and forty years, definitely not the above three hundred years he had just exaggerated.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, knowing was one thing, admitting was another.</span></p>
 <p><span>Supervisor Lin laughed, “Little Brother, your judgement is erroneous. Our Aowu Shop’s ingredients &nbsp;are verified by South Oblast City’s best appraiser, the age definitely can’t be wrong. Look here if you don’t believe me.” He pointed at a piece of paper from the spot where he picked up the Wind Bison Blossom earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong glanced at the piece of paper stating that the Wind Bison Blossom was above three hundred years old. Other than the age of the ingredient, there was a line of words: Archaic Peak Appraiser Firm. &nbsp;</span></p>
