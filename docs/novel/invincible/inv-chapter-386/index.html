 <p><b>Chapter 386: Kill To Silence</b></p>
 <p><span>The small child took the large piece of Tyrant Boar meat that Huang Xiaolong gave him and started ravishing it with fervor. In just a few bites, the big portion of meat all went into the small child’s stomach.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong was struck speechless, exchanging a look with Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu, confirming the thoughts he had earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span>Regardless of how talented, how much of a genius a human could be, they wouldn’t be able to reach the Saint realm at the age of seven or eight. Then, there was only one explanation for this, this small child was a Saint realm demonic beast that had evolved into human form!</span></p>
 <p><span>When demonic beasts’ cultivation reached the Saint realm, they were able to change shape, looking like humans.</span></p>
 <p><span>While these thoughts ran through Huang Xiaolong’s mind, the small child was licking his lips, muttering: “Delicious! Delicious!” Then his eyes strayed to the remaining pieces of Tyrant Boar meat placed near the fire, looking at Huang Xiaolong with a covetous expression, “Big brother, can you give me another piece?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong grinned, “If you like it, you can have all of it.” Huang Xiaolong said, pointing at the roast meat lined up beside the fire.</span></p>
 <p><span>The small child’s eyes sparkled, “Really?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong nodded, “Really.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Thank you,&nbsp;Big brother!” After saying his thanks, the child couldn't wait, his short arms quickly reached out to grab the roast meat, totally unafraid of getting burned, then he started tearing large chunks of meat with his teeth merrily.</span></p>
 <p><span>Watching the small child, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help thinking about the little violet monkey.</span></p>
 <p><i><span>‘That little guy, I wonder how is it now?’</span></i><span> Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span>That year, Huang Xiaolong was a participant in the Duanren Imperial City Battle, ever since he left the Luo Tong Kingdom he had not seen the little violet monkey anymore. At that time, Huang Xiaolong had yet to advance to the Xiantian realm, while that little monkey was merely a Houtian Tenth Order.</span></p>
 <p><span>So many years passed, that little guy should have broken through to high-level Xiantian realm, right? Huang Xiaolong knew better than anyone else the terrifying speed with which the little guy’s strength grew, since it was capable of eating and refining demonic beast cores.</span></p>
 <p><span>So many years of not seeing the little guy, Huang Xiaolong was really starting to miss him.</span></p>
 <p><span>That year, if it weren’t for the little violet monkey, he wouldn’t have stumbled on the opportunity to get the Asura Tactics and the Blades of Asura. His life would have taken a totally different path.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Asura Tactics and Asura Ring—in a way, the little violet monkey led Huang Xiaolong to them.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Delicious, so delicious!” The child’s voice brought Huang Xiaolong out of his reverie. Looking at the small child, he saw that his little mouth was smeared with oil from the meat, smacking his lips with every bite as if he was eating the most delicious gourmet in the world.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu couldn’t resist laughing at the child’s antics.</span></p>
 <p><span>A short while later, the child dealt with all the roast meat like a passing storm.</span></p>
 <p><span>When the child appeared, Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu merely ate half of a Tyrant Boar, which meant that the child alone ate one and a half boars by himself. Even with one and a half Tyrant Boar in his stomach, the child’s stomach remained just the same.</span></p>
 <p><span>Rubbing the oil stain around his mouth, the child licked his fingers as if he was barely sated. Looking at Huang Xiaolong, he asked, “Big brother, did you cook that Tyrant Boar?” Dark obsidian pupils seemed to sparkle in the night.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong nodded: “That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The child said, “My father and mother used to roast meat for me too, but it doesn’t taste good at all. This roast Tyrant Boar you made is the best roast meat I've ever eaten.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong laughed, “Then where are your father and mother?”</span></p>
 <p><span>The cheerfulness was gone from his face in an instant, eyes turned red-rimmed with tears close to spilling at the edge, “My father and mother were killed by bad guys. Those people are evil, after killing my father and mother, they even chopped off their heads.”</span></p>
 <p><span>All three of them, Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu were aghast. Although they didn't know the strength of the child’s parents, judging from the child’s own strength, his parents would at least be high-level Saint realm experts.</span></p>
 <p><span>Who, actually dares to hunt high-level Saint realm demonic beasts?!</span></p>
 <p><span>High-level Saint realm demonic beasts were extremely resilient, and they were much stronger than human warriors of the same cultivation. Even for experts like Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu, unless deemed necessary, neither would disturb a high-level Saint realm demonic beast.</span></p>
 <p><span>The small child continued, “My father and mother blocked all the bad guys, telling me to run, that’s why I could run away.” The child looked crestfallen and pitiful.</span></p>
 <p><span>At this time, a sneer suddenly sounded, “Little guy, so you ran over here!”</span></p>
 <p><span>When the child heard that voice, his little face turned pale, fear evident in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu were also shocked. Their uninvited guest was definitely very strong. &nbsp;At least, no weaker than Zhao Shu or Zhang Fu, otherwise they couldn’t have approached without either of them noticing.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu all stood up, several shadows flickered and five people appeared before them.</span></p>
 <p><span>Five people, two amongst them wore blue robes with the pattern of a white phoenix sewn at the cuffs of their sleeves, whereas the remaining three people were clad in black robes, marked with a red cloud at their chest.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was obvious that the five people were from two different forces.</span></p>
 <p><span>But Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu were surprised noticing their attires, nearly blurting out in unison, “White Phoenix House and Distinct Void Door!” </span></p>
 <p><span>White Phoenix House and Distinct Void Door?</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong observed the five people; the two men in blue robes should be from White Phoenix House while the three men in black robes were undoubtedly from the Distinct Void Door.</span></p>
 <p><span>The five people gave Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu an extra glance for making out their identities so easily.</span></p>
 <p><span>“These warriors’ eyesight is really good, able to recognize our White Phoenix House and Distinct Void Door.” One of the old men from Distinct Void Door chuckled in praise, as he did so, a violet glint shone from his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>By this time, the child was already hiding behind Huang Xiaolong, glaring at the five arrivals with anger, he pointed at them and said to Huang Xiaolong, “Big brother, it’s them, they killed my father and mother.” Probably because Huang Xiaolong gave him some roast meat, he felt that Huang Xiaolong was his closest kin at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Several warriors, this is our White Phoenix House and Distinct Void Door’s matter, it’s best if you do not interfere.” One of the White Phoenix House middle-aged men warned.</span></p>
 <p><span>Clearly, they could see that Huang Xiaolong’s group of three weren’t simple characters, especially Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu, which was why they did not attack the instant they arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span>Both Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu looked at Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span>Noticing their actions, the five people also shifted their attention onto Huang Xiaolong, a little surprised that the one making the decision wasn’t Zhao Shu or Zhang Fu.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong glanced at the five people, “This child, you cannot take away.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Neither one of the five people expected Huang Xiaolong to say that.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was obvious to them that Huang Xiaolong was not related to the kid they wanted to capture, and since they had made their intentions known, these people should look at White Phoenix House and Distinct Void Door’s face and give the kid to them without being nosy, but Huang Xiaolong chose to interfere!</span></p>
 <p><span> “Have you consider it well?” The Distinct Void Door old man’s eyes narrowed dangerously.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What I have decided would not change.” Huang Xiaolong was taciturn.</span></p>
 <p><span>The other White Phoenix House middle-aged man shook his head in pity, “For someone irrelevant, offending our White Phoenix House and Distinct Void Door, honestly speaking, such a decision is truly stupid.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The five people spread out, encircling Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the child in the middle.</span></p>
 <p><span>“If you let it be, you could have left,” Trapping Huang Xiaolong’s group, the Distinct Void Door old man mocked, “But now, it’s too late for you to regret. We can only kill to silence you!”</span></p>
