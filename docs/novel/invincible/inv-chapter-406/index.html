 <p><strong>Chapter 406: Can Evolve?</strong></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong’s face remained his usual calm, “Oh, why wouldn’t I dare to come?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong’s reply made the killing intent in Li Molin’s eyes even stronger. She smiled, yet it didn’t reach her cold gaze, “Huang Xiaolong, do you really think just because you subjugated some Poison Corpse Scarabs that you’re invincible between this heaven and earth? We have the Divine Dragon Armor, those Poison Corpse Scarabs of yours are useless against us!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong retorted with nonchalance.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Huang Xiaolong, hand over the God Binding Ring and Absolute Soul Pearl.” Liu Yang, who was standing beside Li Molin, interjected coldly, “Don’t even think that you can run, the space in this whole area has been locked down by us using Golden Silkworm Thread, if you obediently hand over the God Binding Ring and Absolute Soul Pearl, we can consider letting you die more comfortably!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Golden Silkworm Thread was a rare spiritual item that could cut off space connection. Although a Saint realm expert could manipulate space, if space was entirely&nbsp;locked even they couldn’t escape.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu’s faces tightened—Golden Silkworm Thread!</span></p>
 <p><span>Neither one of them expected Deities Templar to have such a thing.</span></p>
 <p><span>Both of them were aware of how terrifying Golden Silkworm Thread was, the legendary Golden Silkworm Thread produced every ten thousand years. It was tough enough to flay the flesh of a Saint realm expert. The Golden Silkworm Thread’s sharpness was evident.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, Huang Xiaolong blatantly ignored Liu Yang, shifting his attention onto Chen Tianqi’s group, revealing the Asura Ring on his finger.</span></p>
 <p><span>The moment the Asura Ring emerged, it reflected a cold glint in the setting sunlight, exuding an inviolable mysterious power.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Asura Ring!” The group of Domain Leaders behind Chen Tianqi paled slightly looking at the Asura Ring, yet there was an indescribable excitement in their eyes at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Asura Ring was the highest symbol of the Asura’s Gate.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong snapped, “Seeing the Asura Ring is like seeing the Sovereign, kneel down!” Huang Xiaolong’s voice carried a power that jarred their minds.</span></p>
 <p><span>The group of Domain Leaders behind Chen Tianqi shook. Their knees bent slightly, about to kneel down in salute when Chen Tianqi’s loud bellow brought them back to their senses.</span></p>
 <p><span>Chen Tianqi faced Huang Xiaolong with a sarcastic sneer, “Huang Xiaolong, do you reckon that with a mere Asura Ring, you really are the Asura’s Gate Sovereign? Truly ridiculous! I succeeded the Sovereign position based on the unanimous vote of all Domain Leaders, thus I am the rightful Sovereign. Huang Xiaolong, since you’re my Master’s disciple, that means you’re also my Asura’s Gate disciple. Seeing this Sovereign, why aren’t you kneeling down in salute?!”</span></p>
 <p><span>While saying this, Chen Tianqi looked at Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu, ordering in a stern tone, “Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, before this Sovereign why aren’t you kneeling down in salute? You two know very well that those not kneeling when seeing the Sovereign will be dealt with as traitors!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu’s expression sank. It never occurred to them Chen Tianqi would reverse black to white, turning the tables on them, claiming them to be traitors instead!</span></p>
 <p><span>One of the Domain Leaders, Gu Wen, behind Chen Tianqi stepped forward with a sneer, “Huang Xiaolong, Peach Blossom Sea,&nbsp;and Harmony Valley’s Domain Leaders were killed by you, right? As an Asura’s Gate disciple, killing brothers of the same sect, do you know your crime? Kneel down and seek mercy from Sovereign Chen!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong’s expression became grim, “Since that’s your choice, then all of you can go to hell!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Chen Tianqi burst out in a rancorous laughter: “Audacious! Huang Xiaolong, do you think that you’re a God Realm master?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Gu Wen and the rest of Domain Leaders laughed out loud.</span></p>
 <p><span>Although Huang Xiaolong had the Poison Corpse Scarabs, the Deities Templar’s experts had the Divine Dragon Armors, therefore, in Chen Tianqi’s and the Asura’s Gate Domain Leaders’ view, Huang Xiaolong’s Poison Corpse Scarabs had lost their lethality.</span></p>
 <p><span>At this time, Lil’ Tian’s voice sounded, “Big brother, can I fight later?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong was stunned, then a brilliant smile appeared on his face, “You can. Later, when you fight, hit as hard as you can.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Lil’ Tian was ecstatic receiving Huang Xiaolong’s permission and seriously nodded his little head, “Alright, I will use all my energy as if someone is robbing milk from me!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span>Then, Li Molin’s low bellow sounded, her figure flickered into a blur. When she appeared, there was a long azure sword in her hand, pointed straight at Huang Xiaolong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>The azure longsword emitted a curtain of azure glow, sharp sword intent bursting out in all four directions. There was no doubt that this azure longsword was a godly weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span>This time, Deities Templar made a conviction to kill Huang Xiaolong at all costs. That was why, not only did they take out the rare spiritual Golden Silkworm Thread, but all fifteen Deities Templar’s Elders present were also equipped with a godly weapon like Li Molin’s.</span></p>
 <p><span>Almost at the same time, Li Molin attacked Huang Xiaolong. Liu Yang and the rest of Deities Templar Elders also acted, launching their attacks toward Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu’s direction.</span></p>
 <p><span>A cold sneer flashed across Chen Tianqi’s face watching things unfold.</span></p>
 <p><span>This was something agreed beforehand between him and Deities Templar, they would resolve Huang Xiaolong and his group. But, of course, he also promised Deities Templar a lot of good things.</span></p>
 <p><span>Because Deities Templar also had plans to expand to Starcloud Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span>Asura’s Gate cooperating with Deities Templar was beneficial to Deities Templar’s foundation on Starcloud Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span>Just when Li Molin’s attack was about to reach Huang Xiaolong, Huang Xiaolong and Lil’ Tian suddenly disappeared from view. While a black cloud materialized in the air out of nowhere.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Poison Corpse Scarabs!” One of the Deities Templars’ face ashen, exclaiming out loud.</span></p>
 <p><span>Everyone was instantly alerted.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Why are there so many Poison Corpse Scarabs! Didn’t the message say that there were only ten thousand?!” Liu Yang stared at the large black cloud formed by the Poison Corpse Scarabs in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span>According to their information, the number of Poison Corpse Scarabs that Huang Xiaolong subjugated was no more than ten thousand. But the black swarm of Poison Corpse Scarabs was not just twenty thousand, it was at least thirty thousand!</span></p>
 <p><span>The number also frightened Li Molin, but a cold sneer soon sounded from her, “it doesn’t matter how many there are, we are wearing the Divine Dragon Armors and have godly weapons in our hands! To kill these Poison Corpse Scarabs will be effortless!” She waved the azure longsword in her hand to the cloud of Poison Corpse Scarabs to demonstrate to everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhenggg—! A crisp sound rang.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, in the next second, Li Molin’s face warped unpleasantly, for those Poison Corpse Scarabs cut by her azure longsword did not split in two!</span></p>
 <p><em><span>‘What is happening?! These Poison Corpse Scarabs’ toughness actually reached such a terrifying extent, not even a godly weapon can kill them?!’</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Liu Yang and the others looked just as grim, having the same results as Li Molin.</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Molin swung out her azure longsword once more, and an azure curtain of sword intent slashed across space, sending more than a dozen Poison Corpse Scarabs tumbling back in the air. Yet, moments later, those insects beat their wings and flew up again, continuing to attack.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Impossible!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“How are these Poison Corpse Scarabs’ defenses to horrifying?!” Li Molin shrieked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp;Only at this moment did Huang Xiaolong and Lil’ Tian’s silhouettes appear again.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong looked around, sneering, “I forgot to tell you, these Poison Corpse Scarabs can actually evolve.” In the last months, in order to push the Poison Corpse Scarabs’ evolution, he even took out some Dragon Blood Crystals he collected from the Ancient Dragon Clan ruins to feed them.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong noticed that after swallowing those Dragon Blood Crystals, their evolution was faster compared to purely eating Saint realm experts’ corpses by several times.</span></p>
 <p><span>In the end, Huang Xiaolong even took out Divine Dragon Pills to feed these Poison Corpse Scarabs. In the last several months, they had scourged more than three hundred pieces of Huang Xiaolong’s Dragon Blood Crystals and one hundred Divine Dragon pellets.</span></p>
 <p><span>“They can evolve!!” Li Molin, Liu Yang, and everyone who heard it turned sickly white.</span></p>
 <p><span>Including Chen Tianqi and the Asura’s Gate group of Domain Leaders. It never occurred to them that these Poison Corpse Scarabs could evolve, and their defense could be raised to this terrifying level!</span></p>
