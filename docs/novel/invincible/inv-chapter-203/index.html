 <p><b>Chapter 203: This Matter Won’t Be Forgiven So Simply</b></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, it was Huang Xiaolong!” Guo Fei interjected!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Shiwen looked over to Chief Steward Zhang Yue with a baffled expression, Huang Xiaolong’s name was strange to his ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Yue took a small step forward, explaining to him, “Huang Xiaolong is this year’s Imperial City Battle first place winner. Patriarch was away for some time, hence you have no impression of him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some time ago, Guo Shiwen went out to handle some business at an external Million Treasure House branch and had just come back recently. Being busy day in and day out with the family business, he hadn’t had the time to pay attention to these things. But then again, with his identity, he didn’t need to follow events such as the Imperial City Battle closely. In his eyes, the Imperial City Battle was nothing more than a game for kids.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This year’s Imperial City Battle first place?” a tiny frown appeared on Guo Shiwen’s forehead, “I heard that Xie Family’s little kid, Xie Puti, also took part this year?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes indeed. In this year’s Imperial City Battle, Xie Family’s Xie Puti also took part.” Zhang Yue replied respectfully. “But, in the last round, Xie Puti lost to Huang Xiaolong. This Huang Xiaolong’s talent is quite amazing, he has superb twin martial spirits!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Superb twin martial spirits!” Guo Shiwen was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, and both of his superb twin martial spirits are a Primordial Divine Dragon. One is the Black Dragon, and the other is a Blue Dragon that has never been seen before!” Zhang Yue added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A never seen before Blue Dragon!” Guo Shiwen’s eyes narrowed inexplicably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, on the the street just now Huang Xiaolong humiliated us, nearly crushing our throats!” Guo Zhi swiftly cut in, “We cannot let that mongrel bastard Huang Xiaolong off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Shiwen looked at the two of them. Suddenly, he clapped his palms together, sending out two spheres of flames that spiraled into their chests. The dark black handprint that Huang Xiaolong left on their body disappeared at rapid speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feeling the pain in their chests disappear, Guo Zhi and Guo Fei were overjoyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are Chen Qingfeng and Lu Yifan?” Guo Shiwen asked Zhang Yu, “Go and summon them here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Patriarch!” Zhang Yue answered with respect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, an uneasy hesitation showed on Guo Zhi’s face as he said, “Dad, Steward Chen Qingfeng and Lu Yifan, just now, they, they…!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Spit it out!” Guo Shiwen’s frown creased deeper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Zhi nearly jumped out from his skin, “We ran into Huang Xiaolong in the streets, later, the two stewards also came. They are still there now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re still there?” This puzzled Guo Shiwen and Zhang Yue. Both were unable to catch the meaning behind those words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Being the focus of Guo Shiwen and Zhang Yue’s gaze, Guo Fei stammered out an explanation, “Both the stewards, Chen Qingfeng and Lu Yifan, were wounded. They, they are still lying there. I’m not sure if they’re still alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?!” Guo Shiwen and Zhang Yue both exclaimed in shock with widened eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Qingfeng and Lu Yifan were wounded and still lying on the streets, and the brothers was unsure if they were dead or alive?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Zhi and Guo Fei cast their head down, too scared to face Guo Shiwen’s expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Was it a bodyguard beside Huang Xiaolong?” Guo Shiwen questioned in a surly tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, one of Huang Xiaolong’s bodyguards.” Guo Zhi hurried to answer, describing &nbsp;Zhao Shu’s facial features to his father.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Guo Zhi finished, Guo Shiwen and Zhang Yue exchanged a look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did Huang Xiaolong’s bodyguard wound Chen Qingfeng and Lu Yifan?” Guo Shiwen asked another question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huang Xiaolong’s bodyguard waved his hand a single time and a giant palm print appeared in the sky above, swatting down on Chen Qingfeng and Lu Yifan. Then, both stewards were directly buried into the ground.” Guo Fei said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?! You’re saying the other side just used a single wave of his hand?” Guo Shiwen and Zhang Yue were shocked once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s true, that bodyguard just used one move!” Guo Fei answered honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The atmosphere in the big hall suddenly became stagnated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Shiwen paced back and forth, and no one dared to make a sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After what seemed like a long time, Guo Zhi walked up and muttered cautiously, “Dad, we cannot let this matter be forgiven!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Shiwen looked at his sons, his words were spoken slowly through his lips, “Of course we won’t let this matter be forgiven so simply!” He, as the recognized Guo Family successor had both of his sons humiliated and wounded in public. Where would the Guo Family’s face be if he let this matter go?</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that time, Zhang Yue stepped forward as well, “Patriarch, if the other side needed only one palm to wound Chen Qingfeng and Lu Yifan gravely, then he is very likely a peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order expert, someone very close to breaking into Saint realm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Shiwen scoffed, “So what if he is a peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order expert.” A ruthless light flickered in his eyes as he said, “Even if he is a peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order expert, he dared to injure my son. There is only one ending, death!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Death!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A powerful aura burst out from Guo Shiwen’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time in Yao Manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Fei’s expression was extremely gloomy as he listened to his subordinate’s report.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is the name of that middle-aged man that wounded Chen Qingfeng and Lu Yifan?” Moments later, Yao Fei asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A middle-aged man in an indigo robe came forward, “According to this Subordinate’s investigation, he is called Zhao Shu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man who responded was Yao Fei’s left and right-hand man, his name was Xiao Teng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhao Shu.” Yao Fei repeated the name.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Teng moved closer, adding: “Young Noble, this Zhao Shu is probably very close to breaking into Saint realm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems, Jin Mu and Zhang Fei’s death are related to this Zhao Shu person.” Yao Fei snickered, “Peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order? No wonder Huang Xiaolong was so arrogant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Noble, with regards to Huang Xiaolong, should we… ?” Xiao Teng hesitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A mere peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order expert. Our Yao Family has a foundation that was built over two thousand years ago, would we be afraid of a greenhorn that’s wet behind the ears?” Yao Fei scoffed, “Regardless of what identity that Huang Xiaolong has, people who have offended me will suffer the same consequences, and that is to die miserably.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Continue sending people to watch over Huang Xiaolong’s movements!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Young Noble!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deep in the silent night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong stood in his yard. The scene of Li Lu being taken away once again replayed in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ao Baixue!” His knuckles turned white as he thought of the words Ao Baixue said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was barely seven years left before the next Deities Templar’s disciple selection. And one of the conditions to become a Deities Templar disciple was to reach Xiantian Tenth Order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiantian Tenth Order!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monstrous though Huang Xiaolong’s talent might be, and as fast as his cultivation speed was, there was no way he could advance to Xiantian Tenth Order in seven years!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was there no other way? Huang Xiaolong’s brows locked together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sovereign!” Suddenly, Zhao Shu’s voice sounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come in.” Huang Xiaolong calmed himself and answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sovereign, did you need something from me?” Zhao Shu asked after he stepped in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhao Shu, do you know of any method that could help me break through to Xiantian Tenth Order within seven years?” Huang Xiaolong asked directly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, Zhao Shu sighed secretly in his heart. He could easily see through his Sovereign’s intention. Shaking his head, Zhao Shu said, “Sovereign, there’s no way, unless…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unless what?” Huang Xiaolong swirled around and his eyes lit up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unless Sovereign can spend time cultivating in Divine World.” Zhao Shu said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Divine World!” Huang Xiaolong blanked for a second before shaking his head with a bitter smile. This was something impossible. Only Deities Templar knew the space tunnel to enter Divine World, and according to what Zhao Shu explained previously, it required several peak late-Saint Tenth Order experts working together with an ancient array before a tunnel could be opened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, out of nowhere, a thought struck Zhao Shu and he blurted out: “There’s another way, maybe it could… !”</span></p>
