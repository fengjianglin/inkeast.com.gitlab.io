 <p><b>Chapter 294: Back to Explore Broken Tiger Rift</b></p>
 <p><span style>As Wang Hai and the city guards fled further away, Huang Xiaolong retrieved his gaze, looking at He Yunxiong, he really couldn’t figure out what about him He Yunxiong liked enough to receive him as a disciple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Yunxiong was one of top ten experts in the Bedlam Lands, as long as he said the words, the people who wanted to be his disciples could line a hundred miles long!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As though He Yunxiong saw through Huang Xiaolong’s doubts, he laughed lightly, “Brat, you must be puzzled about the reason I want to accept you as my disciple? To be frank with you, I practice a kind of secret law that could roughly estimate a person’s talent, moreover, your character matches well with mine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong was nonplussed; </span><i><span style>that simple?</span></i><span style> However, He Yunxiong’s secret law that could estimate a person’s talent astounded Huang Xiaolong, such techniques, admittedly, were a little terrifying. Even if it was only a rough estimation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Yunxiong went on, “Brat, up to now, you haven’t cultivated over a hundred years, right? Less than a hundred years and you can already defeat a peak late-Xiantian Eighth Order, this level of talent, amongst the geniuses I’ve come across, you can be considered one of the top three.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hundred years? Huang Xiaolong smiled, if He Yunxiong knew he was only twenty-something, how would he react? Most people in general, once they entered the Xiantian realm, would use some secret techniques or take certain elixirs that made them look younger than their real age. Hence, it was difficult to guess a person’s actual age just by judging from appearances.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about it? My words are accurate.” Seeing that Huang Xiaolong kept silent the entire time, He Yunxiong thought Huang Xiaolong acquiescence to his evaluation, smiling, he said, “Brat, for now, let’s make it a simple kowtow acceptance ceremony. Once we return to Millennium City, I will send out the invitations for the official ceremony with top experts as witnesses, we’ll do the proper master-disciple ceremony at that time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When He Yunxiong assumed Huang Xiaolong would kowtow with joy, Huang Xiaolong shook his head instead, “Many thanks for Senior He’s assistance earlier, however, I have a Master.” In Huang Xiaolong’s mind, he only had one Masterㅡthe previous Asura’s Gate Sovereign, Ren Wokuang!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Though he acknowledged Shi Tianfu as Senior Brother in that trip to the Blessed Buddha Empire, those were unexpected circumstances and it was merely a title.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Yunxiong looked stupefied for a moment, this brat actually refused him?! Then he broke into a grin, he had been explaining without introducing himself to the little brat, this brat surely wasn’t aware of his identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little brat, I think you don’t know who I am, right?” He Yunxiong smiled amiably, “I am He Yunxiong, Millennium City’s Castellan.” Fearing that Huang Xiaolong might still be lost, he added another sentence at the end, “One of Bedlam Lands’ top ten experts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong smiled helplessly at his words, “Senior He, I’m aware of this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was He Yunxiong’s turn to be bewildered, frowning, he stared fixedly at Huang Xiaolong. This little brat knew who he was, yet he still refused to worship him as Master?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?” He Yunxiong’s voice was solemn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong replied, “In my heart, I only have one Master.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Yunxiong paused, “In Martial Spirit World, most of the Saint realm experts have more than one Master in their lifetime, I myself worshipped four different Masters.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What He Yunxiong said was the general truth, in Martial Spirit World, the majority of Saint realm experts had more than one Master. Despite that, Huang Xiaolong still shook his head and declined.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Yunxiong looked at Huang Xiaolong, suddenly an intangible pressure burst forth from He Yunxiong’s body, enveloping Huang Xiaolong, causing the other four, Qin Yang, Lifei, Jie Dong, and Fan Encheng to pale visibly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, facing the pressure from He Yunxiong, Huang Xiaolong appeared calm, even as He Yunxiong gradually increased the pressure. In the next moment, the solidified pressure from He Yunxiong retreated like the tide, vanishing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He stared at Huang Xiaolong like a defeated rooster in a match as he smiled, saying “Little brat, since it’s like that, I shall not force you, if you ever change your mind, come look for me in Millennium City. This is a Millennium Medallion.” Fishing out a small pendant-size medallion, he gave it to Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong received the grayish medallion inscribed with a double-headed celestial beast. The same celestial beast on He Yunxiong’s robe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without another word, He Yunxiong’s hand reached out, tearing space, his body entered and disappeared from the spot in a flicker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Keeping the Millennium Medallion into the Asura Ring, Huang Xiaolong returned to the small courtyard residence they bought with Qin Yang and the rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On another side, in the south section of the city, within an exquisitely decorated grand mansion, Zhao Chen was extremely sullen as he glowered at Chen Chen, who was kneeling before him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Garbage!” Zhao Chen kicked Chen Cheng, who was kneeling on the floor, without mercy. A woeful scream came from Chen Cheng as he was sent tumbling to a corner of the yard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chen’s hands grasped at the chairs beside him, turning them into powder. An intense sharp light glinted in Zhao Chen’s eyes, “This He Yunxiong, acting against me every time, one of these days I’m going to crush Millennium City and toy with his wives and concubines to their death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the guards behind Zhao Chen lowered their heads, none dared to utter a sound.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Crush Millennium City?</span></i><span style> Not even Sin City’s Castellan dared to speak of crushing Millennium City lightly. Millennium City had existed for thousands of years, the forces within were deeply rooted, would it be so easily destroyed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chen swirled around towards the silver-haired old man behind him, “Steward Feng, keep a tail on that Huang Xiaolong kid, once they leave the City of Myriad Gods, come report to me immediately.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Young Lord.” The silver-haired old man answered respectfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chen nodded as a light gleamed in his eyes.</span><i><span style> ‘Little punk, as long as you come out from the City of Myriad Gods, I’ll let you know the consequences of defying my, Zhao Chen’s orders! Don’t assume just because there is He Yunxiong, that old fogey, shielding you that I won’t dare to kill you!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As for Huang Xiaolong, he entered the Godly Mt. Xumi upon arriving back to the courtyard. Swallowing all three stalks of Life Soul Grass in the Xumi Temple hall, he concentrated on practicing the Ancient Puppetry Art and Soul Mandate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to He Yunxiong’s intervention, Huang Xiaolong believed that Zhao Chen wouldn’t act against him in public, at least not while he was still inside the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sitting cross-legged in the center of the Xumi Temple, Huang Xiaolong distinctively felt waves spreading out from his soul sea as his spiritual force gathered into a twister of energy, rotating like a violently howling storm, with strands of azure energy multiplying constantly. Sensing this, Huang Xiaolong quickly ran the Ancient Puppetry Art and Soul Mandate to absorb this energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ten days passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under constant refinement, the energy inside all three stalks of Life Soul Grass was absorbed by Huang Xiaolong. Finally, his soul sea returned to its prior calm, while in the space above his soul sea, the black and blue dragons hovered, dragons roars echoed endlessly, exuding dragon might in every direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes, the Eye of Hell of the center of his forehead opened as well and two beams of deep scarlet glow materialized like a thunderstorm. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After refining the three stalks of Life Soul Grass, Huang Xiaolong’s Ancient Puppetry Art finally broke through to the third level, greatly enhancing his spiritual force, and combined with his Eye of Hell, his spiritual attack was even more powerful than before. Huang Xiaolong astutely felt that after this time’s practice, even his battle qi and internal force benefited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s time to visit the Broken Tiger Rift again.’ Huang Xiaolong decided.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong had a strong feeling that the Broken Tiger Rift was the said Four Seas Mountain. In the depth of that rift was where that Ancient God Tribe master’s dwelling was, he was as sure as he could be.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite his rapid increase in strength over these years, Huang Xiaolong still felt that he was too weak. Disregarding experts like He Yunxiong, merely facing Yao Fei or Zhao Chen at his current level of strength, it would be a tough battle to fight. Therefore, he had to break through to the Saint realm as soon as possible.</span></p>
