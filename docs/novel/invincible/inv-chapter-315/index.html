 <p><b>Chapter 315: I Hope You Can Think It Over Clearly</b></p>
 <p><span style>Du Huagang stopped before Huang Xiaolong, giving him a once over glance from head to toe as he shook his head, “Brat, it wasn't easy for you to come this far, you being a peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order means that your talent is not bad. If you can follow a good master, you may have a bright future, but it’s a pity, you took cover under the wrong tree, therefore you can only die here today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because Huang Xiaolong arrived with Sun Haoran, standing slightly behind Sun Haoran, Du Huaguang naturally presumed that Huang Xiaolong was tied to Millennium City, serving as Sun Haoran’s subordinate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong merely replied with a stoic word, “Really?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Du Huagang chuckled watching Huang Xiaolong’s lack of expression, “Definitely, unless a miracle happens.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t waste time with words, swiftly take care of that brat.” Beside Du Huagang, Li Li was getting impatient. “Then the four of us can deal with Peng Feng and Sun Haoran.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Du Huagang nodded, wasting no more time with nonsense. His body flickered, arriving close to Huang Xiaolong in an instant, his palm struck out, aiming straight at Huang Xiaolong’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“An opponent that dies with a single strike has no meaning.” Resolving Huang Xiaolong so easily, Du Huagang shook his head with disdain. But then again, he wasn’t surprised. With his strength, it would need a miracle for a measly peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order to dodge his attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, in the next moment he noticed something wasn’t right, because…! It felt as if his hand struck against an ancient cold iron, a weak tingling pain came from his palm!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Du Huagang raised his head to see Huang Xiaolong facing him with the same indifferent expression, unmoving, standing on the same spot. Before he could recover, a surge of energy that made his heart quiver burst from Huang Xiaolong’s body. Du Huagang hastened to jump back, but he was still a step too late. The shadow of a halberd pierced through the air and penetrated cleanly through one of his shoulders, leaving a pillar of blood in its trail.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pained muffled grunt escaped Du Huagang’s throat as he retreated to Li Li’s side, staring at Huang Xiaolong with anger and wariness. Luckily he dodged in time just now, or else it wouldn’t be his shoulder that was pierced, it would be his heart instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing a pained grunt originating from Du Huagang, Li Li, who was immersed in watching the battle on the other side with Peng Feng and Sun Haoran, inevitably looked over. Seeing the large wound on Du Huagang’s shoulder, she was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Peng Feng and Sun Haoran couldn’t help risking a quick glance over to Huang Xiaolong’s side. Other than Sun Haoran, the rest were flabbergasted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Garbage, you can’t even handle a peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order!” When the shock receded, Li Li snapped at Du Huagang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Du Huagang’s face flushed bright red, but he dared not lash out against Li Li, hence he could only excuse lamely, “This brat is very strong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Li snorted coldly, turning to Huang Xiaolong, “Brat, looks like we’ve underestimated you earlier, unexpectedly, you have some skill.” In her opinion, although Du Huagang was injured due to carelessness, being able to injure him was still considered quite good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll give you a chance, as long as you cooperate with us, kill both Peng Feng and Sun Haoran and submit to us, to Snow Dragon City, I will recommend you to my Master. If your talent is really good, who’s to say that my Master won’t receive you as a disciple as well.” Li Li said, the superiority in her voice evident.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She conceitedly believed this bait was tempting enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the Bedlam Lands, how many talented geniuses would break their heads fighting for a chance to be received as a disciple under her Master,</span><i><span style> the</span></i><span style> Silver Dragon Ao Gu, but those people failed to catch a glimpse of him, not to mention meeting him. Some of these geniuses even knelt in front of Blood Dragon Mansion for ten days and ten nights, kowtowing continuously, but it was all in vain, for they still didn’t get a chance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that she offered to introduce him to her Master, this was like a dream come true to many people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Change my allegiance to Snow Dragon City?” Huang Xiaolong repeated, it seems the other side really took him as Sun Haoran’s subordinate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Li nodded with a smug smile, “Correct.” Then she added another sentence, “This kind of opportunity comes only once, I hope you can consider it carefully.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong shook his head inwardly; this kind of opportunity comes only once? To recommend him to Silver Dragon Ao Gu?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So, have you thought about it carefully?” Seeing Huang Xiaolong remained silent for some time, Li Li asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about this, I’ll also give you an opportunity to consider carefully,” Huang Xiaolong turned the tables instead, “This kind of opportunity only comes once, I hope you’ll think it over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Li and Du Huagang were dumbfounded, for a moment, neither understood what Huang Xiaolong meant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong went on, “Renounce Snow Dragon City, submit to me and I can consider sparing your lives.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone felt as if they’ve been struck by lightning, Peng Feng was even looking at Huang Xiaolong with a weird expression on his face. Was this brat out of his mind? He turned to Sun Haoran, the look in his eyes obviously asking if there was something wrong with this brat’s brain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whereas anger erupted from Li Li and Du Huagang, akin to a volcano, flaring to the sky from the bottom of their hearts, especially Li Li. A terrifying killing intent exploded from her, and around her, a storm of black-colored snowflakes suddenly started to fall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you just said?!” Li Li’s eyes were razor-sharp, penetrating as they focused on Huang Xiaolong, each syllable hissed through her lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was Silver Dragon Ao Gu’s most favored disciple, bearing a distinguished status in Snow Dragon City, with countless sect disciple geniuses wooing her, showering her with compliments, all she ever heard were beautiful words. In Snow Dragon City, she could call the wind and rain with a single word, but now, an ant-like existence of a peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order brat dared to tell her to forsake Snow Dragon City and submit to him?!!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Become his subordinate?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the crudest term, <em>a slave</em>!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was humiliation!</span></p>
 <p><em><span style>Pure, naked humiliation!</span></em></p>
 <p><span style>“You didn’t hear it clear enough?” Huang Xiaolong ignored the killing intent spewing from the other side’s eyes, “There’s only one chance, have you thought it over carefully?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Huang Xiaolong’s sentence ended, an indignant scream split the air. Li Li twirled around, amassing a violent windstorm with her at the center, akin to a wind dragon, spiraling towards Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong remained calm watching the mad attack, he transformed into Asura Physique and was ready for battle. Thick, dense slaughter aura gathered around him, two giant ebony black wings extended out from his back while the Eminent Holiness Halberd in his hand stabbed out decisively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shaking Mountains, Flipping Seas!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Halberd shadows numbered in the millions, a fierce gale gathered like a tsunami, colliding with Li Li violent wind storm. The windstorm dissipated and Li Li’s slender body spun with ease, like a dragon in the vast sea, narrowing the distance between them, her palms flat and straight like the edge of blades, &nbsp;stabbing towards Huang Xiaolong’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dragon Breaking Hand!” Sun Haoran tensed up watching this move, blurting out anxiously: “Brother Huang, watch out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dragon Breaking Hand? Huang Xiaolong’s eyes grew icy, his hands shaped into claws, ripping towards the opponent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thousands of demons howled, devil aura overcast the sky!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asura Demon Claw! </span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the Asura Demon Claw appeared, the devils and ghosts hovering above the temple felt a pull, an attraction, flying towards the claw below, boosting the attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Watching the towering dark claw looming over her head, Li Li paled. She retreated back swiftly like a frightened little dragon, whereas Huang Xiaolong dashed forward, swinging the Eminent Holiness Halberd in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Halberd Galaxy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countless halberd shadows shot out, shining brightly like falling meteors in the twilight sky.</span></p>
