 <p><strong>Chapter 414: An Asura from Hell?</strong></p>
 <p><span>Ever since the Asura Square battle, Huang Xiaolong’s side had not taken any action. The Qi Family formed such opinions, and the other fourteen big families came to similar conclusions, thinking that Huang Xiaolong was apprehensive toward the backing forces behind them, such as the Distinct Void Door, White Phoenix House, and others.</span></p>
 <p><span>On this particular morning, Huang Xiaolong was practicing the Asura Sword Skill’s eight move: Mountain of Knives, Sea of Fire at the back of the Heavenly Sky Phoenix mountain when Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu rushed over with faces full of delight to report to Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Sovereign, we found the Dragon God Grass!” Zhao Shu exclaimed in buoyant mood to Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong trembled slightly and his eyes lit up.</span></p>
 <p><span>“According to the disciple's report, Treasure Oblast Qin Family’s Patriarch also entered the Ancient Dragon Clan ruins that year and collected eight stalks of Dragon God Grass!” Zhang Fu interjected with a laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Eight stalks of Dragon God Grass!” Huang Xiaolong was beaming.</span></p>
 <p><span>Eight stalk Dragon God Grass! It was just enough for him to refine one primordial divine dragon body!</span></p>
 <p><span>The amount of dragon essence contained in one primordial divine dragon was overwhelmingly abundant, so much that it was impossible for one single stalk of Dragon God Grass to have any effect in smoothing the violent surging energy during refinement; according to the old manuscript record, it stated that one needed at least seven to eight stalks of Dragon God Grass.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Reward that disciple heavily!” Huang Xiaolong said to Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu with a big smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span>Both acknowledged Huang Xiaolong’s order with respect.</span></p>
 <p><span>“However, Sovereign, the Treasure Oblast is Cosmos God Cult’s territory.” Zhao Shu highlighted his concern, “Furthermore, that Qin Family’s Patriarch would not necessarily be willing to part with that eight stalks Dragon God Grass.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong waved his hand nonchalantly, the smile never left his face, “It’s fine.” Since there was Dragon God Grass in the Qin Family Patriarch’s hand, things would be easy to deal with.</span></p>
 <p><span>Although Dragon God Grass was also a very rare herb, its biggest role was to reduce the violent energy from a primordial divine dragon’s blood and essence. Holding those eight stalks of Dragon God Grass would not bring much benefit to the Qin Family’s Patriarch.</span></p>
 <p><span>As long as Huang Xiaolong could take out something tempting enough in exchange, he believed that the other party would definitely be willing to exchange them with the Dragon God Grass.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Right, Sovereign, this subordinate has another matter to report.” Zhang Fu suddenly remembered a matter.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Oh, what is it?” Huang Xiaolong asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhang Fu continued respectfully, “Snow Wind Continent’s Blessed Buddha Emperor sent a messenger over to tell us that not long after we left Blessed Buddha Empire, Princess Shi Xiaofei followed behind us and came to the Starcloud Continent.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Shi Xiaofei is here in Starcloud Continent…?!” Huang Xiaolong was dumbfounded by the news.</span></p>
 <p><span>At that time, Shi Xiaofei wanted Huang Xiaolong to bring her over to Starcloud Continent, but he refused. He didn’t expect this girl to have the spunk to sneakily trail behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The Blessed Buddha Emperor said that Shi Xiaofei would send news back every two to three days since she left Blessed Buddha Empire, however, from ten days ago, they have lost contact with Princess Shi Xiaofei.” Zhao Shu added.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong’s brows creased into deep furrows, “Ten days?” It seems like Shi Xiaofei might have met with some problem.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Do we know the last place Shi Xiaofei was at before losing contact with the Blessed Buddha Empire?” Huang Xiaolong grasped the most crucial point.</span></p>
 <p><span>“According to the Blessed Buddha Emperor, she was at the Treasure Oblast!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Treasure Oblast!” Huang Xiaolong was slightly stunned, wasn’t this too much of a coincidence?</span></p>
 <p><span>“The Blessed Buddha Emperor needed to guard the Blessed Buddha Empire and unable to leave the Snow Wind Continent, thus he requested Sovereign's help to find Princess Shi Xiaofei’s whereabouts.” Zhang Fu said.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Blessed Buddha Emperor, Shi Fantian, was his Senior Brother, moreover, Shi Xiaofei could be considered missing because of him, and it was in Starcloud Continent. Whether it was reason or relationship, it was only right that he help find Shi Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Send word back to Senior Brother Shi Fantian, tell him not to worry about this matter.” Huang Xiaolong’s voice grew solemn.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu complied.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I will head to Treasure Oblast right after this, in my absence, the Asura’s Gate matters would need to trouble both of you to handle.” Huang Xiaolong added.</span></p>
 <p><span>Both Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu were surprised that Huang Xiaolong planned to head to Treasure Oblast in such hurry, without bringing either of them. Zhang Fu quickly requested to go with Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “I alone am enough. If all three of us are gone, who’s going to take care of matters at the headquarters? Don’t forget, the more people, the bigger the target, the easier it is to draw Cosmos God Cult’s suspicion.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s argument, the two old men reluctantly conceded. Huang Xiaolong tasked them with handling various matters before Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu retreated.</span></p>
 <p><span>After both of them left, Huang Xiaolong thought of something. His figure disappeared in a flicker towards the north side of Heavenly Sky Phoenix Mountain. Located here, on this northern side, was Asura’s Gate treasure trove.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>For the past month, Huang Xiaolong had been busy with his cultivation, practicing the Thirteen Forms of the Dragon God, the Godly Xumi Art, and Asura Tactics, and had yet to have the time to visit the Asura’s Gate treasure trove. He remembered that his Master Ren Wokuang stated in the Asura Tactics cultivation technique that he left a ‘treasure’ for him inside the treasure trove, something that would aid his Asura Tactics cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span>Before he departed toward the Treasure Oblast, Huang Xiaolong wanted to see what his this so-called treasure that his Master Ren Wokuang left for him inside the Asura’s Gate treasure trove.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Greeting the Sovereign!” The moment Huang Xiaolong appeared, the two Asura’s Gate Elders guarding the treasure trove appeared, greeting Huang Xiaolong with respect.</span></p>
 <p><span>“No need for so much ceremony, stand up.” Huang Xiaolong said, indicating to both Elders to stand up.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong waved his hand, excusing both Elders as he walked towards the treasure trove’s elaborate entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Asura’s Gate treasure trove entrance was a hundred meters tall and thirty meters wide. At first glance, one could hardly determine the material used to construct this door that looked dull and dark. It was daytime at the moment, the sun was shining bright and warm, but despite that, when one got closer to the door, a cold feeling enveloped them, a frigid air that seemed to penetrate deep into one’s bones.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong was astounded; even though this much cold was nothing to a Fourth Order Saint realm like him, if it were those Xiantian realm warriors, they probably couldn’t approach the door.</span></p>
 <p><span>Standing right in front of the big door, Huang Xiaolong still couldn’t figure out what material was used to construct it. He scanned around, and finally, his sight fell onto a palm imprint on the left side of the door.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong placed his right palm right into the imprint on the door, running the Asura Tactics. Asura qi surged forth from his palm, and instantly, the entire large framed door burst out in a dazzling light that seemed to reach the sky as the door slowly opened.</span></p>
 <p><span>The door to the Asura’s Gate treasure trove could only be opened using Asura qi, which was why Huang Xiaolong wasn’t worried that item Master Ren Wokuang left for him would fall into Chen Tianqi’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span>One step into the treasure trove, a whelming aura submerged Huang Xiaolong, alarming him. Looking around, Huang Xiaolong saw an altar in the middle of a spacious hall, and on that altar was a heavily chained strange creature that resembled a human, yet was not! Mysterious talisman symbols ran along those thick iron chains, glimmering occasionally.</span></p>
 <p><span>Two short horns grew on the forehead of this strange creature. Its arms, legs, body, and other parts were covered with a layer of scales; its eyes seemed to glow scarlet red, and all ten fingers were like claws that were dyed with fresh blood.</span></p>
 <p><span>Occasionally, black mists would float out from its body.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This is… Hell Asura?!” A thought clapped through Huang Xiaolong’s brain, both his eyes protruded in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span>Hell Asura?!</span></p>
 <p><span>The Asura’s Gate treasure trove actually had a sealed real-life Hell Asura inside!</span></p>
 <p><span>Words couldn’t describe the shock Huang Xiaolong felt. On top of that, he could sense the raw energy emitting from this Asura, powerful, violent. Its strength had, at the very least, exceeded Tenth Order Saint realm.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What is this? How did Master find this Hell Asura?” Huang Xiaolong mumbled a little incoherently to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span>Or, did this mean that his Master had crossed over to Asura Plane in Hell before this?!&nbsp;</span></p>
