 <p><b>Chapter 253: Geng Ken’s Doubt</b></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong opened the Eye of Hell and surveyed the mansion’s surroundings. In the next second, a sharp glint flickered inside the Eye of Hell and two red beams of light pierced through the sky above. Some birds flying in the air above plummeted down to the ground with a ‘puchi’ sound coming from their bodies. After a few moments of futile struggle, their vitality disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is the Eye of Hell’s spiritual attack?</span></i><span style> Judging based on outside appearances, these birds didn’t seem like they were harmed in any way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless of what kind of living being it was, as long as it was something alive, it contain a soul. Just as these birds had souls, under Huang Xiaolong’s Eye of Hell spiritual attack, these birds’ souls were instantly destroyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Huang Xiaolong was frowning as he watched the last bird on ground, muttering to himself;</span><i><span style> it seems I need to increase my spiritual force cultivation.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The power of a spiritual attack was relevant to the strength of one’s spiritual force. Currently, Huang Xiaolong’s spiritual force was still too weak, otherwise, with the Eye of Hell’s spiritual attack earlier, these birds should have died instantly, not struggling even after falling to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, these were just normal birds, their souls were more vulnerable than most living beings. If they were Xiantian realm experts that had been cultivating for a long time, even without a spiritual force cultivation technique like Huang Xiaolong, their spiritual force was hundreds time stronger than these birds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus Huang Xiaolong had to intensify his spiritual force cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After testing the Eye of Hell’s spiritual attack power, Huang Xiaolong triggered the Asura battle qi in his body and the Eye of Hell on his forehead slowly closed, vanishing without a trace, and Huang Xiaolong’s appearance returned to normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong then headed to the mansion’s main hall, summoning Du Xin and Deng Guangliang there, he instructed them to prepare for a banquet like they did previously and invite another three Sky Magi Sect’s Elders. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Du Xin and Deng Guangliang left the main hall after receiving Huang Xiaolong’s order and went out of the mansion to perform the task. Huang Xiaolong himself remained in the main hall, slowly savoring the Sapidity Wine’s fragrance, muttering to himself, “I should have brought more Sapidity Wine with me if I’ve known this earlier.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he left Duanren Empire, the Sapidity Wine collection he had inside the Asura Ring was not very big, and it grew lesser by the day. The Sapidity Wine was the best wine Huang Xiaolong had ever tasted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Huang Xiaolong raised his head, a light flitted past his eyes like quicksilver as he quietly ran the Asura Qi, opening the Eye of Hell in the middle of his eyebrows. When it was fully opened, Huang Xiaolong directed his gaze towards the main entrance of the mansion, where Du Xin and Deng Guangliang were, having just returned, leading three middle-aged men dressed in Sky Magi Sect’s Elder robes in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, there was an additional guest other than these three people! A small old man wearing a brocade robe of ember-red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following behind the group of five, the small old man hid his presence skillfully. His small body seemed to fade into a half translucent appearance that blended with the air, cunningly escaping Du Xin and Deng Guangliang’s detection.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Looks like this little old man is that so-called Geng Ken.” Huang Xiaolong sneered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Watching Geng Ken sneakily hiding his presence, trailing behind Du Xin and Deng Guangliang’s group, it was evident that Du Xin and Deng Guangliang’s actions these days of inviting Sky Magi Sect Elders had roused this old man’s suspicion. Still, Huang Xiaolong remained nonchalant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this point, the key pieces had fallen into place. Since the old man presented himself at the door, he might as well subdue him together, lest it becomes troublesome in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After controlling Geng Ken, next would be Chen Xiaotian. With that, the Sky Magi Sect will be fully under Huang Xiaolong’s control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His spiritual force had improved greatly with recent practice. Exerting a little effort, he could manage to brand soul marks into four people at once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As these thoughts ran through Huang Xiaolong’s mind, Du Xin and Deng Guangliang walked into the main hall with the latest batch of Elders for the ‘banquet.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Similar to Lin Yu, Gao Qing, and Wu Honggang’s reaction, all three Elders were shocked and surprised to Huang Xiaolong sitting in the main hall drinking wine as they walked in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this time Huang Xiaolong did not waste time with nonsense, instead, he leaped up and struck all three with an Earthen Buddha Palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three men did not expect the black-haired young man would suddenly attack and all three Sky Magi Sect Elders was sent flying from the unexpected impact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You, who are you?!” All three heavily crashed to the floor. Getting up to their feet, the three Elders demanded in anger, fear weaved into their voices.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Lord!” Du Xin and Deng Guangliang greeted respectfully seeing Huang Xiaolong. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young...Lord?!” Du Xin and Deng Guangliang’s actions and reference towards Huang Xiaolong stumped the three Sky Magi Sect Elders. A strong feeling of unease rose in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Geng Ken who hid his presence was also shocked watching Huang Xiaolong suddenly attacking the three Elders and it rose a greater height hearing Du Xin and Deng Guangliang calling Huang Xiaolong Young Lord. His eyes sharpened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this point, Huang Xiaolong slowly approached the three Sky Magi Sect Elders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me enlighten you, those Sky Magi Sect Elders that were invited by Du Xin and Deng Guangliang before you, other than Lin Yu who was killed by me, the rest have submitted to me, just like Du Xin and Deng Guangliang.” Huang Xiaolong said, stopping in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?!” The three Sky Magi Sect Elders turned ghastly pale, shouting in shock. This message came like a thunderbolt on a sunny day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only were the three Elders shocked, even Geng Ken nearly sounded his surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of the Sky Magi Sect Elders had aligned and sworn themselves to serve this black-haired young man as a master?! Impossible, absolutely impossible! This was the first thought that crossed Geng Ken’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not possible! This cannot be true!” At this time, all three Sky Magi Sect shook their heads vehemently in denial, “This can’t be true! Little brat, do you think we would easily believe some nonsense out of your mouth?! Speak, who are you exactly, and what is your purpose coming to Black Demon City!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing either one of the three believed him, Huang Xiaolong’s expression did not change. He knew this was indeed something difficult to believe. Not to say just these three, anyone would have found it hard to believe. But then again, he didn’t expect them to believe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whether you believe it or not, is not important to me.” Huang Xiaolong continued, “Now, I’m giving you a chance, submit to me or die like Lin Yu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three Elders were fearful, moving away from Huang Xiaolong swiftly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the trio prepared to flee, Huang Xiaolong made a dash forward, and with a palm strike across space, the three elders fell back to the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong sneered watching three figures crash to the floor, “It’s best if you snuff the idea of escaping, this is your last chance, submit to me or die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Pui! </span></i><span style>Punk, who do you think you are, daring to dream that we will submit to you! You mother’s bullshit!” One of them raged: “This old man only has one cheap life, kill me if you dare!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong looked at the temerarious expression on that man’s face, a sarcastic sneer appeared on his face, knowing that this Elder was holding the same notion as Lin Yu, that he dared not kill them in Black Demon City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of the other two Elders and the hidden Geng Ken, Huang Xiaolong raised his hand and pointed a finger, a finger imprint shot out, piercing through that Sky Magi Sect Elder’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That Elder’s eyes rounded in shock, his body tumbled to the floor.</span></p>
