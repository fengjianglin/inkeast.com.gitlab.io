 <p><b>Chapter 360: Great Dragon Saber</b></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Tianqi dashed into the hall in a quick flash, his sharp eyes scanning around the spacious hall and finally falling on the four spots where the four crystal pillars used to be before they were taken by Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Huang Xiaolong cut through the edges of the four crystal pillars, there were still obvious clues left behind, especially on the ground. The other Asura’s Gate Domain Leaders also noticed the little signs of the four missing pillars in the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Domain Leader Gu Wen went up to check, stating in a sure tone, “There used to four pillars on these positions here, but they were taken away by someone, and it only happened not too long ago.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another Domain Leader laughed with mocking sarcasm, “Not even leaving the pillars alone, what kind of fool does that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His other comrades also chuckled in contempt. Except for Chen Tianqi. His sharp eyes continued to scan the length of the hall. In a flicker, his hand reached the golden dragon throne, circling around the throne seat, searching. Without warning, Chen Tianqi’s hand thumped on the golden dragon bead, crepuscular rays of light brightened the hall and a powerful rebound energy surged out, repelling everything in its proximity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Tianqi was shocked, hasty in his retreat, but even so, he was sent flying back by this energy, slamming into one side of the wall in a loud crash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sovereign!” Gu Wen and the others’ expressions tightened, hurrying to help Chen Tianqi up. When Chen Tianqi got to his feet with assistance, ‘puff!’ a large amount of blood spurted out from his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sovereign, how are you?!!” Gu Wen asked anxiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Tianqi waved his hand, indicating that he was alright. Taking a medicinal pellet and swallowed it down, ruddiness gradually returned to his face as he ran his battle qi to heal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sovereign, that throne seat?!” One of his subordinates failed to hold back his curiosity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Tianqi answered solemnly, “There’s probably a ban left behind by a God Realm master.” Luckily he managed to dodge when he did, otherwise, he would have fared worse than this much injury.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A ban left behind by a God Realm Master!” The group of Asura’s Gate Domain Leaders was horrified.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go!” Chen Tianqi gave his order and exited the hall. Although he clearly felt there was some secret related to that throne, that God Realm master’s ban was too strong, definitely not something they could break past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His subordinates followed from behind and the group sped away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sovereign, rumors say that Huang Xiaolong is also here in the Origin Forest.” Gu Wen followed right behind Chen Tianqi, muttering in a soft voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Tianqi nodded. Although they mainly moved around the Origin Forest, they had heard about what took place in the Rising Sun City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Looks like that Huang Xiaolong really has the Asura Ring, if not, Lord Left Custodian wouldn’t be ensuring his safety by being at his side.” Another Domain Leader interjected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This Huang Xiaolong’ growth is too scary, if we do not kill him as soon as possible, in another few years’ time, it would be even more difficult to exterminate him.” Another Domain Leader added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A sharp light glinted in Chen Tianqi’s eyes. Nevertheless, when things in the Origin Forest were settled, he had to make a trip to the Duanren Empire. True indeed, Huang Xiaolong must not be allowed to grow further!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For now, there's no need to bother about Huang Xiaolong. The crucial thing now is to quickly find the Dragon Tomb.” Chen Tianqi said, “Deities Templar’s people are also here, Li Molin’s group is definitely aiming for the Dragon Tomb as well, we absolutely must not let them get ahead of us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Sovereign!” The Domain Leaders complied in unison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, Huang Xiaolong arrived at another palace building on the north side. His feet landed on one of the roofs as he surveyed the area. This place also emanated a strong dragon aura. Not wasting time, Huang Xiaolong’s figure flickered, entering the palace building.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first thing the jumped into Huang Xiaolong’s sight was the big saber placed in the hall, a </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%E5%A4%A7%E9%BE%99%E5%88%80&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-nLqYsdjXAhWLKo8KHeHsBv0QsAQILg&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=472#imgrc=9jXh78ykEpHI7M:" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>Great Dragon Saber</span></a><span style>!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The body of the Great Dragon Saber was engraved with a blood dragon, emanating an intense killing aura, it was evident that this Great Dragon Saber had drunk a lot of blood from formidable experts in its heyday. Huang Xiaolong could feel the rippling killing aura where he stood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong approached, but when his right hand reached out to grab the Great Dragon Saber, his arm sank at the weight of the saber. He actually failed to lift the saber up and this realization stunned him. He was now a Saint realm expert, a grasp of his hand through space could crumble or lift an entire small mountain, yet he failed in lifting up this Great Dragon Saber!</span></p>
 <p><span style>What steel or ore was this Great Dragon Saber made of for it to be so incredibly heavy?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rise!” Huang Xiaolong pushed the battle qi from his Qi Sea, bright light shrouded his arm as he made a second attempt to lift the saber. Still, he barely managed to lift it a few inches off the table, but even so, it was a strenuous effort akin to a three-year-old toddler trying to lift a giant brick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Staring at the Great Dragon Saber in his hand, Huang Xiaolong mustered his strength and slashed out. A blood dragon was seen flying out and saber shadows blazed, carrying a whelming killing aura that swept out in all four directions like tidal waves. The palace walls crumbled without resistance, collapsing into ruins.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong gulped nervously looking at the damage done by the Great Dragon Saber.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Isn’t the power of this Great Dragon Saber a little too scary?’ </span></i><span style>Flipping the great saber in his hand, Huang Xiaolong grew fonder the more he looked at it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although both the Blades of Asura and the Eminent Holiness Halberd were powerful weapons, it was still big guys like this Great Dragon Saber that appeared more heroic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Staring at the engraved blood dragon on the saber body, a thought flashed in his mind and he pricked his finger, dripping a drop of blood right onto the blood dragon’s mouth and ran his battle qi to refine the Great Dragon Saber. Instantly, the blood red glow from the Great Dragon Saber pierced the sky as a monstrous aura of killing and slaughter rushed into Huang Xiaolong’s body, crashing into his consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong was startled and quickly willed himself to focus, running the Soul Mandate to slowly refine the rampant energy in his consciousness. When the killing aura was fully absorbed, he was able to breathe in relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he did, a scene appeared in Huang Xiaolong consciousness, showing a Dragon Clan master, holding the same Great Dragon Saber in his hands as he leaped to the sky. One slash, countless saber lights surged forth in multiple layers. In just one slash, the vast ocean was split in half..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, this Dragon Clan master spun the saber around, sending multiple saber lights out, mountains crumbled in its path.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One move after another, until the scene vanished from Huang Xiaolong’s consciousness. But it took Huang Xiaolong a long time to recover from what he had just witnessed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What he had just seen was the heritage battle skill he had received after refining the Great Dragon Saber, the Great Dragon Saber Formula!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Asura Sword Skill encompassed slaughter, it was bloody and peculiar; the Eminent Holiness Halberd Sutra emphasized directness, straightforwardness, fearlessness, and righteous courage; and the sole rule for the Great Dragon Formula was dominance! Dominance that destroyed everything that stood in one’s way!</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a total of six moves. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, when Huang Xiaolong was about to put the Great Dragon Saber away, his ears caught sounds of whistling wind, there were at least three people flying in his direction at high speed. Most likely the ruckus that he made earlier when testing out the Great Dragon Saber alerted people in the vicinity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the blink of an eye, three people landed in front of Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three people were dressed very differently, the only common point was that all three were clad in beast skin clothing, exposing muscular bare arms, exuding a faint but palpable atmosphere of demonic energy.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Beastmen experts!</span></i><span style> Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed to slits. This was the first time Huang Xiaolong ran into Saint realm Beastmen experts, moreover, these three seemed quite formidable, one was peak late-First Order Saint realm, while the other two were early-Second Order Saint realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the three experts landed, without exception, all their eyes fell on the Great Dragon Saber in Huang Xiaolong’s hand, shining with greed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This, is probably the Dragon Clan’s Great Dragon Saber?!” &nbsp;One of them spoke, voice trembling with excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Great Dragon Saber? Could it be that Great Dragon Saber refined by Blood Dragon Elder?” Another exclaimed in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It must be, see that blood dragon on the saber? It was said that Blood Dragon Elder was someone with heavy killing aura. Experts that died under his Great Dragon Saber numbered in the hundreds of thousands!” The first person spoke again. Confirming the saber in Huang Xiaolong’s hand, their eyes grew ever more feverish.</span></p>
