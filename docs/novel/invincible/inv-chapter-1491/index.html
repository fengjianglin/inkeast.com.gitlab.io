 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, Huang Xiaolong nodded and agreed with a pinky promise where the liar would be a piggy. Bei Xiaomei nodded her head with satisfaction and complimented, “I know Uncle is the best.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even so, Bei Xiaomei stayed for another day, before departing with extreme reluctance. With her gone, Huang Xiaolong felt much more relaxed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he watched Bei Xiaomei leaving with her entourage of Silver Fox Commerce’s experts, departing further and further away, and finally out of sight, Huang Xiaolong retrieved his gaze while thinking he could finally cultivate in peace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In recent days, Bei Xiaomei had come to his place early in the morning and left late almost every night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had even ‘complained’ to his Master Zhao Lei about this matter, but Zhao Lei had merely scolded him for not recognizing his good luck. The Silver Fox Commerce’s Second Miss was willing to be close to him, which was a pie falling from the sky, so what was he complaining about such good fortune? Had it been him in Huang Xiaolong’s shoes, he would spend sleepless nights for several years from happiness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Xiaolong could only smile wryly at Zhao lei’s words and had returned to his place without another word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since the apprenticeship ceremony had ended, the Fortune Emperor Palace had arranged a place for him inside the Fortune Divine Kingdom, at the same time, his cultivation palace at the Tiger Dragon Palace Gardens was also kept for his use.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After some contemplation, Huang Xiaolong decided to enter seclusion in his place at the Fortune Divine Kingdom as the spiritual energy and fortune energy there could slightly speed his progress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Xiaolong sat down cross-legged and took out twenty Fortune Divine Fruits from his pile of winnings he had gotten from Wang Yongsen. These Fortune Divine Fruits’ quality was even higher and contained richer fortune energy than the ones his Master Zhao Lei had given him previously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Refining twenty highest grade Fortune Divine Fruits simultaneously was his limit at his current level of mid-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Xiaolong summoned out his three avatars and the four of them formed a four-colored spiritual energy gathering formation as he circulated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium and began absorbing the Fortune Divine Fruits' energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he circulated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, fortune energy rushed outwards from the twenty Fortune Divine Fruits into Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars' bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Xiaolong's three supreme godheads were shining radiantly as they happily absorbed the fortune energy rushing into Huang Xiaolong's body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The seconds trickled by...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More fortune energy rushed into Huang Xiaolong's body, and his three supreme godheads shone even brighter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A month soon went by.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The twenty Fortune Divine Fruits floating in the air gradually lost their luster, crumbling and disappearing from the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A moment later, Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes and exhaled a breath foul qi. The highest grade Fortune Divine Fruits were really different, many times better than the Fortune Divine Fruits he had received as reward from the rankings competition and the ones his Master Zhao Lei had given him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Xiaolong stood up and stepped out from his cultivation palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His cultivation palace within the Fortune Divine Kingdom was located at the top of a high cliff, where abundant spiritual energy was condensed into clouds. Looking from above, the clouds and mists embroidered the cliff, painting an ethereal fairyland.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘I wonder where has Senior Brother reached now?’ Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More than a month ago, after the apprenticeship ceremony had ended, he made a requested to his Senior Brother Chen Hao to go pick up Li Lu, Yao Chi, as well as his two Masters, Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor to bring them over, as a precaution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Senior Brother Chen Hao had immediately understood his worries, and without any delay, Senior Brother Chen Hao had personally made a trip to the Vientiane World surface to pick up Li Lu, Yao Chi, and his two Masters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More than a month had passed, but Huang Xiaolong had not received any messages from his Senior Brother Chen Hao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After obtaining Fang Gan’s approval, Senior Brother Chen Hao had used the Fortune Emperor Palace’s low-grade grandmist flying ship. Considering the flying ship’s speed, Senior Brother Chen Hao was expected to return to the Fortune Emperor Palace with Yao Chi, Li Lu, Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor in another month’s time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Until Yao Chi, Li Lu, and his two Masters arrived safely, Huang Xiaolong found it difficult to fully concentrate on cultivating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Xiaolong frowned, thinking of the Fiend God Emperor Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">According to that Fiend God Emperor Palace’s master who had taken away Wang Yongsen, the Fiend God Emperor Palace would be participating in the Battle of the Heavenly Court. Moreover, from his tone, the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Emperor’s Disciple was much stronger than Wang Yongsen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Could he be a Seventh Order God King Realm master? Maybe even a peak late-Seventh Order God King Realm! Perhaps, he had already broken through to Heavenly Monarch Realm?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Though it didn’t seem very likely that the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Emperor’s Disciple had broken through to Heavenly Monarch Realm, there were always one of the two impossible things that became possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This further strengthened Huang Xiaolong’s determination to raise his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Master Zhao Lei had told him that the Battle of the Heavenly Court could very well be preponed, and it might be held in three thousand years? But it could be much earlier than that as well, maybe in one thousand years, or even a hundred years!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Huang Xiaolong was pondering about the Fiend God Emperor Palace and Battle of the Heavenly Court, a figure appeared in the distance and was flying towards him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the figure got closer, Huang Xiaolong saw that it was Fang Xuanxuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the Fiend God Emperor Palace had returned her safely more than a month ago, she had remained unconscious until the day before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the rule stated that only Emperor Realm masters and supreme godhead disciples could enter the Fortune Divine Kingdom, Fang Xuanxuan as the Fortune Emperor’s daughter was not bound by this rule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fang Xuanxuan also saw Huang Xiaolong standing on top of the cliff from afar. She halted for a split second, then continued flying towards Huang Xiaolong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moments later, she descended in front of Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation palace and approached him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After standing in front of Huang Xiaolong, there was a complicated expression on her face as she looked at him. She struggled internally for a few seconds before speaking, “I heard from my father that you’re the one who saved me… Thank you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she had first met Huang Xiaolong in the Royal Buddha Great Worlds, she had vowed to make things difficult for him after his arrival at the Fortune Emperor Palace. Now that Huang Xiaolong had a saving grace towards her, how could she hold grudges against him in the future?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not to mention, she had also heard that Huang Xiaolong was not merely a supreme godhead genius, but a king of supreme godhead genius. If she really created troubles for Huang Xiaolong, Uncle Zhao Lei and her father would reprimand her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re welcome.” Huang Xiaolong added, “It’s something I had to do.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, Fang Xuanxuan felt her mood improve, just a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You must watch out for the Fiend God Emperor Palace.” Fang Xuanxuan spoke again after a brief silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Xiaolong responded with a smile and said, “I will.” Even without Fang Xuanxuan’s reminder, Huang Xiaolong was aware of the dangers.</span></p>

He dazed momentarily then shook his head, as it seemed like Fang Xuanxuan had specifically visited to thank him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was planning to ask Fang Xuanxuan about her brother, the Emperor’s Disciple, but on second thought, he scratched off the idea as he didn’t want to risk rousing others’ suspicion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Well, he could look for other opportunities and asked his Master Zhao Lei instead. Zhao Lei should know the Emperor’s Disciple’s real name, right?&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Xiaoniu and the rest, Huang Xiaolong had them brought into the Emperor Fortune Palace’s grounds and arranged a place in one of the palace gardens for them, a month ago. They had been eating and sleeping well, and their days were more than comfortable, so there was nothing he needed to worry about them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Huang Xiaolong went back to his cultivation, somewhere in the vast space, there was a flying ship flying rapidly in the direction of the Fortune Emperor Palace. This flying ship was carrying Chen Hao on his way back from the Vientiane World surface. Li Lu, Yao Chi, Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor were with him on the ship.</span></p>
