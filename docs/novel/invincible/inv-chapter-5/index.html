 <p><b><u>Chapter 05: Wants To Cripple Both Of My Arms?</u></b></p>
 <p>Second Order Warrior!</p>
 <p>From the first day of cultivation up to reaching Second Order warrior, Huang Xiaolong spent little more than three days! This was an unprecedented event.</p>
 <p>In general, a grade ten martial spirit would require at least one year’s time to breakthrough to Second Order. Even if one possesses a superb talent martial spirit, one needs at least six months to achieve this result.</p>
 <p>However, Huang Xiaolong only spent three days!</p>
 <p>Suppressing the excitement in his heart, he continued running the Xuan Qin cultivation technique so that the second layer’s battle qi that was flowing into his meridians became smoother and calmer, circulating slowly.</p>
 <p>If first layer battle qi meridians are akin to a small stream, then the second layer battle qi meridians are comparable to a small river, wider and larger, accommodating more battle qi.</p>
 <p>The night passed.</p>
 <p>When the morning sun’s warmth streamed through the window onto Huang Xiaolong’s body. Huang Xiaolong stopped his practice and opened his eyes. After one night’s practice, he had stabilized his Second Order warrior cultivation.</p>
 <p><em>I wonder what little brat Huang Wei’s progress is like?</em> Huang Xiaolong thought, before jumping down from his bed and heading out of the room, stretching his limbs while facing the sun.</p>
 <p>Leaving his room, in the little yard, Huang Xiaolong caught sight of the very same half meter sized big rock in the corner that he hit several days prior. &nbsp;He couldn’t resist himself so he walked up to the big rock while lifting his right hand-- battle qi wrapped around his palm as he landed a strike on the rock. The big rock trembled violently as small pieces of rubble crumbled down, scattering all over the place.</p>
 <p>On the surface of the big rock, one could see minuscule crack lines. Retrieving his right hand while observing the power of his palm, Huang Xiaolong nodded with satisfaction. As per his expectation, after advancing to Second Order warrior, his strength was actually comparable to a late-Second Order warrior-- that’s equivalent to the power of two stones.</p>
 <p>Back on earth, if a seven-year-old child had the strength of two hundred pounds it would be an unbelievable marvel, but here on Martial Spirit World it was nothing to be lauded.</p>
 <p>From the little courtyard, Huang Xiaolong headed towards the Eastern Courtyard.</p>
 <p>Not far from his little courtyard he heard several manor guards’ gossiping.</p>
 <p>“Gee, I heard that Young Lord Huang Wei successfully condensed his battle qi in just three days! During our time, it took us two months to condense our battle qi. At this rate, Young Lord Huang Wei will be able to break through to First Order warrior in less than four months!”</p>
 <p>“I wonder how Young Lord Xiaolong’s practice is going?”</p>
 <p>“Young Lord Xiaolong? Although Young Lord Xiaolong’s talent is not bad, to successfully condense battle qi would require at least a month’s time. That is simply incomparable to Young Lord Huang Wei. To break through to the First Order would be a minimum of one year’s time!</p>
 <p><em>So, that little brat Huang Wei was already successful in condensing his battle qi?</em> Huang Xiaolong stood there with his hand behind his back, just like a small-sized adult as he watched the several manor guards walk away.</p>
 <p>Looking at the disappearing backs of the manor guards, Huang Xiaolong headed towards the Eastern Courtyard’s hall. Moments later after reaching the Eastern Courtyard and entering the main hall, other than his father and mother, there was also his little sister, Huang Min, and his four-year-old little brother, Huang Xiaohai.</p>
 <p>“Dad, Mom.” Huang Xiaolong called out as he entered the main hall.</p>
 <p>“Sit.” Huang Peng raised his head indicating to Huang Xiaolong that he sit at a particular chair inside the main hall, a trace of worry on his face. Sitting down, Huang Xiaolong found that Su Yan’s expression was the same as his father’s, so he opened his mouth and asked: “Dad, Mom, what happened?”</p>
 <p>“A few days ago, you beat up Zhou Guang’s son?” Huang Peng stared at his son and asked.</p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong directed his gaze towards his little sister, Huang Min. Without a doubt, this matter was reported by his sister. &nbsp;Conscious that Huang Xiaolong was looking at her, Huang Min stuck out her small tongue, afraid to look at Huang Xiaolong.</p>
 <p>“That kid was looking for a beating.” Huang Xiaolong calmly said.</p>
 <p>Huang Peng and Su Yan were taken aback, looking at each other.</p>
 <p>“How is your practice these few days?” Huang Peng asked moments later, no longer questioning on the previous matter. These past few days, Huang Xiaolong had been training day and night, regardless of the time. Huang Peng and Su Yan had of course noticed this, and they felt comforted that Huang Xiaolong was putting effort into his cultivation.</p>
 <p>Hearing his father’s question about his practice, Huang Xiaolong hesitated for a moment, should he tell them the truth? Or should he conceal part of his strength, or perhaps reveal that he already condensed battle qi?</p>
 <p>Seeing his son’s look of hesitation, Huang Peng comforted him: “It’s only been a few days, it doesn’t matter if you haven’t condensed out battle qi-- I spent a whole month before I successfully condensed out battle qi.”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Xiaolong, your talent is higher than your Dad’s. You’ll definitely be able to condense battle qi after a month.” Su Yan said.</p>
 <p>In truth, the two of them seeing the look of hesitation on Huang Xiaolong’s face made them think that Huang Xiaolong was embarrassed to answer that he had yet to condense battle qi.</p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong blanked for a moment listening to his parent's words. However, after a little thinking, he went along his parent's line of thought, saying: “Dad, Mom, rest assured that one month later I will surely be able to condense out battle qi.”</p>
 <p>Listening to their son’s ‘oath’, both Huang Peng and Su Ya were very pleased.</p>
 <p>Although Huang Xiaolong said that, worry deepened on their faces as they thought about the dubiousness of Huang Xialong’s oath. Huang Peng then replied to his son, saying: “Xiaolong, the day before yesterday, Huang Wei announced that he would cripple both of your arms during the Annual Clan Assembly!”</p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong finally understood the look of worry on his parents' faces.</p>
 <p>Others might not dare to do so, but since Huang Wei dared say as much, then he probably will cripple his arms during the clan assembly and claim that it was accidental. At that time, even Grandfather Huang Qide would not penalize him and instead just reprimand him with a few stern words at most.</p>
 <p>“Cripple both of my arms?” Huang Xiaolong smiled, a trace of viciousness rising in his heart.</p>
 <p>Seeing Huang Xiaolong’s look of unconcern, Su Yan was afraid that Huang Xiaolong did not know the gravity of the matter: “Xiaolong, Huang Wei has successfully condensed battle qi and by the end of the year, he will be able to achieve late-First Order warrior. He’ll do what he said-- at that time, he will definitely cripple both of your arms.” As Su Yan said this, an image of Xiaolong’s hands being crippled flashed through her mind and her eyes turned red.</p>
 <p>“What should we do? What can we do?” Su Yan broke down in tears.</p>
 <p>Huang Peng looked at his wife that was drowning in tears and was extremely vexed: “Woman, why are you crying? Can crying be of any help?”</p>
 <p>Su Yan turned over with a face full of tears: “If Xiaolong is disabled, what will you do then? If both of Xiaolong’s hands are wasted, how will he continue to live? Huang Peng, why don’t you seek Big Brother out, let him ask Huang Wei to let our Xiaolong off!”</p>
 <p>“Implore big brother?” Huang Peng frowned.</p>
 <p>“I know this will cause you to lose face, but do you prefer to see Xiaolong’s hands crippled?” Su Yan said, crying even louder.</p>
 <p>Seeing Su Yan crying so miserably, the two little ones, Huang Min and Huang Xiaohai, both walked over to her side and started crying together with her.</p>
 <p>Just when Huang Xiaolong wanted to say something, Huang Peng suddenly stood up while gritting his teeth: “Okay, I‘ll go!” After saying that, holding Huang Xiaolong’s small hand, he led him towards the direction of the Northern Courtyard.</p>
 <p>“Father, I--” Coming out from the Eastern Courtyard main hall, Huang Xiaolong opened his mouth wanting to say it was not necessary to look for Huang Ming, but he was interrupted by Huang Peng: “Xiaolong, in front of your Eldest Uncle, you must behave, understand?” After saying that, without waiting for Huang Xiaolong’s reply, he and Huang Xiaolong headed towards the Northern Courtyard.</p>
 <p>When they reached the Northern Courtyard, Huang Ming and Huang Wei, this father and son, were in the main hall. Coincidentally, Zhou Guang and Zhou Xuedong were also there.</p>
