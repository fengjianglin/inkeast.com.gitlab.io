 <p><b>Chapter 183: Imperial City Battle (15) </b></p>
 <p><i>“Boom!”</i> Exploding shockwaves reverberated on the stage. Xie Puti’s Tyrant God Finger scattered with one punch from Huang Xiaolong.</p>
 <p>To be precise, the grade of a battle skill only increased the power of battle qi during an attack.</p>
 <p>Before a stronger and more powerful battle qi, everything was futile.</p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong’s fist shot forward, striking Xie Puti’s body after scattering his finger attack battle skill.</p>
 <p>Taken by surprise, Xie Puti quickly countered with his fist, and in the next instant the two fists collided.</p>
 <p>Xie Puti’s body shook from the impact. The entire length of his arm went numb and he was forced to stumbled back repeatedly, whereas the black flame from the Black Flame Phoenix armor crossed over to Huang Xiaolong’s fist from the contact. However in the next instant, everyone saw when the phoenix’s black flame met with Huang Xiaolong’s dragon scales, it was scattered away. With the protection of dragon scales on his body, there was no way the Black Flame Phoenix’s black flame could hurt Huang Xiaolong.</p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong’s silhouette blurred into motion as he swung the Blades of Asura in his hands.</p>
 <p>Flower of the Other Shore materialized again, blooming midair in an eerie shimmering glow of inky purple. In the next moment, it disappeared in a ghostly manner just like the previous time.</p>
 <p>Yet the moment Flowers of Other Shore disappeared, Xie Puti let out a muffled grunt. His chest was struck again by the same attack.</p>
 <p>Xie Puti might’ve soul transformed and been protected by a layer of black phoenix flame armor, but despite that, being struck with the attack left him feeling miserable.</p>
 <p>The spot where the flowers hit caused intense pain. Not only that, Xie Puti vaguely felt as if there was an indescribable frigid qi that seemed to originate from hell slowly invading his body. He felt like he could not do anything other than try to use the black flame phoenix battle qi to suppress it.</p>
 <p>After having his first attack land, Huang Xiaolong subsequently launched another attack.</p>
 <p>The Flower of the Other Shore bloomed again and spread a radiant glow. Xie Puti was left with the inability to dodge yet again.</p>
 <p>Flower of the Other Shore was too unpredictable, and when it moved through space there was no ripple or fluctuation whatsoever. How could anyone avoid it? Unless they could be like Huang Xiaolong, having the ability to hide inside a space pocket, it was virtually impossible!</p>
 <p>Below the stage, heads shook at Xie Puti’s chances of winning.</p>
 <p>Before, Huang Xiaolong could not come closer than within ten meters of Xie Puti because of his black flame’s protection. But now, the black flame armor had lost its effect in front of Huang Xiaolong. On top of that, Xie Puti could neither predict nor dodge Huang Xiaolong’s attack. Hence, there was only an inevitable defeat remaining.</p>
 <p>Ten minutes later, Huang Xiaolong’s Wrath of the Nether King crashed straight into Xie Puti’s chest, sending him flying and falling to the edge of the battle stage area. Only then did Huang Xiaolong stop his attacks.</p>
 <p>The four corners of the square were filled with silence.</p>
 <p>Everyone watched as Xie Puti struggled to his feet, albeit in a wobbly and unstable manner.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Xie Puti let out a furious roar! A burst of battle qi exploded from his body and he attacked Huang Xiaolong.</p>
 <p>However, just as he arrived at Huang Xiaolong’s side, he was struck away with one palm, this time falling outside the battle stage area.</p>
 <p>Xie Puti—<i>defeated!</i></p>
 <p>When Xie Puti no longer got up after thirty breaths of time had passed since falling outside the battle stage, the entire Duanren Square erupted in cheers. The thunderous voices were like never ending tidal waves and it took a long time before it subsided.</p>
 <p>This final battle ended at last!</p>
 <p>The first place winner in this year’s Imperial City Battle was actually Huang Xiaolong! It never crossed anyone’s mind that it would turn out this way. Even more mind blowing was the fact that Huang Xiaolong possessed superb twin martial spirits!</p>
 <p>And his strongest Primordial Divine Blue Dragon was a martial spirit that had never appeared in Martial Spirit World before.</p>
 <p>The battle might have ended, but everyone’s emotions were still running high.</p>
 <p>The battle they witnessed today was way more thrilling that they had anticipated.</p>
 <p>This was all because of Huang Xiaolong!</p>
 <p>Even Duan Wuhen and Cheng Jian were feeling dumbstruck.</p>
 <p><i>Perhaps even Imperial Father will feel shocked when we report the results to him later!</i> Duan Wuhen thought.</p>
 <p>Moments later, Cheng Jian announced Huang Xiaolong’s win in the final battle.</p>
 <p>When Cheng Jian’s voice ended, another wave of deafening cheers and applause resounded through the crowd.</p>
 <p>Even though the competition ended, the rewards would not be given out until the next day.</p>
 <p>Huang Xiaolong stepped off the battle stage, and on the way back to his seat, he passed by Pang Yu. Pang Yu forced out an awkward smile while his feet were retreating in a flustered manner, opening up a wide path for Huang Xiaolong.</p>
 <p>It was not until Huang Xiaolong moved further away that Pang Yu dared to breathe out in relief. His back was already wet with cold sweat. He was fortunate to not have wet his pants.</p>
 <p>When Huang Xiaolong exited the battle arena, the young misses, young masters, and commoners were lauding his name loudly: <i>“Huang Xiaolong!”</i></p>
 <p><i>“Huang Xiaolong!!”</i></p>
 <p><i>“Huang Xiaolong!” </i>This three-word chant reverberated in Duanren Square for a very long time as wave after wave grew increasingly louder.</p>
 <p>At this point, Huang Xiaolong was already elevated to idol status by some budding youths of these families.</p>
 <p>Superb twin martial spirits of the same kind! Such a monstrous talent, he was the very first one in the long history of Duanren Empire’s foundation!</p>
 <p>From all directions, the crowd mobbed Huang Xiaolong.</p>
 <p>He fortunately had Zhao Shu, Yu Ming, and Fei Hou to fend them off. It would otherwise have been a strenuous task for Huang Xiaolong to leave the square with his clothes intact after being swiped at by the claws of the young misses of noble families clamoring after him.</p>
 <p>Most likely, a layer of his skin would be scraped off from all the hands rubbing his body.</p>
 <p>Only after Huang Xiaolong had left Duanren Square did it return to the usual empty calmness.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>In the second private room of Unforgettable Intoxication Restaurant, Yao Fei glowered at Yanggang and Pang Yu with a dark expression.</p>
 <p>“Garbage!” Yao Fei coldly snapped.</p>
 <p>Both Yanggang and Pang Yu quivered under the stare.</p>
 <p>“But I did not expect Huang Xiaolong to have superb twin martial spirits, causing even Xie Puti to not be his opponent!” Yao Fei’s voice was frigidly cold, red bloodlust shone in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Twin superb talent martial spirits!</p>
 <p>And there was a possibility that the Blue Dragon was grade fourteen!</p>
 <p>Grade fourteen!! This kind of legendary existence that was only recorded in ancient manuscripts actually appeared in the body of an ordinary, small family background Huang Xiaolong!</p>
 <p>If Yao Fei had such talent, and with the resources of his Yao Family, he would definitely break into the Saint realm!</p>
 <p>“Hateful!” Yao Fei suddenly shouted. A strong pressure burst out from him, instantly turning the chair beside him into powered dust.</p>
 <p>Yanggang and Pang Yu were frightened into quickly retreating, both of their faces ashen.</p>
 <p>But in the next instant, Yao Fei converged his emotions. His cold eyes swept over Yanggang and Pang Yu’s face, “It’s fine, both of you can go.”</p>
 <p>Yanggang and Pang Yu were stunned at first and then nodded their heads vigorously before fleeing as if their lives were in danger.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>At the same time, deep in the underground palace within the Duanren Imperial Palace, Duanren Emperor was listening to his son and Minister Cheng Jian report the results of the Imperial City Battle. He too was astounded.</p>
 <p>“Superb twin martial spirits... It is actually superb twin martial spirits!”</p>
 <p>Duanren Emperor mumbled softly to himself somewhat ecstatically, causing his usual dignified decorum to slip.</p>
 <p>Duan Wuhen was surprised as he watched his Imperial Father’s reaction. He had never seen his Imperial Father drop all pretense of decorum in any way. It seemed that shining between his eyes was a trace of hope and elation?</p>
 <p>Cheng Jian was also taken aback while observing Duanren Emperor’s dramatic reaction.</p>
 <p>Moments later, Duanren Emperor realized his gaffe. Recovering, he emphasized, “Tomorrow, after the prize giving ceremony is done, bring Huang Xiaolong to see me.”</p>
 <p>“Imperial Father wants to meet Huang Xiaolong?” Duan Wuhen was baffled and surprised at the request. It had been many years since Duanren Emperor wanted to meet with the geniuses from any Imperial City Battle, even first place winners of previous years did not have this privilege.</p>
 <p>“Correct.” Duanren Emperor affirmed.</p>
 <p>“Yes Imperial Father!” Duan Wuhen answered respectfully, not daring to inquire too much.</p>
 <p>“Alright, you can leave now.”</p>
 <p>Duan Wuhen and Cheng Jian saluted and retreated from the room quietly.</p>
