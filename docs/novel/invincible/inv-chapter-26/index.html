 <p><b>Chapter 26: Fear?</b></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Huang Wei looked over and his gaze met Huang Xiaolong’s. The corner of Huang Wei’s mouth stretched into a disdainful&nbsp;sneer, and his eyes were brimming with hatred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since they came back from the&nbsp;Li Residence, Huang Wei’s hatred towards Huang Xiaolong increased every day. Every time he recalled the scene of Li Lu holding Huang Xiaolong’s hands right in front of him, asking Huang Xiaolong not to leave, he wished he could gnaw on Huang Xiaolong’s flesh and drink his blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their gazes collided and shifted away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong, his father and mother sat across Huang Ming, father and son.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A short while later, Grandfather Huang Qide arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing his Grandfather appear again at this year’s Clan Assembly, Huang Xiaolong already knew&nbsp;why. In spite of the fact that&nbsp;he trained Huang Wei wholeheartedly, at last year’s Clan Assembly,&nbsp;Huang Xiaolong beat up Huang Wei ruthlessly, and&nbsp;it more or less blemished his reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, most likely, he wanted to see Huang Wei return the favor, so that his reputation would&nbsp;remain untarnished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone stood up to salute as Huang Qide walked towards the main podium.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“En, everyone sit down.” Huang Qide’s face was full of smiles as he waved his hand to indicate everyone to sit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And everyone sat down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Same as last year, Chief Housekeeper Chen Ying stood up to oversee the event. After he had received Huang Qide’s nod of approval, he declared loudly. “The Annual Assembly begins!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Annual Clan Assembly begins!</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a moment, the Main Foyer was&nbsp;silent. Then, one by one, the disciples who had awakened their martial spirits this year went up the stage to spar with each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And those who had awakened their martial spirits last year were to wait for the new disciples to finish before they could go up the martial stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one was really paying attention to the spar between this year’s disciples who just awakened their martial spirits not too long ago; it was clear they were looking forward to the fight between Huang Wei and Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Last year, Huang Wei, as Huang Clan Manor’s most talented person, the person that the Old Manor Lord trained with dedication, was severely walloped by Huang Xiaolong, what would happen this year?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Qide too was filled with expectation as he sat upon the main podium.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the crowd’s expectation, the first batch of disciples finished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once again, the Main Foyer were strangely quiet for a moment. Almost at the same time, all looked towards&nbsp;Huang Wei and Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What differed from last year was, this time, Huang Xiaolong stood up first, and slowly walked up to the martial stage at the center.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing it was Huang Xiaolong who first went to the stage, the crowd felt a little strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Standing tall on the martial stage, Huang Xiaolong looked at Huang Wei, in a cold voice said, “What? Afraid to come up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Wei jumped up in anger, with a sarcastic ‘haha’ laugh, he leaped onto the martial stage. As he stood across Huang Xiaolong, he said “Me, afraid to come up? That’s the funniest joke under the heavens! Last time you ambushed me, and were lucky enough to win by half a move, do you think you will be fortunate again this year?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire hall was silent as his words rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weird expressions swept through the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ambush? Lucky enough to win by half a move?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong didn’t expect this Huang Wei’s skin is thick to this extent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Wei ignored the weird stares thrown at him, turned his head towards Huang Qide and said, “Grandfather, according to Assembly’s rules during the sparring event no one is allowed to interfere, correct?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked at Huang Peng when he finished saying this; his meaning was written all over his face– he was afraid Huang Peng couldn’t control himself and interfere if&nbsp;Huang Xiaolong was&nbsp;beaten half to&nbsp;death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, no matter who it is, no one is allowed to interfere!” Huang Qide nodded as he said with a decisive tone, not to be doubted. When all who were&nbsp;present heard this, they realized this is the&nbsp;Old Manor Lord’s&nbsp;warning to&nbsp;Huang Peng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could Huang Peng and Su Yan not realize what Huang Qide’s words meant? Even though they were angered, they were mostly&nbsp;worried about their son.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Wei calmed down after he got Grandfather’s assurance. A blood-thirsty light flashed across his eyes as turned around to look at Huang Xiaolong. The anger and hatred that he had been suppressing for the past year broke out completely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huang Xiaolong, today I will show you the difference between grade ten martial spirits and grade seven martial spirits! I will let you see how far my terrifying strength has reached!” Huang Wei said in a low voice as his battle qi broke out like flash flood, exhibiting his strength before all those&nbsp;present&nbsp;and&nbsp;at the same time, his martial spirit, the&nbsp;Three-Eyed Black Tiger appeared behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to last year, it had grown two-thirds bigger, black rays glimmered on its body, and it&nbsp;emanated the coercion of a Xiantian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Such a strong battle qi! This is Third Order, no, peak mid-Third Order! God, it’s actually the peak of the&nbsp;mid-Third Order!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Lord Huang Wei’s talent defying the heavens. Within a year, he advanced from Second Order to peak mid-Third Order!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every elder and housekeeper inside the Main Foyer was shocked with their mouths agape– some even jumped up from their seats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the main podium, when Huang Qide saw the elders’, and housekeepers’ shocked faces when Huang Wei revealed his strength, his face was full of smiles, which turned into laughter for he couldn’t resist laughing out loud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Below the stage, Huang Ming’s face had already blossomed into a big smile early on, and he&nbsp;nodded his head in satisfaction as he looked at his son.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Having revealed his strength, Huang Wei looked at Huang Xiaolong with a smirk and said in a cold tone. “Huang Xiaolong, now that you’ve seen the extent of my strength do you feel extreme fear?! Don’t worry, fear is normal, and no one here will laugh at you! Finally, you understand the gap between our talents? The difference between us is not something your dog shit luck of three Yang fruits can make-up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fear?” Huang Xiaolong looked at Huang Wei who was feeling full of himself, shook&nbsp;his head and&nbsp;said icily, “Is this all the strength you have? Make your move, this time not only do I want to beat you until your Dad can’t recognize you, but I will hit till even Grandfather can’t recognize you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group of elders and housekeepers heard this and&nbsp;each shook their heads. Not one person believed Young Lord Huang Xiaolong would emerge victorious against a peak mid-Third Order Young Master Huang Wei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And anger was apparent on Huang Qide’s face, as he sat on the podium. &nbsp;This grandson, Huang Xiaolong, was too presumptuous!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” Huang Wei laughed. A hint of viciousness flitted across his eyes and his silhouette flashed and in the blink of an eye, he appeared before Huang Xiaolong. His fists punched out with all his might.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaolong!” Seeing Huang Wei’s fist was about to hit Huang Xiaolong, Huang Peng, and Su Yan’s faces were filled with worry as they stood up from their seats. At this time, Huang Qide who was angered by Huang Xiaolong’s presumptuous sentence released his aura, locking onto&nbsp;his son, Huang Peng, his eyes icy as he shouted, “Whoever dares to interfere will be dealt with according to the clan rules!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at this time, Huang Qide suddenly noticed that the Main Foyer had fallen into a strange silence, every elder, housekeeper and disciple were stunned with their mouths’ wide open looking at the martial stage. Feeling doubt, Huang Qide turned towards the stage just like everyone. On the stage, nobody knew when&nbsp;Huang Wei’s fists that were about to hit Huang Xiaolong was locked and stopped midair!</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Huang Qide and everyone else watching with rapt attention, Huang Xiaolong looked coldly at Huang Wei and said, “I too shall let you see part of my strength!”</span></p>
