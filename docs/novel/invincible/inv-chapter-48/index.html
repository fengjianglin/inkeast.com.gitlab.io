 <p><b>Chapter 48: Revoked Qualification</b></p>
 <p><span style>Li Lu embraced Huang Xiaolong, causing people nearby to look at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although in appearance both of them were nine-year-old kids, but with so many people paying attention to them, he still felt a bit shy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uncle.” Huang Xiaolong greeted Li Cheng who was coming behind Li Lu, while trying to separate himself and create some distance from Li Lu: this girl seemed to be addicted to embracing him as every time she saw him, it seemed necessary to hug him at least once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The most baffling to Huang Xiaolong was Li Cheng’s attitude– as a father, why doesn’t he curtail his daughter?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Cheng smiled and nodded right at Huang Xiaolong before turning towards Fei Hou, respectfully greeting him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had already met the day before; therefore, after the brief greetings, they walked together into the Cosmic Star Academy’s gates until they got to a huge square paved with a rarely seen stone, Starlight Stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Starlight Stones contained a trace of spiritual energy and standing close to it energized a person. Every piece of Starlight Stone was worth a thousand gold– in such a huge square, how many Starlight Stones were there? This Cosmic Star Academy was really wealthy and influential.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were already many people already gathered in the huge square, a few hundred in number: and they all came for the Academy registration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong and the others looked around, then headed to the registration spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arriving at the registration spot, they saw that the person in charge of reception was a twenty-something year old woman with arched brows and phoenix eyes. So fair was her skin that it seemed transparent to the bone; she was stunning! With a cold temperament.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello Teacher, we came to register!” Li Lu walked up to her and said, her cute dimples showed as she smiled cutely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiong Meiqi looked up, seeing Li Lu’s adorable dimples, her cold face loosened a little. With a faint smile she nodded and asked: “Name, age.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Lu answered all in a proper manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After recording everything down, Xiong Meiqi gave Li Lu a wooden token then told Li Lu to go into the inner hall to test her martial spirit and other procedures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite stating the requirements of a grade nine and above martial spirit and being under the age of twelve, there were still additional assessments to be taken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Receiving the wooden token, Li Lu stood one side to wait for Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this point, Huang Xiaolong walked up and withdrew a recommendation letter and hand it over to Xiong Meiqi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Huang Xiaolong took out a recommendation letter, the amiable attitude she displayed with Li Lu vanished into thin air and was replaced with a frosty expression. Dislike and contempt shone from her eyes; she hated these types of students that did not possess grade nine martial spirit talents yet, insisted to enroll into the Cosmic Star Academy, relying on their family’s connection to get a recommendation for privileged enrollment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Name, age!” Xiong Meiqi snapped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huang Xiaolong, nine and a half years old.” Huang Xiaolong answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiong Mei roughly recorded the information, and took out a plate about two thumbs size, with starlight twinkling and flung it to the floor, saying “This is your student token.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The twinkling student plate fell right beside Huang Xiaolong’s feet, it was extremely obvious that the token did not fall by accident.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, Fei Hou and the two guards became angry, but just as they were about to step forward, Huang Xiaolong stopped them and shook his head. Only then did the three endure and restrain themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Hou picked up the student token.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Xiong Meiqi threw his student token on the floor, Huang Xiaolong was no longer inclined in being polite with such a person, his voice sounded cold as he asked “Where do I pay the fees?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiong Meiqi retorted icily, “Are you dumb?! Can’t you find someone else to ask?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Insolent!” When Fei Hou heard Xiong Meiqi actually dare to insult his Sovereign as a dumb, his Tenth Order oppressive atmosphere was instantly released.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiong Meiqi blanked for a moment realizing Fei Hou was a peak late-Tenth Order warrior, but instead of fear, she laughed coldly, “Want to make trouble here?” Saying that, Xiong Meiqi went all out, and her martial spirit appeared in the air behind her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiong Meiqi’s martial spirit was actually a butterfly!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, her butterfly wasn’t the common type; hers had eight wings colored golden-silver and a halo of colors surrounded its entire body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seven-Colored Butterfly!” This was beyond Huang Xiaolong’s expectation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Rainbow Butterfly was a rare kind of martial spirit; although it was a grade nine martial spirit, it was considered average.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Martial spirits of the same grade were further classified into: average, top, and apex classifications.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, from different directions of the square, three silhouettes flew over to Huang Xiaolong’s location at high speed and soon, the three figures appeared before them. All three people wore similar clothing to Xiong Meiqi, the Cosmic Star Academy’s teacher uniform. Apparently the newly arrived people were also academy teachers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the three had a vertical slit on his forehead akin to having a third eye, adding a devilish charm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arriving at the location, the slit on his forehead moved as he turned to Xiong Meiqi, asking, “Meiqi, what happened?” as his question ended; his gaze fell on Fei Hou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiong Meiqi burned with indignation glaring at Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou: “Just a trash of a student with a recommendation letter who is relying on a family’s background to cause trouble!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A trash with a recommendation letter!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Relying on family’s influence!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Causing trouble!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong’s face instantly turned cold. Initially, he found this woman unpleasant, but now it shot up to total dislike; even if Huang Xiaolong was registering into the academy with a recommendation letter and not through assessments, this was the Academy’s issue, this ugly woman had no authority to interfere, she was only a teacher. By trying to vent her dissatisfaction on him, this woman chose the wrong prey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, so it is a waste student bringing a recommendation letter; kid, if you’re trying to make trouble you found the wrong place! Why don’t you look around and realized where you are standing!” The man, Zhong Yuan barked at Huang Xiaolong, and continued in a cold tone, “Now, kneel down and apologize to Teacher Xiong, and we will forgive this matter, otherwise…!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those coming to register with recommendations usually had strong backgrounds, therefor in Zhong Yuan’s opinion just punishing him by asking him to kneel down and apologize for his actions was already very tolerant and magnanimous!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Otherwise, he would have revoked this kid’s qualification and told them to scram!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kneel down and apologize?</span></i><span style> When Fei Hou and the two guards heard that the man wanted Huang Xiaolong to kneel down and apologize, their anger soared, and at this point, Huang Xiaolong shifted his attention to Zhong Yuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pointing at Xiong Meiqi, he sneered sarcastically, “I also give you and this female bear a choice, kneel down and apologize to me, or else…!” A cold, sharp light glinted in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since these two people him and were giving him trouble, he would grant them their wishes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just because no one dared to do so in the past didn’t mean no one would dare to in the future!</span></p>
 <p><span style>By this time, those who came to register with their family had crowded around them; hearing Huang Xiaolong wanted two teachers to kneel down and apologize, shocked gasps echoed within the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This brother is too f**king awesome!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xiong Meiqi and Zhong Yuan were shocked senseless; their faces turned red and deepened to purple in a fury; a waste relying on a recommendation letter to enroll was so brazen, and dared to tell them to kneel down and apologize to him instead!</span></p>
 <p><span style>That Xiong Meiqi pointed at Huang Xiaolong, her voluptuous bosom rose and fell as she hollered: “I’m revoking your qualification this instant, get out of here with your three slaves!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong jeered, “You want to revoke my qualifications? A mere teacher like you doesn’t have the right to do so!” What Huang Xiaolong said was a fact, only the Principal had the right to revoke the registration of students who registered through a recommendation letter.</span></p>
