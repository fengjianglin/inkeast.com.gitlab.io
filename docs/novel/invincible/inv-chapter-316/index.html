 <p><b>Chapter 316: White Phoenix</b></p>
 <p><span style>Watching the countless halberd shadows raining down like meteors, fear suffused Li Li’s eyes. Both of her hands struck out the Dragon Breaking Hand one after another endlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Breaking Hand could terminate any attack midway and it was the skill that Snow Dragon City’s Castellan, Ao Gu, was most proud of. Every time Li Li used it against her opponents, it worked ten times out of ten, but this time, the skill seemed to have lost its prowess. She watched, eyes wide with apprehension and shock, as the halberd shadows pierced through the wall barrier of Dragon Breaking Hands like meteors over the sky, growing bigger in front of her eyes in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Halberd shadows fell on her body like a torrential rain.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puff~~!</span></i><span style> Her body was thrown back after being hit by the great waves, crashing heavily to the floor with a boom. All surrounding noise and sound died with the crash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peng Feng and Du Huagang looked dazedly at the spot Li Li crashed into. The dust settled, revealing her tragic appearance, her body was filled with deep wounds, with blood flowing out constantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only after some time did Du Huagang react.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fifth Senior Sister!” Crying out, he arrived beside Li Li in the blink of an eye. Only then were the two middle-aged men jolted back to their senses and hurried to Li Li’s side with an apprehensive expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Silver Dragon Ao Gu had more than a dozen disciples, Li Li was, without a doubt, his most favored disciple by far. If anything happened to Li Li, then…! Imagining the horrifying scene when their master Silver Dragon Ao Gu found out about what happened here, the two blue-robed middle-aged men shivered involuntarily as a chill spread over their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Li groaned from pain, wobbling unsteadily as she tried to get up from the floor, pushing away the three people surrounding her. Looking at Huang Xiaolong, the dread in her heart showed in her eyes, but even more was anger, indignity, embarrassment, and plain fury!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was a half-Saint warrior, her Master was </span><i><span style>the </span></i><span style>Silver Dragon Ao Gu. At her level cultivation level, beneath Saint realm, the number of half-Saint realm warriors that could defeat her did not exceed ten, but despite that, a mere peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order insect managed to gravely injure her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Li’s eyes were spitting fire, her venomous eyes fixed on Huang Xiaolong were filled with hatred, “From childhood till now, no one dared to hurt me! No one!! I want to kill you! I’m going to kill you!!!” Scorching white flames flowed from her body, burning wildly, and a large phoenix emerged behind her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Top grade twelve martial spirit! White Phoenix!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was Li Li’s martial spirit, and because of her martial spirit and talent, she was Silver Dragon Ao Gu’s most favored disciple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The White Phoenix hovered above Li Li’s head, letting out a ringing cry that sounded from the ancient era, shaking heaven and earth and traveling more than a dozen miles. White flames surged around Li Li, emanating a powerful atmosphere and coercive pressure with her as the center, spreading in four directions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peng Feng and the rest were astonished as they watched speechlessly, the many wounds caused by the Eminent Holiness Halberd piercing into her flesh closed up at a speed visible to the naked eye, finally leaving no scar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Li floated up in midair, her cold and imposing eyes staring at Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, you're very surprised that I have the top grade twelve martial spirit White Phoenix, aren’t you?! Let me tell you, the White Phoenix has the sacred white flame, no matter how serious my injuries are, I won’t die. I’m going to let you know how foolish your actions of injuring me were. I will make you regret, make you kneel down before, me begging for mercy!!” The more Li Li spoke, the more turbulent her emotions became, intense hatred ravaged her sanity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to Peng Feng and Sun Haoran’s shock after seeing Li Li’s White Phoenix martial spirit, Huang Xiaolong was more composed. Not to mention a top grade twelve martial spirit, even if a top grade thirteen martial spirit materialized in front of him, he wouldn’t blink an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That year, during the Duanren Imperial City Battle, he battled Xie Puti, who possessed a first-rank grade thirteen martial spirit, Black Flame Phoenix, but in the end, didn’t he come out the winner? The Black Flame Phoenix was two grades higher than this White Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The anger in Li Li’s heart escalated after seeing Huang Xiaolong’s nonchalant attitude after she called out her White Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Godly White Phoenix Claw!” Li Li bellowed, her body thrust forward in Huang Xiaolong’s direction. The shadow of a large white claw imprint fell on Huang Xiaolong from above. Before the claw arrived, the dense slaughter aura gathered around Huang Xiaolong exploded in a salvo, thinning his imposing momentum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when Li Li’s claw was about to tear Huang Xiaolong apart, Huang Xiaolong hollered under his breath. Before the astonished eyes of Peng Feng, Sun Haoran, Du Huagang, and the two blue-robed middle-aged men, a resounding dragon roar reverberated in the sky with the emergence of a giant black dragon above Huang Xiaolong’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Primordial… Divine Black Dragon!” Peng Feng and Sun Haoran exclaimed out loud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It never crossed anyone’s mind that Huang Xiaolong’s martial spirit would be a Primordial Divine Dragon, a top grade twelve Black Dragon! Although they were both considered top grade twelve martial spirits, dragons were deemed slightly stronger than phoenixes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Li stared blankly at the black dragon hovering above Huang Xiaolong, dumbfounded. In the next moment, she watched Huang Xiaolong leap up, his fist punching out at her White Phoenix’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fist imprint looked surreal, profound and mysterious, it was the Great Void Divine Fist!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom! A thunderous blast echoed miles away. A streak of white flame was seen flying back, the white claw imprint shattered into smithereens. Failing to withstand the powerful shockwave, Li Li staggered back until her feet touched the ground. Even so, it was a dozen steps later that she managed to steady herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You!” She could no longer conceal the overwhelming shock she was feeling as she looked at Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong stopped attacking and his feet landed back on the ground. His icy gaze fell on her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peng Feng, Sun Haoran, and the others forgot to breathe watching the two people going against each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fourth Junior Brother, he is?” At this point, Peng Feng asked dazedly. The shock Huang Xiaolong gave him was ineffable. Since when did such a character appear in the Bedlam Lands?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Haoran shook his head, “I am also not sure of his identity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You also don’t know?” Peng Feng choked slightly at Sun Haoran’s answer. He assumed that his Fourth Junior Brother knew who Huang Xiaolong was, seeing that they arrived together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Haoran nodded, “Before coming here, I ran into Wu Zhang, and nearly died in his hands. He was the one who killed Wu Zhang and saved me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wu Zhang… he’s dead?” Peng Feng’s eyes protruded in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Haoran nodded again, emphasizing, “He died... In three moves!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Three moves!</span></i><span style> Peng Feng stood in stupefied stillness on the spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, they heard a holler from the other side, the white flames shrouding Li Li soared to the sky in a spiral, at the same time, a glittering white armor covered her body, where a life-like totem of a white phoenix appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong forced her to the point of having to soul transform. When Li Li soul transformed, Huang Xiaolong did the same, black scales emerged on the surface of his skin, covering him like a full-bodied armor. Pointed sharp spikes lined the length of his arms, reddish black energy shrouded him, akin to a true blood primordial divine dragon, a demon overlord.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two powerful momenta clashing brought Peng Feng back to reality. Turning to look, he saw a soul transformed Li Li whistled through the wind like a mythical phoenix soaring through the Nine Heavens, a phoenix cry echoed in the sky, white Phoenix flames overshadowed the earth, and it dived down on its prey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sundering Phoenix!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A giant white blade transformed from the white phoenix appeared above Huang Xiaolong’s head, cutting down. As the white blade came closer and closer, Huang Xiaolong raised the Eminent Holiness Halberd in his hands, and with a flick of his wrist, a windstorm of halberd shadows tunneled upward, like a whirlpool in the deep sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tossing Heaven, Moving Earth!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white phoenix blade was right in the path of the abyssal whirlpool of halberd storm, metallic sounds of clashes rang endlessly and pieces of blades and halberds dissipated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the center of the storm, a brilliant pillar of light erupted, soaring high up. The Eminent Holiness Halberd was akin to a divine dragon bursting out from the deep sea, penetrating straight into Li Li’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An anguished scream split the air, accompanied by pearls of red blood, splattering over Peng Feng and the others’ bodies. &nbsp;Li Li was thrown far away in the distance, slamming into a stone pillar.</span></p>
