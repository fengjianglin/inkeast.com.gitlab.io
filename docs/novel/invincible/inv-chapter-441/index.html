 <p><b>Chapter 441: Look at the Stars</b></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong, Shi Xiaofei, and her two maids made their way back to Asura’s Gate headquarters, traveling during the day, resting and cultivating at night. Inevitably, Huang Xiaolong exposed his excellent meat roasting skills before the three women, and without exception, all three were hooked.</span></p>
 <p><span>Even Shi Xiaofei had her noble lady demeanor swept aside, picking up roast meat with her bare hands and tearing meat off straight from the bone with oil glistening on her lips. Despite that, her actions did nothing to lessen her beauty, in fact, at the end of each meal, the way she sucked on her fingers would conjure some ambiguous fantasies in others.</span></p>
 <p><span>Ever since the first night she tasted Huang Xiaolong’s roast meat, every evening when they stopped to rest for the night, Shi Xiaofei would swing Huang Xiaolong’s arms, acting spoiled for roast meat.</span></p>
 <p><span>Her actions were almost a copy of Lil’ Tian in the early days. The lovely, cute, and untainted expressions on her face held a charm that was hard to say no to.</span></p>
 <p><span>It took Huang Xiaolong’s group a little more than one month to arrive at the Asura’s Gate headquarters. When they walked through the gates, Huang Xiaolong let out an obvious breath of relief. The daily responsibility of a cook was no easy life, ah… especially playing cook for Snow Wind Continent’s number one beauty.</span></p>
 <p><span>Just as Huang Xiaolong returned to the Asura’s Gate headquarters, Lil’ Tian came looking for him in his courtyard with tears streaming down his little face, clamoring why it took Huang Xiaolong so long to come back, was he planning to throw Lil’ Tian away?!</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong nearly sweated bullets.</span></p>
 <p><span>Lil’ Tian didn’t know when Huang Xiaolong left the Asura’s Gate headquarters, thus he was left there. If Lil’ Tian knew that Huang Xiaolong was going to Treasure City, he’d have insisted on tagging along.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Big brother, tonight you roast some meat for me, alright?” Lil’ Tian was pulling Huang Xiaolong’s arm and used his pair of innocent obsidian black eyes to look at Huang Xiaolong with a hint of pleading.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feeling a headache, Huang Xiaolong reluctantly nodded in agreement. </span></p>
 <p><span>On the same night Huang Xiaolong returned to the Asura’s Gate, his cook responsibility continued.</span></p>
 <p><span>Around the campfire in the Asura Square, seven people gathered—Huang Xiaolong, Shi Xiaofei’s group of three, Lil’ Tian, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu. The aromatic scent of roast meat tickled their nostrils.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Sovereign, after you rescued Miss Shi, that Xie Hui reacted like a rabid dog and issued a top-down order: all Asura’s Gate disciples, families, and forces that submitted to Asura’s Gate within the Cosmos God Cult’s territories were slaughtered clean!” Zhao Shu informed Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong nodded. He already heard about this matter.</span></p>
 <p><span>The upside of this was the fact that the Asura’s Gate didn’t have many disciples within the Cosmos God Cult territories. This was something that Huang Xiaolong couldn’t stop even if he wanted to. </span></p>
 <p><span>“After Sovereign beheaded Enigma City’s Qi Family Patriarch, among the fourteen families, ten of them had sworn allegiance to our Asura’s Gate.” Zhang Fu added and named the four remaining families that remained on the fence.</span></p>
 <p><span>Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong asked Zhao Shu and Zhang Shu about the Asura’s Gate current situation and the latest happenings in the Martial Spirit World.</span></p>
 <p><span>Both Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu reported what they knew.</span></p>
 <p><span>Ever since the Asura Square battle, Deities Templar had been keeping a low profile, nothing out of ordinary was seen from their side. On the surface, they seemed to be behaving.</span></p>
 <p><span>While the three of them were discussing these matters, Lil’ Tian was happily gnawing on a roast Tyrant Boar leg while smacking his lips. These days, during Huang Xiaolong’s absence, the little guy had ‘suffered’ greatly. </span></p>
 <p><span>Tonight, he must eat his fill, to compensate the recent days’ suffering.</span></p>
 <p><span>Compared to Lil’ Tian, Shi Xiaofei and her two maids’ eating mannerisms were more civilized and easy on the eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>Though occupied with the Tyrant Boar meat in her hands, Shi Xiaofei’s eyes weren’t idle, from time to time she would sneak a furtive glances at Huang Xiaolong. Under the campfire glow, Huang Xiaolong’s good looks seemed to exude a certain inexplicable charm.</span></p>
 <p><span>The little party ended several hours later and everyone dispersed for the night.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, when Huang Xiaolong barely stepped into his courtyard, Shi Xiaofei paid him a visit.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Big brother Huang, can you accompany me to look at the stars?” Shi Xiaofei came over with a request.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Look at stars?” Huang Xiaolong looked at Shi Xiaofei with a dumb expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span>Shi Xiaofei grew shy under Huang Xiaolong’s stare, a faint blush colored her cheeks. Fortunately, it was dark and wasn’t noticeable despite the moonlight. She nodded at Huang Xiaolong, “When I was young, Mother used to accompany me to look at stars a lot, tonight I suddenly feel like looking at the stars… Big brother Huang, can you accompany me?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Looking at that face full of anticipation, in the end, Huang Xiaolong nodded. He was already back at the Asura’s Gate headquarters, practice could wait one night.</span></p>
 <p><span>He reached out and held Shi Xiaofei’s small hand, leaped up to the roof of his courtyard and sat down.</span></p>
 <p><span>Shi Xiaofei’s heartbeat accelerated, sounding like war drums in her ears when Huang Xiaolong held her hand.</span></p>
 <p><span>Sitting down on the roof, Huang Xiaolong looked up at the vast night sky and saw that it was littered with stars. Glittering brightly in the dark, they seemed to relax the heart and mind.</span></p>
 <p><span>He remembered that in his past life on Earth, when he was little, he often looked at the stars just like this.</span></p>
 <p><span>This Martial Spirit World’s sky was just as relaxing as the one on Earth.</span></p>
 <p><span>Shi Xiaofei sat down beside Huang Xiaolong, her heartbeat gradually calmed down as she watched Huang Xiaolong quietly looking at the stars. Following Huang Xiaolong’s gaze, she looked at the night sky, muttering to herself: “So beautiful.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong was pulled out of his reverie by her voice. From the side, Shi Xiaofei’s enraptured expression as she stared at the night sky was truly alluring; small bulbous nose and dainty mouth, her fragrant body scent teased Huang Xiaolong’s nose.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Your Mother must love you a lot.” Huang Xiaolong focused his attention as he said.</span></p>
 <p><span>Shi Xiaofei looked over at Huang Xiaolong, flashing him a brilliant smile that struck him at the core, “True, my Mother loves me very much, but my Father is so hateful, always forcing me to practice since I was little!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong chuckled softly hearing her words, “That’s because your Father loves you too.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Martial Spirit World was a place where the strong preyed upon the weak, Shi Fantian forced his daughter to cultivate so she could have the capability to protect herself.</span></p>
 <p><span>Shi Xiaofei nodded: “I know.” But her small face looked crestfallen, “Big brother Huang, am I useless?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong was taken aback by the question, but quickly understood that she was referring to herself being captured by Xie Hui.</span></p>
 <p><span>“No.” Huang Xiaolong replied, “Your talent is good. With your aptitude, there’s only a handful of people considered more talented than you. You haven’t cultivated for long, but already broke through to Saint realm, it’s an amazing achievement.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong wasn’t uttering sweet words, in the whole Martial Spirit World, there was an uncountable number of big sects and super families genius disciples that failed to advance into Saint realm despite cultivating for over a thousand year.</span></p>
 <p><span>Shi Xiaofei looked straight at Huang Xiaolong, her beautiful eyes misty, as her voice sounded soft, “Thank you, Big brother Huang. I… can I lean on you for a while… ?”</span></p>
 <p><span>The look in Shi Xiaofei’s eyes was similar to how Li Lu looked at Huang Xiaolong the year she left, too similar.</span></p>
 <p><span>“En.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span>Getting Huang Xiaolong’s permission, Shi Xiaofei slowly leaned closer, putting her head on Huang Xiaolong’s shoulder, taking in the masculine scent coming from Huang Xiaolong’s body. Her breathing quickened, blushing quietly in the dark.</span></p>
 <p><span>Both sat in silence like this, staring at the velvet night sky.</span></p>
 <p><span>Some time later, Huang Xiaolong turned over to look at Shi Xiaofei, only to find the girl had fallen asleep leaning on his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span>The sleeping beauty’s eyelashes fluttered like dancing butterflies, her skin smooth and flawless, akin to a painting.</span></p>
 <p><span>Reluctant to wake her, he let her sleep, leaning on him.</span></p>
 <p><span>The night gradually faded.</span></p>
 <p><span>Shi Xiaofei woke up when the morning sunlight fell on her face. When she came to her senses, a small scream escaped her mouth, as if she couldn’t believe that she actually fell asleep leaning on Huang Xiaolong’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Big brother Huang, I…” Shi Xiaofei blushed with embarrassment, feeling awkward.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It’s fine.” Huang Xiaolong teased, “Being able to become a pillow for a beauty like you is many men’s lifelong fantasy.”</span></p>
 <p><span>This only made Shi Xiaofei’s little face turn redder.</span></p>
