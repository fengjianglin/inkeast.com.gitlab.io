 <p><b>Chapter 341: Teach Them How To Behave?</b></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help smiling a little hearing the discussion on the next table and didn’t mind it in the least.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huo Ping? Top grade thirteen martial spirit, White Bear, twenty two years old, late-Xiantian Second Order strength… </span><i><span style>‘Indeed, his talent can be considered not bad.’</span></i><span style> Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong didn’t mind the discussion on the next table, but hearing someone put a new guy, Huo Ping, on the same status as his Big brother, even saying that the kid’s talent was much better compared to his Big brother, Huang Xiaohai was very much disgruntled in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fire exploded in Huang Xiaohai’s eyes, but just as he was about to stand up, Huang Xiaolong pressed a hand on his younger brother’s arm, shaking his head,”Just a small thing, leave it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big brother!” Huang Xiaohai was stunned, but the look from Huang Xiaolong’s eyes made him return to his seat down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong opened one of the wine jugs, pouring out two bowls for them, “Come.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The brothers clinked their wine bowls and took a big mouthful, filling the mouth with the fragrance of wine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong nodded: “Not bad.” This Hometown Wine, although not as good as the Sapidity Wine, it did not lose out to the Snow Moon Wine he had with Lu Kai in the Luo Tong Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, the voices from the next table sounded again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say, what do you think Young Noble Divine Dragon’s strength is now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Several years ago, when he participated in the Imperial City Battle, he had just broken through the Xiantian realm, in my opinion, he is at most a Xiantian Fourth Order.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiantian Fourth Order? I think that’s not possible. Talented as he might be, it’s impossible to advance one order every year, my guess is that he is a Xiantian Third Order. Who knows, maybe he hasn’t even reached late-Xiantian Third Order.” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Xiantian Third Order?</span></i><span style> Huang Xiaolong nearly choked listening to these people’s estimations, smiling helplessly. Whereas Huang Xiaohai’s brows furrowed deeper, these people’s words grew more outrageous the more they talked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>That year, Huang Xiaolong revealed his strength once, but the Huang Family and Emperor Duanren had the news blocked, thus common people, in general, had no idea of Huang Xiaolong’s strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another wave of words floated over to their table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard that Huo Ping made a declaration yesterday, saying that he wants to pay a visit to the Southern Hill Estate to ask Young Noble Divine Dragon for ‘guidance.’”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guidance… meant asking for a battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If that is true, I wonder who would come out on top.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaohai couldn’t hold his temper in anymore, hearing that Huo Ping guy actually planned to go to that Southern Hill Estate to look for his Big brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A bunch of idiots!” He scolded. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The customers at that table looked over, hearing Huang Xiaohai’s voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, what did you say just now?!” A shaggy beard middle-aged man stood up from his seat and snapped at Huang Xiaohai. That expression was exactly one of an evil and vicious character.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said, all of you are a bunch of idiots, didn’t you hear?” Huang Xiaohai repeated coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That shaggy beard middle-aged man erupted in rage, one hand unsheathed the big knife in his hand, barking: “Kid, you’re courting death!” and wanted to attack Huang Xiaohai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But at this time, at sudden ruckus swept across the restaurant first floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s Huo Ping!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This year’s Imperial City Battle first place winner, Huo Ping!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That shaggy beard man was surprised, he stopped and turned over to look, like everyone else. Not far from the main streets below, there was a young man wearing a short-sleeved blue robe with an accompanying treasure sword hanging from his waist. Handsome features, in his early twenties, and he was crossing the crowd below, walking toward the Happy Monarch House with a group of bodyguards tagging behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the beginning, this young man wore a proud, lofty expression on his face. Well, it was inevitable for any young man to look a little proud after winning the Imperial City Battle, at the same time possessing an amazing talent, top grade thirteen superb talent martial spirit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everywhere Huo Ping walked past, the street was packed with disciples from big families, young men and women, cheering at Huo Ping.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By this time, Huo Ping reached the restaurant’s entrance, being welcomed personally by the restaurant owner with utmost respect before entering the premise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong retrieved his gaze from the window, shaking his head. Merely from the short observation just now, Huo Ping gave him a bad impression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seconds passed and Huo Ping and his group of bodyguards came up to the first floor. The present guests all stood up, smiling in a complaisant manner and smartly moved to the sides.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Watching the respectful demeanor around him, Huo Ping nodded with satisfaction, but when his sight fell on Huang Xiaolong and Huang Xiaohai, who remained sitting by the window, he frowned slightly. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He turned toward the restaurant owner saying, “Boss, I want to reserve the entire first floor to celebrate with my subordinates here.” Done saying that, he threw a bag of gold coins into the restaurant owner’s hand, “Those who have already ordered, take it as my treat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Receiving the bag, the restaurant owner weighed it roughly in his palm, estimating about five to six hundred gold coins inside, his face immediately bloomed, “Young Noble Huo Ping, holding the celebration banquet in our Happy Monarch House is our honor, it’s just that…” His face looked a little ugly, as the proprietor, it wasn’t proper for him to chase his customers away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, Huo Ping looked around the first floor, “You have no objections, right?” Nearly all the first-floor customers smile amiably, nodding there were no objections. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The restaurant owner secretly breathed in relief, however, noticing that two people were still sitting by the window table, he hesitated for a moment before approaching Huang Xiaolong and Huang Xiaohai with a smile he deemed friendly, “These two brothers, Young Noble Huo Ping wants to reserve the entire first floor, how about I arrange another table for the two guests on the ground floor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The restaurant owner’s demeanor was considered polite.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this point, Huang Xiaohai took out a bag of gold coins, pouring out everything inside, it probably contained one to two thousand gold coins, then said, “Since it’s like this, then us brothers are reserving the whole first floor. Those who have already ordered, consider it as our treat...” pausing here, Huang Xiaohai looked at Huo Ping and sneered, “As for those that haven't ordered, forgive me, tell them to scram!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Scram!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was aware who those words were intended for, because only Huo Ping’s group just came up and haven’t made an order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The restaurant owner blanked staring at the gold coins littered on the floor, and the customers that prepared to leave halted their steps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This kid dared to challenge Young Noble Huo Ping?! What’s his background?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What background? I say, they don’t even know how miserably they will die in a moment!” The shaggy beard man who was discussing Huang Xiaolong and Huo Ping loudly earlier scoffed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd was stirred, but the expression on Huo Ping’s face was extremely ugly. He didn’t expect that he would encounter such a thing after coming here to celebrate with his subordinates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Lord, these two brats are so lacking in tact, how about this subordinate go there and teach them how to behave?” One of the guards behind Huo Ping approached him, giving a suggestion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huo Ping lifted his arm, stopping the guard beside him. Watching Huang Xiaolong and Huang Xiaohai, he snapped coldly, “Which family are you two from? Have both of you thought about the consequences of doing this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaohai shrugged his soldiers nonchalantly, “Consequences? Why don’t you tell us then, what are the consequences of our actions?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong sat watching in silence, thinking that his younger brother’s temperament was quite like himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Huo Ping’s face darkened as if water was about to drip out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The restaurant owner stepped forward to persuade Huang Xiaolong and Huang Xiaohai, “These two brothers, in my opinion, it’s better if you go down to the ground floor. In fact, ground floor or first floor is just the same.” In his eyes, this was for Huang Xiaolong and Huang Xiaohai’s benefit, it was not necessary to offend Huo Ping, who had a strong background, merely for a table.</span></p>
