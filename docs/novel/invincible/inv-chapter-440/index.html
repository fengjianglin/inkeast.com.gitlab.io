 <p><b>Chapter 440: Where’s Shao Dongjian?</b></p>
 <p><span>Zhu Wuji didn’t have many interests, but tea was one of them. In fact, it could be said that hardly a day passed by without him enjoying a cup of tea.</span></p>
 <p><span>Raising the teacup in front of him, Zhu Wuji leisurely took a small sip and closed his eyes in enjoyment, immersing in the flavor. The fragrant tea flowed onto his taste buds, making him crave more.</span></p>
 <p><span>His tea was brewed from special tea leaves aged more than a thousand years, not only could it boost spirit clarity, but drinking regularly could even strengthen his internal organs. </span></p>
 <p><span>Zhang Jingfeng stood not far away, hesitating several times.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhu Wuji spared a glance in his direction, saying, “If you have something to say, say it.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhang Jingfeng hesitated before speaking, “President, it has been quite a while since Deputy Sovereign went out, could something… an accident has happened? &nbsp;Should we go and have a look?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhu Wuji laughed hearing Zhang Jingfeng’s words, “I’m very clear of Shao Dongjian’s strength, to deal with a Fourth Order Saint realm only requires moving a finger, what could happen? I like tea, he likes women. I’d say he’s probably waging ‘war’ with that three young women right now!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhang Jingfeng loosened up, “It is this subordinate that thought too much, but frankly speaking, Deputy Sovereign Shao is truly lucky, ah, one against three at the same time.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhu Wuji chuckled, “That also depends on the quality of goods, there aren’t many that could enter Shao Dongjian’s eyes.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Is that so?” Just when their laughter rang out, a cold voice cut through their laughter. The voice appeared too sudden, startling both men.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Who?!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Under the vigilant eyes of Zhu Wuji and Zhang Jingfeng, four silhouettes gradually appeared in front of them—Huang Xiaolong, Shi Xiaofei, Xiaorou, and Xiaoyue.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It’s you!” Zhu Wuji stared at Huang Xiaolong, unable to conceal his shock, “You didn’t die?!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Did Shao Dongjian change his mind, and did not kill this brat? Zhu Wuji was confused and bewildered.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It seems like President Zhu is very surprised that I’m alive?” Huang Xiaolong sneered.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhu Wuji placed his teacup on the table as he looked at Huang Xiaolong, “It was out of my expectations that Shao Dongjian would spare your life instead of killing you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Other than this reason, Zhu Wuji couldn’t think of any other reason.</span></p>
 <p><span>To say that a Fourth Order Saint realm escaped from a Tenth Order Saint realm’s pursue was absurd. Therefore, the most sound explanation for this was that Shao Dongjian was wary of this young man’s identity, sparing his life.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Where’s Shao Dongjian?” Zhu Wuji questioned.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Shao Dongjian spared me?” Hearing Zhu Wuji’s conjecture made Huang Xiaolong freeze for a second, and then he shook his head, flashing a cold smile at Zhu Wuji, “You want to know where Shao Dongjian is? You’ll know in a bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“In a bit?” There was doubt in Zhu Wuji’s eyes, failing to understand the meaning behind Huang Xiaolong’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span>Foregoing further pretense, a light flickered and the Eminent Holiness Halberd had pierced through the center of Zhang Jingfeng’s eyebrows. The halberd rotated, drilling a hole right through the skull, coming out from the back of his head.</span></p>
 <p><span>Blood spurted all over the floor as Huang Xiaolong pulled out the halberd.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhang Jingfeng’s eyes widened with disbelief, staring at Huang Xiaolong until the final moments when he tumbled to the floor. Zhang Jingfeng might be an Elder of the Golden Pavilion Chamber of Commerce, but his strength was only at early Fourth Order Saint realm. For Huang Xiaolong, these were just enemies ripe for picking.</span></p>
 <p><span>Watching his subordinate fall lifeless to the floor, Zhu Wuji finally reacted. He didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong to attack so suddenly, not to mention killing his subordinate right in front of him. Even more unimaginable was the fact that a Fourth Order Saint realm young man could slay an early Fourth Order Saint realm Zhang Jingfeng in less time than it took to breathe.</span></p>
 <p><span>“You!” Zhu Wuji flew to his feet, enraged: “You, actually dared to kill him!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“So what if I did?” Huang Xiaolong retorted with a deadpan face.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhu Wuji was pushed beyond anger, laughing instead: “Good, good! You punk, I don’t give a f*ck who you are, I don’t want to know why Shao Dongjian spared your life, today you must die!” He was truly maddened.</span></p>
 <p><span>Letting the words echoed in the air, Zhu Wuji aimed a killer punch at Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Boundless Golden Dawn Fist!” </span></p>
 <p><span>Golden light exploded in the hall, fist imprints spun with infinite changes.</span></p>
 <p><span>This Zhu Wuji was actually a notch stronger than Shao Dongjian.</span></p>
 <p><span>But, before his fist could land on Huang Xiaolong, a deluge of ghost aura soared to the sky, enveloping the entire inner hall. Malicious evil spirits rumbled like a tsunami, blocking Zhu Wuji’s punch. In that split second, Huang Xiaolong disappeared from sight.</span></p>
 <p><span>Just like what happened to Shao Dongjian earlier, Zhu Wuji was shocked and stunned: “Array formation!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Next, his vision was filled with little black insects that flew toward him. Like Shao Dongjian, Zhu Wuji did not place any significance on these little black insects. Punches shot out, but after several punches, Zhu Wuji’s face finally turned grim.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Could these be…?!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“You, you’re Huang Xiaolong?!” Zhu Wuji blurted.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong snorted in reply, no further sounds came from him.</span></p>
 <p><span>A chill snaked up Zhu Wuji’s heart, silence meant acknowledgment!</span></p>
 <p><span>At this point, the Poison Corpse Scarabs made another wave of attack. Watching the Poison Corpse Scarabs, Zhu Wuji felt a chill spread all over his body, quickly striking his fists out to repel those black critters.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was as if a hammer slammed into his head. By now, how could he not know these little black insects were those terrifying Poison Corpse Scarabs!</span></p>
 <p><span>Then, Shao Dongjian!</span></p>
 <p><span>“You killed Shao Dongjian!” Zhu Wuji couldn’t help blurting out.</span></p>
 <p><span>A small part of him refused to accept Shao Dongjian was dead!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Didn’t I say just now, you’ll know in a little bit.” Huang Xiaolong’s cold voice sounded. </span></p>
 <p><span>Zhu Wuji lost all color from his face and started shaking.</span></p>
 <p><span>Half an hour later.</span></p>
 <p><span>Without suspense, the Poison Corpse Scarabs swarmed all over Zhu Wuji, stripping every piece of meat and his soul ended up being swallowed by the Supreme Ghost Flag, turning into an evil spirit.</span></p>
 <p><span>In fact, at the very end, Zhu Wuji pleaded Huang Xiaolong, as long as Huang Xiaolong spared him, he would submit under him. Unfortunately, at his current spiritual force level, he was unable to brand a soul imprint in Zhu Wuji’s soul sea, making Zhu Wuji a constant risk that couldn't be fully controlled. In the end, Huang Xiaolong could only feed him to the Poison Corpse Scarabs as nourishment, albeit reluctantly.</span></p>
 <p><span>After ‘cleaning up’ Zhu Wuji and Zhang Jingfeng, Huang Xiaolong and the three women disappeared from the scene.</span></p>
 <p><span>Due to Huang Xiaolong’s precaution measure, using the God Binding Ring to lock the space around the inner hall, what took place did not alert anyone from the Golden Pavilion Chamber of Commerce in the lobby outside. Everything proceeded as normal.</span></p>
 <p><span>Shao Dongjian and Zhao Wuji weren’t any average Saint realm experts; Shao Dongjian was a late-Tenth Order Saint realm, while Zhu Wuji was slightly stronger, closer to a peak late-Tenth Order Saint realm.</span></p>
 <p><span>Their corpses were definitely not something that average mid and high-level Saint realm experts could compare.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nourished by such quality corpses, the Poison Corpse Scarabs evolved again, their shells were more lustrous, akin to a black ruby, and the feelers on their heads grew stronger and sharper.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Supreme Ghost Flag’s power was also boosted with the addition of two strong souls.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong and the three women left Birchleaf City once more, this time heading back to the Asura’s Gate headquarters. Huang Xiaolong’s plan was to return to the Asura’s Gate headquarters first, refine one primordial divine dragon, and after that, he would send Shi Xiaofei and her maids back to the Blessed Buddha Empire.</span></p>
 <p><span>Having some Dragon God Grass in hand, he wasn’t as rushed on the journey back. Huang Xiaolong and the three women covered grounds during the day and stopped to rest at night, while Huang Xiaolong would cultivate the Godly Xumi Art, Asura Tactics, Ancient Puppetry Art, and Soul Mandate.</span></p>
 <p><span>At the same time, Huang Xiaolong continued to familiarize himself with the nine tactics of pill refinement recorded inside the Golden Dragon Pill Refinement Tactic.</span></p>
 <p><span>Killing Shao Dongjian and Zhu Wuji provided Huang Xiaolong with a lot of ingredients from their spatial rings, thus Huang Xiaolong was definitely not lacking.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Divine Dragon Pill, Golden Jadesea Pill, and other divine grade spirit pellets he had gotten from the Ancient Dragon Clan’s ruins were running out, he had to grasp the Dragon Clan’s all nine pill refinement tactics. At that point, as long as he had the ingredients, he could definitely refine them.</span></p>
