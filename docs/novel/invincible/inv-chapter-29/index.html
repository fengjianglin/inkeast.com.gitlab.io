 <p><b>Chapter 29: Asura Sword Skill – Second Move</b></p>
 <p><span style>For a long while after Huang Xiaolong left the hall, no one dared to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father, you see…?” A while later, Huang Ming asked in a small voice after he stole a glimpse at his father’s expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Qide sighed heavily as he raised his head, and then waved his hand. “Everyone disperse, this year’s Assembly ends here.” After saying that, he turned and walked away; his stooped shoulders gave off a feeling of loneliness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It ends here!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Clan Manor elders, housekeepers, and disciples looked at each other in doubt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone disperse!” After Huang Qide’s silhouette had disappeared from their sight, Huang Ming waved his hands and ordered. He left the hall half carried by Elder Zhou Guang and a little while later the hall was empty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This is the first time since the Huang Clan Manor was established that a Clan Assembly ended midway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After leaving the hall, Huang Xiaolong returned to his courtyard. Not too long afterwards, his parents came to his little courtyard. Seeing his parents arrive, he knew that they would have many questions, so without waiting for them to speak, he said, “Dad, Mom, I know you have many questions, but there are some things that I can’t explain to you right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Peng and Su Yan exchanged a look when they heard this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaolong, who is senior Fei Hou?” Huang Peng asked after a short pause.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Senior Fei Hou? </span></i><span style>Huang Xiaolong replied after he pondered for a moment. Then said, “I became the disciple of an extraordinary person, and Fei Hou is his subordinate, so he calls me Young Master.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong did not mention Ren Wokuang and Asura’s Gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Peng and Su Yan finally understood, and were overjoyed that their son was able to become the disciple of such a great Master; if Fei Hou was a peak late-Tenth Order expert, what of his Master?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking about this, their bodies quivered with excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaolong, has your current strength gotten to the mid-Fourth Order level?” Su Yan asked some moments later, both of them looked at their son expectantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the stage, Huang Xiaolong said Fourth Order was only a part of his strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mid-Fourth Order?” Huang Xiaolong was startled for a moment, in the end, he nodded, confirming their suspicion. It was better that they thought of him as being at mid-Fourth Order if they knew he was actually at the peak late-Fifth Order they would be frightened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that their son confirm that his strength was at mid-Fourth Order, their hearts almost flipped for joy, but even so, they were shocked! Mid-Fourth Order! Their son had actually reached the mid-Fourth Order!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, Mom, two days after the New Year celebration, I have decided to leave the Huang Clan Manor, to gain experience outside!” Huang Xiaolong said firmly leaving no room for debate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Gain experience?” Huang Peng and Su Yan were surprised and almost shouted in unison, “No!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong opened his mouth and said, “I know that you are worried, but with Fei Hou coming along with I won’t be in any danger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaolong, I know you want to leave Huang Clan Manor this instant because of your Grandfather’s actions, but no matter what, he still is your Grandfather. Don’t hate him. Besides you’re still too young, why don’t you wait another two years before leaving?” Huang Peng used a gentle tone as he tried to dissuade Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though there was a Tenth Order warrior with Huang Xiaolong, he was still too young – not even nine years old! Huang Peng and Su Yan wouldn’t be able to stop worrying if they allowed Huang Xiaolong to leave!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, Mom, I have decided. And I will leave after the New Year.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head; his eyes were resolute. It was true that he wanted to leave Huang Clan Manor at this very moment because he didn’t want to have to see his Grandfather nor Eldest Uncle Huang Ming, the pair of father and son. But his wanting to go out and gain experience was not entirely due to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted to hone himself so that he would become stronger and also explore the world outside of the Huang Clan Manor and meet with experts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing their son’s expression, Huang Peng and Su Yan’s sighed– they both knew it was useless to continue trying to persuade him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking about how her son was going to leave home and travel to distant places, Su Yan’s heart ached, and her eyes become red. “Xiaolong, when will you return?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A trace of warmth spread across Huang Xiaolong’s heart, and smiled and said, “Mom, rest assured, before next year’s Clan Assembly, your son will definitely come back to see you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Next year’s Clan Assembly?” Only then did Su Yan feel better. Su Yan continued to ‘nag’ Huang Xiaolong for quite some time; she kept reminding him to be careful while traveling and to take care of his body and to be careful of bad people, etc.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong nodded throughout, unable to refuse her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two hours later, his parents finally left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fei Hou, we will be leaving two days later after the New Year. Prepare the necessary things that we need to take with us.” Huang Xiaolong ordered Fei Hou after his parents left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Sovereign!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The night passed without incident.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the cold jade bed, Huang Xiaolong stopped practicing the Asura Tactics and gazed at the coming dawn sky through the window. He walked out to the small yard and started practicing Tempest of Hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tempest of Hell has already reached major completion; it only lacks power, but that will increase with my battle qi. The next step is to practice Asura Sword Skill’s second style.” An hour later, Huang Xiaolong stopped practicing Tempest of Hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He retrieved a piece of paper from the ring and studied the diagram of the second style.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asura Sword Skill, Second Style: Tears of Asura.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tears of Asura? This name is really unique.</span></i><span style> Huang Xiaolong circulated his battle qi according to the diagram, the Blades of Asura had already been called out. He leaped into midair and launched an attack, and from midair, a ray of light fell to the ground. That’s right; it fell just like a tear drop falling to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first style, Tempest of Hell attacked from the ground. However, the second style could only be used while one was in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong’s body floated to the ground after his first attempt. He stood still on the ground, remembering the movements and how it felt when he launched a string using Tears of Asura. He stood there for half an hour then made his second attempt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, the ray of light from the blades was softer, as if weightless, akin to a tiny drop of rain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another half an hour had passed before Huang Xiaolong made the third attempt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And just like when he first started practicing Tempest of Hell, after each attempt, he would stand still for at least half an hour before trying again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Huang Xiaolong immersed himself in practice, the sky gradually turned dark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He shook his head as his body floated down from midair. Although with one day’s worth of practice the power of the attack had increased quite a bit compared to the first time, he had yet to reach minor completion. According to the illustration, when Tears of Asura produced the sound of cries, then it would be considered as having reached minor completion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire time while Huang Xiaolong was practicing, Fei Hou stood silently outside the small courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The truth is, Asura Sword Skill and Claws of Asura were exclusive to those who practiced Asura Tactics; therefore, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t worried that either Fei Hou nor anyone else would try to learn it in secret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Huang Xiaolong finished his Tears of Asura practice, the sounds of footsteps echoed outside of the small courtyard. When he turned to look, he saw that the people approaching were his Grandfather Huang Qide, Eldest Uncle Huang Ming, and they were accompanied by his father, Huang Peng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Xiaolong frowned.</span></p>
