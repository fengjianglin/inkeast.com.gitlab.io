 <p><b>Chapter 398: Having Something Appraised</b></p>
 <p><span>Hence, after their appetite was satiated, Huang Xiaolong’s group left the restaurant and asked for directions towards the Archaic Peak Appraisal Firm.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Archaic Peak Appraisal Firm was one of South Oblast City’s largest appraisal firms, from pill refinement ingredients to paintings, books, battle skills and cultivation techniques, amongst other items.</span></p>
 <p><span>A short while later, Huang Xiaolong’s group reached one of the most prosperous streets in the city: Poland Street.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Archaic Peak Appraisal Firm was located on this Poland Street, at the most strategic position. Arriving at Poland Street, they headed straight to the Archaic Peak Appraisal Firm.</span></p>
 <p><span>This Poland Street was just as bustling as Food Street, with a small difference. The pedestrians moving in and out of Food Street were mostly commoners, whereas, on Poland Street, luxurious brocade robes filled the streets, lavish jewelry sparkled and gleamed in the sunlight, evidence of their high status, they were either nobles or disciples of big families.</span></p>
 <p><span>The environment on Food Street was loud and noisy. While there were a lot of people on Poland Street, the level of noise was more controlled.</span></p>
 <p><span>A moment later, Huang Xiaolong’s group stood in front of the Archaic Peak Appraisal Firm building. The facade of the Archaic Peak Appraisal Firm was big and spacious, with a grand decor that exuded a quiet elegance and nobility. Judging from appearance, it was even more impressive than the Aowu Shop.</span></p>
 <p><span>Inside, the hall decorations were on a grander scale compared to the facade, exuding the elegance of upper class. </span></p>
 <p><span>One of the staff members spotted Huang Xiaolong’s group. Approaching with agile steps, he politely asked, “May I know if the several guests came to have treasures appraised or to buy treasures?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Appraise treasure.” Huang Xiaolong replied.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Several guests, please come with me.” Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s reply, the staff led Huang Xiaolong to a seat at a corner, saying, “Our owner is currently helping Castellan Manor’s Miss Yang appraise a treasure, kindly wait for a moment.” The staff turned and left after saying this.</span></p>
 <p><span>When Huang Xiaolong’s group entered the hall, the others inside took a quick glance and no longer bothered with them.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and Lil’ Tian sat down, observing the activities in the hall. In the center of the hall was a group of young people, three men and two women, all draped in expensive brocade robes and dresses. Clearly, amongst the two women, one of them was the aforementioned South Oblast City Castellan Manor’s Miss Yang.</span></p>
 <p><span>Placed on the table before them were a jade item, an ancient bottle, a short blade, and a short stalk of an inky violet plant.</span></p>
 <p><span>On the other side of the table sat a portly middle-aged man that grew two long thin mustaches, coupled with a pair of small beady eyes. He was the owner of the Archaic Peak Appraisal Firm, Gu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span>The name of this appraisal firm was taken off Gu Feng’s own name.</span></p>
 <p><span>At this time, the Archaic Peak Appraisal Firm’s owner was holding something like a magnifying glass, carefully observing the short blade on the table. That short blade was half the length of an adult’s arm, the blade body glowed with a greenish red light and was inscribed with the pattern of a demonic beast head. Underneath the light, the demonic beast head pattern reflected a light yellow light.</span></p>
 <p><span>A short while later, the Archaic Peak Appraisal Firm boss looked towards a fair-skinned, round-faced woman clad in purple, “Congratulations, Miss Yang, this short blade is most likely the legendary Luna Beast Blade! Several thousand years ago, this Luna Beast Blade was the heritage treasure of the Luna Beast Tribe. It was said that under the moonlight, this blade can display a magical power!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Yang Ying’s face did not show much joy at these words, instead, she looked prideful and arrogant, “Is that so? Then according to Boss Gu Feng’s opinion, how much would this Luna Beast Blade fetch in an auction?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Gu Feng smiled, “If this Luna Beast Blade is taken to the auction house, it can fetch at least fifty million gold coins!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The young man seated beside Yang Ying, Lin Wu, laughed as he said, “Congratulations, Miss Yang.” The other three quickly followed, relaying their ‘heartfelt’ congratulations.</span></p>
 <p><span>Yang Ying nodded, exposing a nonchalant smile, “Just fifty million, it’s nothing much.” The underlying meaning was, she wasn't concerned with a mere fifty million gold coins.</span></p>
 <p><span>Subsequently, the Archaic Peak Appraisal Firm owner continued to assess the jade item and the bottle on the table. When it came to that small stalk plant, the expression of Gu Feng’s face turned serious. A second later, he exclaimed, “This is likely the plant they call king of a thousand herbs, Nine Leaves Purple Grass! Moreover, this is a stalk that is over a thousand-year-old!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The three young men and the young woman gasped with surprise hearing Gu Feng’s evaluation.</span></p>
 <p><span>King of a Thousand Herbs, Nine Leaves Purple Grass! A rare panacea, no matter how grave one’s injuries were, swallowing this Nine Leaves Purple Grass would heal all wounds!</span></p>
 <p><span>Yang Ying’s expression remained calm as if she already knew, “Boss Gu Feng’s eyesight is really good. Indeed, this is the King of Thousand Herb, Nine Leaves Purple Grass. My main purpose here this time is to request Boss Gu Feng to help me determine the actual age of this Nine Leaves Purple Grass.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Gu Feng was astonished, then begin carefully checking the small plant. A brief moment later, he said, “This Nine Leaves Purple Grass should be one thousand three hundred years.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Lil’ Tian’s voice rang in the hall at this point, “Big brother, that herb look really tasty.” At the end, he even swallowed visibly, eyes stared fixedly at that small stalk of herb at the center of the hall that was emitting an alluring soft glow.</span></p>
 <p><span>Lil’ Tian’s voice was too abrupt and crude, attracting everyone’s attention in the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span>Yang Ying’s willow brows furrowed slightly, disgust flitted in her eyes, “Where does this savage kid come from, rude and ignorant of etiquette!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Lil’ Tian’s feet were bare, and even though his clothes were decent, they were made with the common material, resembling one of the poor commoner kids. For nobles and big families’ disciples like Yang Ying, they despised these lowly commoners the most.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu’s clothes barely passed.</span></p>
 <p><span>The young man beside Yang Ying, Lin Wu, glared at Lil’ Tian, “Tasty? Little thing, this kind of rare elixir is not something lowly commoners like you can afford to eat. Able to breathe the same air in the presence of this elixir is worth your ten lifetimes of luck! Let me tell you, a hundred of your lives cannot even compare with one leaf from this Nine Leaves Purple Grass!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Lin Wu puffed up his chest arrogantly, staring at Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and Lil’ Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong was calm as ever, “Really?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Another young man from the group, Qin Guo spoke this time, “Didn’t you say just now that you want to appraise some treasure? Since we’re done with ours, it’s your turn. Come, take out those so-called treasures you have on you and let Boss Gu Feng evaluate them, who knows, there might really be something good!” The word ‘treasure’ was heavily emphasized by Qin Gui, laced with obvious ridicule.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was obvious that, in his eyes, the treasures in Huang Xiaolong’s possession were nothing but rubbish.</span></p>
 <p><span>A dangerous glint flickered in Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu’s eyes hearing the young man’s words. Both of them were about to stand up, but Huang Xiaolong waved his hand, indicating both to relax. Huang Xiaolong did not speak and did not get up. He remained seated at the same place while taking out two herbs from the Asura Ring that he collected years back in the Eminent Holiness cultivation cave, placing them on the table in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span>The moment these two herbs were brought out, it filled the entire spacious hall with spiritual energy. The fragrance from this side of the hall totally overpowered that stalk of Nine Leaves Purple Grass from the other side.</span></p>
 <p><span>Everyone present in the hall was stunned, staring at the two stalk of herbs on the table in front of Huang Xiaolong. One of them was actually a Nine Leaves Purple Grass, but that Nine Leaves Purple Grass’s color was more brilliant, bigger in size, even exuding layers of purple halo!</span></p>
 <p><span>Beside the Nine Leaves Purple Grass was a human-shaped ginseng, wholly blood-red in color, it was as if they could see translucent blood flowing within, emitting glimmering soft lights.</span></p>
 <p><span>After a brief moment of daze, fervid greed crept up their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>That Archaic Peak Appraisal Firm boss, Gu Feng, reached Huang Xiaolong’s table in less than ten steps, his eyes never moving away from the two elixirs on the table, “This, this is a ten-thousand-year-old Nine Leaves Purple Grass, and this is a Human-shaped Purpleblood Ginseng!” His voice quivered, hardly believing what was in front of him.</span></p>
