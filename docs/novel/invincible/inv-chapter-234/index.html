 <p><strong>Chapter 234: Wounded My Xiao’er</strong></p>
 <p><span>“They are also the Guo Family’s in-laws?” Huang Xiaolong was surprised. But then a frown appeared on his face as he looked over to the Tie Family’s disciples on the dashing horses, saying “The Tie Family’s disciples actually dare to race on their horses in the Imperial City, aren’t they afraid of repercussions from the law?”</span></p>
 <p><span>This naive sounding question made the young man chuckle wryly while shaking his head, “Now that the Guo Family is becoming in-laws with the Huang Family, even Emperor Duanren needs to give Guo Family some face. Moreover, the Tie Family is in-laws with the Guo Family too, not to mention racing on the streets of the Imperial City, even if they kill someone in broad daylight on the streets, no one would dare to stop them!”</span></p>
 <p><span>At this time, the group of Tie Family disciples on horses had arrived within a hundred meters of Huang Xiaolong. The other people nearby hurried to scatter and avoid their path.</span></p>
 <p><span>Watching this, the young man advised anxiously, “Let us avoid quickly, otherwise those Tie Family disciples will really…!” Before he even finished his words, his hands shot out and pulled Huang Xiaolong to a safer side of the street.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, Huang Xiaolong remained standing like a mountain on the same spot.</span></p>
 <p><span>The young man was stunned. But the Tie Family disciples were only a dozen meters from them, the young man’s face was ashen and had to let go of his hand. Like everyone else in the vicinity, he jumped out of the Tie Family disciples’ path.</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp;By this time, there were only a few meters left between the sprinting horses and Huang Xiaolong, whereas the group of Tie Family disciples burst out in raucous laughter after a momentary shock when they noticed Huang Xiaolong standing in their path, unlike the others that had run for safety early on.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Brothers, there are still people that aren't afraid of death!” The frontmost young man amongst the group laughed loudly, and as if on cue, the rest laughed with him.</span></p>
 <p><span>All the while Huang Xiaolong looked at the laughing group with a cool expression.</span></p>
 <p><span>Closer, less than five meters between them, Huang Xiaolong suddenly raised his right hand and struck his palm to the front. Multiple golden lights whistled through space, right into the Tie Family disciples. Before the surrounding crowd’s eyes, every individual and horse struck by the golden lights stopped moving, frozen in place just a few meters away from Huang Xiaolong.</span></p>
 <p><span>The previous young man had a flabbergasted expression on his face staring at the live statues consisting of the Tie Family disciples.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What kind of battle skill is this?!” And he wasn’t the only one looking dumbfounded at the scene in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong strutted in an unhurried pace towards the young man leading the group of Tie Family disciples.</span></p>
 <p><span>Seeing Huang Xiaolong approaching them, the young man was terrified and angered at the same time. To disguise his fear, he threatened Huang Xiaolong, “Little maggot, you’re absolutely dead! You actually dared to attack and injure us? Do you know who we are? We’re Tie Family disciples! I’m Tie Xiao and my father is the Tie Family’s Patriarch, Tie Fang!&nbsp;</span><em><span>You’re f*cking dead, I tell you!”&nbsp;</span></em></p>
 <p><span>“Tie Fang?” Huang Xiaolong snickered.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>So</span></em><span>, this little brat was that what’s-his-name Tie Family Patriarch’s son… in other words, he was Guo Shiwen’s nephew? No wonder this brat was another arrogant young master!</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong lifted his right hand again, fingers bent a little like a claw as he clutched at Tie Xiao’s throat, lifting him into the air. Exactly what he did to the Guo Brothers two years ago.</span></p>
 <p><span>Being lifted up into the air by his throat, Tie Xiao had disbelief and fear written all over his face.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Brat, you dareㅡ!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Immediately release our Young Lord, if not, even an Immortal descending won’t be able to save you!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Not only you, your entire family will be buried together with you!” The Tie Family guards roared at the top of their lungs, while the rest stared dumbstruck at Huang Xiaolong’s bravado, including the young man that tried to pull Huang Xiaolong to safety earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span>Listening to the clamors from the Tie Family guards, a mysterious smile arched at the corner of Huang Xiaolong’s mouth. Without warning, he let go of his grip on Tie Xiao’s throat. However, Huang Xiaolong’s action made Tie Xiao think he was afraid. A finger pointed at Huang Xiaolong as Tie Xiao bellowed, “You maggot, it’s too late for you even if you let me go now! I want your whole family dead! You, dead!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Before Tie Xiao could state his powerful threat to the end, Huang Xiaolong struck out another palm with a turn of his wrist, striking accurately on Tie Xiao’s chest. Letting out an earth-shaking wail, Tie Xiao’s body was sent flying. When he crashed down, large amounts of blood were spurting out from his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Young Lord!!!” The Tie Family guards cried out.</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong struck out another palm, this time it was aimed towards the Tie Family guards. A palm imprint pierced through space, sending the large group of guards tumbling out in a whirlwind. Huang Xiaolong fused the first move of the Asura Sword Skill into this palm strike, although it was much weaker than using the Blades of Asura, it was sufficient to deal with this level of fodder. Amongst these Tie Family guards, the strongest was only a Xiantian Second Order. Therefore, to Huang Xiaolong they were a trivial inconvenience.</span></p>
 <p><span>The heads in the crowd turned to look at Tie Xiao and his guards, then turned the other way to look at Huang Xiaolong. There were a thousand and one expressions, from admiration to worship, pity, and others in between.</span></p>
 <p><span>At this point, the same young man who pulled Huang Xiaolong earlier arrived at his side, saying in an anxious tone, “Bro, hurry and leave the Imperial City immediately, run as far as you can! If the Guo and Tie Families’ people arrive, you won’t be able to run even if you wanted to!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Run?” Huang Xiaolong shook his head. “I’ve just returned. My younger sister is getting married in three day’s time, I need to be there for the ceremony so I won’t run.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The young man blanked at Huang Xiaolong’s reason, “Bro, how can you be thinking about your younger sister’s wedding in this situation? Fleeing for your life supersedes everything, if your life is already gone, would you still be talking about attending your younger sister’s wedding?!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Watching the young man’s anxiety and concern for him, a feeling of goodwill towards this young man emerged in his heart. After all, they were nothing more than strangers on the same street</span></p>
 <p><span>“Which family are you from?” Huang Xiaolong looked at the young man and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>Again, the young man blanked. What situation was he in, this man still has the time to enquire which family he’s from?!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Bro, forget which family I come from. Quickly get out of the Imperial City, most likely the Guo and Tie Families already knew what happened here!” The young man became even more anxious.</span></p>
 <p><span>Whereas Huang Xiaolong was cool as a cucumber, “What are you so anxious for?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Hearing this sentence made the young man speechless to the core. In the end, he could only give up, answering Huang Xiaolong with a helpless expression: “My name’s Gao Yong, a Gao Family disciple from the Geer Kingdom.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Huang Xiaolong nodded, “Since we’re both free, how about we go and have a few drinks?”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>Since we’re both free?</span></em></p>
 <p><em><span>Have a few drinks?!</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The young man felt an onslaught of dizziness, he truly did not know what to say anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span>…</span></p>
 <p><span>At this time, Guo Shiwen, Guo Shiyuan, and some others were seated in the Guo Family Mansion’s main hall, laughter and voices filled the air. Next to Guo Shiwen sat a beautiful woman, and that beautiful woman Guo Xiaoqing,&nbsp;Guo Shiwen and Guo Shiyuan’s younger sister.</span></p>
 <p><span>Guo Xiaoqing was laughed dazzlingly, “Big brother, Second brother, now that our family is becoming in-laws with the Huang Family, even Emperor Duanren needs to pay attention to our Guo Family. I want to see who dares to blaspheme our Guo Family in the future!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Guo Shiwen and Guo Shiyuan were full of smiles.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Patriarch!!” At this moment, a Guo Family guard ran into the main hall all flustered shouting, “It’s bad, Young Master Tie Xiao was beaten on the streets!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Guo Shiwen, Guo Shiyuan, and Guo Xiaoqing were stupefied!</span></p>
 <p><span>“What did you say?!” A brief moment passed and Guo Xiaoqing instantly awakened as the meaning of the Guo Family guard dawned on her, “You’re saying someone wounded my Xiao’er?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Yes, on Dawn River Street!” The guard confirmed.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Dawn River Street,” Guo Shiyuan repeated, “It’s not far from our Guo Mansion.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Guo Xiaoqing jumped to her feet. Undisguisable wrath in her voice: “I want to see who has such big guts to dare hurt my Xiao’er!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Guo Shiwen sto</span><span>od up too, ordering the guard with a cold sneer, “Tell people to have the city gates on lockdown, that punk must not escape!” He turned towards Guo Shiyuan and Guo Xiaoqing, “Let’s go and have a look, we’ll capture that punk alive!”</span></p>
