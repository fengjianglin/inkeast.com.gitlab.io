 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it really was a prison, who exactly was it trying to imprison? And who was it that set up this prison?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su thought to himself, but he momentarily couldn’t find an answer. As such, he slowly withdrew from his thoughts, allowing his body’s damage that was due to the many thought centers burnt from overload to recover. After this battle, Su obtained completely new knowledge regarding the apostles, knowing that right now, he still wasn’t their match. Without making further preparations, rashly challenging Serendela or Fitzdurk was simply courting death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su had previously fought both Fitzdurk and Serendela, so he understood them extremely well. These were two individuals with extremely distinct energy characteristics, both of them reaching the absolute extreme in their respective domains. They each occupied one field, like two brilliant points on a five tip star. Thus, there were at least three more apostles, as only then would this five pointed star be completed. There were already two apostles that appeared, so would the other three be far off? The apostles’ appearance wasn’t all that random, they definitely had their own missions and destinations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Madeline...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su’s understanding of Madeline could be said to reach down to the soul, yet the more he understood her, the more he felt hints of coldness from deep within him. Madeline’s nature was clear, even though she might not necessarily be one of the five points, there was an ineradicable relationship between them. This was a similarity between energy and life morphology, a closeness in biological intrinsic quality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su forcefully shook his head, wishing to remove excess thoughts from his mind, but this ended in failure. However, at this moment, it was as if that silver-haired, blue-eyed little girl who seemed to be full of sunlight from the moment of birth from ten years ago reappeared before his eyes. In the past, she gave the perplexed Su a direction of life, and now, she silently soothed the shadows in his heart once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, waves of low buzzing sounds suddenly sounded from the horizon, the originally dusky lighting becoming even more overcast. An expanse of dark clouds appeared once more below the distant clouds of radiation, moving quickly, smoke and dust roiling beneath them, as if an entirely mechanized army was charging forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dark cloud was formed from countless mechanical bugs, their numbers in the several millions even from just an extremely rough estimate, this swarm stretching close to a hundred kilometers. Moreover, this time, at the center of the mechanical bug army was actually a super mothership exceeding a thousand meters in length. Even from far away, others would immediately notice it, as if there was a flying island. A mothership of this scale not only served as a place to take off and land, carry out maintenance, as well as manufacture all types of basic mechanical combat units, it was also used as a platform to transport large scale weapons of destruction. For the mechanical bug swarm to undergo such a great transformation in the span of just a few months, it could only be said that the control of the mastermind operating them from behind the scenes was rapidly becoming deeper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mechanical bug swarm passed over Su’s head. It stretched out above him, only after a long time had passed did they completely pass. The bug swarm occasionally released a few high energy light beams, blasting all large scale creatures below into ashes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su’s expression wasn’t all that good, he could imagine just what kind of disaster this level of bug swarm would bring to this planet. Moreover, this was definitely only a portion of the bug swarm, to the extent where it might only be a small portion. However, right now, he was powerless, because the bug swarm’s numbers already exceeded a critical point, a million and ten million already making no difference. Su could destroy the giant floating mothership at the center, but had no way of striking down the millions of combat units, which was why he could only watch them move into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Did the Blood Parliament have the power to resist this bug swarm? Su could only wait. However, fortunately, that powerful aura that extended over a thousand miles gave him quite a bit of confidence. Su suddenly recalled the ideal Bevulas pursued, and as a result sighed inwardly. If Bevulas lived until this day, seeing this world-covering swarm of mechanical bugs, would he still insist on an ideal where abilities were given up, a world that abandoned individual strength?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This question would never be answered.</span></p>
