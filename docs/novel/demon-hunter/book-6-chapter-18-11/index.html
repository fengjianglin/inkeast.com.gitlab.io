A string of machine cannon shells flew over, tearing apart the commander’s corpse, yet couldn’t even damage the corners of her clothes. At the top of the wheel type tank’s gun turret, a concocted human gunner had the lever pulled all the way down, the dual machine guns crazily firing, raining down bullets towards this fiend-like girl. However, this girl suddenly jumped out, immediately disappearing from his field of view. This machine cannon’s shooter was also a third class commander. He immediately let go of the machine gun, withdrew from the gun turret, and then closed the roof.</span></p>

The circular metal bolt released a groaning sound, but didn’t break. The girl tried more time, and then realized she couldn’t pull it open with brute force. She suddenly bent down, her face almost sticking to the cover, and then released a streak of extremely hot fire. Under the flames, the cover’s color immediately became red, and then went from red to white, a clear white line appearing at the center. A moment later, the heat stream actually cut this tank’s cover in half! The girl pulled off the cover with a single motion, and then rushed into the tank.</span></p>

With a forceful pull, the armored car’s door was forcibly torn open. Concentrated assault rifle gunshots immediately sounded from inside the vehicle, a first class commander unexpectedly standing inside. The assault rifle in his hands released burst fire, the entire magazine quickly emptied! The girl released a shrill cry, actually sent flying by the impact, the flowered dress covering her even more so completely destroyed by the concentrated barrage. Blood continuously spurted out from her body.</span></p>

She released another cry, suddenly bouncing from the ground to avoid the first class commander, moving behind a tank. She hung from the vehicle’s walls with a single hand, and then lowered her head to continuously lick the wounds on her body with her long tongue. In that short instant, she was struck by more than ten bullets. The wounds that were licked continuously closed, the bullets either removed by her tongue or straight up squeezed out by her muscles, but there were just too many wounds on her body, still quite a bit of blood lost, dyeing the tank’s side wall red. It was unknown how her body had so much blood, but after licking her body that was almost blasted to mush, killing intent raged in her eyes!</span></p>

The spot where she was just at was covered in fiery sparks. Not far out, the commander held an assault rifle horizontally, a cold smile on his face as he walked over. The assault rifle released blazing tongues of flame, the bullets chasing after the girl as she scuttled left and right as if they had eyes.</span></p>

However, the girl’s speed suddenly increased, moreover rushing straight into the barrage of bullets without evading! The magazine of bullets was almost completely emptied into her chest, but she counteracted the impact of the bullets with her tremendous momentum, successfully arriving in front of the commander!</span></p>

When she saw the tumbling head, she didn’t feel happy at all, to the extent where she didn’t even feel any hate. Against these lowest level concocted soldiers, she could kill a dozen with a sweep of her blade, yet now, she had to display complete combat skills to kill a single one. Right now, she was exhausted, the long blade already feeling like it weighed several dozen tons, impossible to pick up.
