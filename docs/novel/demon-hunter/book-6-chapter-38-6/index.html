 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Book 6 Chapter 38.6 - Embrace</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Morgan sighed, not paying Helen’s mockery any attention, instead continuing, “What I said just now, most of it you already knew about. Meanwhile, after the war, after continuing the research on the apostle specimen and extraterrestrial spaceship, we unexpectedly discovered another crashed spaceship, determining based on the technology system that it belongs to the same civilization as the former spaceship. However, what is different is that the organism on this spaceship still had weak activity. Meanwhile, after a preliminary analysis, an astonishing conclusion was reached back then, that these specimen that still had activity were precisely the ultra life forms in our dreams! Moreover, its genes were just so perfect, and so complex, the charm and fascination not something we can describe even with the limits of our imagination! That was why it was called the perfect body. Meanwhile, whoever obtained it, they would have a chance of becoming an eternal ultra life form with just a single leap. If this was placed in the olden era, then we would rank it at the level of gods. Even though back then, this secret was known to only a select few, even though they were powerful individuals at the peak of humanity, this was still an irrefusable enticement. That was why in the end, the struggle over the complete body led to a complete collapse, separating into two great factions, thus also leading to an endless and bloody war. This war dragged in almost all ability users of that time, in the end leading to the deaths of close to 90% of all ability users. Meanwhile, that war, is precisely Blood Dusk. However, from the start of the war until the end, most people didn’t know what the true cause of Blood Dusk was.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After pausing for a moment, Morgan continued and said, “After Blood Dusk, we divided the complete body into three parts, splitting it between me, Lanaxis, and Bevulas to separately safeguard. What lies before you, is one portion of the perfect body.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What does the perfect body have to do with me?” Helen asked. However, even though her subconscious evasive movement was hidden well, it still leaked her thoughts. The perfect body wasn’t something just anyone would produce a response to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The perfect body not only has research value, its own activity is also powerful to an inconceivable degree. In reality, until now, all of the research has proved that we haven’t even found a single reliable method to completely destroy it. For the sake of safety, this was why we divided the complete body into three portions. The severed perfect body still has some method of connection unknown to us, but as long as it is cut up, they would be like severed animal parts, only having instinctive reactions left. As a result, even though cutting up the perfect body substantially decreased its abilities, we still cut it up and split it up for safekeeping. Not even Lanaxis was willing to face the uncut perfect body. Before it, even the most powerful fella would feel a chilliness from their innermost depths.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he spoke up to here, General Morgan’s voice trembled slightly again, clearly recalling the feeling he felt when facing the past perfect body. After pausing a bit to compose himself, only then did he continue and say, “The severed complete body has another function, which is that when it is activated, moreover taken into a living creature, it would instinctively multiply, moreover control and remodel its host’s body functions. The modified human’s strength would be increased hundreds of times, but they would gradually lose their sense of self, becoming a parasite controlled by the perfect body. However, the greater the strength one possessed, the more they could resist the perfect body’s control. That is why from a certain perspective, when one was powerful enough, the perfect body could directly make them cross millions of years of evolution, turning them into an ultra life form!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If one reached that degree of power, aren’t they about the same as an ultra life form already?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, that is not the case.” Morgan shook his head and said, “The complete body is definitely not an ordinary ultra life form, but rather close to a perfect ultra life form, to the extent where it is even more powerful than an apostle. Even when facing the divided complete body, to this day, I still have no confidence in absorbing it. Bevulas was an extremely prideful person when he was alive, completely devoted to researching the complete body’s secrets, becoming extremely powerful himself, but not obtaining his strength through the method of ultra life forms. Only Lanaxis has a chance of controlling the perfect body, but it is still only a chance. The greater possibility is that one day in the future, she would also be controlled by the perfect body, and from this become a medium for the perfect body to resurrect. That is why I need to find her and examine her current state.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why are you so certain the empress has already merged with the perfect body? Also, what kind of consequences are there if one is controlled by the perfect body?” Helen asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Perhaps she hasn’t merged with the perfect body yet…” Morgan said with hesitation. However, when he saw Helen’s expression, he finally gave up thoughts of hiding anything, instead directly saying, “She definitely already merged with the perfect body. In the battle that night, she used Doomsday Storm, but the power was hundreds of times greater than in the past! This isn’t power that a human could display, but rather something possible only through the complete body. Meanwhile, once she is controlled by the perfect body, then she would immediately become our human race’s most dangerous enemy. Ultra life forms are also divided into categories, if the complete body grows up, it would become a type of ultra life form known as a predatory type ultra life form. Their evolution has no end, which is to say, everything on this planet will become its nutrients, become a stepping stone for its march into the cosmos.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Helen nodded. She pointed towards the little metal box, asking, “Then what about this thing? Don’t tell me you only want me to keep it safe.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, that’s not it. When I meet Lanaxis this time, I do not know what the end result will be like. If I don’t come back and the apostles return to Dragon City, then you should just open the box and absorb it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will definitely be controlled by the perfect body. Are you not scared of the human race having another natural enemy?” Helen asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Morgan released a long sigh. He looked at Helen, and then slowly said, “If I don’t come back, then that means I wasn’t able to stop Lanaxis, nor could I destroy the apostles. Regardless of which result it is, it is still a disaster for the human race. That is why having another ultra life form won’t make a difference either. The modifications we carried out on you back then, even though there are many regrets, it at least increased your compatibility with the perfect body higher, and the amount of time your will can persevere is longer. Even if you become a completely new ultra life form in the end as well, it will still be equivalent to surviving through a different method. I hope that you can continue living, regardless of what type of method it is through.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she saw that Morgan got up to leave, Helen also stood up. She took a step forward, arriving before Morgan, staring at the general’s face covered in deep wrinkles. She suddenly reached out her arms, giving the old man a rather stiff hug, and then said, “Then… regardless, you still have to return, father…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Helen’s voice was still mechanical and without a trace of emotion, what she used was the word father and not the more endearing daddy, Morgan’s body suddenly went rigid, something seemingly about to come out from the corners of his eyes. He hugged Helen with even more clumsy and rigid movements, his speech a bit incoherent as he said, “Of course, of course!” Then, he walked out with large steps, as if he wanted to escape from this building that was too warm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only when she saw General Morgan’s figure depart into the distance, did Helen release a sigh for the first time. She turned towards the small metal box placed on the coffee table, her expression complicated.</span></p>
