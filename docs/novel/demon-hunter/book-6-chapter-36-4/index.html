 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Book 6 Chapter 36.4 - Previous Generations</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When facing the mechanical bug swarm of close to ten thousand, Snow’s complexion finally changed. Moreover, the mechanical bug swarm was no longer made up of a single foundation combat unit, but rather having more than ten several meter long miniature warships in its nuclear region. The warships’ functions were unknown, but Snow sensed a real threat as soon as they appeared. She suddenly increased her speed, her body disappearing with a flash like a fish in water, instantly throwing itself onto a miniature warship. The two blades easily entered the ship body, the high frequency vibrations added to them turning the internal components into an absolute mess. Snow destroyed six miniature warships in a single breath, but the remaining miniature warships obtained their chance because of this. Several gravitational fields surrounded Snow’s body one after another, the increased gravity making her speed slow down by an entire thirty percent. Meanwhile, the other miniature warships began to aim their main cannons, similarly equipped with high energy light beams, but the warship’s power was more than ten times greater than a foundation combat unit’s. A streak of light beam struck Snow’s body, even though most of the energy was scattered by her body’s sleek surface and concentrated scales, the energy that remained still increased the temperature greatly, moreover making Snow’s scales deform and rupture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Snow released a low roar of pain. Her body turned, quickly rushing at the remaining miniature warships, moreover completely disposing of them in a single breath’s time. Even with her speed decreased by thirty percent, Snow’s speed was still twice that of the foundation combat units, as well as three times greater than the miniature warships’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Continue the testing, double the numbers.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Extremely… troublesome!” When she saw the new wave of enemies, Snow’s face finally fell. She could still win, but she didn’t have confidence in stopping all of the flowing light and missiles, prevent them from damaging the private hospital. Snow instantly planned and prepared over a hundred methods of dealing with the enemy, and then with a low roar, her small body drew out a graceful arc, flying towards Dragon City’s surroundings. She directly made her way through the mechanical bug swarm, leaving behind a streak of flames behind her, one made from the burning remains of mechanical bugs. As expected, the bug swarm that flocked over turned around, pursuing Snow closely, gradually leaving the private hospital.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luring the enemy away from her territory, this was a simple plan, Snow thought complacently to herself, completely overlooking the small price she paid: she endured more than ten attacks, losing several scales and a bit of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another wave of bugs separated from the great army, viciously attacking the five floor building Morgan occupied. Within the sky shrouding flames of war, no one noticed that a few special mechanical bugs quietly collected the scales and blood Snow lost before quietly disappearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The specimen was quickly delivered to a hundred meter long medium-sized mothership. After undergoing a preliminary analysis, the mothership immediately separated from the large army, rushing towards the northern base at full speed. It accelerated up to 3000 kilometers per hour, able to return to Valhalla in under an hour of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Valhalla’s main control room, Fitzdurk and Serendela were both floating in the air, countless bands of data moving through their bodies. Only after Serendela completely recovered her apostle consciousness, did she obtain control over Valhalla, but it was just a small part. The two apostles didn’t stand opposite of each other, but rather at an angle. If where their line of sight intersected was the center, then the two apostles were two corners of a pentagon. Right now, the focal point of their attention was precisely the mothership that was flying back at full speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It seems like we found quite the interesting thing, perhaps it has some relationship to the inheritor of ruler’s magic, Brooks.” Fitzdurk’s voice was full of expectation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Perhaps, but the likelihood is only 1%. Regardless, any ultra life forms that appear on this planet have a chance of pointing us in the direction of our remaining companions. Apart from inheritor Brooks, we still need to find our brain, the thinker Haisva. The various signs all point towards the possibility that she will also appear on this planet. Once all of our past comrades are found, we then have a chance of breaking free from this place.” Serendela said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fitzdurk sighed. “1% possibility is already an unprecedented breakthrough, we can’t ask for any more. However, recently, I’ve been thinking, where exactly is Brooks, and what is he doing? When we landed in this world, he should be the first one to break through the will of the world and awaken, and then wake us, this is his duty after all. However…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Serendela said with a cold voice, “Brooks is definitely in this world. He left a mark on this planet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then… why is he…” Fitzdurk thought bitterly with his brows furrowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Perhaps it is just like how I was not too long ago, becoming one with the consciousness of this world, mistaking this world’s consciousness as his own instincts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Serendela was speaking, the lights and shadows in the control room suddenly underwent a transformation, Gusglav and the young light bringing knight’s figures flashed past. Then, right before her face, the two figures completely shattered and collapsed. Fitzdurk was momentarily speechless, he knew that what Serendela now destroyed was even the last bit of this world’s consciousness that remained within her, which also meant that everything she had experienced up to now become a thing of the past. At the very least, her awakening was now even more thorough than Fitzdurk’s, even though he had awakened earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fitzdurk muttered to himself, “Together with the sword bearer Madeline, all five of our comrades would be together. I truly never expected all of us would be gathered on this small planet, it truly is a miracle. However…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">en</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">, do we really only have five comrades?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Serendela raised her head, looking above the pentagon. Within a certain place up there, was an unseeable cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No…” She said, “There should be one more apostle… it is… Creator…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This short sentence, not only did Serendela’s words become slower the further she went, it also seemed to be more and more difficult. All of her body’s energy surged frantically towards a certain area of space, just these few seconds of effort completely sucking her energy dry, to the extent where it even endangered Valhalla’s operation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Enough!” Fitzdurk released a great roar, making Valhalla tremble. The spatial furnace instantly crossed the threshold of operation, the tremendous energy that poured out instantly sealing up the energy black hole within Serendela’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There is only the two of us here, don’t try to touch the sealed memories! This is a rule!” Fitzdurk roared at Serendela.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Creator, the sixth apostle, this was precisely the memory fragment Serendela almost paid the price of destroying her self for, reentering a state of deep sleep to obtain it from the depths of her memories.</span></p>
