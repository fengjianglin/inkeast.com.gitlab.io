 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Book 6 Chapter 35.1 - Covered In Dust</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the wilderness, two figures were currently tangled in battle like the wind, their speeds already fast to the extreme. Both of them exploited their environment to the limit. The tremendous impacts produced by instantaneous changes in direction could make the bones and muscles of any ability user under eight levels rupture and break, yet the two of them could make instantaneous turns several dozen times every second.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two figures rushed into an abandoned house like wind. This small house couldn’t stand the ravaging at all, collapsing with a loud noise. They rushed out from the dust again, but this time, they completely tangled about each other. After staggering a few steps, they both fell onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su released a long breath, forcefully pushing aside the opponent crushing down on his body, and then turned around to sit upright. His right hand was slowly extracted from the duplicated body, in it a vividly pulsating heart. The heart wasn’t large, but the pulsing was extremely powerful. Even though it was gouged out, it didn’t harm its vitality at all, as if it was going to jump out of Su’s hands. If it was thrown onto the ground, it might bounce high up like a tennis ball. For living creatures, this heart was pretty much the most important organ, but in Su’s duplicated body, it shouldn’t have appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because Su didn’t have a heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The external appearance of the duplicated body that was laying on the ground looked exactly the same as Su. It also had a ridiculously pretty face, light golden loose hair, and green eyes, even the expression similar, but that was all. The duplicated body didn’t have Su’s essence, a type of indifference that carried resoluteness. Moreover, it didn’t have Su’s right eye either. The copy’s right eye was completely a failed product, lacking even the slightest sight function.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The copy laid on the ground, long losing its life. The fatal wound wasn’t the injury on its chest, but rather the scorched black hole on its throat. The hole was deep to its skull, extending all the way into the back of its head, burning through the bones. The hole was almost completely spherical, the walls of the hole burnt until it crystallized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the battle, Su suddenly spat out a mouthful of flames, a stream of heat exceeding three thousand degrees in temperature, double the temperature of liquid steel, completely not something a biological composition could stop. The high temperature heat stream shot through the copy’s neck, instantly burning through the back of its head, killing it in one blow. Killing the duplicate was much easier than Su had expected, the reason why it was dragged on for so long, running all the way here, was still because he wanted to avoid Serendela and Gusglav. However, for some reason, those two actually didn’t follow him. As soon as Su noticed that he escaped to a safe enough distance, he immediately released ferocious attack against the duplicate that pursued him relentlessly, killing it in one move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire battle process lasted six seconds. Meanwhile, the difficult situation of fighting the duplicate Su anticipated was seventeen seconds long. The reason why the battle was so easy was because the copy’s degree of imitation didn’t even reach 50%, completely just an outer shell. Where Su was truly different from humans, for example, the energy conversion system in his chest cavity, tissues that absorbed energy crystals, they were not copied at all, let alone those Bisindle symbols hidden deep within the depths of his right eye. Until now, Su still didn’t know how the Bisindle language was stored in his right eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su stood up. He organized his messy clothes a bit, and then looked towards the distant prison. Apart from clouds and mountains, there was nothing there. There were no people, nor was there even a larger mutated creature. Su had a vague feeling that something happened where Serendela and Gusglav were, or else they wouldn’t give up such a good chance. Moreover, the poisoned Gusglav definitely couldn’t be saved, so this already established a grudge that was impossible to neutralize. A complete duplication was completely identical to the real body in every way, even the memories and nature the same. When the duplication was killed, it was equivalent to killing half a Gusglav.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this time, Su’s face suddenly froze. In his perception, an aura that was terrifying to the extreme stretched for a thousand miles, instantly landing on Prison Number One, and then disappeared with a flash. That aura was like a bottomless sea, lacking all techniques, just its terrifying size making Su couldn’t help but tremble. When that aura passed, another similarly giant icy-cold desolate aura also rushed into the sky, giving Su another familiar feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Serendela… did she finally become a complete apostle?” Su silently thought. After repeating this name a few times in his mind, he immediately became a bit speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su might not have known before, but now, he already understood the deep relationship between Serendela and Gusglav, the connection might not be less than his and Persephone’s. Moreover, she had clearly been trying to suppress her apostle instincts this entire time, not allowing them to replace the will of this world. This process was full of suffering,moreover extremely difficult. The reason for this persistence, was definitely Gusglav.</span></p>
