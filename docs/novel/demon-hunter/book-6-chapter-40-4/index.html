 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Book 6 Chapter 40.4 - Mutual Love</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The miniature biological weapons numbered in the tens of thousands, several dozen to a group, relying on high speed, explosiveness, and powerful firepower to instantly tear through the mechanical bug swarm’s defensive line, and then penetrate deeply within. When one looked down from above, it was as if several thousand arrows shot ferociously into the bug swarm, moreover still continuously entering. The mechanical bug swarm’s outer battle line was pulled extremely wide, and also became extremely fragmented, the basic combat units advancing in groups of a hundred and twenty. After breaking into the battle line, the agility type weapons’ tails began to release faint blue energy, speed increasing to up to five times the speed of sound. They each locked onto a target, screaming as they rushed at small-scale motherships and large-scale special combat units!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The damage the high-speed bone spurs inflicted was great, even if it was the several meters long small-scale motherships with powerful defensive strength, they still couldn’t resist the continuous bombardment of a group of biological weapons. Normally, after being hit tens of times, they would explode in the air, not even given the chance to gradually descend and carry out repair. Meanwhile, when the mechanical units began to gather, the biological weapons also began to suffer casualties. As long as the high energy light beams’ effects were strengthened, they would still inflict damage. Moreover, the high energy light beams were completely impossible to evade, they had to predict their trajectory and dodge ahead of time. That was why when the high energy light beams were concentrated enough, the agility type weapons’ casualties immediately increased exponentially. In the following minute of battle, they shot down at least three thousand small-scale motherships, but at the cost of over half of their members before the mechanical bug swarm’s three waves of attacks, their losses afterwards even greater. When the motherships exploded one after another or dropped while burning from the sky, the number of agility type creatures in charge of the assault also silently changed by an order of magnitude, decreasing from tens of thousands to less than ten thousand. Meanwhile, the final ten thousand biological weapons were still attacking at full speed, the biological weapons who shot all of the bone spurs within them decided they might as well fly forward at full speed, smash directly into surviving motherships!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, a nearly undetectable disorder appeared in the mechanical bug swarm’s outermost front. The motherships served as the main pillars to the entire intelligence network, the most important nodes for lower class networks, as well as the cornerstone of the highest level intelligence network. Large amounts of motherships crashed in an extremely short amount of time, causing chaos in the surrounding intelligence network, processing, analysis, and decision-making ability even more so directly dropping a few orders of magnitude. Meanwhile, at this time, due to the loss of large amounts of basic nodes, the upper levels of the bug swarm’s intelligence network also displayed sluggishness, temporarily unable to find any way to substitute so many nodes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The main brain already simulated and analyzed the mechanical intelligence networks’ weak points, these numerous small-scale motherships were the weakness of the entire network. That was why the first wave of attacks that were released targeted precisely these small-scale motherships. Reality proved the accuracy of the main brain’s decision, when the destruction of the nodes reached a critical threshold, the intelligence network immediately entered a state of chaos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this time, an extremely large biological reaction appeared in the outermost range of the scouting units’ detection. This was a giant beast that reached a hundred meters in length, its body flat, wings wide and long, sharp tail making one associate it with deep sea stingrays. This giant creature moved through the sky inconceivably fast, with a move of its wings, it already broke through the speed of sound, rushing into the chaotic mechanical bug swarm. Several hundred gaps opened up on its body, continuously releasing high frequency waves. The waves transmitted far out, instantly covering several square kilometers of space. All mechanical units within the region were immediately shaken up by the vibrations, and then the weakest combat units were actually shaken until they began to break apart! In that instant, it was unknown just how many mechanical units broke apart in the sky, parts falling off one after another like rain, for example, energy storage units, high energy light beam firing devices, driving engines, and other parts exploded while falling. As such, in the night sky, it was as if fireworks blossomed continuously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There wasn’t only a single stingray. A bit later, there were several dozen stingrays in the mechanical bug swarm’s range of scouting! This wave of attacks immediately delivered an extremely heavy blow to the mechanical bug swarm. From west to east, south to north, within a range of several hundred kilometers, the balls of flames in the sky were like interlinked stars of the sky, and when they fell, they were like the most splendid meteor shower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless biological weapons followed the stingrays into the mechanical bug swarm, starting an unrestrained massacre. These biological weapons’ species were as many as several hundred types, their attack methods also many and varied, moreover possessing overwhelming superiority in speed, defense, and flexibility, their coordination on a small-scale even more so faultless. The main brain’s control over the battlefield situation seemed nearly limitless, to the extent where it could even control the flight speed and angles of every single biological weapon. Meanwhile, comparatively speaking, the mechanical bug swarm’s intelligence network’s processing ability still couldn’t recover, yet it suffered another heavy blow from the stingrays. The smaller the number of mechanical units, the lower the intelligence level would become. Meanwhile, the main brain didn’t have this type of restriction at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the losses exceeded a million, the mechanical bugs felt danger as well, starting to condense their formation, retaliate with concentrated firepower. This move was effective, the biological weapons’ losses extremely great. The bug swarm contracted further, density of firepower increasing greatly, biological weapons starting to burn and fall in the web of flames one after another as a result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More than ten minutes later, the entire mechanical bug swarm already turned into a hedgehog-like ball of metal. Their losses already exceeded three million, while the biological weapons also lost over three hundred thousand members. When the density of firepower reached a certain threshold, small-scale biological weapons actually couldn’t rush through the web of firepower.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right when both sides couldn’t hold on anymore, and the balance of victory or defeat began to lean towards the mechanical bug swarm, a gust of wind suddenly swept through the night sky. The wind carried an eerie coldness, not only did the biological weapons in the sky tremble, even the mechanical bug swarm became sluggish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The coldness in the wind, how could it make the mechanical combat units who didn’t feel any fear tremble? This didn’t make any sense, yet it happened. On the northern continent several thousand kilometers out, Fitzdurk who had always been paying attention to the battle situation on this side released a low groan, a few of the over ten thousand data light bands connected to his body already snapped. Just now, an extremely powerful and strong consciousness directly rushed into Valhalla’s central control room through the data bands. Even though it was directly crushed under Fitzdurk and Serendela’s cooperation, it was already enough to leave the two apostles’ faces ashen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because they were apostles, and their opponent was only a single biological weapon. Even though the Stupas were completely different from the traditional meaning of biological weapons, they were still, in the end, a biological weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the border of the southern continent’s battlefield, a bit of radiance suddenly lit up. This bit of radiance was like stars at first, then quickly became bright moons, and then in the blink of an eye, already became blazing suns! The massive body that was hidden in the darkness was also faintly shining, as if there was a volcano burning within its body! Soon afterwards, a light beam crossed the southern continent’s northern shore! This was a high energy light beam similar to the mechanical units’ beams, even though the energy level was high, the results were similar. The only difference was that the mechanical units’ medium starship main cannons’ light beam was nothing more than a meter in thickness, while this pillar of light directly reached a hundred meters in diameter!</span></p>
