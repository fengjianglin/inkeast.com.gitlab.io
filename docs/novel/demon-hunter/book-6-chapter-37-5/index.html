 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Book 6 Chapter 37.5 - Eruption</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the curtain of night, the great sea’s waves rose and fell, full of unknown dangers. However, Su suddenly jumped, drawing out a graceful arc in the sky, and then entered the sea. He quickly moved in the water, speed gradually rising to over two hundred kilometers per hour. The ice-cold seawater gradually calmed Su’s mood, allowing him to silently think. Right now, Su already released all of his control, new thought centers quickly taking form, able to break through the information he obtained from the apostles soon. Su vaguely felt that this was an extremely crucial event.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had already been a long time since his instincts made any noise, this fact making Su feel uneasy. This perhaps proved that Su’s current evolution speed already satisfied his instincts, which was why they calmed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The southern continent’s sea was incredibly vast, but with Su’s speed, he would reach it soon. New thought centers were formed one after another, immediately speeding up the analysis of the apostles’ information. In Su’s consciousness, a deep space appeared. Light appeared in this void, shining on a construct similar to an altar in the center. The altar had five corners, every point corresponding to a rotating planet. Meanwhile, these planets each corresponded to an apostle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, after the acquired information overlaid with the original information, Su finally obtained the apostles’ fundamental structures, determining that there were at least five apostles. Everything Serendela and Fitzdurk were doing right now might be to search for the remaining three apostles. Right now, the clues of the remaining three apostles were already pointing at Dr. Rochester. He definitely had an extremely close relationship to the apostles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su moved underwater quickly. Meanwhile, a new sharp life form thus separated from his body. It was roughly half a meter in length, fine and sharp, accelerating through the water using a water jet method. It then jumped out from the sea, propulsion method changed to releasing air streams, speed suddenly increased to a thousand kilometers an hour, flying away in the blink of an eye. It continuously released a mysterious message, only after it traveled several thousand kilometers, reaching its destination at the end of the southern continent, would it exhaust the energy stored within its body and stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the southern continent’s dense rainforest, there were many biological weapons scattered throughout. Regardless of what type of biological weapon they were, they all behaved in roughly the same manner as ordinary mutated beasts. They wandered about, marked their territory, hunted, foraged, and then spent most of their time asleep, occasionally mating to produce a new small individual. Mating was merely for show, the biological weapons able to increase in number through cloning. Right now, they only increased their numbers in a moderate manner, and it was because their area of activity was currently expanding. After Su left the southern continent, he only brought some of the biological weapons with him, not giving the ones he left behind in the southern continent any orders. That was why the biological weapons made decisions based on their own intelligence, choosing to assimilate into their present ecology environment, maintain a set population size, and await further orders. For example, if they never received new orders, then in a few decades, these biological weapons would convert their genes into recessive ones, and thus, the southern continent would have a few new beast species.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The number of biological weapons Su brought with him to the northern continent was extremely small, and they were ultimately completely wiped out before the mechanical bug swarm. Before reaching the southern continent, he already transmitted his orders to the biological weapons scattered throughout the various regions. The biological weapons that received the information immediately changed behavior, revealing terrifying auras once more, starting to assemble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The foragers began to eat through the forest, a small portion of them starting to reproduce. A few hours later, new foragers would have already grown up, among them large amounts of foragers that ate minerals and rocks, even more of them ordinary foragers that collected energy. The new mid-level biological weapons, mother beasts, began production. They were like giant worms, but their mobility wasn’t too weak either, the anti-gravity organ in their abdomen areas allowing them to move through the air. Their giant stomachs would release more than ten young biological weapons every few minutes, these biological weapons able to grow up in less than half a day’s time. This batch of biological weapons were many and varied, but they completely relied on the foragers’ energy crystals as an energy source, all mid-level biological weapons with great combat strength. Every single mid-level biological weapon’s strength was equivalent to at least a hundred Herkula.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, the primitive Herkula were all currently assembling at one point, an unprecedented giant cocoon currently being nurtured there. The cocoon wriggled about, both ends opened. Herkula continuously jumped into the giant opening one after another, pulverized by thousands of teeth, and then after a complex and highly efficient digestion process, the excess waste products were released from the other end of the cocoon. In the upcoming war, Herkulas already couldn’t display much effects, because they had already been chosen to serve as food for higher level biological weapons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apart from Herkula and Leigna, there were foragers who continuously poured newly produced energy crystals into its giant mouth. Meanwhile, another type of biological weapon known as porters transferred all types of materials, from primitive ancient wood to rocks into the giant cocoon’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As it wriggled about, the giant cocoon grew at a visible speed. It was already five meters tall, more than ten meters long, but its growth still showed no sign of stopping. When one looked down from above, a vacant expanse appeared in the forest where the giant cocoon was, and it was still spreading. This wasn’t the only one, if one could see the entire southern continent, they would discover that there were mere many of these bald spots. They were all places where biological weapons gathered, the ground completely bare, almost all organic matter, even the organic matter in the soil was digested and absorbed by the foragers, converted into energy crystals one after another. The ground had long become like sand, almost all matter that could be used entering the foragers’ bellies, and then becoming corresponding materials to feed the giant cocoons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su set foot on the southern continent, the giant cocoon already grew to over fifty meters long, ten meters tall, and they were still going. Everything within fifty kilometers of its surroundings already completely disappeared, the hills also becoming bare, moreover continuously becoming shorter. The mountain peaks were full of holes, countless biological weapons currently crawling in and out of them. They reproduced while collecting resources in an unbridled manner. Apart from silicon that was available in the largest amounts, almost everything was a resource they needed. The biological weapons increased more and more in size, the great earth quickly becoming barren.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su wasn't aware of these things, most of his thought centers processing the information regarding apostles at full speed. The essential orders had already been transmitted, the remaining process would be completed automatically, based on the judgment of the biological weapons with high intelligence, there was no need for Su to interfere at all. Even the lowest level Herkula had intelligence not inferior to a mature human’s. If Su could see the changes that were happening to this continent, perhaps he would reconsider his decision to fully activate the biological army, but right now, Su didn’t have too much leeway in his choices.</span></p>
