 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Book 6 Chapter 31.1 - Unknown</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">War often erupted from the most insignificant things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like in the internal struggle of the Blood Parliament, the trigger was nothing more than a small matter, yet the implications were widespread, eventually even the three great influential families involved. This territory that was starting to show signs of prospering after developing for more than a decade was once again burned down to ruins by the flames of war, even a small half of Dragon City destroyed. Many facilities that were vital to the survival of ordinary people were also ravaged by flames, for example, the food factories, nuclear power plant, conventional power station, as well as various metal refining factories and other things. While they engaged in internal strife, foreign enemies were also looking for opportunities to invade. Only, the Holy Crusaders who used to be the Blood Parliament’s greatest enemy, for some reason, suddenly collapsed, and that was why the northern front was still intact. However, the Scorpions of Disasters’ crazy attacks still made the Blood Parliament shed quite a bit of blood, the one who suffered greatest being the Arthur Family. If it wasn’t for O’Brien’s powerful return and Eileen’s sudden turncoat, the Arthur Family might have been completely destroyed under this war. Even though the Scorpions of Disaster suddenly aimed their sights westward when the situation was most dire, the Arthur Family’s state still didn’t improve. In the following battles, the Arthur Family became the empress’ side’s sole tower of strength, enduring the attacks of almost the entire Blood Parliament. If it wasn’t for O’Brien’s stunning display, the Arthur Family would have long been wiped from history.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, the chairman side’s cornerstone of strength, William Family’s current state wasn’t all that much better off either. It could be said that more than half of O’Brien’s glorious battle accomplishments were established on the blood and corpses of William Family’s soldiers. Compared to O’Brien, Rudolph seemed much more steady and conservative, but in this war, steady and earnest were words that long carried negative connotations. After this turning point, with Gardner forced back in defeat once again, Rudolph could no longer bear the heavy casualties, and as such had no choice but to lead the remaining soldiers from the family in retreat. What this meant first of all, was that they could no longer bear the blood loss, while this wasn’t necessarily true for the Arthur Family. For this war, this was already a turning point, but this didn’t mean that this would forever remain the case.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truly high level figures all understood clearly that what would decide the war wasn’t the army, the ordinary, or even high level ability users’ battles, but rather the battle between the few most powerful humans at the very peak. These names included Lanaxis, Bevulas, as well as Josh Morgan; as long as they didn’t join in yet, then the war wouldn’t end. Perhaps, in the eyes of those few, this list of names now included Su.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Blood Parliament’s internal strife didn’t last for that long, yet for ordinary people, the destruction it brought might even be greater than the olden era’s world war. Nearly half of the Blood Parliament’s population of several million were wiped out, this rate was an absolute calamity for any biological community. Even with the human race’s maturation cycle sped up substantially and the birth period greatly reduced, it still wasn’t enough to recover their numbers in a short amount of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">War, had another side to it as well. The olden era’s war resulted in a redistribution of resources, and it was also the driving force behind the rapid advancement in science and technology. Meanwhile, during the Blood Parliament’s civil war, more and more ability users emerged, their levels also rising rapidly. Now, if one were to look at it from a perspective of number of high level ability users, the number in the Blood Parliament was only higher, not lower. There were some who speculated that this was precisely what the Spider Empress needed, as she always believed that ability users were the true pillars of the new era. Bevulas always wished to restore the order of the olden era, restore an age of equality between men. However, if his ideal were to be implemented, he could only rely on ability users to deal with other ability users. Meanwhile, he himself, only by relying on the complete body’s power, would he be able to face the Spider Empress, because she also had a complete body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">War destroyed the old world, but it built a new world on its ruins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the northwest wilderness, more than ten people arranged themselves in a long line, currently moving swiftly and silently. Even though their numbers weren’t great, their destructive power wasn’t any less than an olden era heavy armed force. Apart from a few Combat Domain soldiers and a Mental Domain sniper, the others were all magic ability users with at least five levels of ability. O’Brien and Eileen were also surprisingly in this group! O’Brien walked at the very front of the troop, his perception long extending far into the distance to its limit. The outline of a small town appeared at the limits of his line of sight, half of this place in ruins, looking like there were no signs of human life. However, O’Brien knew that this wasn’t the case, as this small town was an important supply hub for the chairman’s army, as well as the core of the enemy’s new line of defense after they withdrew. Even though his injuries hadn’t healed yet, he still brought the main force of his family’s troops with him, preparing to seize this important location in one swoop, prevent the chairman’s army from recovering their strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">O’Brien knew that this small town definitely guarded some secrets, which was why they stopped when they were still a few kilometers out. They had a Perception Domain ability user go first to scout things out, while everyone else remained in place to get some rest. His target were the supplies in the small town, and not to wipe out the enemy’s ability users, and as such, he wasn’t scared of the other side knowing his intention to attack. If he could make the defenders panic or waver, then it was already more than he could ask for.</span></p>
