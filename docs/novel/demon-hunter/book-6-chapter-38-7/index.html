 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Book 6 Chapter 38.7 - Embrace</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The clouds of radiation in the extreme north’s skies weren’t as thick and steady as before, but were rather becoming berserk and chaotic. The giant Valhalla moved through the depths of the clouds of radiation like a fish swimming in water, quiet and stealthy, but its extreme speed still dragged out a long tail behind it, making the clouds of radiation scatter and break apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inside the spaceship’s central control room, the atmosphere was heavy. Fitzdurk’s attention was completely concentrated on operating Valhalla, almost no brainpower to spare for the remaining mechanical bug swarm, the mechanical bug swarm already practically in completely free states. The clouds of radiation surrounding this planet were an extremely bizarre thing, if one was surrounded by them, perception would be greatly weakened and restricted, so if Fitzdurk wanted to control the mechanical bug swarm in the surroundings, he would need to use at least five times the energy. Meanwhile, right now, such great expenditure might very well lead to huge losses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Serendela similarly floated in the air, linking up with Valhalla through countless data light bands. She continuously scanned the surrounding vast region, guiding Valhalla forward. In Serendela’s perception, streaks of powerful perception waves were currently moving about in the clouds of radiation, searching for something. These perception beams’ core region was as long as tens of kilometers, the remaining fluctuations even more so spreading a hundred kilometers out. Even with Valhalla’s flexibility and high speed, evading such terrifying perception scanning was still an extremely strenuous task.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Valhalla moved &nbsp;between the perception beams skillfully, often avoiding the perception beam’s scanning by a hair’s breadth. Within the clouds of radiation, even through the help of Valhalla’s amplification, Fitzdurk’s perception still didn’t exceed one hundred kilometers, while Serendela’s could reach three hundred to even five hundred kilometers. However, once it exceeded three hundred kilometers, then there was the danger of her perception coming into contact with the perception beams chasing after them. Once their perception intersected, then it might result in a spiritual battle state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was hard to imagine that in this type of primitive planet that lagged behind in technology, the Starship Valhalla that had taken the apostles through the endless cosmos was forced to such a sorry fleeing state. If one didn’t see it for themselves, probably no one would believe that the interstellar level Valhalla carrying two apostles would be running, moreover without even the slightest strength to retaliate. Even Serendela and Fitzdurk didn’t believe this, but this really was what happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The temperature already dropped below freezing point. The apostles also felt a deep feeling of humiliation, apart from frantically evading, they didn’t have any other thoughts. The terrifying woman warping and weaving about making them instinctively feel great fear, unable to produce any thoughts of resistance. That type of shaking from the depths of their souls made them recall the source of fear sealed within the void’s depths. Those were sealed memories, as well as the beginning to the entire story, even more so the origin of terror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Doomsday Storm that woman released not only destroyed an interstellar warship, it also instantly wiped out a ten million sized mechanical bug swarm. This was a planetary level destructive power, something that originally shouldn’t have appeared on a creature on this planet, yet it did. Moreover, forget about everything else, just that woman’s current size that was comparable to Valhalla was not something that should’ve appeared on this planet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter how humiliated they felt, before the streaks of powerful perception beams, all of it would vanish like smoke into thin air. In terms of intensity, they didn’t seem that much weaker than Serendela’s; one had to understand that Serendela was but an apostle who specialized in scouting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Valhalla made a few turns, already rushing out several dozen kilometers. It was about to change directions again, but it suddenly stopped! Several fine white-colored threads shot out from the clouds of radiation, landing on Valhalla’s body. The wisps were even finer than pencils in width, before Valhalla’s massive ship body’s contrast, it was completely negligible, but once it was infected by them, the massive starship was unexpectedly forcibly stopped! The tremendous vibration made Valhalla shake, the data light bands in the central control room suddenly increasing several times, almost completely wrapping Serendela and Fitzdurk within. Countless signals of emergency and damage were transmitted to the two apostles’ brains, instantly exceeding the limits of what they could process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spatial furnace trembled and roared, the powerful surging energy pushing Valhalla forward. The threads were instantly pulled taut, releasing sharp screeching noises, one of them even more so directly snapping! However, after the thread snapped, it immediately turned into fragmented energy, scattering in the air. They weren’t tangible spider threads, but rather fine threads condensed from pure energy, yet this was precisely why it could latch firmly onto the energy protective screen surrounding Valhalla’s surface, and also strengthen itself by absorbing the protective screen’s energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, after the spider thread broke apart, over a hundred new spider threads descended from the clouds of radiation, firmly binding Valhalla in place. Now, regardless of how Valhalla trembled, it couldn’t struggle free from the spider threads’ restrictions. The clouds of radiation above suddenly rushed in all directions, and then the Spider Empress’ massive body appeared from the clouds of radiation, throwing herself onto Valhalla’s body while carrying unstoppable vicious winds. Her eight black and red limbs fastened down firmly, holding Valhalla in place. From the distance, the limbs still looked as if they were made of a rock material, but in reality, it already wasn’t rock, because no rock possessed the rigidity to tear open Valhalla’s body, not even the slightest bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Spider Empress’ massive spider body was almost half the length of Valhalla, however, if they were comparing bulk, the slender and long starship definitely couldn’t compare to the empress’ spider body. A massive body signified inconceivable power, and also that this body structure officially exceeded the living creatures of this planet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Due to the body being too large, the eight spider legs’ pointed ends were actually not sharp, but under such massive bulk, hardness became the most important attribute. The damage on Starship Valhalla’s body, instead of saying it was cut open, it was better to say that it was forcibly pressed open. Even though only a bit of power was used to press it open, for Valhalla who was capable of interstellar travel, a creature damaging its outer shell was inconceivable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though her body was massive, Lanaxis’ appearance was still as beautiful as in the past, her face that was calculated in hundreds of meters extremely fine, not inferior to that of her past human self. It wasn’t just her appearance, even her entire upper body was flawless, her skin fine like ice, her upright and perky peaks’ tips a faint pink. This was a temptation that couldn’t be any greater, but when her upper body already reached several hundred meters, there were pretty much no humans who would have any sexual delusions towards her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she saw that even though Valhalla was firmly held in place by her limbs, it still frantically struggled, a faint smile of mockery appeared at the corners of Lanaxis’ lips. Even more energy threads shot out from the spider body, tangling about Valhalla. The energy swirling about Valhalla’s body immediately grew dim, a sea of energy absorbed into the spider body through the energy strands, while Valhalla’s vibration and struggling power decreased a bit. Lanaxis’ upper body leaned forward, spitting out a streak of faint white light from her mouth onto Valhalla. Wherever the energy radiance landed on, the ship body would immediately produce ripples, and then gradually warp and deform, as if the metal completely became soft. Meanwhile, the surrounding scenery also began to distort, a phenomenon that would only appear under extreme temperature. The Spider Empress released a cold laugh, raised her right hand high into the air, and then stabbed it down, inserting it deeply into Valhalla’s body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When this attack struck down, a larger half of Spider Empress’ arm entered Starship Valhalla’s body, almost completely penetrating it! However, right when she prepared to tear at the starship horizontally, completely rip off the bow of the warship, her expression changed. After releasing a cry of pain, she then withdrew her hand. On that white jade-like arm, countless injuries of varying sizes could be seen, the smaller wounds only half a meter long, nothing more than small red specks on her current arm, but the large ones were more than ten meters long, two or three meters deep, completely terrifying flesh ravines. Meanwhile, the Spider Empress’ pinkie was even more so cut off at the base!</span></p>
