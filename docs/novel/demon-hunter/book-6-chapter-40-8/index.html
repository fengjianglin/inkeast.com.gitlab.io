 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Book 6 Chapter 40.8 - Mutual Love</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood poured out like a fountain from the bottom of the priest’s feet. When the scorching hot blood droplets landed on the ground, it would turn into a ball of flames, disappearing without a trace after recklessly combusting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under world-shaking rumbling sounds, Alphonse finally landed heavily on the ground! Loud noises were released from the inside of its massive body, continuously breaking down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The priest released a long breath, his expression becoming quite a bit more relaxed. However, when he looked into Alphonse’s eyes that were full of suffering, his own eyes were laden with grief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There is only Bierlus left…” The priest thought. He knew that Little White could deal with Quque, even though the price for doing so wasn’t light. The price Little White had to pay, was its own life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The priest sensed the power his left hand bore; it was heavy, but it could still be endured. His left hand was holding Bierlus, the Stupa’s struggle continuously exhausting the priest’s already lacking body tissues. However, the priest’s right hand was already freed up, so the battle was going to end soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, for some reason, the priest suddenly sighed with sorrow inside, looking around himself. Wherever his eyes passed, there was only destruction, not only the scorched earth that had been ravaged, but even the skies were completely white. There were no mechanical bug swarms to be seen, no biological weapons. The former mechanical army and terrifying biological army all silently collapsed under the energy blastwaves. This was a molecular level disintegration, there was no hope of restoration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The aftermath of the priest’s battle with the Stupas already created irreversible harm to the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within a range of tens of kilometers at the very center of the battlefield, the ground was no longer scorched earth, but rather already completely crystallized. This type of earth that carried crystal granules didn’t have any chance of producing life. This several thousand square kilometer region already became a land of death. Even if the human race reoccupied this planet in the future, without several decades of time for slow reformation, there was no way of bringing vitality back to this land. The crystallized earth was not only burned by high temperature, but also completely ignited by force fields, moreover, all of the energy was extracted. That was why all the way until several hundred meters underground, there wasn’t any life, not even bacteria able to exist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just a controlled battle already delivered such damage to this world. Even if one looked at it from the entire planet’s perspective, this was still a scar that couldn’t be overlooked. What if they fought without any reservations?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While feeling this mysterious sense of sorrow, the priest suddenly saw someone from the corner of his eyes, someone who was currently walking over while treading on the scorched earth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The crystallization of the great earth was still continuing, because the battle between the priest and Bierlus had just reached its climax. The energy that spilled out was fatal to all creatures, so how could there be someone who could walk through this domain of death, moreover in such an easygoing manner?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the priest’s eyes landed on this person, everything before his eyes immediately became blurry, only a resplendent green eye remaining, this eye like the purest piece of jadeite. That was a right eye, the priest thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immediately afterwards, the priest suddenly became clear-headed! He never expected himself to actually lose himself. As the creator, how could he lose himself? However, that bottomless right eye was like an abyss, one that he couldn’t help but fall into.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The priest didn’t have time to think, immediately retracting the energy around Bierlus, moreover fully igniting all of his tissues! His hair stood on end one after another. The appearance of this person already forced him to burn the last of his life force!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That person calmly walked over from the distance, but his speed was gradually increasing. Meanwhile, the moment he arrived before the priest, was the moment the priest burned the most powerfully. On the other side, that head of short light golden hair was also burning, as if it was the purest flame. Meanwhile, the green right eye seemed to have dyed this entire world in a layer of jade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When all of his potential was completely burned as well, the priest finally saw the face of the person from the distance. That was Su, as well as the owner of the three Stupas. However, who was Su? Why was he able to silently seize three Stupas from his control?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This question didn’t have an answer, because Su already began to run!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su’s speed gradually increased, the last ten kilometers crossed with a single step! Two giant blades had unknowingly when appeared in his hands, identical to the heavy swords Madeline was most fond of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su’s attacks were extremely simple, directly hacking or piercing forward with the blades. His movements were also simple to the extreme, suited to directly rushing into the priest’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, what made all the difference was speed and energy. Su was like a fiery comet that was burning with the utmost ferocity, instantly reaching inconceivable speed, brushing past the priest!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su’s body appeared ten kilometers out, the heavy swords in his hands already melted down to only a sword hilt left, large amounts of crystallization also taking place on his perfect human body. Su’s left hand was gripping a burning hot heart, this heart still throbbing unwillingly. Meanwhile, behind Su, the priest lowered his head, looking at the giant hole in his chest, in a bit of disbelief. A moment later, he finally revealed a look of relief. His body quickly returned to the size of an ordinary human, and then he fell on his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">White’s miserable scream sounded from the skies. It tore through Quque’s abdomen, rushing out from within. White was already riddled with injuries, several miniature Stupas still hanging from its body. It disregarded everything, wishing to arrive at the priest’s side, but Quque seized the opportunity, inhaling deeply, sucking it back into its belly. White roared unwillingly, its final roar echoing through the world. After being sucked into Quque’s body, White never appeared again. During the forceful breakthrough process, it suffered too many injuries, to the extent where the battle situation could no longer be reversed. Meanwhile, the most White could do, was drag down Quque to death with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su gradually turned around, walked over to the priest’s side, and then slowly squatted down. He looked at this man who he had never seen before, yet also seemed to have been acquainted with through countless eras.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The priest struggled to release a laugh, and then said, “This battle… really was short.”</span></p>
