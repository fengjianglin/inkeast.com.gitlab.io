 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the range of his Panoramic View, scouting bugs quietly floated, moving about slowly. Their detection ranges overlapped each other, interweaving into a large web. One could well imagine just how many scouting bugs were floating outside of Su’s range of perception. A large web monitoring everything had long spread, covering the entire northern continent, perhaps the sea included as well. Moreover, this web was still continuously spreading. When he thought about how he was living under this type of invisible web of surveillance, Su sensed a vague feeling of constraint and annoyance. He thought for a bit, and then casually picked up a few rocks from the ground. With a crush of his fingers, under the tremendous pressure and instantaneous heat’s effects, they were turned into perfectly shaped bullets. With a flick of his finger, a few bullets that were still burning instantly flew into the distance, leaving behind&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">pi pi pa pa</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;sounds in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several specks of fiery light flickered in the distant skies, the result of those scouting bugs’ destruction and burning. Several stone bullets flew several hundred to several thousand meters, destroying all of the scouting bugs within a range of ten kilometers. Su’s body structure was already completely different from that of an ordinary human’s, so the power of the stone bullet was already comparable to that of an anti-aircraft machine gun, yet it was much more accurate. The scouting bugs differed somewhat, but they were all around the size of a pigeon. Forget about an anti-aircraft machine gun, even if a sniper rifle wanted to blast a scouting bug out of the air from several hundred meters away, it was still an almost impossible task.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After destroying more than ten scouting bugs, that formless great web immediately had a large hole of over ten kilometers in diameter. Su originally anticipated that there would be large amounts of bugs that would hurry over, perfect for him to see what other types there were, if the results were just as his analysis deduced. However, after waiting close to an entire day of time, no new mechanical bug swarms came.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Su was feeling confusion, Fitzdurk also frowned. Above the holographic map, the areas covered by the scouting bugs was lit up, but right now, there were large areas of black, many seemingly still enlarging. The Blood Parliament was like a surging black tide, not only did the range not decrease under the mechanical bug swarms’ attacks, the areas of black were instead widening, roughly doubling its size. By comparison, the small area Su produced couldn’t be considered major at all, not drawing that much of Fitzdurk’s attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apart from the Blood Parliament, there were a few other black spots that were quickly growing, drawing Fitzdurk’s attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Great Lakes Western Region, there was a continuous mountain range. At the summit of a mountain peak, a young girl who wasn’t that old made her way out from a pile of rubble. Her appearance was extremely sweet, to the extent where it was bewitchingly so, her long dark maroon hair falling like a waterfall. The young girl had a large pair of eyes, but they weren’t all that quick, instead appearing extremely strange. She stood at the top of the mountain, when she gazed into the sky, several pupils unexpectedly appeared in the depths of her eyes! In this young girls’ eyes, a scouting bug was perfectly reflected. The clouds of radiation weren’t that high, the lower parts almost brushing the mountain summit, which was why the scouting bugs didn’t fly all that high. It moved in a carefree manner, slowly shifting towards the mountain peak’s side. When it was about to reach the mountain peak, it felt as if its scouting field of vision was somewhat obstructed, and as a result, a small engine on the side of its body was started up, releasing a stream of air, from the looks of it wishing to make a detour around the mountain. At this time, the little girl suddenly leapt out from the mountain rocks, her bare soles unexpectedly leaving behind a small footprint in the sturdy mountain rock! Her movements were fast like lightning, a single leap taking her several tens of meters, already bringing her a few meters away from the scouting bug. Then, her small mouth opened, spraying out a fine, silk--like, transparent thread! The thread instantly firmly wrapped up the scouting bug, and then with a forceful constriction, it unexpectedly directly chopped the scouting bug into several dozen pieces! After dicing up the scouting bug, the girl began to fall. Then, the clothes on her body flew up, revealing her snow-white, exquisit waist, one able to see that there were actually two crystals embedded in her lower back that currently released a yellow light. Under the effects of the two crystals, the little girl was moved by an anti-gravity force field, slowly flying towards the mountain peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as she stood stably, a strong gust of mountain wind blew over, raising up her clothes, a piece of paper flying out from her pocket. She immediately cried out in alarm, jumped out, even when she gripped this sheet of paper in her hands again, her face was still full of alarm, fearing that she would lose it. She carefully examined it, and after making sure that it wasn’t damaged, only then did she carefully return it to her pockets, even using her small hand to press it a few times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was a photograph, the photograph of a flame-like woman. Regardless of whether it was her short maroon hair or the long blade she dragged, they both left an unforgettable impression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After properly putting away the photograph, only then did the little girl release a long sigh. Her eyes lit up again, staring at another scouting bug several kilometers out, thus rushing to another peak. When she ran, her four limbs all touched the ground like a leopard, her speed extremely fast. Soon afterwards, she already reached the other mountain peak, hiding herself, quietly waiting for that scouting bug to come over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This, was Little Luo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, in the extreme north’s snowy mountain forest, a small irregular beast was also running at full speed. Its speed was fast to the point of defying general knowledge, unexpectedly moving at a speed of close to three-hundred kilometers per hour even though it was moving across extremely complex terrain! Aside from short distance jumps, it was pretty much completely running on the ground. The areas where its six-jointed limbs landed were incredibly precise, from time to time erupting with inconceivable power, propelling its small body forward with extreme speed like this. It raised its head, complex eyes long locking onto a scouting bug flying several hundred meters in the sky. Right when it reached just below the scouting bug, it immediately raised its head, opened its large mouth, and then sprayed out a streak of energy beam that was fine like a strand of hair! This energy beam that was only a dozen or so centimeters long contained many extremely fine and sturdy granules, instantly blasting through the scouting bug’s body, and then the scouting bug underwent a strong explosion, not having the time to transmit any data or intelligence back at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After destroying a scouting bug, it didn’t stop at all, chose another direction, and then ran quickly again. Ten kilometers in this direction, another scouting bug was currently floating in the sky. As such, in Fitzdurk’s map, a black line was currently extending.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As scouting bugs exploded one after another in the sky, the little fella suddenly felt a bit of regret. It somewhat missed its mother, also wanting a name.</span></p>
