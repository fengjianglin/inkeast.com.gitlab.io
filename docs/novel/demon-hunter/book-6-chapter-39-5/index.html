 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Book 6 Chapter 39.5 - Silent</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rochester flew up, a dividing wall opening before him. After recovering his body, he automatically obtained a portion of control over Valhalla. Valhalla belonged to the apostles, Fitzdurk was the controller, but not the owner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He directly flew out of the ship, stood in front of Madeline’s body, gave her a look, and then sighed, sitting down at her side. Rochester produced a box of cigarettes from who knows where, lit one, and then after taking a deep breath, said, “I can tell that you just awakened, this matter is definitely extremely hard to accept, right? Back then, I was also like this. Even now, the decades of life experience before the war are still fresh in my mind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Madeline coldly said, “Your will of this world is extremely strong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“And what is so strange about that?” Rochester laughed, with the distinctive wisdom and calmness of an elder, saying, “Retaining the will of the world isn’t completely a bad thing, it all depends on how you treat it. Even if it is only a dream, a dream that has lasted for several decades has already become a part of our life experiences, so there is no need to forcibly erase it. Our lives have no end, several decades of time passing in an instant. When a few centuries, or more than a millennium pass, the things that we cannot let go of right now will gradually fade from our memories. At that time, it really will be just a dream.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Madeline suddenly reached her hand towards Rochester, saying, “Give me one.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rochester laughed, removed a cigarette from the box, and then handed it to Madeline, Madeline frowned, carefully examined the cigarette, and only then did her fine fingers hold it, placing it into her mouth, and then she attempted to take a breath. The moment the cigarette entered her mouth, it was automatically lit. The young lady breathed slowly and carefully, and also for a long time. After a single breath, half the cigarette was already missing. Her lips pursed slightly, sending the strands of smoke out. Her brows furrowed tightly, and then she said, “What is so attractive about this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rochester chuckled and said, “For your current self, of course there is no point of attraction. Our perception is extremely sharp, analysis ability also extremely great. Smoking, for us, lacks all meaning. It is just the result of some of the most basic chemical combinations, so there is no way it can affect us at all, only having some use for basic humans. The reason why I smoke right now isn’t because I need it to satisfy a craving, but only because it is a type of memory and reminiscing, cherishing the feeling of smoking before my instincts awakened.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Madeline nodded in half-understanding, not throwing this half cigarette out, but rather finishing it completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“One must learn to forget, especially things that are destined to leave us. Otherwise, in the future, there will be endless vexation and suffering. However, this isn’t easy, which is why you don’t need to force yourself for now either. Even for me, there are too many I still cannot let go. We still have time, you can slowly think things through.” Rochester said, and then stood up, walking towards the starship. After taking a few steps, he turned around and said, “I forgot to remind you, under certain conditions, your instincts will make decisions in your place. You have to make some preparations, after all, our instincts are our true selves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Madeline sat there like a sculpture, not moving. Then, she suddenly asked, “What is our purpose and meaning for existence?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This problem made Rochester’s steps stop momentarily. He remained quiet for a moment, and then said with a bitter smile, “I really do not wish to reply to this question… however, I have to say that we are apostles, so our existence, it doesn’t have any meaning or purpose.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No meaning or purpose?” Madeline was stupefied. This was an answer that completely exceeded her expectations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Correct. Not even existence itself, is our purpose.” Rochester replied with a grave tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After leaving Madeline behind alone to think to herself, Rochester arrived at the central control room, and then said, “Start up all of the spatial furnaces, produce the mechanical army at full speed. We might soon have to face the creator’s biological army, perhaps Su’s as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Su?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rochester nodded. “Correct, Su also has the ability to manufacture biological weapons, moreover standardized biological weapons.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fitzdurk finally seemed to have learned his lesson, not saying the words ‘the creations of primitive humans’, but he immediately realized the main points of Rochester’s words, his expression couldn’t help but change as a result. “Standardized weapons?! If that really is the case, then making the mechanical army now is already too late! My mechanical army’s speed of expansion and replenishment has no way of matching standardized weapons!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I know, which is why we need to find a way to draw their biological weapons out for a decisive battle before they fully form. As for the Spider Empress’ side, we will avoid it for now.” Rochester said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But the Spider Empress gives me more fear, she carries a type of aura we’ve always wished to avoid.” Fitzdurk said with a frown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rochester shook his head, saying, “Before Madeline thinks things through, we need to avoid battles against powerful ultra life forms like the Spider Empress. Pass on all of the battle materials from last time to me, a planet wouldn’t produce ultra life forms for no reason. I want to see if I can find any clues from within. Apart from this, send all of the remaining mechanical units out, continue to purge this planet, this will force out the creator.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Valhalla made a graceful turn in the air, flying north. In the continuous seacoast mountain range, Fitzdurk had long buried two spatial furnaces. The mountain belly had been emptied for quite some time already, a new ten million sized mechanical army formed within, waiting for Valhalla’s instructions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, when Valhalla turned around, Madeline’s eyes flashed, but the two weak sparks quickly faded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A day later, the entire continent shook. The center of the western sea mountain range split open, countless mechanical combat units rushed into the sky from the earth, covering everything. After the new mechanical army assembled, they were like an enormous dark cloud, slowly throwing themselves towards the flourishing southern continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the mountains split open, the powerful individuals of the continent all sensed something, looking in Valhalla’s direction. What they cared about wasn’t the rumbling earthquake, but rather the even more frightening spatial instability. Just now, Valhalla released the third spatial furnace, so now, together with the spatial furnace inside the starship, this planet already had four spatial furnaces simultaneously operating. The third spatial furnace didn’t only signify a 50% increase in the mechanical army production, it also signified that the extraction of spatial energy already exceeded the limits of what this planet could handle. As long as the fourth spatial furnace’s full operation exceeded a certain degree, space had a chance of collapsing, and then a miniature black hole would be produced on the surface of the planet. Even if this type of black hole only existed for a few minutes, it would lead to devastating destruction to the planet’s life system.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Valhalla dealt with planetary level civilizations in the past, they had previously used four spatial furnaces, completely wiping out that civilization, this was the method the apostles often used for civilizations that didn’t have much recycling value. The spatial furnaces were an endless source of energy, at the same time a planetary level tactical weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The instant all four spatial furnaces were started up, all powerful creatures knew that there wasn’t much time left for them. This wasn’t only the case for powerful individuals, even a few ordinary people sensed something.</span></p>
