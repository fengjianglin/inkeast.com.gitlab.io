 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Book 6 Chapter 37.6 - Eruption</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Rochester really was an apostle, then he was the first of the apostles to awaken. Even though Su didn’t know what he did for the few decades after war erupted, he definitely didn’t idle his time away. Sun Empire, for an ultra life form like the apostle, was a complete joke, it could only be a tool to hide Rochester’s true goal. As the father of abilities, Rochest’s understanding towards abilities and evolution definitely far exceeded that of Serendela and Fitzdurk, the characters similar to the Bisindle divine language he saw within the temple even more so making Su feel doubt. The energy and knowledge released by those mysterious symbols were basically the reason why Su was able to evolve to this day. Even now, he still knew absolutely nothing about the Bisindle divine language’s origins or creation. Meanwhile, Rochester clearly already started his research on this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When faced with this type of enemy, Su didn’t know what would happen either, the danger perhaps even greater than that of when he faced Serendela and Fitzdurk. Meanwhile, right now, Su was almost completely helpless before the mechanical bug swarm, but if he threw himself straight into the apostles’ nest, facing two apostles was equivalent to seeking death. In the last battle, just one Serendela alone forced Su to quickly retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unless… Su activated more of the Bisindle symbols, completely evolving, abandoning his human exterior. As a primitive life form in the cosmos, the human race, forget about their internal composition, just their external form was completely unsuitable for adaptation to the interstellar focused new era. That was why Su chose a substitution plan, using a sea of powerful biological weapons to face Rochester. No one knew what Rochester was hiding under Sun God Temple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su began to run, his speed growing faster and faster, directly charging towards Great Sun God Temple Rochester resided in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Outside the great clouds of radiation, the sun rose and fell. On the seventh morning, Su was already standing at the peak of the snowy mountain, looking at the Great Sun God Temple at the summit. If it wasn’t because of his first death, Su might not have stepped foot into the southern continent until now. After the war, the number of regions humans could step on was already extremely limited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Great Sun God Palace wasn’t much different from the last time he saw it, just the outside having some slight changes made. The terrace was remodeled, now larger than before, able to receive mid-level aircrafts. The exits on the mountain’s belly had also been extended. It was currently sunrise, as well as an important time for Sun God Temple’s sacrificial ceremonies. A raging flame had long been lit at the top of the altar, several officiants leading hundreds of monks in praise and prayer. The officiants surrounded the altar, jumping about, carrying out a strange dance. Under Su’s observation, their dance movements changed somewhat, but the efficacy of energy that was activated was also increased somewhat. This type of religious ceremony was something that shouldn’t change for decades, but in the short time Su left the southern continent for, Sun God Religion’s ceremonies already changed. This meant that Dr. Rochester made some progress in his research, if he was given another few decades of time, perhaps he really would change the world once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su leapt out, his body unfolding in the sky, flying past two mountain peaks like an eagle, and then descending on Great Sun God Temple’s summit. Su walked towards the underground tunnel with large steps, moreover, not deliberately covering up his traces. As soon as he appeared at the top of the palace, the bodies of the officiants that were in charge of the ceremonies trembled, all of them looking in this direction at the same time. Su’s eyebrows also frowned. The moment he descended, he felt as if he had entered a quagmire, a strange and cryptic force field winding about his body, making every movement feel as if he was burdened by several hundred tons of lead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The officiants produced a magical staff from the altar, brandishing it as they rushed over. The magical staff was made of metal, one end already burned very red, yet the officiants didn’t seem to feel the heat at all while holding it in their hands. They brandished the magical staff, smashing it down on Su’s head! The force field that restricted Su’s movements didn’t affect these officiants at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This type of extremely primitive attack didn’t pose any threat to Su. What provided the force field with energy were precisely the monks that were still praying, three hundred of them in total, so it was as if Su was facing three hundred monks in a contest of strength at the same time. In reality, the officiants all had around six levels of Combat Domain ability, members of the highest level of officiants in all of Sun God Religion. Meanwhile, the force field was formless, not even Su able to detect it beforehand. Once one entered the force field, even a tenth level ability user would be restricted to having only around six levels, which was why it would be extremely difficult for them to stop the officiant’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The force field was made through the combined efforts of those monks, this level of skill extremely similar to certain types of mid-level biological weapons. They were all creatures that could combine individual strength, from this display even greater use.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surface of Su’s body produced a layer of light blue radiance. It shook a few times under the force field’s constriction, and then it shone, illuminating this entire place! The three hundred monks’ bodies trembled at the same time, their eyes bulging out, bones in their bodies releasing&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">crack crack</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;noises, lines of blood continuously shooting out from their ears and noses! Just now, it was the same as three hundred monks fiercely competing in strength with Su, comparing purely in brute force. Even though the monks’ numbers were great, when they were combined together, they were only comparable to someone with eleven levels of strengthened power. Meanwhile, not only did Su’s strength exceed eleven levels, his power source came from the various miniature spatial energy tissues within his body, the energy supply simply endless. In this clash, it was as if the three hundred monks directly faced an energy storm produced by ruptured space, the result was that all of their bodies’ bones and inner organs were blasted apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, when the officiants sent their burning metal rods smashing over, the electrical current running around Su’s body was already powerful to a blinding degree. Several streaks of giant lightning separated, each striking one of the metal rods. The high voltage currents instantly blasted through the officiant’s bodies, almost burning them down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After dealing with the disciples on the observation terrace, Su directly walked towards the entrance leading to the inside of the temple. He pulled open the heavy metal door with a single motion, and then followed the wide and deep tunnel all the way down. Monk soldiers and red-robed Warriors continuously rushed out, to the extent where there were even skeleton-like ascetics among them. However, these people who were under nine levels already posed no threat to Su, to the extent where they couldn’t even stop him in the slightest. Su’s attack method was simple and direct, but the efficiency was inconceivable. He would often grab a floor lamp, and then stab it into a corner. Immediately afterwards, a sturdy red-robed warrior would look at the floor lamp that suddenly appeared with shock, but couldn’t control his forward momentum, thus directly allowing his own chest to be impaled by the lamp. There were countless similar situations, Su’s every movement deemphasized, seemingly completely meaningless, yet the enemies would always send themselves straight over. The elite monk soldiers and red robes completely killed themselves, while Su’s energy suffered practically no losses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su’s perception spread in all directions, investigating every corner of the inside of the divine palace. If Great Sun God Palace didn’t change, then Rochester should be in the underground depths of the divine palace. He might still be one person, but there was a higher chance that he had already changed into another type of life form. Human life form was too weak, difficult to endure more power. With Rochester’s accomplishments in biology, creating a completely new creature wasn’t difficult at all, what was difficult was that what he wanted to create was a perfect life, one that possessed eternal life, great power, extraordinary intelligence, the ability to adapt to all types of different environments, as well as the most important thing: being able to evolve limitlessly.</span></p>
