 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Book 6 Chapter 32.6 - Overture</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the military base’s command division, all officers and soldiers with special abilities were seated in the combat room, their attention concentrated on the screen. However, the one who was explaining and giving orders wasn’t Shiwa, but rather a young and somewhat thin and weak youngster. Whenever his eyes passed over the young man’s body, a shadow would flash past Shiwa’s eyes. This was originally his position, yet now, he had no choice but to step aside for this young man. It was only because he carried an order from O’Brien that he directly replaced Shiwa’s position.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arnobi Duncan, this was the name of the young man. Shiwa knew that he was an ability user who rose up in the family’s private army within the recent half year, someone who had followed at O’Brien’s side all this time. However, half a year ago, Arnobi was merely the lowest level soldier, yet now, he completely pushed Shiwa aside, moreover not leaving him with any face! Arnobi’s abilities being equivalent to Shiwa’s was one thing, but what was hardest for Shiwa to accept was that his surname wasn’t even Arthur!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arnobi, who was standing in front of the screen, didn’t pay Shiwa any attention, instead pointing at the three-dimensional diagram of a mechanical bug, continuously explaining the main aspects of combat against it. His vocal speed was fast, as if he was trying to cram several days worth of contents into these soldiers’ brains. Meanwhile, the two soldiers he came with distributed some special equipment into everyone’s hands. When the soldiers in the combat room saw the various mechanical bugs’ appearances, quite a few of them revealed perplexed expressions. There weren’t many veterans in this camp, most of them were new recruits who after the war showed signs of taking a turn for the better, their combat experience lacking, which was why they were sent all the way here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this time, hurried footsteps suddenly sounded from the corridor. A messenger rushed into the combat room, first shouting out ‘reporting’, and then stating that he had important military intelligence to report. However, when he saw the situation in the combat room, he was clearly momentarily stumped, hesitating as to who he should report to. Shiwa was originally already standing up, preparing to receive intelligence, but he never expected Arnobi to directly say to the messenger, “I am the highest commanding officer at present. If you have anything to report, then just say it here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The messenger gave Shiwa a look, and then said, “Yes, commanding officer! We lost contact with the third patrolling troop, it has already exceeded the last time limit of an hour, which is why we have tentatively judged that they have encountered the enemy. Should we send out troops for search and rescue?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arnobi’s expression changed. He couldn’t help but say, “Lost connection? Quick, what was their route of itinerary? Where was the last point of contact?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before the messenger replied, an extremely ear-splitting alarm sound rang out in the base. On the monitoring image at the corner of the screen, the few light spots that represented fixed armed sentries suddenly became red, the sign of them already being destroyed. Before everyone reacted, the combat room immediately began to sway intensely, the ceiling breaking apart, dust and rigid PVC boards falling bit by bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All members, prepare for battle!!” Arnobi released a crazy roar. He reached his hand out, grabbing the sniper rifle on the side, and then rushed out of the combat room with incomparable nimbleness. When he appeared from the rooftop balcony, he just happened to see a swarm of mechanical bugs numbering in the hundreds fly over. Energy light beams already gathered into a rain of light, scattering down on the camp. One expanse of light that was especially concentrated with high energy light beams directly rained down on a machine gun tower at the corner of the camp, instantly blasting through the steel roof of the tower, blasting the two marksmen along with the machine guns into sieves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw the large amounts of densely packed light specks in the sky, Arnobi’s hair stood on end, he knew that he had already been locked onto.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damn it, why did they come so soon?!” Arnobi cursed out hatefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a flip of his body, he already shifted out several dozen meters, passing over the command division building’s rooftop balcony. Several dozen streaks of high energy light beams scattered down one after another, melting through the roof. The thick roof had a layer of steel netting inside, and after it was melted, the high energy light beams also exhausted most of their energy. Even if some of them did penetrate inside the command division building, the destruction wouldn’t be life threatening. When he saw the extent of injuries of everyone after they left the command division building, Arnobi quickly calculated the high energy light beam’s power level, and then his mouth cracked open into a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He moved through the camp with inconceivable speed, along the way pressing five blue painted special bullets into the sniper rifle, and then he pointed towards the sky, firing five shots! Five blasts of blue plasma spheres erupted in the sky, the powerful energy field quickly passing through the swarm of mechanical bugs, leaving behind a faint blue layer of light on their surface. The mechanical bugs’ speed immediately decreased by more than half, and there were more than ten mechanical bugs that began to spray out electrical flames after suffering damage from the retaliation on the ground, falling from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The information on the guidebook was correct after all!” Arnobi revealed a strange and sinister smile. He suddenly sprung up from the ground, before leaping out, an assault rifle already appeared in his hands. A single jump took him several dozen meters into the air, closing the gap between himself and the mechanical bug swarm hovering a hundred meters from the ground, the automatic rifle in his hands continuously spraying tongues of flame. Every single round he fired had blue electrical flames coiling about it, once they struck a mechanical bug, they would immediately burn down the fine intelligence and drive units within them, making them lose their ability to fly and drop from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A magazine was emptied in the blink of an eye, Arnobi himself also landing on the ground once more. More than twenty destroyed mechanical bugs dropped from the sky, landing in his surroundings one after another. Arnobi gave the mechanical bug remains that were still releasing smoke a look, the smile on his face malicious and a bit twisted. He licked his lips, muttering, “Just no blood to see, it really is a bit disappointing.”</span></p>
