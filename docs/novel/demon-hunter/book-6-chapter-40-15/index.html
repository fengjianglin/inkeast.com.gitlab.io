 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Book 6 Chapter 40.15 - Mutual Love</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The flame stream already controlled this entire region, the private hospital long enveloped in raging flames. Under the extreme temperature, everything that was and wasn’t flammable all went up in flames. Under the darkness of night, one could see a raging pillar of flames surging high into the skies in Dragon City. The stream of heat still continuously spread, covering the half of Dragon City it passed in flames. Dragon City’s surviving humans were first in shock, and then they ran in horror, trying to prevent themselves from being caught in this terrifying heat stream that was comparable to a nuclear warhead’s explosion. The speed at which the heat stream swept past was far greater than running speed, the humans that were within its range of cover, aside from the few most powerful ones, were not able to survive. Fortunately, when the flame covered half of Dragon City, it suddenly stopped, not continuing, or else all of Dragon City would have went up in flames. Despite this being the case, the over ten thousand degree temperature the heat stream released still turned a larger half of Dragon City into a domain of death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the raging flames, the Spider Empress Lanaxis slowly walked over like a goddess born in flames. She carried a distant indifference as she said, “The pursuit of power and eternal life is every creature’s innate instinct. I am no exception.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even before the aloof and remote Spider Empress, Helen still remained ice-cold and indifferent like before. “Since you’ve already merged with two parts of the perfect body, then you should know that the Lord cannot appear, nor can it be reborn.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why?” Lanaxis’ smile was proud and cold. “Only because the Lord is the most powerful ultra life form that stands above all life? Your misgivings, before my eyes, seem to be nothing more than a low level existence’s excuse for survival. The meaning of life is precisely in evolution!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I instead believe that the meaning of life is in existence itself.” Helen placed her hands into her pockets, calmly saying this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lanaxis stopped when she reached three meters in front of Helen. The current Spider Empress already returned to being in the form of a normal human, just like when she first met Su. She raised her head slightly, asking Helen, “Then please tell me, aside from power, what other reason is there for us to reject the Lord’s appearance? Just because you all betrayed it, my little apostle?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Helen revealed a bitter smile, shaking her head and saying, “Of course there is another reason, but I am unable to tell you, because I do not know either. The memories that were inherited pertaining to this are also vacant. However, the lord cannot appear, this is a warning engraved within the depths of our bloodlines. What I can tell you, is only this much.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The perfect body isn’t the Lord, but rather only the shell left behind after the Lord’s death.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Helen retorted, saying, “Isn’t it just a shell without life?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even if the Lord has a chance of being reborn through this, it is only an ultra life form. At the very least, I have a chance of suppressing it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If that happens, then you would be the Lord!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is so impossible about that?!” Lanaxis spoke resolutely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Helen sighed, saying, “That is definitely impossible.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A minute later, an unprecedented great explosion shook up the entire planet. Dragon City, along with all of the humans inside, all life, from then on, became history.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The explosions’ blast waves didn’t spread that far, the quakes not as great as some earthquakes of history either. However, the two types of energy attributes that clashed, in the limited perception of the living, were the most shocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">---</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sensation Su felt was extremely powerful, his short light blonde hair standing on end, every cell under his skin moving about, ready to erupt with their greatest power at any time. He felt a deep threat, as if a male tiger in heat saw a stronger tiger in its territory, the conclusion destined to be a battle to the death. However, Su’s attention wasn’t placed on this, all of his focus was concentrated on the young lady standing on the roof of Valhalla.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bierlus beneath his feet was currently winding about restlessly, subconsciously stirring up powerful winds with its wings. It even released low roars to remind Su of its own uneasiness. The explosions’ energy nature made it feel extremely uncomfortable, in its perspective, ascertaining the cause of the explosion in the distance was much more important than dealing with the apostles. There were only four apostles, and regardless of whether it was the Creator or the Destroyer, they shouldn’t lose to the incomplete apostles. Even though the sixth unexpectedly fell under the seventh apostle in battle, and it was the only one left among the Stupas, on this planet, Valhalla’s power was heavily limited, Bierlus had confidence in neutralizing the starship’s uses, let alone the fact that the Brain wasn’t here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su completely ignored its reminder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the top of Valhalla’s elegant ship body, Madeline stood facing the wind, her long hair fluttering about, her beautiful body forming a stark contrast with the giant sword in her hands, continuously clashing with the sight of others. She was also looking at Su, within the depths of her azure starry pupils, radiance was currently flickering about intensely, as if a hailstorm was hidden within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They seemed to never have expected to meet like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, inside Valhalla, it wasn’t as serious as if a great battle was about to erupt, actually in a bit of chaos, even Rochester losing his cool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What did you say?! The inherited memories are incomplete? How could this be? What are the lost parts?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Serendela and Fitzdurk had one question after another, bombarding Rochester to the point where he couldn’t hold on at all. He was also laughing bitterly, not understanding why so much of the inherited memories would be missing, especially the three most important parts: what was the Lord, why did the apostles betray the Lord, and why all information pertaining to the Brain apostle completely went missing. In the inherited memories’ dangerous area, Rochester also discovered signs of someone recently entering, only, the energy traces left by the other party were too faint, and he couldn’t stay in the inherited space for too long either. In this extremely chaotic energy environment, staying for even a millionth of a fraction of a second longer would result in Rochester’s consciousness possibly being destroyed. That was why he could only do his best to collect the memories dispersed within the space, only when he returned could he carefully examine the contents. The inherited memory space was extremely unstable, even though this time, they already ascertained its coordinates, it didn’t mean that the risk would be any lower next time. Less than 10% chance of survival wasn’t high even in the eyes of any lunatic. Meanwhile, only ultra life forms in absolute despair would gamble with a 50% chance, let alone 10%.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The most important memories were missing, and what was even more frightening was that someone had just entered the inheritance space. When Rochester revealed this, Fitzdurk and Serendela became momentarily speechless. The number of ultra life forms who could enter the inherited space, even if the entire universe was searched, was very few. This was a shattered space similar to the heart of a black hole, moreover linked with countless mysterious areas of space. If one wanted to enter and exit freely, what was needed was not only powerful energy, what was even more important was a level of energy. Only an ultra life form evolved close to the very peak had a chance of entering and leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Could it be the Brain?” Serendela suddenly asked. Fitzdurk frowned, wishing to retort, but those words stopped at the edge of his lips, not spoken out. In theory, this was something completely impossible, the Brain was only one of the five apostles, the energy level not higher than the other apostles. Only after gathering the power of three apostles, moreover using a small portion of Madeline’s strength did Rochester ultimately enter the inherited space. How could the Brain do it all by itself?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is very likely!” Rochester unexpectedly agreed with Serendela’s viewpoint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, how could the Brain have such a large amount of energy?” Fitzdurk asked this question that lingered about the bottom of his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rochester laughed bitterly, saying, “What if it obtained the shell of the Lord?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Lord’s shell?!” Serendela and Fitzdurk simultaneously cried out in alarm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Correct. The people of this world call it the perfect body.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this time, Valhalla trembled slightly, reminding the apostles in its own way that there was another great enemy outside the starship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ll deal with the Destroyer first!” Rochester set his resolution. However, he hesitated, and then slowly said, “There is one more important matter! That is that from today forth, we won’t mention the Lord again, let alone think about it, or search for its whereabouts or existence. We were the Lord’s creation, so as long as we think about the Lord, if we do it too many times, the Lord will be reborn through some type of method.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The apostles’ panic and dispute lasted for quite some time. Forget about Su, even Bierlus could see that Valhalla’s reaction was sluggish, that it was a good chance for an attack, but Su didn’t show any intention of grasping this chance. It was precisely because it knew that Su’s computing and analysis abilities even exceeded the main brain that it was even more confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though, while staring at the beautiful young lady, he had endless things to say to her, he didn’t ask anything. He would instead prefer this silent and deadlocked situation to last for an eternity than to shatter the weak layer of secrets. Only, time always moved on. Valhalla trembled slightly, the gradually shining patterns reminding Su that a great battle was about to start.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Turns out you were the apostles’ Sword.” Su’s smile carried a trace of bitterness.</span></p>
