 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Book 6 Chapter 34.9 - What Was</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Duplication!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aside from the eyes of penetration, this was Serendela’s trademark ability, the only ability that combined the Perception Domain’s extreme penetration ability towards material compositions and the Mental Domain’s fine control over matter and energy. Even though the current Serendela still wasn’t a complete apostle, the main thing was that the apostle’s instincts still haven’t fully awakened, while the endlessly surging energy was no different from that of a true apostle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Su could borrow his instincts to display Clairvoyance, Serendela obviously could as well! Moreover, the emotions she shared with Gusglav were clearly unordinary, so how could she just watch him die, and not use her own most powerful ability?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The instant Su thought of this, his instincts already had him moving backwards, moreover completely withdrawing into the underground passage, everything in his path completely smashed to pieces. It was to the extent where even though a streak of golden radiance shot at his leg, he still allowed it to burn, only wishing to reach the passage with the greatest speed possible. Right at this time, an incomparably brutal aura suddenly rose from the mist on the side, the powerful heat as if it could burn through steel. Then, a giant palm appeared from the smoke and dust, covering his entire body as it descended. This palm didn’t carry any tricks, containing only power that was terrifying to the extreme! This was a blow that carried eleven levels of power, not even Su willing to face it head-on. Moreover, it was precisely because this attack was overly simple that Su’s Clairvoyance had no room to move around it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While in an impasse, Su instead became incredibly cold. He instantly stood still, then brandished his elbow upwards, using an incredibly powerful stance to face this world-shaking strike!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the palm and elbow made contact, there was actually not the slightest bit of sound. However, a formless energy storm immediately spread from the two individuals, the entire underground prison swept through. All of the crushed rocks, regardless of whether they were large or small, were sent flying into the wall by the vicious energy. All of the prison rooms were completely destroyed, turning into rocks of various sizes. The few prison cells that were completely made of steel couldn’t withstand such a powerful energy storm, consequently crushed into a lump of warped steel. Among them, there were several chunks that continuously seeped out blood and smashed body tissues.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su’s legs deeply entered the ground, almost half his body sinking in. If not for him using an energy force field to support himself, the power would have immediately nailed his body rigidly into the ground. Meanwhile, the enemy’s state wasn’t that great either, after suffering Su’s full powered attack, the giant palm also released a muffled metal grinding sound, completely warping. The one who attacked Su was a steel-like man, unwavering and tall, as if an unmovable mountain towered before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he appeared, Su didn’t feel any fear, instead revealing a hint of a smile. This was because Serendela finally used her trump card. The one who was standing before Su right now was the real Gusglav!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A roar sounded once more, the Gusglav who was poisoned rushed out from the smoke and dust. If one didn’t look at the injuries, the two Gusglavs were completely the same, even their behavior the same, Su unable to tell the difference between the two at all. Su couldn’t tell who was real and who was the copy, but there was already no meaning to trying to differentiate between them. Even a copy could exist forever unless Serendela wanted to end the duplicate’s life early. Moreover, there were no differences at all between the duplicate and the original body, so there was no need to distinguish between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two Gusglavs, even if one of them was poisoned, this battle still couldn’t be continued. Clairvoyance already gave him his only choice: run. Su still kind of wanted to give it a try, he still had his final methods as well. As long as the high temperature stream was released from his chest, under a close distance, not even Serendela could resist the extreme heat, even though Clairvoyance continuously told him that there was no chance of success.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su lowered his body. Serendela and the two Gusglavs simultaneously stopped their momentum, taking precautions against Su’s possible fatal blow, this place entering a momentary deadlocked situation. Meanwhile, Serendela released a cold laugh, the golden radiance in her eyes not flourishing, instead dimming. This abnormal change immediately drew Su’s vigilance. Before Clairvoyance gave him an answer, the flesh puppets roaming about the surface suddenly released a scream, their bodies shriveling up without any omen. At the same time, Su suddenly felt a wave of weak coldness from behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without even taking the time to think, his hand flipped over, as long as his sharp fingernails slashed the opponent hidden in the darkness, the vicious poison would be transmitted. Even though it was a common use poison that didn’t target any specific foe, it was still enough to pose a fatal threat to someone like Gusglav. Under the Clairvoyance state, this attack had seventy percent chance success of hitting the attacker. However, when this hand lashed out, it unexpectedly failed to hit anything!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as a feeling of alarm rose in his mind, Su felt pain from his palm, and then an extremely familiar numbing sensation began to spread from the injury. Su was shocked, quickly evading to the side, at the same time sending his fist into the empty space in front of him! With a muffled&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">tong</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;sound, a fist suddenly appeared, colliding with Su’s. This fist was similarly soft and fine, skin like jade. The two figures staggered, separating, and only then did Su see his opponent clearly. It was actually another Su!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline"> </span></p>
