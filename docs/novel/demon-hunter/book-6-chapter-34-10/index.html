 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Book 6 Chapter 34.10 - What Was</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She already acquired enough data to duplicate me?” Su gave the complacent Serendela in the distance a look, immediately turning around to rush into the passage, instantly vanishing into the passage above. The duplicated Su immediately chased after him, similarly incredibly nimble, almost no different from Su.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, the poison finally made Gusglav stagger, collapse with a loud noise, unable to crawl up again. Large amounts of dark green blood flowed out from his body, creating a ghastly sight. A hint of discomfort passed Serendela’s eyes, but soon afterwards, it was replaced by raging flames of anger. Her figure flickered, chasing after him. However, when she only took one step, she was stopped by Gusglav.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Spider Empress had said before that I am not permitted to leave this place. That is why I cannot leave.” Gusglav said quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Spider Empress? Even that old woman’s words are trustworthy?” Serendela screamed out. She reached out her hand towards Gusglav, and then said, “Hurry and chase after him with me! The copy might very well not be his opponent!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gusglav revealed a bit of shock. “It isn’t a perfect copy?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Serendela clenched her teeth, saying, “It’s not! Not only that, but the degree of duplication doesn’t even reach 50%!”This made Gusglav feel true shock. He understood Serendela’s power well. When he looked at the other Gusglav that had already turned into a corpse laying on the ground, he revealed a bitter smile again. Serendela’s ability was a true miracle, right now, not even him able to tell if this was his original body or copied body. However, which one it was wasn’t important. When Serendela wanted to bring him away, Gusglav’s face finally revealed a helpless and freed smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A small spider dropped from the ceiling. It was just that weak and small, making one wonder just how it survived from the battle that had just happened. However, its movements were so fast, fast to the point where Serendela couldn’t even react in time. The spider landed on Gusglav’s shoulder, climbed into his neck, and then bit down on his exposed skin. Two streaks of golden light shot over soon after, completely vaporizing the spider, even the area that was bit on Gusglav having a two centimeter deep wound burned. If it was an ordinary spider bite, it wouldn’t even have time to inject its venom, so there was no need to burn open a two centimeter deep injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The intense pain made Gusglav frown, but soon after, his expression changed, to the extent where he already couldn’t speak, only able to give Serendela a deep look. Then, he collapsed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Gus!” Serendela screamed out, reaching out her hands to hold him, but when they only reached out halfway, she stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gusglav’s body was already starting to display bits of dark red radiance, irregular energy change brought about by poison, proving that the inside of his body had already been completely destroyed. In terms of the strength of the poison, the Spider Empress’ poison was far greater than Su’s biological poison. However, this was a special poison that had designated effects, so it was completely different from Su’s common use poison to begin with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Serendela gave Gusglav’s corpse a look, everything happening too quickly, too fast, her thoughts momentarily stopping, completely stopping all activity. The spider’s poison instantly destroyed over twenty percent of Gusglav’s tissues, several important tissues and organs completely destroyed, no possibility of them being restored. Even if the restoration was complete, what she obtained would no longer be the original Gusglav.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From their reunion, to completely losing him, only a few minutes of time had passed between the two. Even for an apostle whose thoughts were countless times greater than a normal human’s, this amount of time was too short, the rollercoaster of emotions too great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, Lanaxis slowly walked out from Dark Red Castle’s pervaded darkness, walking onto the balcony. From this angle, she could see a great sea stretch out. At the limits of the great sea was the outline of the continent. Between her five fingers that looked like they were carved from jade, a small spider was currently crawling back and forth in a lively manner. While staring into the dark great sea, she seemed to be thinking about something, her eyes a bit vacant and distant. All of a sudden, a smile appeared on the corners of her lips, and then her five fingers suddenly closed. With a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">pa</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;sound, the small spider was instantly crushed! As it died, it actually released a crying sound like that of a human infant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The instant that small spider’s body died, Gusglav’s corpse suddenly exploded into a blast of blood! The large amounts of blood and flesh pieces rained down, soaking through Serendela’s body. She still knelt there with a stupefied expression, hot blood pouring on her body, unexpectedly releasing a fragrant aura. A drop of blood moved past Serendela’s pupil, leaving behind a ghastly streak of blood, as if it was an injury that would never heal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lanaxis reached out a finger, and then with a flick, the small spider’s corpse flew out, landing on the balcony. A clear&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">ding</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;sounded, tumbling about, only when it smashed into a pair of boots that were polished brightly did it stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dyke Avidar bowed, using his hand that was covered in a snow-white glove to pick up the spider. He carefully looked at it, and only then did he walked up to the Spider Express, softly asking, “This is…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Merely a small bug, crushed it to death due to my good mood. Is there any more reasoning needed?” Lanaxis replied with a light smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Only, this little bug… your distinguished self is too correct.” Dyke Avidar’s ability to change his attitude could be said to be on par with the darkness he released.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Far away, the crevice in Serendela’s pupils became deeper and deeper. Her eyes that were like gold-colored ceramic glass suddenly cracked with a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">pa</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;sound, shattering, and then turned into pieces of golden ice chunks that gradually sunk into the depths of her eyes. What replaced her two pupils, was an expanse of bottomless icy coldness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Serendela stood up again, the feeling she gave off was already completely different. She gave Gusglav’s corpse a look, and then indifferently said to herself, “Lanaxis, I will not let that old woman go. You can pass on peacefully.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Far away, Lanaxis suddenly laughed again, her laugh extremely easygoing. “Even something that has lived for hundreds of thousands of years has the the nerve to say that to me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dyke Avidar, who was almost within reach, tried his best, managing to not hear it clearly.</span></p>
