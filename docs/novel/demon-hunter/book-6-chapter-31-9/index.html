 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Book 6 Chapter 31.9 - Unknown</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su became silent. He could only nod his head, and then lead Persephone towards the heart of the little town. The two had long exposed themselves before the little town’s sentinel, but the sentinel’s eyes passed right over them, as if they didn’t see anything, and then turned to a different direction. Persephone put on a pensive look; that sentinel had around six levels of perception ability, Infrared Sight and Glimmer Sight also essential abilities, so the darkness of night was naturally not a hindrance. If one wanted to screen out his perception, there was a type of high level ability in the Mysterious Fields: Wish Fulfillment, that could do such a thing. This ability could affect the target’s mind, make the other party see what the other party wants them to see. However, Su didn’t seem to have such high level Mysterious Fields ability, he seemed to be using some type of Perception Domain ability, distorting the light rays, other waves, and force fields that could be perceived within the Panoramic View, from this hiding the two individuals’ traces. This sounded simple, but in practice, especially to avoid scouts who specialized in high levels of Perception Domain, the instantaneous computing power needed was inconceivably great. Persephone was extremely intelligent herself, but she felt a faint headache as soon as she just began to think about it, not daring to seriously calculate the information processing capability this entailed. Perhaps only Helen could do such a thing, she definitely didn’t have this ability. Apart from inconceivable wisdom, she was completely an ordinary person, so there was no way she could do all of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In reality, ‘Wish Fulfillment’ was nothing more than a ninth level Mysterious Fields ability. Now, Persephone’s abilities were gradually recovering, already having nine levels of strength. However, this ability relied on affecting the other party’s willpower, and there were all types of limitations, the effects extremely unstable, so almost no one learned it. Only a reduced version was sometimes used for interrogation purposes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since the start of turmoil, the number of times Persephone could meet Su became fewer and fewer, yet each time they met, Su would always give her an entirely different feeling. She couldn’t really say whether this was good or bad, but she definitely felt estranged. She felt more and more estranged from Su, even when he displayed his unchanging smile, Persephone would sometimes still feel as if the him before and after were entirely different, as if it was a completely different person. When Su looked at this world, or observed anything, he would become an entirely different person, one who was cold, indifferent, as if he wasn’t the least bit concerned about anything in this world, yet wouldn’t overlook the smallest detail. That was a feeling of controlling everything, being high up above all things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Persephone hated this feeling of estrangement Su gave her, but whenever Su looked at her, he would become the Su she knew, the warm and gentle Su whose arms she could sleep peacefully in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In reality, in the eyes of others, Su didn’t change at all. Not only were there no differences in his external appearance or expressions, not even the most precise energy wave detection instruments could find any difference. Su was still the same Su, only Persephone knew that Su already changed, even though she couldn’t say where he changed. This was her woman’s intuition, and between two intimate individuals, intuition was often extremely accurate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The small town wasn’t that large. Su and Persephone walked into the small town right under the sentinel’s eyes, arriving at the square at the center of the town, to the extent where they brushed right past two soldiers on the streets. They were both battle-hardened veterans, apart from the aura of energy that represented high level abilities, there was also a thick bloody killing intent, clearly many people dying under their hands. This type of person, when placed on the battlefield, could often kill several times the number of similar level ability users without experience. However, they both turned a blind eye to Su and Persephone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the center of the town was a small church, a building that existed in almost every single olden era little town. There were many beliefs and customs that continued into the new era as well. Su stood right in front of this little church, reached out his hand, and then pushed open the side door. The wooden side door had long been worn down by the corrosion of time, the door hinge releasing a groaning noise when it was pushed open, creaking and groaning with difficulty. Su walked into the church first, and also hinted for Persephone to follow him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The church wasn’t large, clearly not used for many years now. However, after a simple cleaning, it became much more tidy. In the prayer room at the back of the church, intense and rhythmic sounds were continuously transmitted, those with experience could tell after just listening a bit that this came from the powerful movements of two humans engaging in coitus, the impact comparable to giant elephants, frequency even more so concentrated to the point of making one’s hair stand on end. The door of the prayer room had long rotted, now only having a cloth curtain hanging down, four calves visible from below the curtain. Of course, unless there was an emergency situation, the soldiers resting in the small town definitely wouldn’t enter this small church, even if they quietly entered, they would still be discovered. That was why the people in the prayer room were currently brazenly embracing each other, already about to enter the most tense and extreme stage. In addition, their abilities were all extremely powerful, their corresponding constitution also far exceeding that of ordinary people, the amount of time they could linger on the brink of joy even more so inconceivably long. Borrowing the faint rays of light, one could see that those two bright, clean, and straight calves were trembling uncontrollably, while the two strong and powerful legs grinded against the floor with crazy force again and again. The wooden floor couldn’t bear the heavy burden, currently groaning and continuously breaking down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su wasn’t someone who understood inclinations and interests that well. He spoke precisely at this most critical point in time, saying, “Sorry for the disturbance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su’s voice was still pleasant to listen to, full of enticing charm. However, as soon as he spoke, time seemed to have frozen still in this entire little church, all things momentarily entering absolute silence. It was to the extent where the four intertwined legs stopped moving in that instant, the man’s legs still maintaining a position that was about to exert force, his muscles completely taut, the next pounding motion clearly going to be extremely violent and rough. Meanwhile, veins could vaguely be seen from the woman’s legs, her blood vessels already swelled to the limit. If Su didn’t suddenly speak, perhaps her climax would have continued for several minutes, more than ten minutes, or even as long as she wanted it to. However now, right when she was about to orgasm, it was forcibly stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time froze for an entire second in the small church, and then the walls of the prayer room crashed down. Several dozen energy streams produced by magic rushed at Su!</span></p>
