 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Book 6 Chapter 37.12 - Eruption</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the surface, the snowy mountain was still calm and beautiful. Aside from Great Sun God Temple, several temples built on the snowy mountain had just finished the early morning ceremony, now starting to busy about. Strands of clear smoke rose from the chimneys, the fragrance of food starting to spread in all directions. The monks dug up large amounts of ice and snow, carrying them into the temple. Sun God Temple’s teachings believed that snow water was natural and pure, which was why it was the water that was essential for all types of ceremonies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the calmness of this day was shattered soon afterwards. A giant shadow slowly appeared from the distance, moreover flying towards the snowy mountain. It didn’t fly that high, but the shadow it cast over the earth was extremely frightening, almost covering all heavenly light!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The giant shadow on the ground covering over ten kilometers in size continuously moved forward, entering the snowy mountain soon afterwards. It gradually rose up, eventually completely covering the temple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an incredibly large creature, the moving body over ten thousand meters long, behind it dragged a long tail. Two giant fins extended to the left and right, looking like a giant beast that appeared from the deep sea. At its side, the six wing fins already completely spread out, every single wing fin exceeding two thousand meters in length. It was unknown what kind of method it used to float in the sky, but with just a light sway of its giant tail, its giant body would quietly move several dozen kilometers through the air. It floated above the temple, massive body slowly descending. Several dozen light bulb-like brilliant organs swelled from its belly, and then several dozen streaks of light beams shot out, illuminating the divine temple. Under the light beams, the snow that accumulated year-round on the summit quickly melted, revealing the dark-colored rock. Meanwhile, the rock actually began to melt soon afterwards as well. The sturdy rock couldn’t even stop the light beams, so the temple naturally quickly dissolved, the officiants and monks not even able to release a final cry before being completely vaporized!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The temple completely disappeared soon afterwards. Meanwhile, the energy pillars were still shining, the mountain continuously melting, gradually revealing revealing a giant hole underground. The moment the hole was completely revealed by the energy light beams, countless mutated creatures emerged from within, wailing as they threw themselves at the giant beast in the sky. Even though they weren’t that large, their speeds were exceptional, extremely vicious, possessing power that definitely didn’t match their size. It was to the extent where several of them actually brazenly faced the energy light beam’s illumination, rushing up against this power! If these mutated beasts reached its body, the giant beast might not necessarily be able to stop their attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The giant beast above seemed to sense danger. It released a long cry, and then its body moved, firing out countless biological beasts from its subcutaneous folds. These biological weapons were all equipped with short distance levitation abilities. They immediately threw themselves at the enemies that rushed out from underground, viciously tearing and biting at them! In an instant, thousands of extremely vicious biological weapons rushed together. The biological beasts that appeared from underground were clearly bigger and stronger, but their numbers were too few. Their opponents could calmly surround them in groups of three to five, and there were even more waiting for an opportunity to join in. The overwhelming numbers disadvantage put Sun God Temple’s biological beasts in a bitter situation. Meanwhile, the giant beast in the sky wouldn’t pay the fly-like biological weapons any attention, its giant body slowly descending, covering the giant opening on the mountain peak. Meanwhile, its tail that was several kilometers long first curled up, and then it stabbed fiercely into the opening!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire mountain peak trembled, and then a great cry of pain sounded from the underground depths, the volume extremely great, as if tens of thousands of mammoths roared at the same time. The giant beast’s body revealed six claws, firmly clasping the mountain. Its belly swelled and contracted, continuously extracting the flesh and blood of the unknown giant beast underground. After sucking for more than ten minutes, only then did it stop. By now, the underground world long calmed down, that giant beast no longer releasing any sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The giant beast floating about shook its body, seemingly extremely satisfied. Several minutes later, it released countless biological weapons again, sending them to join the battle in the air. The numbers superiority quickly reversed the situation, Sun God Temple’s side falling one after another. Even though the other side’s casualties were even greater, the battle’s conclusion was already decided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The giant beast removed its tail, opened its wing fins, rising up to the sky again with difficulty, flying towards another Sun God Temple. Those biological weapons completely devoured the corpses of both sides, and only then did they rise up, catch up to the floating giant beast, enter the fold, and then disappear. One definitely wouldn’t be able to tell that this giant beast constantly carried countless biological weapons on it, but if one only looked at its bulk, carrying tens of thousands of biological weapons was entirely possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the underground depths of Great Sun God Temple, Su and Rochester’s intense battle still had no end in sight, the repeated erosion of energy already destroying most of the biological solvent, the temperature underground already rising to more than five hundred degrees, moreover still rising. If it wasn’t for Rochester protecting himself with an energy field, the entire underground biological solvent would be ignited and burned to ashes. Rochester also felt that Su’s energy abundance was a bit strange, which was why he increased the frequency and intensity of his attacks. Right now, there would be at least three streaks of lightning that bombarded Su’s body at all times. Even though the energy expenditure of this was ten times that of before, Su’s defenses still began to show signs of becoming unstable, proving that it was already reaching the limit of what he could bear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rochester laughed loudly, the brain membrane quickly wriggling about. Eruption points, gravity, severing, all types of magic abilities took form once again, pouring down on Su like rain. Even though the efficiency of these magic attacks wasn’t as high as that of &nbsp;lightning, the energy consumption also greater, they would also make Su’s energy consumption greater, from this speeding up the collapse of Su’s defenses. Rochester already suspected that Su might have some type of eternal energy supply core inside his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, right when Su already entered a critical state, he suddenly opened his eyes, looking towards the exposed brain membrane below. “Rochester, do you feel like you already won?”</span></p>
