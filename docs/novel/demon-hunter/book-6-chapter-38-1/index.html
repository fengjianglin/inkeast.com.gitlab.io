 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Book 6 Chapter 38.1 - Embrace</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After who knew how long, Su finally emerged from the boiling biological solvent, gradually rising into the sky. He was completely naked, regardless of whether it was his body or appearance, he was still perfect, his light golden soft short hair fluttering about, green pupils flickering with a bit of bewilderment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As if he woke up from a dream, only after a long time had passed did Su release a sigh, a bit of divine radiance returning to his eyes. He first gave his own body a look, and then his line of sight landed on the biological solvent below him. The original half solid biological solvent continuously boiled, already completely liquefied. There were large amounts of bubbles that continuously emerged from the depths, and then they ruptured, releasing highly toxic gas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within every single drop of biological solvent, the original cells were fighting crazily against intruder cells, no, to be more precise, they were currently being devoured. After three days of crazy division, growth, battles, and swallowing, the intruder cells had already increased from the original dozen or so to now covering every corner of the biological solvent. In another hour and forty minutes, all of the biological solvent would be devoured and converted by the intruder cells.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su calmly watched everything. If there was a need, he could control the movement of every single intruder cell. The amount of data that would instantly pour into his mind was already calculated in hundreds of millions, yet Su could easily processes it, moreover with energy to spare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If one examined them under a high-powered microscope, they would find that the current intruder cells were smaller, but the quality was even better. Apart from a long and strong tail, they even had three flagella that could control direction and increase speed. It was to the extent where if more than ten intruder cells combined together, they could release a weak force field. The current intruder cells were already completely different from those of before Su awakened, they grew together with Su, already undergoing two great evolutions and countless smaller modifications. The activity of the biological solvent’s cells wasn’t much stronger than that of those of this world, not fighting on the same level as the intruder cells at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The third generation intruder cells, in cellular level battles, were already unrivaled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The boiling biological solvent gradually calmed down, the water level gradually dropping. Throughout the semi-transparent biological solvent, countless eggs had already taken form, unknown what was being produced within them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While watching the intruder cells’ glorious battle accomplishments, Su’s mind suddenly moved, recalling his earliest days. Back then, there was a fiery little girl with short maroon hair, she loudly declared while pointing at him ‘You’re mine!’, and then chased after him. In the end, in the forest depths, she ended up falling into the enemy’s hands, this was a falling of both body and heart. She never knew that after she left, the song ‘Welcome to the Jungle!’ played in his mind that entire night. It was precisely that afternoon that Su’s intruder cells were left on the pistol, and it was taken by her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was the start of trouble, as well as the start of unforgettable memories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su’s arms slowly moved, subconsciously embracing himself. This body was completely new again, a third of the inner composition swapped out once more. Right now, not even Su was willing to examine his body’s innumerable new functions, all known knowledge related to living creatures already overthrown. He couldn’t even say for sure what exactly he was. His outer appearance was still human, to the extent where he even preserved all traits of a male. Even though his appearance was picturesque, skin like jade, his beauty exuded a type of great boldness; there was a raging flame within the soft rosyness. No one would doubt Su’s identity as a male.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After reconstructing his body, Su subconsciously chose a human body again, at least for his outer form. In reality, Su didn’t consider his external appearance during this reconstruction and evolution at all, even if he turned into a monstrous appearance, he still wouldn’t care much. However, in the end, he was still a human male, just that he became even prettier. The current Su was already beautiful to a mathematical degree, without the slightest flaw to be found. When he saw his own external appearance, Su understood that he was still persevering in his subconscious mind’s innermost depths, a perseverance that would continue until his will scattered. Su himself actually already didn’t care that much about his identity as a human, only, those memories, the reluctant worries, made him unable to drop his status as a human. Even if, for the sake of protecting those he loved, he had to give up his body composition as a human, he still wanted to at least maintain the external appearance of a human.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The current Su already understood many things he didn’t understand in the past, for example, why each time he evolved, he would become prettier and prettier. This was actually a type of choice his instincts made, as his understanding of human society deepened, his instincts already discovered the importance of external appearance. In the human world, regardless of what era it was, whether it was male or female, those who were prettier always had it easier. That was why his instincts continuously used the reactions of others as reference to revise his appearance, moreover helping Su maintain a characteristic that others would never forget, which was those bottomless deep green eyes; this was why Su became prettier and prettier. However, his instincts couldn’t understand that many times, an appearance that was too outstanding would often instead signify danger. Meanwhile, on the other hand, Su’s own temperament, as well as the areas deep within his heart that moved others, were the true source of his charm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su released a light sigh. If he had a choice, then he would still rather maintain a perfect appearance and body. Even though he believed Persephone wouldn’t leave him no matter what kind of appearance he changed to now, if he was pretty, she would still feel happier, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In an instant, all of his blurry memories returned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He recalled the thrill he felt when he escaped the laboratory. It was for no other reason than an instinctive craving for freedom and survival that he grasped this fleeting opportunity. At that time, Su was only a fist-sized irregular flesh chunk. For the sake of fleeing, he changed into at least several hundred different shapes, giving up 99% of his cells, and only then did he escape from the laboratory base through an air vent. It was to the extent where Su recalled that the number of cells that fled was precisely thirteen. In the long period of time that followed, Su always existed in a form similar to a virus, in the end finally choosing a human form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regardless of whether it was when he was a virus, or when he was a young human male, a mysterious fear always surrounded Su’s mind. Meanwhile, for his past memories to be blurry, this was also an extremely normal thing, because at that time, Su often only had a dozen or so cells, so how could he recall everything clearly? However, why was he able to recall all of this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Life carried endless mysteries. When he thought carefully about this, he would inadvertently feel fear. However, as long as Su wanted to know, the Bisindle divine language would clearly dissect all mysteries for him and present them before his face, this was what one should truly feel shock over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He finally struggled free from his past memories, but Su’s mind instead felt increasingly heavy. It was as if a formless shadow clouded his mind, yet he didn’t know what it was. The fear that had accompanied his growth became more realistic, yet he couldn’t ascertain its source, only now, he was sure that this fear truly existed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su’s eyes landed at the center of the biological solvent again. This was where Rochester’s body previously rested, but now, it was a blank space. All of the brain matter had already been converted and directly absorbed by Su. As for his memories related to the apostle, they were still like fragmented glass, stored in Su’s memories. The apostle’s memories were extremely numerous, even Su needing time to slowly digest them. However, right now, he wasn’t in a rush, he still had time. Right now, Su was more willing to immerse himself in the past, immerse himself in his identity as a human for a bit longer. It was because soon afterwards, all of this would become an extravagant luxury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li, Madeline, Persephone, Lanaxis, Li Gaolei, Ricardo, Sally… a string of names appeared and flowed out like water, making him sigh with sorrow. It was said that old people like to reminisce about the past, Su smiled bitterly as he thought. Was he already old? No, this wasn’t it, it was just that Su had a premonition that he was already reaching the end of a life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He floated in the air, and then he suddenly released a silent roar! This roar was a shout, a calling, summoning his children to come see him in the southern continent. As long as they were on this planet, as long as they had Su’s blood running through them, no matter what corner they were hiding in, or what kind of condition they were in, they would obey Su’s calling, moreover could not refuse it.</span></p>
