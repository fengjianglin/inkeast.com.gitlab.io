 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Book 6 Chapter 41.2 - Difficult To Find the Way Back</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Serendela dared to vow she saw Su die with her own eyes, while Rochester and Fitzdurk couldn’t find any reason to refute this either, the apostles were still uneasy. The Destroyer was just too mysterious. In the apostles’ long life, this was the first time they encountered the Destroyer. Regardless of whether it was Rochester or Serendela who was fully concentrated on searching for Madeline, right now, they were both silently convincing themselves, repeatedly emphasizing that Madeline’s full powered strike might be something only the Lord could receive and not die from, the Creator or Destroyer unable to survive under this heavy sword that could erase space. Indeed, the apostles were practically undying, but the sixth and seventh apostle were truly undying, they would always find some way to be reborn. However, this type of rebirth would take hundreds of thousands to even tens of millions of years, the location of rebirth also unknown as to which corner of the universe it would be at. At that time, the apostles would have definitely freed themselves from this prison, returning to the free cosmos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fitzdurk gave the ground a look, and then cursed angrily, “This damned world’s will!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rochester and Serendela both remained silent. Madeline’s sudden disappearance might very likely have something to do with the will of this world. However, for them to erase the will of the world now was already too late, when they purged this planet, it would most likely be time for Madeline to slaughter her way back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As if knowing what the two apostles were thinking, Rochester slowly said, “Time isn’t necessarily against us. You all shouldn’t forget that she is also an apostle after all. If the will of the world wishes to suppress an apostle’s instincts for a long time, that is something completely impossible!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only when they heard these words, did Serendela and Fitzdurk’s expressions improve a bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the depths of the mountain cave, the walls’ trembling had long disappeared, however, Madeline didn’t notice any of these. She only tightly held Su, her own face already sticking to Su’s, trying to warm Su with her own body temperature. The young lady didn’t dare open her eyes, but despite this being the case, those scenes still repeatedly appeared before her eyes, impossible to get rid of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment she released the final sword strike, Madeline had long known that her own sword was destined to fail, at most add a bit of injury to Su’s body. Her sword’s purpose wasn’t to kill, but rather as a form of restriction, preventing Su from killing her companions throughout endless generations. However, when she saw Su still heavily injure the three apostles one after another, not showing any intention of blocking her sword, Madeline suddenly panicked, also becoming moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He really… feels differently towards me. He trusts me…” The young lady couldn’t help but think. Not even she herself knew why she developed such a strange thought, why she would be moved by this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, right when she was absentminded, a streak of icy-cold consciousness suddenly surged from the depths of her body, instantly controlling her body! The young lady instinctively felt that something wasn’t right, immediately doing erupting with all of her strength to crush the instincts that controlled her. However, right at this time, three powerful consciousness waves suddenly invaded her consciousness, and then forcefully suppressed her resistance! This originated from Serendela, Fitzdurk, and Rochester’s wills. They worked together, using the resonance channels they shared to successfully disrupt and suppress Madeline’s will. Even though it was for only a brief instant, it was an irreversible instant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Madeline watched helplessly as her own hands gripped the heavy sword, all of her potential surging at this moment. Then, the heavy sword’s power directly increased several times, stabbing towards Su’s back with irreversible power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this instant that was impossible to react from, Su suddenly turned around, when he saw the heavy sword that rushed over, his face was covered with undisguised astonishment. Then, the astonishment became shock, anger, grief, and then calmness. All of these complex emotions, they all appeared in the instant one couldn’t even produce a thought in. Meanwhile, at this moment, Su’s right hand was also raised with a speed far surpassing the young lady’s, black energy condensing on his fingertip, restricting the young lady’s instincts to the point where they screamed in horror! Meanwhile, the three apostles’ consciousness that restricted the young lady simultaneously released their control, frantically fleeing from her body. If they were struck by that black energy of destruction, the three apostles’ consciousness within the young lady’s body would be wiped out as well. For apostles that were close to pure energy states, this was equivalent to a fatal injury. If one wished to recover from this, it would take millions of years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su’s final expression was calm, to the extent where he even revealed a smile like in the past. That was a smile full of sunlight, a radiance that previously illuminated the skies for the young lady for eight whole years. Meanwhile, the energy of destruction ultimately stopped at his fingertip, not shooting out, moreover scattering as the heavy sword entered his body and his life force collapsed. Su slowly closed his eyes, calm and at peace, as if he was finally freed and going to get some sleep, the smile on the corner of his lips thus frozen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was the final trace of sunlight the young lady saw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ah!!!”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young lady finally released a hysterical scream!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The willpower that gushed forth not only collapsed her instincts, it also seriously injured the three apostles who didn’t have the time to escape. The heavy sword was pulled out from Su’s body, and then her elbow swept out, the high frequency waves not only destroying everything within a radius of thirty meters, it also seriously damaged the apostles’ bodies! Only, when the sword swept out, the young lady’s expression immediately paled, the heavy sword almost leaving her hands. The instant the apostle instincts took control, all of her stamina and energy were used on the thrust that penetrated Su. Right now, when she forcefully banished her sword again, the inside of the young lady’s body immediately became covered in countless wounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Madeline! Do not be reckless! Did you forget how I freed you from destruction back then?” Rochester roared. While Fitzdurk and Serendela didn’t dare rush forward, Rochester walked over, boldly approaching Madeline. In the past, he had indeed helped Madeline prevail over many powerful ultra life forms. Moreover, the reason why he dared step out was because he could see that the young lady was already seriously injured, without much energy left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, before his words ended, the heavy sword that originally should’ve been powerless flew out again, stabbing straight at the back of his head! Rochester was horrified, frantically dodging, but he couldn’t avoid Madeline’s attack at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">pu&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">sound, bloody mist scattered in Valhalla, half of Rochester’s body turning into a bloody paste. Meanwhile, the young lady spat out blood mixed with her inner organs, moreover unable to hold the heavy sword again, allowing it to leave her hands, insert itself into Valhalla’s walls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Valhalla trembled intensely a few times, as if it suffered an unendurable pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young lady grabbed Su’s body with a single motion, jumped out from Valhalla’s damaged deck, and then descended into the night shrouded great earth, thus heading into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After an entire minute passed, only then did Fitzdurk and Serendela recover from their shock, barely manage to control Valhalla. Meanwhile, Rochester was still struggling against the destructive vibrations covering his body. Valhalla immediately turned around, swaying as it followed in the direction the young lady disappeared in. Fitzdurk and Serendela both understood how serious the young lady’s injuries were, which was why they, who were also apostles, didn’t understand why the young lady could still run, to the extent where not even Valhalla could catch up to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, these scenes temporarily disappeared from before the young lady’s eyes. However, immediately afterwards, what she felt was Su’s ice-cold face. She would rather immerse herself in her memories’ suffering rather than feel the despair of reality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unknowingly when, hot tears already covered the young lady’s face. Her eyes were tightly closed, rubbing against Su’s face, softly kissing him as she muttered, “Don’t leave me, please, don’t…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Drop after drop of tears carrying the young lady’s warmth landed on Su’s face, but they couldn’t bring his ice-cold face the slightest bit of warmth. Su’s body was currently becoming rigid, becoming even harder than the sturdiest alloy. This type of change made the young lady feel despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because she was also an apostle, Madeline understood Su better than anyone. She knew that not even her own sword that transcended the peak could make Su die so quickly. The death of Su’s body and life force, to a larger part, wasn’t because of the heavy sword, but rather because he himself withdrew his life force. In other words, Su ended his own life. At the time, even though the young lady’s willpower was restricted by the other three apostles, she clearly saw that Su’s powerful and terrifying instincts were currently awakening under the threat to his life, moreover roaring, preparing to destroy all of the apostles. Meanwhile, killing all of the apostles, would, first of all, end Madeline’s life. Even so, Su suppressed his instincts, the price being that he couldn’t stop the attack that followed. After being seriously injured, Su’s consciousness began to fall into darkness. He collected all of his life force, thus stopping his instincts from awakening again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only, whenever she thought of his expression of calmness, yet also slight sorrow and regret in Su’s final moments, the young lady’s heart felt unspeakable pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She didn’t have any other ways, she could only quietly shed tears, embrace Su even tighter.</span></p>
