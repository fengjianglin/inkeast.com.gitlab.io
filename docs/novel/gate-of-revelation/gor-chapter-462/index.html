 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 462 Island?</strong></p>
 <p>When their submarine arrived at the given coordinate for the island, Chen Xiaolian and the others checked their surroundings using the submarine periscope for a moment. After that, they sighed.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian smiled wryly and said, “This island must have been temporarily created by the system for this instance dungeon!”</p>
 <p>Roddy stepped away from the periscope. He turned to Chen Xiaolian and was unable to stop himself from pulling a face. “Son of a bitch! For something like this to appear in the sea near Tel Aviv, this is definitely something that is temporarily created for the instance dungeon. If that is not the case, this world is going to go topsy-turvy!”</p>
 <p>Lun Tai clicked his tongue in amazement. As for Xia Xiaolei and Qimu Xi, they were left dumbfounded, their eyes wide open.</p>
 <p>It was a very big… … island?</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Waves rolled restlessly on the surface of the sea. The starry sky in the night resembled an embroidered cloth and moonlight shone through the waters.</p>
 <p>At that moment however, those inside the submarine could only see a mountain peak. It rose up high like a sword piercing straight through the Heavens.</p>
 <p>There was no telling how high the mountain peak was. They felt as though it was charging up the firmaments, challenging the moonlight.</p>
 <p>Strangely, what lay beneath the mountain peak were large stretches of black coloured rocks, forming barren lands without a single vegetation in sight.</p>
 <p>Most importantly however, was what lay beneath those large stretches of black coloured rocks… … nothing!</p>
 <p>The island was floating above the sea!</p>
 <p>There was a distance of over 10 metres between the island and the surface of the sea. The sight of the floating island shocked them. There was nothing to support the lands and the mountain.</p>
 <p>Compared to the humongous island with the lofty mountain peak, their submarine was like an ant standing beside a giant.</p>
 <p>After examining the floating island using the periscope, everyone was left in a dazed state. After a while, Xia Xiaolei sighed, “Damn it… … no matter how you look at it, that island is dangerous!”</p>
 <p>Everyone entered a deep state of contemplation.</p>
 <p>Lun Tai looked at Chen Xiaolian and said, “Do we head to the island now?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian checked the time. There were 28 more minutes before little Will’s life force reached depletion.</p>
 <p>However… … the time before the system revealed their coordinates to the members of the Light Faction… … three minutes.</p>
 <p>“Heading to the island now…” Chen Xiaolian suddenly shook his head. “No. Right now… … Roddy, turn around. We will leave this place!”</p>
 <p>“Le, leave?” Roddy was stunned.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian grunted and said slowly, “If we head to the island now, the moment we arrive on the island will be the moment the system reveals our coordinates to the Light Faction!</p>
 <p>“I am guessing that there are more storyline quests for the members of the Light Faction. After reaching Tel Aviv, the members of the Light Faction must still complete some other quests to acquire the coordinate of this Demon Island.</p>
 <p>“In other words, if we are to head to Demon Island right now, we might give away the coordinate of this Demon Island!</p>
 <p>“Listen to my command. We will immediately turn around and leave this place. Head south at full speed.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian took a deep breath and clenched his fists. “We… … will wait for this next coordinate announcement by the system to end before returning here!”</p>
 <p>“But little Will…”</p>
 <p>“We will make it in time.” There was a resolute expression on Chen Xiaolian’s face.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Tian Lie slowly pulled his hand out from a knight’s chest. His fingertips that had transformed into sharp metal spikes quickly returned to its original form.</p>
 <p>His entire body was covered in blood. Corpses formed a circle on the ground around him.</p>
 <p>Nicole, on the other hand had already charged into the distance. Blood stained her hair and her warhorse frothed, on the verge of collapsing.</p>
 <p>Nicole pulled the horse to a stop and jumped down. She turned to look at the knight that she had just unseated with her attack. She moved forward to stand beside the knight. Then, she gently pulled down the knight’s visor.</p>
 <p>Under the moonlight, the knight’s face promptly shrivelled and aged, the muscles beneath his armour transformed into faint smoke before slowly dissipating.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the corpses of the knights and their warhorses turned to smoke as well. Even the blood on Nicole and Tian Lie’s bodies were of no exception. All of them dissipated away.</p>
 <p>It was as though… … the intense battle that had occurred earlier had never happened.</p>
 <p>Tian Lie watched as the blood dissipated off his clothes. Frowning, he turned to look at the distant Nicole.</p>
 <p>“Looks like…. the battle is over?”</p>
 <p>Hearing Tian Lie’s words, Nicole responded with a harrumph. She turned around and patted the sack on her horse.</p>
 <p>The fellow inside the sack grunted out a few times and his body shivered.</p>
 <p>“As long as you are alive, that is good.”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the two of them received a system prompt through their personal systems.</p>
 <p>[System prompt: You have successfully dealt with the interception and killed off all the interceptors, opening the path into Tel Aviv and acquiring the permission to enter Tel Aviv.]</p>
 <p>After reading it, Tian Lie said coolly, “So, this means we can enter Tel Aviv now?”</p>
 <p>“What are you still waiting around for?” Nicole shouted at him from the distance. “If we keep on waiting here, the sky will light up.”</p>
 <p>“There are two more minutes before the system reveals the coordinates of the members of the Demon Faction. I am curious to know where those fellows are.” Tian Lie smiled.</p>
 <p>Nicole looked at her warhorse. “It seems our horses are at their limit. We need to go on foot.”</p>
 <p>Hearing that, Tian Lie shook his head. “We need to get some form of transport….”</p>
 <p>“What is the matter?” Don’t you always like to waste time?”</p>
 <p>“I have this strange suspicion… … if we don’t hurry up to Tel Aviv, we may not have any other chance to enter the city.”</p>
 <p>….</p>
 <p>Tian Lie’s suspicion was right on the money. The two of them abandoned their warhorses and ran to the road. There by the roadside, they found a pickup truck…</p>
 <p>At the same time, the members of Meteor Rock Guild turned the submarine away from the island.</p>
 <p>If the members of Meteor Rock Guild had chosen to go to the island, the system would have determined that the second phase had ended, thereby stopping Nicole and Tian Lie from attempting to enter Tel Aviv, kicking them out of this instance dungeon.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“Another two and a half minutes.”</p>
 <p>Thirteen looked at Chen Xiaolian and said, “Time before the system reveals your coordinates: two minutes twenty-eight seconds.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian looked at Lun Tai. “Are the preparations done?”</p>
 <p>Lun Tai nodded.</p>
 <p>Roddy’s voice came through the guild channel. “Tidal Fighter is ready. You all can come aboard at any moment.”</p>
 <p>Up in the sky above the submarine was the Tidal Fighter. It flew at a low altitude, almost close to sea level, parallel to the submarine.</p>
 <p>Roddy was inside the Tidal Fighter’s cockpit. His hands were operating the controls. “I will be opening the hatch later. Get ready to get on board.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t do it just yet. We still need to wait … another two minutes.” Chen Xiaolian smiled.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“Eh?” Those fellows are heading south… … looking at these coordinates, they are in the sea?”</p>
 <p>Tian Lie, who was seated inside the pickup truck, checked his personal system and said, “These Demon Faction fellows are not in Tel Aviv. They ran to the sea and are heading south.”</p>
 <p>“Maybe those fellows from the Demon Faction have a different storyline from ours,” replied Nicole with a frown. “Is there anything wrong?”</p>
 <p>“Killing one gives 500 points oh. Not to mention, there are additional rewards.” Tian Lie glanced at Nicole. “Don’t tell me you are not tempted. If I can be certain those fellows aren’t Chen Xiaolian and his team, I would surely go hunt them.”</p>
 <p>“Shut your mouth and quickly bring us to Tel Aviv.” Nicole’s face was ugly to behold.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“Heading south?”</p>
 <p>In the square some distance away from the Wailing Wall…</p>
 <p>Shen observed the Wailing Wall that was illuminated by the moonlight. A smile suddenly appeared on his face and he sat down cross-legged. “Quite the cunning fellow…”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>A few minutes later, Chen Xiaolian watched as his team members jumped into the Tidal Fighter. Standing on the submarine, he leapt while keeping the submarine back into his Storage Watch. The moment he landed inside the Tidal Fighter, he shouted to Roddy, “Turn back! Let us head to the damned island!”</p>
 <p>The sounds of air movements came from the Tidal Fighter’s engine and it shot away like an arrow.</p>
 <p>It moved at an incredible speed and the Demon Island’s outline quickly re-appeared before their eyes.</p>
 <p>“This place looks very dangerous.” Lun Tai, who was standing beside Roddy, observed the mountain peak on the floating island and said, “Who knows what could be waiting for us on this island?”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qimu Xi pointed at a spot far away and shouted, “Look!”</p>
 <p>They turned their gazes toward the direction pointed by Qimu Xi. There, under the moonlight, a clump of dark shadows emerged from the other side of the mountain. It flew so fast that the winds whistled around it as it flew in a circle around the mountain peak…</p>
 <p>They all stared at it and were unable to stop themselves from gulping down a breath of cold air.</p>
 <p>So many… .. bats!</p>
 <p>There were over thousands of them and they were all clumped densely together. They appeared like dark clouds, casting an oppressive air down on the scenery…</p>
 <p>As the Tidal Fighter approached the mountain peak above the island, a layer of clouds appeared out of nowhere, shrouding the moonlight and the starry sky. Faint bursts of lightning and rumbling could be heard from within the clouds.</p>
 <p>…</p>
