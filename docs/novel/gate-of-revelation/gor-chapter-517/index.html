 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 517 Let Us Cooperate</strong></p>
 <p>When Gibbs ran out from the yacht like building, Chen Xiaolian was nearly incapable of recognizing him.</p>
 <p>Back in the control room, Gibbs was wearing an Angel Corps uniform – it was something similar to the military uniform seen in sci-fi movies. Presently however, Gibbs was in combat gear.</p>
 <p>It was a composite armoured exoskeleton suit – the configuration done on the suit was very thorough. Exoskeleton armour had been placed over the key joints of the exoskeleton suit. Additionally, energy materials and breastplates were placed on both the chest and the back.</p>
 <p>Weapons were installed onto the waist and legs part of the suit. Moreover, he also wore an [A] class protective suit over the armoured exoskeleton suit.</p>
 <p>Appearance wise, it looked somewhat similar to the Accelerator suits in the G.I. Joe movie. However, it was better configured, more refined, more compact and less bulky.</p>
 <p>At the very least, when Gibbs emerged from the building, his movements were no different to that of an ordinary human – instead, it was more dextrous.</p>
 <p>There behind Gibbs was… … a woman.</p>
 <p>The instant he saw the woman, a look of astonishment appeared on Guan Shan’s face.</p>
 <p>He blurted out. “Tina!”</p>
 <p>Seeing the look of astonishment on Guan Shan’s face, Chen Xiaolian was quick to realize that there was something special about this woman’s identity.</p>
 <p>This woman was very young, with brown hair and a very sweet face. Her skin had a faint sheen of chocolate colour and her body was lean and slender. She wore a skintight full body combat suit. Appearance wise, it appeared to be made of leather – however, Chen Xiaolian knew that was not possible. In fact, he was willing to bet that it was a form of protective suit.</p>
 <p>Appearance wise, she looked somewhat similar to the famous Latin beauty, Jessica Alba. Highly amorous with an angel like smile. In fact, this woman’s facial features were more refined, more perfect.</p>
 <p>After emerging from the building, Gibbs saw Chen Xiaolian and Guan Shan, who were standing before the building. He immediately halted his steps and gazed at the two of them warily.</p>
 <p>He subconsciously made a move. This move by him caused Chen Xiaolian to raise his brows. Gibbs took a step forward to place his body before the woman.</p>
 <p>Those set of movements were done in a very fluid and natural manner.</p>
 <p>“Mr Gibbs,” said Chen Xiaolian solemnly.</p>
 <p>“You are… …” Clearly, Gibbs was unable to recognize Chen Xiaolian. However, when he saw Guan Shan, an odd look overcame his face. “Guan Shan? Why are you here? Did Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild send you?”</p>
 <p>Guan Shan did not say anything. Instead, he turned to Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian exhaled before speaking up again, “Mr Gibbs, the one looking for you is me.”</p>
 <p>“Who are you?” Gibbs cast a frowning look at Chen Xiaolian. “I remember you. Back in the control room, you were standing beside Bluesea. Are you also a member of Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild? Humph… … I am a member of the Angel Corps. But I am already suspended from duty. Why would someone from Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild come looking for me?”</p>
 <p>“I am not a member of Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild,” Chen Xiaolian was quick to reply. “Let’s make this short. We are now in an emergency and there is insufficient time for a good chat. To be precise, I need your help. Rather, I think we should help each other and think of a way to escape this place.”</p>
 <p>“… … …” Gibbs cast an indifferent look at Chen Xiaolian as his hand moved to touch something placed on his waist area. It appeared to be a metal cylinder of sorts. However, Chen Xiaolian was willing to bet that it was some form of energy-tier weapon. “I do not understand what you mean.”</p>
 <p>“No, you understand, of course you understand.” Chen Xiaolian looked Gibbs in the eye and continued, “After leaving the control room, you could have made your way to the main gate and leave. However, you did not do so! Obviously, you realized that the main gate had already become a dangerous place. Moreover… … it would appear that you have no intentions of leaving by yourself. Instead, you came here. Let me guess, that beautiful woman behind you is your girlfriend? Or someone very close to you? That is why the first thing you did after leaving the control room was to come here. You want to bring her along as you escape, right?”</p>
 <p>Gibbs narrowed his eyes and remained silent. However, his eyes were darting around, attempting to find a way to escape.</p>
 <p>“I am his wife.” The beautiful woman behind Gibbs suddenly spoke up. Her voice was very soft and her tone was one of extreme calmness. “We did not have a wedding, but this is Zero City. There is no such thing as weddings in Zero City.”</p>
 <p>Guan Shan’s mouth fell so wide that it would be possible to stuff an egg through it. “Wife? By the Heavens! Gibbs! You sure are something! Rodriar’s beauty! You successfully captured the heart of the beautiful nymph adored by so many in Zero City. You two sure can hide this.”</p>
 <p>“Humph! Guan Shan, now is not the time for nonsense. What are you two up to?” Wariness filled Gibbs’ eyes.</p>
 <p>“Are you not interested in knowing what is going on with the main gate?” asked Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>“I don’t need to even ask.” Gibbs shook his head. “Let me guess, Order 13, right? Humph… … I have read through the plan before. I was involved in the simulation of the plan many times. I was also part of those who improved upon the plan.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, he turned to face Chen Xiaolian before turning to Guan Shan. “Let me guess, the main gate is now besieged, right? If there were nothing wrong with the main gate, you would not be looking for me. You, Guan Shan, you should be beside Bluesea. The fact that you are here means that the main gate cannot be used. There are enemies outside, right? If so, the next step is to implement Order 13. First, use the large-scale Electromagnetic Jammers to shut down the main gate, right? How much time do we have left?”</p>
 <p>“17 minutes and 30 seconds… … oh, it is now down to 29 seconds.” Chen Xiaolian looked at his watch.</p>
 <p>“Then stop wasting my time. Stop blocking my way.” Gibbs turned and took a step to the left. However, Chen Xiaolian quickly stepped before him.</p>
 <p>“What are you doing?” There was a concerned look on Gibbs’ face.</p>
 <p>“Your look is enough to prove me right. Gibbs, you have a way to leave Zero City, right?” asked Chen Xiaolian in a hushed tone.</p>
 <p>“I don’t.” Gibbs shook his head and looked at Chen Xiaolian. “What about you? Who are you and what are you planning?”</p>
 <p>“My name is Chen Xiaolian, the Guild Leader of an outsider guild and a friend to Bluesea. By the way, I was the one in the competition arena for Blood Verdict last month.”</p>
 <p>Hearing about the competition arena, a startled look flashed across Gibbs’ face. A clear look of dread could now be seen on him as he faced Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>The combat power Chen Xiaolian displayed back in the competition arena was sufficient to create an uproar throughout Zero City. The power he unleashed was of the [S] class and he utilized that power to trample and easily kill off his [A] class opponents.</p>
 <p>Facing such a character, Gibss’s hand, which was holding onto his weapon, suddenly tightened. However, his hand finally loosened its grip on the weapon.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian noted Gibbs’ actions.</p>
 <p>“All right, what exactly do you want?” asked Gibbs as he looked at Chen Xiaolian. “Against an expert like you, I will have to admit that I have no way of resisting.”</p>
 <p>“Like I said, I want us to help each other and find a way to leave this place.”</p>
 <p>“Why me?”</p>
 <p>“Because I saw everything that happened in the control room. Back then, you were one of the few smart fellows in the room. Additionally, you are truly knowledgeable about matters regarding Zero City’s system. When it comes to running away from here, I would rather place my bets on a knowledgeable pro.”</p>
 <p>Gibbs did not reply.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian sighed. Next, he displayed a more direct and convincing move.</p>
 <p>He suddenly raised his hand and waved gently with it.</p>
 <p>The streetlamps lining the entire street suddenly turned off.</p>
 <p>Next, Chen Xiaolian waved his hand again and the streetlamps turned on once more.</p>
 <p>Gibbs finally revealed a reaction on his face and he blurted, “You, how did you do that? You… … you hacked Zero City’s lighting control system?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t ask me how I did it. Explaining it would take too long. Right now, I believe I have the right to cooperate with you, no?”</p>
 <p>“… … fine!” Gibbs sighed. “I do have some ideas, which may get us out of here. However… … I cannot be certain. Additionally, we don’t have much time. Let us talk while we move.”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>The young woman named Tina summoned out a flying car before the four of them. Gibbs quickly got into the driver’s seat, Tina got into the first passenger’s seat and both Chen Xiaolian and Guan Shan got into the back seat.</p>
 <p>This car was a form of floating car that utilized a certain anti-gravity technology. It quickly made its way to the oval shaped Board of Patriarchs’ building.</p>
 <p>“We are heading to the Board of Patriarchs’ building?” asked Chen Xiaolian, who was seated behind.</p>
 <p>“More accurately, we are heading to the backup units building behind the Board of Patriarchs’ building.” Gibbs, who was driving, shook his head.</p>
 <p>The car sped through the streets. Then, Gibbs pulled the car higher up into the air and had it sped over the top of the buildings in the city.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian could see the many outsider Awakened ones rushing around like headless flies within the streets of Zero City. However, the actions of some others shocked Chen Xiaolian. They took this opportunity to smash their way into some unguarded buildings that belonged to certain guilds and began robbing the place.</p>
 <p>Many combat personnel continued gathering in the distant central square while aircrafts and tanks gathered around the oval shaped Board of Patriarchs’ building.</p>
 <p>One by one, war fortifications were erected. Powerful turrets, beam and energy-tier ranged-weapons and various other magic array type of equipment were brought out.</p>
 <p>The air around the area was filled with a wondrous glow that was visible to the naked eye.</p>
 <p>“Those are fluctuations from magic power. They are setting up a large-scale magic enchantment.”</p>
 <p>Tina, who was in the first passenger seat, suddenly spoke up, “It seems my guild has finally joined in. That magic array has the unique imprint belonging to my guild. I can recognize it.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian ignored Tina’s words. Instead, he asked Gibbs, “So, you never had the intention of going out through the main gate, right? After leaving the control room, you did not even go to the main gate in the central square. Instead, you went to your wife’s residence to find her and take her away.”</p>
 <p>“I don’t believe those fellows can pull it off.” Gibbs voice suddenly took on a furious tone. Gibbs’ appearance was originally like a civilian, somewhat wooden and scholarly. At this moment, however, his expression twisted greatly as he shouted, “Those fellows are idiots, so many of them are idiots! Occasionally there would be a few smart ones, like Sir Angel Wu and your Guild Leader Bluesea. However, there are too many shackles binding them down and they have no choice but to follow those idiots and commit acts of idiocy.</p>
 <p>“Trust me on this. I know the Angel Corps’ plans of defence very well. In my opinion, that plan is an absolute mistake!”</p>
 <p>“What evidence do you have for those words?” Hearing such an assessment on Bluesea, Guan Shan asked in dissatisfaction.</p>
 <p>“Because Order 13 itself is a stupid plan,” replied Gibbs with a sneer. “Commit a large number of firepower in the central square as we try to damage the invaders. Next, use the south street as the second battlefield to delay the enemy progress. Finally, use the Board of Patriarchs’ building as our last line of defence and wage a battle of life and death against the enemy… … what a joke! A foolish plan!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian sighed and cast a glance at Gibbs. “If so, what do you think should be done?”</p>
 <p>“It is very simple. We should commit our most elite combat personnel and combat powers to the central square! At the very least, an [S] class is needed to help maintain the situation in the central square!</p>
 <p>“Because that is the only way for the enemy to invade. The invaders have to force their way in through the main gate. Only then can they establish themselves by creating a bridgehead to solidify their position here. That is the only way they could ensure a steady flow of reinforcements through the main gate.</p>
 <p>“If I was the commander in charge of defence, I would commit at least one [S] class expert in the central square. Use the power of [S] class to forcibly suppress and smash down the vanguard forces of the invading army. Stop them from establishing a bridgehead and occupying the central square and the main gate. Stop them from casually obtaining reinforcements from the main gate.</p>
 <p>“We should use our strongest combat power right from the beginning to disrupt the enemy’s plan of setting up a bridgehead, that is the most important part.</p>
 <p>“There is a load limit for the main gate. No matter how much the enemy side has, they cannot bring them all in at the same time. They have to send them in bit by bit.</p>
 <p>“That is why there is a need for a powerful existence to stand guard before the main gate. Whenever a batch enters, kill them – that is why an [S] class is needed to defend the gate!</p>
 <p>“Not like this! Appearance wise, it would seem as though we have a lot of combat personnel defending. However, none of them are high-ranking experts! All of them are being held back in the Board of Patriarchs’ building for the final battle… … this is stupidity!</p>
 <p>“At present, the forces deployed in the central square may seem numerous. However, they are all cannon fodder. They simply do not intend to win the fight in the central square. They just want to buy time for the defences of the Board of Patriarchs’ building – but those actions are pointless!</p>
 <p>“Because once the central square is lost, the main gate would belong to the enemy. When that happens, it won’t matter how durable or impregnable our defences in the Board of Patriarchs’ building are. In face of the unlimited enemy forces from the outside, it is only a matter of time before it falls!”</p>
 <p>“So, if we are to act according to your plan, can we win? Stop Zero City from falling?” Guan Shan asked with an unconvinced tone.</p>
 <p>“… … no.” After a few moments of silence, Gibbs answered. “Even if we were to follow my plan, in the end, the results would be the same. However, according to my deductions and calculations, following my plan, we might be able to postpone the inevitable for several hours. Even so, the fall of Zero City would remain inevitable.”</p>
 <p>“If an [S] class expert were to fight with his life on the line, he or she could indeed devastate the invading forces and forcibly hold the place for some time,” said Chen Xiaolian as he nodded. “Stop the enemy from establishing a bridgehead and stop them from casually getting reinforcements. I agree with your plan. But why was it rejected?”</p>
 <p>“Because this is Zero City. The ones in control of Zero City are the Patriarchs,” said Gibbs in a ridiculing tone. “Despite being [S] class, their power is not limitless. This is highly intense battle. Should we successfully hold the gate for minutes or even hours, the enemy side would figure out that something is not right. Thus, they might send in their own [S] class to seize control of the main gate.</p>
 <p>“Thus, the [S] class expert assigned to the central square will most certainly die. That person would either die from exhaustion or killed when the enemy side sends in their own [S] class. In their fatigued state, the enemy [S] class expert would be able to kill them.</p>
 <p>“None of the Patriarchs would accept this plan… … because they are the [S] class experts. Not only that, they are [S] class experts from different guilds. None of them would be so noble as to sacrifice himself or herself up first and leave the rest to the other guilds.”</p>
 <p>“In other words, your plan is not that useful. At any rate, the end result would remain the same and Zero City would still fall, no?” Guan Shan was still unconvinced.</p>
 <p>“Following my plan, we would be able to buy a few more hours of time. In those few hours, there could be some miracles. Maybe… … during those few hours, we might be able to find the way to close the main gate. Or perhaps we might be able to re-activate Zero City’s security protocols.</p>
 <p>“Fighting for time, even if it means a few hours more, one hour, tens of minutes, several minutes, that would mean more hope. Even if just a little bit more, it would still be better than nothing.” Gibbs sneered.</p>
 <p>“We still have 14 minutes and 48 seconds,” said Chen Xiaolian after checking his Storage Watch. “Tell us about your plan.”</p>
 <p>“We are almost there.” As he said that, Gibbs brought the flying car into a swerving motion.</p>
 <p>It circled around the oval shaped Board of Patriarchs’ building, a distance of 500 metres between it and the building.</p>
 <p>There was already a line of defence in the sky, consisting of Sentinel mechs equipped with flying equipment. The flying car flew by and headed toward the area behind the Board of Patriarchs’ building.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was able to recognize the place. This place behind the Board of Patriarchs’ building… … looked like….</p>
 <p>“This is the competition arena?” Chen Xiaolian was slightly shocked. “What are we doing here?”</p>
 <p>“The competition arena and the place where we keep the backup units.” Gibbs brought the flying car to a halt 200 metres away from the competition arena.</p>
 <p>There was a square shaped building before them. Appearance wise, it seemed to be made of all metal and looked like a Rubik’s cube.</p>
 <p>The building was around 200 metres to the right side of the competition arena. Chen Xiaolian sensed something dangerous about the metallic glow coming off the surface of the building.</p>
 <p>“Welcome to the Rubik’s Cube.” Gibbs jumped down the car and walked toward a circular door. Light flashed out to scan Gibbs body and it quickly turned green in colour.</p>
 <p>Gibbs turned around and said, “Stand there and do not move. Don’t touch anything as well. The defences of the Rubik’s Cube are very strong. So, if you do not want to be atomized by the energy-tier weapons here…”</p>
 <p>Gibbs quickly rushed in through the circular door. A few seconds later, his head poked out from the door. “All right, come in! I have temporarily disabled the defence system. However, it will only last for 15 seconds. Hurry!”</p>
 <p>The three of them rushed in through the door and saw spiral-shaped staircases before them. Those staircases were everywhere. No matter which direction they turned, there would be tens of such staircases facing them.</p>
 <p>“The Rubik’s Cube building… … so this is how its interior looks like.” Guan Shan was unable to stop himself from exclaiming.</p>
 <p>“How did you disable this place’s defence system?” Chen Xiaolian looked at Gibbs.</p>
 <p>Gibbs quickly inputted something into a control panel on the wall. He replied casually, “Because I was originally one of the fellows’ in-charge of this place. Additionally… … I was one of those who helped design the outer defence system for this Rubik’s Cube building… done! These fellows sure are lazy. I have been transferred away for such a long time now, but they did not even execute a thorough scan. They did not find the secondary secret defence pass that I left behind.”</p>
 <p>“English, man. I don’t get your technical jargons!” Chen Xiaolian muttered in dissatisfaction.</p>
 <p>“It is very simple. Before getting transferred, I left a little backdoor in this system. That is how I can access this place’s defence system and bring you all inside. It is that simple.”</p>
 <p>“That… … that is a violation of the security protocols! That is a serious violation!” said Guan Shan with a frown.</p>
 <p>“So? Do you want to report me now?” Gibbs rolled his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Enough, dearie. I said before, don’t be mean. We are now cooperating with each other.” Tina walked forward, tugged Gibbs’ hand and whispered gently to him.</p>
 <p>“Fine, you are always right.” Gibbs looked at Tina with eyes as gentle as water.</p>
 <p>Next, this tech geek snapped his fingers.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>A spiral-shaped staircase quietly descended from above and onto the floor.</p>
 <p>Gibbs pulled Tina up the spiral-shaped staircase. He also turned to look at Chen Xiaolian and said, “Hurry up. Whether we can make it out or not would depend on whether my guess is right or wrong.”</p>
 <p>After the four of them had ascended the staircase, it quickly spun and disappeared into the heart of the building.</p>
