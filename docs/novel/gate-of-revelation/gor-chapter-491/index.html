 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 491 Strange</strong></p>
 <p>A sneering expression flitted across this Aunt Flame’s face as she slowly walked over. Her graceful body wrapped in red coloured leather clothes seemingly swayed as she moved.</p>
 <p>And yet, despite her alluring beauty, no one was in the mood to appreciate her beauty.</p>
 <p>The remaining low lives looked at Aunt Flame as one would treat an evil spirit. She had just caused someone’s head to blow up like a watermelon with the snap of her fingers. Under such circumstances, how could they remain calm?</p>
 <p>Some of them were so terrified, they pissed in their pants as they stood there, trembling uncontrollably. Although their minds screamed at them to run as fast as possible, their legs were unable to comply. As for the others, they were on all fours as they puked to the point of puking out their bile.</p>
 <p>It did not matter what you call them. Thugs, low lives, they were all ordinary humans. Normally, they would only be involved in bravado and fight. However, in this critical moment, after seeing someone kill humans as one would kill chickens, the fact that some of them could still stand without falling to their knees was a feat in itself.</p>
 <p>Aunt Flame walked over and the low lives did not even have the strength to crawl away. As for the stalwart man, he gripped the shoulder pole tightly. His face was twisted. However, as a former soldier who had seen many deaths in the battlefield, he was able to maintain a straight posture in face of the woman’s shocking and magical act of brutally murdering the low lives.</p>
 <p>Fatty however, was in far worse shape.</p>
 <p>His teeth were shuddering to the point of making chattering noises and his legs jittery as he looked at Aunt Flame. “You, you, you are here…”</p>
 <p>Aunt Flame gave a harrumph. She casually pointed out with her fingers and the heads of the two low lives beside her exploded. Their bodies then melted into a pool of mud. When that happened, the other low lives seemingly regained the courage to run for their lives. They jumped up and began dispersing in every direction. Aunt Flame merely sneered and snapped her fingers in succession.</p>
 <p>The heads of the low lives that ran into the wheat fields burst apart. They only managed to run a distance of ten metres before falling into the wheat fields.</p>
 <p>The stalwart man felt his throat go dry. He stared at the woman and said, “You, just what are you? What kind of… … monster…”</p>
 <p>Aunt Flame stared at the stalwart man for a moment. For an instant, something strange seemingly flickered across her eyes. However, she abruptly ignored the stalwart man and moved before Fatty. She raised her hand and sent a slap forward.</p>
 <p>This slap of hers caused Fatty to stagger backward.</p>
 <p>Fatty clutched his face but was too fearful to even go hide. He simply looked at the woman&nbsp; in terror.</p>
 <p>“Tell me, am I not in the right in slapping you?”</p>
 <p>Fatty’s cheek had turned red, but he nodded his head vigorously and said, “Right! Right! You are right to slap me! No matter what, you are always right!”</p>
 <p>“Haven’t I always treated you well, little Fatty? Could that bastard Bluesea have treated you better than me?” Aunt Flame pointed at the stalwart man. “If I had not personally found out something strange going on with him and come investigate, I would probably be kept in the dark by you fellows! Humph! Something like this… you dare hide something like this from me?!”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Aunt Flame was standing beside Fatty. The light from the reception room shone on her, allowing the stalwart man to see the woman’s facial features.</p>
 <p>His face was originally that of one facing a great enemy. However, after carefully scrutinizing the woman’s face, his expression changed greatly.</p>
 <p>A look of utter disbelief took hold of his face and he stared intently at the woman. He then opened his mouth and exclaimed loudly, “Ah! You, you… You! It’s you!”</p>
 <p>Aunt Flame turned her head around and cast a complicated gaze at the stalwart man. “Me, me, me, me, what about me? Just because I put on some makeup, you can’t recognize me?”</p>
 <p>The stalwart man’s body gave a shudder. “You are… … you are Ah Yu? You are Ah Yu? Ah Yu?!! How is this possible? This cannot be! No way! You, you, how could you be so young?”</p>
 <p>The woman that Fatty had called Aunt Flame, after hearing the stalwart man call her Ah Yu, raised her eyebrows in response. She was unable to stop her expression from flickering somewhat. “Hmm, Ah Yu. It has been a long time since people called me that.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, she studied the stalwart man for a moment. Then, the light in her eyes faded with disappointment. “You are Da Feng, but… … you are no longer Skyblade.”</p>
 <p>The stalwart man wanted to say something. However, Ah Yu quickly flashed behind him and sent a finger to poke his head from behind. The stalwart man’s eyes rolled over and he fell to the ground.</p>
 <p>Fatty, who was beside him, reacted quickly. He caught the stalwart man in an embrace and turned to regard Ah Yu.</p>
 <p>“What are you looking at? Did you think I would actually hurt him?” Ah Yu glared at Fatty, scaring him until he shrunk his head back. “Knock him unconscious first, then slowly explain things to him later. There is a need to properly consider how to tell him about the multitude of things involved here.”</p>
 <p>“But, but…” Fatty held his own father in an embrace and smiled wryly before saying, “Aunt Flame, the way you made an entrance is too shocking. The moment you came, you started a rampage. Could it be, err … … too much?”</p>
 <p>The woman sneered. “Too much? Humph! Of all things for you to pick up while staying by Bluesea all these years, you ended up picking up his indecisive character! These fellows came to trouble your father. By chasing them away, did you think they would never come again? Do you plan on staying here forever to protect your father? You pulled out a gun this night, but you did not finish them off. Instead, you let them go. What will you do when they bring the cops here? Would your gun be useful then? Or do you plan on pulling out a mech? Children, always acting in such a careless manner. I had helped you dealt with all of them. Isn’t that better?”</p>
 <p>“But, but these fellows ended up dying here for no reason…”</p>
 <p>“Their bodies had turned to fertilizers.” Aunt Flame sneered before continuing, “As for where these people disappeared to all of a sudden, who knows? This is a farming village, not a city. There are no surveillance system here. When the police are investigating their disappearance, would the other side come out and say that they sent these men to harm your father? Even if they did decide to say that, your father is only one man. The police would never believe that your father is the one behind their disappearance.”</p>
 <p>“But, but you killed so many people so quickly…”</p>
 <p>“One more low life like these in this world means the world becomes that much filthier. So what if I killed them? There is nothing to it.” After a pause, Aunt Flame then continued coolly, “Even if one of them did not commit a crime deserving of death, must I ask them if they deserve death?”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian and Bluesea stood in the central area of the oval shaped building. There was a large elevator here. However, it went all the way down.</p>
 <p>Tens of people stood on a metal plate that protruded out from the ground. These people were clearly visitors who came because Zero City was open.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian watched as the elevator within the oval shaped building continued to descend. He was unable to stop himself from feeling curious and he looked around. Then, he asked Bluesea, “Who are these people? Are they also visitors?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>“This… this is Board of Patriarchs’ building! Also, aren’t you bringing me to Zero City’s main control system? Anyone can go in and visit that place?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>Seeing the look of indifference on Bluesea’s face, Chen Xiaolian became utterly speechless.</p>
 <p>The main control system of Zero City… … how would it look like?</p>
 <p>…</p>
