 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lu Leiya looked long and hard at Chen Xiaolian. Finally, he gritted his teeth and nodded his head slowly. “I… understand.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He inhaled deeply a few times to raise his spirits. Then, he slowly spoke up, “I… … it hasn’t been that long since I came to this town. However, I arrived in this afterlife world much earlier, earlier than even brother Bluesea.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That day… … I was standing on the roof of a high-rise building, thinking about how my wife cuckolded me, how I lost my job, how I incurred millions in gambling debt with skyhigh interest… … how I am better off dead. I downed half a bottle of sorghum wine and jumped down the building.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“However… … I woke up to find myself lying within a forest. Its… … a rainforest filled with trees.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Back then… … I thought I was dreaming…. … I walked aimlessly through that untouched rainforest. I walked and walked… … I don’t even know how long I walked; all I knew then was that I was feeling thirsty and hungry. I wanted to drink some water and eat some meat, but there were none to be found in the forest…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“As I was about to faint, I heard a strange series of sounds coming from the front…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I practically crawled my way forward to find the source of the sound. Then, I saw… … a woman!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That woman… … is very beautiful! More beautiful compared with any of the actresses in the movies! Her right hand held the arm of a little child, a boy, who followed her… … the little boy looks very strange. His head… … there is a clump of fire on top of his head.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Wait. A little boy?” Chen Xiaolian furrowed his brows. “How old is the boy? And how old is the woman?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The little boy… … looks around 11 or 12 years old. As for the woman… …” Lu Leiya racked his mind to recall. “I cannot figure it out… … sometimes, she looks to be in her twenties; sometimes, she looks to be in her thirties… … however, when she smiles, she looks like a teenager…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian sighed and nodded. “Continue, then.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Listening to Lu Leiya’s description, that woman was likely not Qiao Qiao.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, since Bluesea had brought this man to meet Chen Xiaolian, it must mean… … his story should be somewhat helpful.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lu Leiya continued, “After walking through the forest for so long, I finally met another human. So, I quickly ran forward. I wanted to ask her where I was and why I would appear there.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“However… … that woman simply ignored me… … when I spoke to her, she simply sent a cold glance my way before leading the little boy away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“But when the little boy looked at me, he suddenly pulled the woman’s hand and said, “Aunt Yun, this uncle looks like he is very hungry. Let’s give him some of our food.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“When the woman known as Aunt Yun heard the little boy’s words, she immediately… … pulled out a number of food and water from who knows where and tossed them to my feet. Even then, her face remained indifferent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I picked up the food and was about to thank her when…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When he reached that part of the story, a hint of fear flashed across Lu Leiya’s eyes. He paused for a moment before continuing, “From far away… … the sounds of trees falling down suddenly rang out. It sounded as though all the trees in the rainforest were made of paper. I watched as the distant canopy fell non-stop, moving toward us… … it was like… … like a T-Rex was charging through the forest!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Then, I saw him… … a man who looked as tough as a cow walked out from the forest! Behind him rested all the collapsed trees! He… … he was at least three metres tall and the muscles on his body were convulsing non-stop. When he saw the three of us, he suddenly displayed a ferocious grin. Cracking his fists, he walked over… … I still remember what he said… … “Excellent, got three all at once.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“After saying that, with just a wave of his hand, he cut down the tree beside him! He… … he held the cut tree like how one would hold a firestick. And then, he swung the tree down upon the three of us!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I… … back then, I was completely terrified! I don’t understand why… … the moment he saw us, he wanted to kill us! I was so terrified, my legs turned limp and I was unable to muster even the strength to run away… I shut my eyes, thinking that I was a goner…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As he spoke, Lu Leiya wringed his arms. Due to how hard he was wringing his arms; the whites of his bones could be seen. There was a strained smile on his face as he said, “I had just thrown myself off a building with the purpose of dying, but… … at that moment, not even knowing what was going on, I was about to die a second time. I was simply… … simply unwilling… …</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“However, after I shut my eyes, the tree did not descend…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Opening my eyes, I saw that the woman was standing in the same spot. With one hand, she actually… actually stopped the tree above her head!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That cut tree was tens of metres in length. Two of me cannot even wrap our arms around it… … it was one thing for that muscular and brawny fellow with his mysterious strength to hold the tree, but the woman has a clear delicate look. She is not even as tall as me. Yet, someone like that managed to stop the tree with just one hand. Additionally…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lu Leiya took a deep breath. “Despite exerting himself to the point where his face turned red, the muscular fellow was unable to move the tree! As for the woman… … she had her back against me and I was unable to see her face. However, I could sense that she was in a nonchalant state. It was as though she did not have to exert any strength to stop the tree…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Next, I heard the woman say something… she said: “All these years, World’s End has always been a place where everyone minds their own business. Yet, you have now attacked me. What is the meaning of this?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That muscular man… … he struggled to pull back the tree. However, no matter how much he struggled, he could not move it at all. Gritting his teeth, he said, “So, you are an Irregularity? If that is the case, follow me back. Once the Coalition proves your innocence, everything will be all right. The ones we want to kill, are the Awakened ones.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“After that, they exchanged some words. I don’t quite recall the details of their conversation. I just remember the mention of… … clearing, refresh, and something about Awakened ones and Irregularities… … back then, I was utterly terrified, so much so that my mind was in a state of chaos. I don’t understand what they were talking about at all. In the end, the muscular man said that if the woman chooses not to follow him, it will be just a matter of time before even more fellows come after her. Something about what the Coalition is doing is for the sake of protecting Irregularities. The Coalition will not kill others at whim, only the traitor who had betrayed all of the Irregularities. However, if she kills someone from the Coalition, that was the equivalent of becoming an enemy of the Coalition and she would be hunted to her death.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“After that… … the woman sneered. With a push of her hand, she threw the tree onto the ground. Then, she casually plucked a branch from the tree…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The branch was only as thick as a finger and no more than one metre in length… … the woman cleared the branch of the leaves sticking to it and walked toward the muscular man… … and she… she…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lu Leiya raised his head to reveal a face filled with fear. After a lengthy pause, he continued, “Using the branch, she gave the muscular man’s body a light hit. I swear! It was just a light hit. After that, the muscular man’s face sank! From white to red, then to purple, then… … then, his entire body turned into a pile of mud! Just like that, he came crashing down!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That woman… … after what she did, she tossed the branch away, turned around and walked until she was standing before me. I was so scared, I dared not even more. I thought… … I thought that she wanted to kill me. However, all she did was point in a certain direction and say, “Move there. You will reach the next instance dungeon area. There, you can find food and water.” … … after that, she led the little boy with her and left…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That’s it?” Chen Xiaolian knitted his brows.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No…” Lu Leiya lowered his head. “Before she left, the little boy, whom she was pulling, spoke up… … he asked, “Aunt Yun, is what the man said true? This world will be destroyed?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The woman shook her head and smiled before saying, “Even if it will be destroyed, I will accompany you until that day arrives. Every day I accompany you is time we get to spend together.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“After that, I watched as the two of them walked away… … I remain seated on the ground. After a long time, I finally recovered some of my strength. Carrying the food and water the woman left me, I walked in the direction that she had pointed out…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It took me about one day’s worth of walking to make it out of the rainforest… … I kept wandering about for a long time before finally reaching this place…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After Lu Leiya was finally done with his long story, he released a sigh of relief and his body fell limply on the sofa.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian grew silent for a moment. Then, he reached out with his hand to hold Lu Leiya. “Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After that, he turned to Bluesea. “Thank you, too, Mr Bluesea.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“About what he said earlier, that the world is going to be destroyed… … do you already know something about it?” Bluesea stared at Chen Xiaolian. “I remember you spent quite some time talking with the fellow who transformed into the snake-headed dragon back on the bridge.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes.” Chen Xiaolian nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You promised to tell me everything after we reached this town.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If so, tell me.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… … …” Chen Xiaolian hesitated for a moment before sighing. “Fine.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea frowned. “You… … feel reluctant?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No.” Chen Xiaolian shook his head. “It’s nothing. About this world…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
