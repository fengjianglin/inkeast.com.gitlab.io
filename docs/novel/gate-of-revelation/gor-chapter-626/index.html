 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 626 </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya looked at the sword that Chen Xiaolian was slowly lifting upward. A serious look had appeared on his snake face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although his right arm had yet to fully recover, a sphere of light had begun to consolidate upon his left palm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Through his instinct as a powerhouse, Wu Ya was able to sense that Chen Xiaolian was gradually pushing himself to his limit.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was not that he was reluctant to initiate an attack. Earlier, he had barely managed to block off Chen Xiaolian’s attack through the use of his right arm, crippling it in the process. Thus, Wu Ya understood just how powerful Chen Xiaolian’s sword attack was.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, in order to take on Chen Xiaolian’s earlier attack, he had to hastily transform. Yet, despite pushing himself to his limit, he was unable to complete his transformation. That was why his right arm was crippled in the process. Now, despite having completed the transformation, he found that he had used up too much strength.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although he had begun initiating his sphere of light skill, he will need a certain amount of time before it could be fully formed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>All Wu Ya could do at the moment was to exert himself to consolidate the sphere of light while staring at the sword in Chen Xiaolian’s hands, which continued to rise up slowly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A transient golden light shimmered around the sword. This time, the golden light was not flowing through the sword. Instead, it formed an illusory silhouette of a long sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>For every inch the sword rose up, the golden sword silhouette grew by a notch and its outline grew even clearer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The aura exuding from Chen Xiaolian’s body, too, intensified.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>This kid, could he also be [S] class?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The moment Wu Ya thought of that, he dispelled that thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>For Players, Awakened ones and Irregularities, there were many system props which they could use to change their appearances. However, after entering the Recycle Bin, all those props would disappear.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In other words, no one in World’s End will grow old. At the same time, their appearance will remain similar to that of their time of death.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The youngster before him appeared to be roughly 16 or 17 years old. Even if he did have some fortuitous encounters, how could someone this young reach [S] class?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>So far, Wu Ya had only met a small handful of [S] class Irregularities.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, the aura emanating from Chen Xiaolian and the gigantic golden sword silhouette forming in the sky was something that only an [S] class expert could possess.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Unlike Wu Ya, who was in a state of shock, Chen Xiaolian was calm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian had discarded all other thoughts from his mind. At that moment, all within Heaven and Earth did not exist. The only thing his eyes could see was Wu Ya.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Skyblade’s power surged through his entire body and flowed out from his arms into the sword that he was holding.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The more power he poured into the sword, the heavier it became; as the sword continued to rise inch by inch, every inch required a great deal of strength.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Finally, both his hands were atop his head and the gigantic golden sword created from the golden light was in the same position as the sword in his hands; erect, rising all the way up to the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At the same time, the sphere of light on Wu Ya’s left palm had fully formed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The sphere of light was bigger and even more dazzling compared to the one Wu Ya had used to kill the mature Karra beast. It swirled rapidly within Wu Ya’s palm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His right arm had stopped bleeding; however, it was not fully recovered. The shattered bones of the right arm were unable to support the arm and it hung limply. Despite that, Wu Ya no longer had the time to wait for it to recover.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He lifted up his left arm. With a quick twist of his body, Wu Ya then hurled the sphere of light down at Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Die, you insect!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“My blade, is for hacking!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Facing the descending sphere of light, Chen Xiaolian felt as though Skyblade’s words were resonating within his ears.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>What he held in his hands no longer mattered. Be it a blade, a sword, an axe, or a hammer, only one thought remained in Chen Xiaolian’s mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Hack it!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Following Wu Ya’s roar, Chen Xiaolian swung down both his arms.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The sword hacked down, bringing the gigantic golden sword down with it to hack the incoming sphere of light.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The vast force gathered into the sword was like a reservoir filled to the brim with water, thrashing about to find a way out, only to be held back by Chen Xiaolian. At that very moment, however, it was as though a gap had opened up on the reservoir and that power surged out all at once.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The gigantic golden sword descended, seemingly at in incomparably slow rate. However, it also moved with seemingly incomparable swiftness to meet Wu Ya’s sphere of light.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The gigantic golden sword struck the sphere of light. Shockingly, no explosion erupted. Not even the sound of collision could be heard.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The gigantic golden sword remained in a peculiar state of stillness, in contact with the sphere of light. It was as though it had come to a grinding halt.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya gnashed his snake fangs as his red tongue continued swinging about on the outside. His body, however, was unmoving as he continued hovering in the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Likewise, the sword in Chen Xiaolian’s hands stopped halfway in its descent. Just like the gigantic golden sword in the sky, the sword in his hands could not advance any further.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Two fearsome power had clearly clashed against one another. Yet, at that very moment, the entire area entered instead into a peculiar state of stillness, similar to the surface of a tranquil lake.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Still.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Still.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The stillness continued.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After an unknown amount of time had passed, Wu Ya suddenly released a loud roar.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The sphere of light suddenly expanded by several notches, engulfing the gigantic golden sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Insect! You are… … not [S] class!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya released a savage roar of laughter, which echoed throughout the bridge. However, it also contained traces of weakness.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Now, die! Insect!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After having engulfed the gigantic golden sword, the white sphere of light slowly descended upon Chen Xiaolian, who remained on the bridge. The sphere of light moved unobstructed, descending like a vast mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even so, Chen Xiaolian did not move to dodge. Both his hands continued holding onto the sword as he maintained his earlier stance.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His eyes continued to stare at the sphere of light. There was neither fear nor despair in his eyes, only pure determination.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Break!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Clenching his teeth, Chen Xiaolian then released his own roar.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The advancing sphere of light suddenly came to a halt. Once again, the peculiar state of stillness entered the area.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Next, a faint golden light shone out from within the sphere of light.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In the beginning, the golden light was only a faint existence, almost fleeting in quality. In the blink of an eye, however, it grew increasingly concentrated and its light shone out in every direction.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The expression on Wu Ya’s snake face sank.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, it was too late.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The golden light grew increasingly concentrated and the sphere of light silently broke apart, unravelling away in the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After breaking out from the sphere of light, the gigantic golden sword had grown even more dazzling compared to before and it moved forward in a hacking motion. Its target, Wu Ya.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya howled out furiously. Forming a fist with his left palm, he sent it out to take on the gigantic golden sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This time, a world shaking explosive sound broke out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya released a miserable shriek as the gigantic golden blade sent his colossal body flying. His entire left arm disappeared amid a shower of blood which rained down on the ground beneath him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As for the gigantic golden sword, it too, unravelled into nothingness.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Only then did the sword in Chen Xiaolian’s hands manage to successfully hack down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When the tip of the sword touched the surface of the ground, Chen Xiaolian’s chest heaved rapidly and his face turned pale.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Since entering World’s End, he had had to use Skyblade’s power too many times. In the earlier fights, he had not pushed Skyblade’s power to its limit due to the limitation in weaponry. However, that single attack he just unleashed was one without reservation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Given his present physique, that single attack was his limit.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Every cell within his body felt as though it was being prodded by needles; all of them eagerly transmitting sensations of intense pain throughout his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A soft breaking sound rang out from the sword in his hand as it broke. Beginning from the tip of the sword, all the way to the hilt, it shattered into powdery fragments before drifting away in the wind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian gave a muffled grunt as he lost the support of his sword. No longer able to stand, he fell to his knees.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Yet, his waist remained straight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His face appeared drained of blood. Even so, Chen Xiaolian kept his head upright and he looked at the hurtling figure of Wu Ya.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After getting struck by the sword, Wu Ya’s body became like an artillery blast, flying backward at the high-rise buildings of Manhattan.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The buildings that he was falling toward just so happened to be standing side by side; two skyscrapers towering high into the clouds.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Twin Towers!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya’s colossal body slammed into the central position of 1 WTC, breaking right through it. However, the momentum behind his fall remained strong and he continued to smash into the second tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After smashing into the two buildings in succession, the momentum behind Wu Ya’s fall was finally stopped. Following a deafening rumble, hundreds of thousands of tonnes of concrete and steel bars that were no longer able to support the structure of the buildings came crashing down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian, who was kneeling on one knee, watched all that was transpiring with his right fist on the ground, providing support. For some unknown reason, seeing the collapse of the two buildings made him reveal a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Naturally, Chen Xiaolian had not personally witnessed the collapse of the two towers in the outside world. All he saw regarding the incident were some videos on the internet then.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Never in his wildest imaginations did he think that he would one day witness the collapsing scene of the two most famous buildings in human history.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Additionally – the one who caused their collapse, was him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In the distance, the group of four watched as Chen Xiaolian’s sword attack sent the shocking monster flying into the Twin Towers, causing it to collapse. It took them a few seconds to register the rumbling sounds caused by the collapse.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea then looked behind at the three who were seated at the back. All three had dumbfounded looks on the faces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Meanwhile, Chen Xiaolian, who was still on the bridge far away, was kneeling on one knee, not budging at all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Without showing any hesitation, Bluesea pushed the gear stick and stepped on the accelerator, sending the SUV forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Only after a few seconds had passed did Grace recollect herself. She screamed out sharply, “Bluesea! What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Retrieving him.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Are you crazy? Those two fellows are monsters! Monsters! The four of us are just ordinary humans. What can we do?” Grace gripped the front seat’s backrest tightly and shouted, “You are just going to your own death!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Bluesea, Chen Xiaolian told us to wait for him here. You…” While not as panicky as Grace, terror could clearly be heard within Daniel’s voice. “Grace is right. We are just ordinary humans. What can we contribute in a battle against monsters? Even a minor shockwave from their exchange can disintegrate us!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Stop the SUV! Stop it, Bluesea! You fool!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The SUV continued barrelling forward, having moved onto the bridge as it rapidly made its way toward Chen Xiaolian. Seeing that Bluesea was ignoring her, Grace moved to grab hold of Bluesea’s hair and pulled it back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Let go.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The black muzzle of a gun appeared before Grace’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yang Lin… … you… … did you go crazy as well?” Grace looked with widened eyes, a look of utter disbelief on her face as she turned toward Yang Lin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Let go, Grace. Don’t force me to open fire.” Yang Lin cast a cold look at Grace and pulled the hammer on the gun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Grace, let go! Hurry and let go! This guy will fire!” Sweat oozed out from Daniel’s palms.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>While Grace may not have realized it, Daniel had already seen the determination in Yang Lin’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Should Grace choose to not let go, Yang Lin would likely open fire for real.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Grace turned to look at the anxious expression on Daniel’s face before looking back at the black muzzle of the gun. Then, she slowly released her hold on Bluesea’s hair.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Yang Lin, too, slowly put down his gun. However, his eyes continued to watch over Grace in a wary manner.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>During the whole thing, Bluesea had not spoken a single word.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Their SUV sped across the surface of the bridge and it quickly came up from behind Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Hearing the roar of the engine, Chen Xiaolian hastily turned around to see Bluesea driving the SUV toward him. There were only a few hundred metres between the SUV and him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Go back!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, Chen Xiaolian’s shouts failed to reach Bluesea’s ears.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Soon, the SUV came to a sudden halt behind Chen Xiaolian. Bluesea jumped out from the SUV and moved over to prop up Chen Xiaolian. “Get on the SUV, quick!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mr Bluesea, you…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian looked at Bluesea. Then, with a bitter smile, he shook his head and pushed Bluesea’s hand away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Chen Xiaolian! What are you dawdling about?” Bluesea, who was shocked by Chen Xiaolian’s move, asked with a frown.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian sighed. “He is not dead yet.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A few kilometres away, a thunderous roar rang out from beneath the ruins of the collapsed Twin Towers, shaking its way through the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The heavy blocks of concrete flew explosively outward. It was as though a celestial being was scattering flowers through the sky, covering it with the blocks of concrete.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The colossal monster emerged from the ruins and vaulted up into the air. Next, it flew toward the bridge once more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
