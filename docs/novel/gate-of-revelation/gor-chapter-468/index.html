 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 468 I Am Very Satisfied</strong></p>
 <p>[You are here now.]</p>
 <p>Seeing that prompt, Lun Tai’s body froze.</p>
 <p><em>I… … am here.</em></p>
 <p><em>That is why I am not coming back to save my little bro…</em></p>
 <p>This one thought roared through Lun Tai’s mind.</p>
 <p>He did not consider anything else, nor did he attempt to consider if there was anything wrong with the situation.</p>
 <p>[Now, you have a choice. Will you, for the sake of saving your little brother, kill that man?]</p>
 <p>“I…”</p>
 <p>Lun Tai looked forward.</p>
 <p>The man picked up the wrench and struck his little brother’s arm heavily with it. His little brother’s screams caused the corners of Lun Tai’s eyes to twitch.</p>
 <p>His little brother was unable to run away. His legs were injured and his body jerked about in an attempt to dodge even as he curled himself up.</p>
 <p>The man, with the wrench in hand, had a grim and twisted expression on his face. He walked over, step by step….</p>
 <p>This man… … was someone he had once called ‘father’.</p>
 <p><em>Kill… him?</em></p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“Do you know? I hate you a lot! Hate!”</p>
 <p>Xia Xiaolei panted. He slapped Qimu Xi, sending her flying before looking down at the bite wound on his arm.</p>
 <p>He glared at Qimu Xi, who was struggling to get up. “Of course, in the beginning, I did not hate you. But you are too useless! Guild Leader and the others are all outstanding individuals, all amazing! You? In this guild, you have contributed nothing!</p>
 <p>“Everyone is risking their lives here! Their lives!</p>
 <p>“Guild Leader had revealed his biggest secret to us! He really considers us as family!</p>
 <p>“But your existence, your existence will be the death of Guild Leader! You are just a burden!</p>
 <p>“Besides crying, screaming, being afraid, trembling, running… … what else can you do?</p>
 <p>“You cannot do any *** thing!</p>
 <p>“Whenever something dangerous happens, you will need someone else to save you! Whenever there is a situation, you will tremble and hide!</p>
 <p>“What qualifications do you have to stay inside this guild? You will end up killing Guild Leader!</p>
 <p>“He is so kindhearted, so powerful… only to be burdened by someone like you!</p>
 <p>“Someone like you have no right to stay in our guild!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“Sister, I really do not know what to do.” Soo Soo looked at Qiao Qiao and she suddenly whispered out. “Sister, when I return home, if I were to go ask sister’s father about this, how do you think he will answer?</p>
 <p>“I think, he would be like you now.”</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao was unable to say anything. She could only use all her strength to embrace Soo Soo.</p>
 <p>She was simply unable to answer Soo Soo’s question.</p>
 <p>Because she was very clear on one thing.</p>
 <p>In the secular world, the one responsible for all the matters involving Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild was her father, Qiao Yifeng.</p>
 <p>Soo Soo’s voice softly came out from Qiao Qiao’s bosom.</p>
 <p>“Sister, I don’t want to hurt you… … I also don’t want to hurt sister’s daddy… … what should I do then? I… … maybe, I can only hurt myself.”</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao’s body flinched and she quickly loosened her embrace. She looked at Soo Soo and found that her body was gradually turning cold.</p>
 <p>“Cannot hurt sister, cannot hurt sister’s father. If so, I can only kill this self… … if I cannot get revenge, it will hurt me a lot since I cannot forget daddy and mommy’s death… … but if I hurt sister, I will also feel hurt…”</p>
 <p>“Soo Soo!” Qiao Qiao grabbed Soo Soo’s shoulders only to see that Soo Soo’s eyes were closing.</p>
 <p>The warmth in her body seemed to be rapidly dissipating.</p>
 <p>“What are you doing? Soo Soo!”</p>
 <p>“I am killing myself… … I am releasing all the warmth in my body out…”</p>
 <p>“Stop it! Stop it!”</p>
 <p>“Just release all of it out and everything will be fine.” Soo Soo raised her head. Her hand was holding onto a dagger and she… … stabbed the dagger into her own stomach.</p>
 <p>“A a a a argh!!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>[So, what is your choice?</p>
 <p>[Kill him, or watch as he kills your little brother?]</p>
 <p>Lun Tai trembled.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“Come on, kill me.” Roddy looked straight at Nicole, who landed gently before him. He watched as the military blade in Nicole’s hand slowly moved toward him. He closed his eyes. “I will stay here with you forever.”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>BOOM!</p>
 <p>The world came crashing down!</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Everything broke into fragments and disappeared as the whole world collapsed.</p>
 <p>It was as though a multi-coloured glass had been broken. The colourful patterns on the glass then disintegrated along with the broken glass.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao held onto Soo Soo tightly, embracing Soo Soo with all her might.</p>
 <p>Darkness surrounded them.</p>
 <p>The flaming house, the fire, the blood, all of it disappeared.</p>
 <p>The Soo Soo in her arms was real and Qiao Qiao shook Soo Soo before reaching out to feel Soo Soo’s stomach but found no dagger. There was no blood either…</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao became somewhat relieved.</p>
 <p><em>It is… over?</em></p>
 <p><em>Why is it over?</em></p>
 <p>As the thought struck her, a bright light suddenly illuminated her surroundings.</p>
 <p>Countless lights shone out to reveal a cavern, a large, round shaped cavern.</p>
 <p>The wall of the circular cavern was inlaid with various gems, gold and jewellery. They were arranged in a close pattern and were astonishingly dazzling.</p>
 <p>Under the illumination of the countless lights, they sparkled brilliantly.</p>
 <p>Within this circular cavern, Qiao Qiao saw, not far to her left…</p>
 <p>Xia Xiaolei and Qimu Xi were tussling with each other on the ground.</p>
 <p>There on the other side was Lun Tai, his face grim as he knelt on the ground. His chest rose up and down as he panted.</p>
 <p>And Roddy.</p>
 <p>Roddy too, was kneeling there with his eyes closed, not saying a word. He seemed to be waiting for something.</p>
 <p>All of it…</p>
 <p>Was wrong!</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao felt her mind rapidly clearing up. Just now, when she was stuck inside the illusion, her mind was seemingly under someone else’s control. She was unable to think matters through properly and could only follow one line of thought, desperately wasting her time on a problem that could not be solved.</p>
 <p>After that, it was as though she was caught in a logic trap and was unable to escape…</p>
 <p>Only now did her mind felt at ease.</p>
 <p>She lowered her head to look at Soo Soo. There was a confused look in Soo Soo’s eyes as she stared into the distance.</p>
 <p>Her face was emotionless.</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao’s heart sank.</p>
 <p>“We… … what happened?”</p>
 <p>Xia Xiaolei gently loosened his grip on Qimu Xi, who shrunk backward with a terror-stricken face.</p>
 <p>The both of them looked at each other, tangled expressions washing over their faces.</p>
 <p>Although they had managed to escape the illusion… … they could not forget what happened inside the illusion.</p>
 <p>However, their minds were no longer awash with rage and they were able to calm down.</p>
 <p>Even so, the things that happened just now, the things that were said…</p>
 <p>Qimu Xi looked at Xia Xiaolei fearfully. Xia Xiaolei’s heart sank and he clutched his head tightly. “I… … what did I say, I…”</p>
 <p>Lun Tai’s rate of breathing gradually grew stable and he looked up at everyone there. As he looked around, he felt a stab of pain in his heart.</p>
 <p><em>Ended? Or was it stopped?</em></p>
 <p><em>But… … just now, what choice did I make in the end?</em></p>
 <p><em>Kill… him? Did I make that choice?</em></p>
 <p><em>I…</em></p>
 <p>Roddy opened his eyes.</p>
 <p>“I, why am I not dead? I should have been the one to die!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>As everyone’s mind were falling into chaos and were about to mentally collapse…</p>
 <p>Clang!</p>
 <p>A sound echoed within the cave.</p>
 <p>Everyone reacted by raising their heads to look around. There at the corner of the cavern stood Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>He held the Sword in the Stone in his hand, slamming the blade of the sword against the surface of the cavern wall.</p>
 <p>Again! And again!</p>
 <p>Clang! Clang!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian appeared calm and indifferent. However, his eyes…</p>
 <p>Those who caught sight of his eyes were unable to stop themselves from recoiling.</p>
 <p><em>That, just what is up with his eyes?</em></p>
 <p>“Are you all awake now? Awakened from that nightmare?” Chen Xiaolian took a deep breath before shouting loudly.</p>
 <p>Slowly, he stepped into the centre of the cavern, the tip of the Sword in the Stone scraping the ground behind him.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian stood in the middle of the cavern and looked at his teammates.</p>
 <p>“Right now, I want to say this… … no matter what it is you all experienced, no matter what happened, all of those… … are fake! Fake!</p>
 <p>“Do you all understand? Remember!</p>
 <p>“All of you better *** listen up! They are all fake! They are but illusions created by this damned instance dungeon to set us up!</p>
 <p>“And now you have all made it out from the nightmare! Thus, I don’t care what it is you dreamt about, all of you… … cut it out!”</p>
 <p>The fearsome expression on Chen Xiaolian’s face caused Xia Xiaolei to recollect himself. Qimu Xi too, had stopped trembling. She subconsciously straightened her body.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian walked forward until he was standing before Roddy. Seeing the absent-minded expression on Roddy’s face, he promptly raised his hand and slapped Roddy’s face.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>The slap caused Roddy to stagger backward.</p>
 <p>“Are you awake?”</p>
 <p>“… … …”</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Another slap across his face!</p>
 <p>“Are you awake?”</p>
 <p>“… … much better.” Roddy shook his head, a wry smile etched on his face. He raised his hand to feel the reddening part of his cheek and sighed deeply. “I… … I don’t know what happened to me just now.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian ignored Roddy. He turned to look at Lun Tai.</p>
 <p>Lun Tai was still clutching his head, his mind preoccupied. Chen Xiaolian walked over and – without saying anything – kicked Lun Tai’s stomach, sending him sprawling on the ground.</p>
 <p>Lun Tai was shocked.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know what you dreamed about just now.” Chen Xiaolian gnashed his teeth and continued, “However, you better remember this, everyone is still depending on you! Additionally, Bei Tai is still waiting for us to return! Losing even one is unacceptable!”</p>
 <p>Those words caused Lun Tai to recover somewhat.</p>
 <p>Finally, Chen Xiaolian came to stand before Qiao Qiao and Soo Soo.</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao stared mindlessly at Chen Xiaolian – she could instinctively feel something amiss with Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>Soo Soo was silent as well. She just observed Chen Xiaolian quietly.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian looked at the two sisters for a good five seconds before speaking with a hoarse voice. “You two… … are you two all right?”</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao nodded and was about to say something when Soo Soo suddenly let go of Qiao Qiao’s hand – more accurately, she had broken free from her.</p>
 <p>“Xiaolian oppa,” Soo Soo spoke out gently, but there was firmness in her voice. “Can I stay beside you?”</p>
 <p>As she spoke, she stood up, extricating herself from Qiao Qiao’s embrace and moved beside Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao’s heart sank.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian stared at Soo Soo for a moment. Then, he gave a nod.</p>
 <p>“Since it was a dream, now that it has ended we should not be hung up with it anymore! Right now, we have more pressing matters!” Chen Xiaolian shook his head anxiously before turning his attention back to the others. “Did you all not realize it? Someone is missing!”</p>
 <p>“Missing…”</p>
 <p>“Ah! Little Will! Where is little Will?”</p>
 <p>“That is right! He was right beside me just now!”</p>
 <p>“Beside you? That cannot be right. He was with me when I fell into the Tokyo instance nightmare.”</p>
 <p>“No, I recall carrying him.”</p>
 <p>A spark glinted within Chen Xiaolian’s eyes and he took a deep breath. “Enough, stop it.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian clenched his fists, seemingly suppressing something. In the end, he hissed slowly, one word after the other, “You! Are. You. Satisfied?”</p>
 <p>Silence…</p>
 <p>A few seconds later…</p>
 <p>Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!</p>
 <p>A loud clapping sound rang out.</p>
 <p>A dark silhouette suddenly appeared out of nowhere in the middle of the cavern.</p>
 <p>The thin figure of little Will stood there. He had the same facial features. However, his expression seemed to contain an indescribable evil.</p>
 <p>“Excellent, truly excellent! I am very satisfied. I am talking about every one of you, all of your dream worlds.” Little Will swept his gaze across all of them. In the end, his eyes fell on Chen Xiaolian’s face. “Especially you… … you surprised me the most!”</p>
 <p>“Will?” Xia Xiaolei blurted.</p>
 <p>“Oh, don’t go around addressing me wrongly.” Little Will performed a slight bow. “I am not this little Will. I am just borrowing his body to restore my consciousness… … no, it would be more accurate to say that the little Will that you all knew was just one of the many ‘me’s. As of now, please stop addressing me as little Will. My name is…</p>
 <p>“The Demon King, Belial!”</p>
