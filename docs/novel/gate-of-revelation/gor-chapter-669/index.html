 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 669 Decision </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Wait, Xiaolian! What are you thinking?” Qiao Qiao tugged at Chen Xiaolian. “Do you want to become a target? If we move on land, we could at least hide ourselves. If we ride on this…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“How do you think Lei Hu found us?” Chen Xiaolian turned to face Qiao Qiao. “Given his strength and position, could he not have life signature detectors? It does not matter if we travel by land or sky, we will be unable to hide ourselves. However, by riding this, we could at least increase our speed of escape and move out from Lei Hu’s range of detection as fast as possible.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“However, what if he discovers our position and shoots us down while we are still up in the sky?” Qiao Qiao’s brows remain furrowed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Don’t worry.” Bluesea patted Qiao Qiao on her shoulder. Taking the initiative, Bluesea pulled open the hatch and moved to sit on the driver’s seat. “He can’t bring himself to kill Chen Xiaolian.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The helicopter slowly rose up into the sky. After circling a few times, it quickly flew into the depths of the snow field.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun stopped. Her face, which had been calm, revealed a hint of a wrinkle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Before her stood a small wooden cabin. This was the place where Chen Xiaolian had cut her Silver Dragon spear, sending his coordinate to her.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At that moment, however, the little wooden cabin had collapsed, leaving only a pile of wood. No signs of life could be found there.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>With a frown on her face, Sister Yun stepped forward. Using the Silver Dragon spear in her hand, she nudged aside a pile of broken wooden boards.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Inside the cabin’s fireplace, the ashes had yet to be completely extinguished and the embers still shone with a dark red glow.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Used bowls and utensils could be seen on the floor. However, they had all broke into pieces. Even so, there were still residues resting at the bottom of the bowls.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There under several wooden planks, several faint motes of light rested on the floor. This was where the Silver Dragon spear she gave Chen Xiaolian had been broken.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun crouched down to scoop up the motes of light, which gradually faded into her palm, returning into her body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After replenishing a bit of her over exhausted strength, Sister Yun stood up to survey her surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A trail of footprints could be seen moving from the cabin into the depths of the snowfield.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun knitted her brows. She gently stroked the air with her right hand, causing silver motes of light to blink into existence. The silver motes of light then formed a white horse.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Soon, a white figure could be seen shooting through the snowfields in pursuit of the footprints like a speeding arrow.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Olympus Pantheon Temple…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A man was standing within the square.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He was as short as a little child, no more than 1.4 metres in height. Every part of the skin on his face was wrinkled and his two ears rose sharply upward. There was a bluish-green quality to the colour of his skin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His eyes were closed and an anxious expression was etched on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A Sentinel mech soared through the sky in the distance, making its way toward the temple. After hovering atop the square for a moment, the mech landed before the man.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Sentinel mech’s hatch opened up and an Irregularity jumped out. The Irregularity rushed to stand before the man while checking their surroundings. Seeing traces of a battle in the area, he revealed a look of utter shock on his face. “Sir Lei Hu, why are you standing out here? Mount Olympus… why is the restrictive barrier no more? And what is up with the traces of battle I see here?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A series of questions gushed out from his mouth. However, Lei Hu did not answer him. Instead, he opened his eyes to regard the Irregularity. “Gnu, have you completed your task?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes, Sir Lei Hu.” The Irregularity called Gnu revealed a flicker of emotion as he said, “This is the eighth instance dungeon cleared by me.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After saying that, he patted the mech behind him. His action caused a muffled thud sound to ring out. “My luck this time is quite good. This Sentinel mech is in very good shape. It is also equipped with flight parts. It is very convenient for both searching and pursuing. None of the Awakened ones survived.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mm, not bad.” Lei Hu nodded his head softly before sighing. “You have also done your best for everyone. However… … now that it has come to this, I cannot hesitate anymore.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Hesitate?” Gnu was stunned by the words. However, before he could react, Lei Hu extended his hand out. He flicked a finger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Following the finger flick by Lei Hu, a flower of blood bloomed out from Gnu’s heart area. With a look of shock on his face, Gnu flew several metres backward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When his body fell to the ground, it began convulsing madly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There at the heart area was a hole the size of a fist. Within the hole, a small seed had made its way into the blood within the body and was furiously sprouting. In but the blink of an eye, countless vines had emerged. The vines then drilled its way into the other parts of the body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After only a few seconds, Gnu’s convulsing body stopped convulsing and it lay calmly on the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu ignored Gnu’s corpse. Instead, he closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After a while, Gnu slowly sat up. Moving his hands, he then got up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The expression on his face was now similar to the one on Lei Hu’s face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After getting up, Gnu did not look at Lei Hu. Instead, he turned and moved toward the Sentinel mech.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The thrusters roared into action as blazing hot trails of flames shot out from the Sentinel mech, pushing it into the sky once more. It flew toward the snowfield.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The helicopter had flown for more than half an hour. Lei Hu had yet to come in pursuit of them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“We don’t have much fuel left.” Bluesea looked at the dashboard. “We have at most five more minutes before landing becomes necessary. That storage equipment you took from them, is there any fuel there?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No.” Chen Xiaolian glanced at his feet before smiling bitterly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This helicopter was unlike the Devourer fighter aircraft or the Tidal Fighter, which possessed near unlimited flight capacity. These flight crafts from the outside world had a limited fuel tank.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>They had long since left the snowfield instance dungeon. The ground beneath them right now was a stretch of desert. There was no end to the desert in sight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>If they were to lose their transport in a place like this…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although this was also a desert, Chen Xiaolian was not that confident that he would be so lucky as to bump into another Devourer fighter aircraft.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Don’t worry too much.” Qiao Qiao smiled as she comforted Chen Xiaolian. “We have already flown far away. Yet, we have not seen Lei Hu coming after us at all. Perhaps… … his real body was far away and he had lost track of our position.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Let’s hope so.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian sighed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“We have to land.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea looked at the fuel indicator as it moved toward the lowest part of the red area. Then, he slowly manoeuvred the helicopter down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The look of anxiousness on Lei Hu’s face was growing even stronger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The bodies of the hundred plus Awakened ones that he had to painstakingly assemble had been lost due to his carelessness.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Given the limited amount of time he had, how was he to gather up enough bodies to spread out in search of Chen Xiaolian?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His Foresight skill could only predict a vague possibility of the future. He cannot accurately know where the other party was at.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At that moment, Lei Hu was feeling very regretful.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He was one of the first batch of Irregularities that Bai Qi had taken in and also the only one from that batch to survive. Sebast’s batch was far inferior to his in qualifications.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was precisely because he had remained close to Bai Qi for so long that he could understand just how terrifyingly powerful he was.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Coincidentally, his skills happened to be the type that could grow stronger through personal training. Thus, after living for so long, he was able to reach his present level. Even so, Lei Hu knew all too well just how big of a difference there was between him and Bai Qi.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>That day, before leaving, Bai Qi had turned around to regard the mountain of corpses and sea of blood beneath him. Then, his gaze turned to sweep across the few survivors…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing that glance made Lei Hu felt incomparably fortunate. Fortunate that he had not made the same choice as the others, to recklessly charge forward and challenge the authority of the King.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In fact… forget about the King, even that blond young man who had come to pick him up, although he had never made a single move, Lei Hu knew that the blond man possessed an equally terrifying level of strength.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When his Foresight skill found out about Qiao Qiao’s existence and the opportunity she carried with her to return to the outside world, Lei Hu first became excited. Then, he grew fearful.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Among the Irregularities who had to eke out a meagre existence within World’s End, which of them do not wish to return?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, that scene from back then remained clear within Lei Hu’s mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It mattered not if the one to come here this time was Bai Qi, the blond young man, or someone else equal to them in strength, Lei Hu had no confidence in facing them in a fight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After deliberating for the longest time, Lei Hu finally decided on his present strategy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He would keep Qiao Qiao in the dark from the very beginning and use the puppets controlled by his parasitic plants to perform his plan.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>If the one who came was truly someone like Bai Qi, an ancient monster, Lei Hu could at least avoid getting sucked into danger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Once he had fully confirmed that the other party’s strength was not as high as his, he could let go of his worries and take action.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Unexpectedly, this cautious nature of his had ended up backfiring on himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The scattered Irregularities who returned to Mount Olympus after completing their clearing task would all, without exception, be killed by Lei Hu and transformed into his puppets using his parasitic plants.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, up till now, there had been only a few of them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The hundred plus plant puppets from earlier was something that Lei Hu had gathered beforehand. At present, all known Awakened ones within World’s End had been cleared. Where was he to go find more puppets?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu possessed a considerable number of equipment in hand. He had given each of the puppets life signature detectors as well. However, the current number of puppets he possessed was insufficient to cover such a large area.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu hesitated for a moment before finally coming to a decision.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
