 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 447 Seeking A Ride</strong></p>
 <p>That huge lump of meatball… … how should it be described…</p>
 <p>It was as though seven or eight pigs had been taken out, flesh, bones and internal organs included, and thrown into the crushing machines until all were completely crushed. Then, the product was moulded together into one spherical mass.</p>
 <p>Oh, the flesh and blood on this particular meatball were not from pigs, but…</p>
 <p>Humans!</p>
 <p>This thing rolled into the room, shattering the glass door as it did. Some of the broken glasses stabbed into the surface of the meatball as it rolled forward.</p>
 <p>Seeing the meatball roll into the room, the female members of Meteor Rock Guild were unable to stop themselves from puking out of terror.</p>
 <p>This thing…. was too terrifying and nauseating.</p>
 <p>The meatball was simply the product of crushed meat. After the meatball entered the room, it stopped. On the side of the meatball facing the members of Meteor Rock Guild, crushed eyeballs and intestines of varying length could be seen on the surface. Some toes could also be seen sticking out of the surface of the meatball.</p>
 <p>And the stench was beyond unbearable.</p>
 <p>The surface of the floor that made contact with it when it rolled forward was now covered in green coloured slime.</p>
 <p>“What the Hell is that thing?!” Xia Xiaolei shouted.</p>
 <p>Lun Tai’s face was greatly contorted and he quickly roared, “Open fire! Don’t hesitate!”</p>
 <p>The moment those words left his mouth; Lun Tai raised his rifle.</p>
 <p>Fiery muzzle flash poured out from the muzzle of his rifle as Xia Xiaolei, Qimu Xi and the others followed suit.</p>
 <p>Bullets struck the surface of the meatball, causing its flesh and blood to scatter around. Lun Tai led the others back while loading a grenade into his grenade launcher.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The grenade flew out, striking the meatball and exploding. Pounded flesh and green coloured liquid were strewn around and the meatball began moving. It began rolling toward Lun Tai and the others.</p>
 <p>“Hurry, run!” Qiao Qiao and Roddy, who were trapped inside the glass room, shouted.</p>
 <p>Lun Tai dared not show any hesitation. He shouted, “Spread out!”</p>
 <p>Even as he said that, he swept Soo Soo up, holding her beneath his armpit as he turned around and ran toward the left side. As he did so, he also pulled Qimu Xi to move her out of the way.</p>
 <p>The meatball raged forward and the members of Meteor Rock Guild had to run. Xia Xiaolei grabbed Will and dashed to the right as Lun Tai brought Soo Soo and Qimu Xi to the left.</p>
 <p>After charging to the edge of the room, the meatball twisted and turned around. Next, it bounced up vigorously toward Lun Tai, Soo Soo and Qimu Xi.</p>
 <p>“Be careful!” Qiao Qiao shouted in alarm.</p>
 <p>Seeing the meatball going after Lun Tai’s group, Qiao Qiao panicked and summoned out her War Pet.</p>
 <p>With a flash of black coloured light, a huge Black Widow spider appeared inside the room. Eight limbs flew within the room and the Black Widow’s limbs halted behind Lun Tai’s back, blocking the meatball’s path.</p>
 <p>Ka!</p>
 <p>Two of the Black Widow’s sickle-like front limbs hacked down. The meatball did nothing to dodge the incoming attack and the power behind the attack hacked the body of the meatball. As a result, a portion of the meatball’s body was cut off.</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao became excited. However, her excited eyes quickly turned wide as she stared.</p>
 <p>The cut off piece of meat wiggled on the floor for a moment before transforming into a smaller version of the meatball. Then, it bounced up and rolled off in pursuit of Lun Tai’s group.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>Xia Xiaolei, who had put some distance between him and the room, turned around and began firing. The hail of bullets struck the mini meatball, slowing it down.</p>
 <p>As for the big meatball, it slammed itself upon Qiao Qiao’s Black Widow.</p>
 <p>Although the Black Widow was not too small in comparison to the big meatball, slamming into others was not its forte. Thus, facing the meatball’s ramming attacks, it could only retreat. Its sickle-like limbs waved around and more pieces of meat fell off the body of the big meatball.</p>
 <p>Despite the Black Widow’s ferocious counter attack, the cut off pieces of meat that fell to the floor would again transform into mini meatballs and roll around the room.</p>
 <p>On Lun Tai’s side, he had already discarded his grenade launcher and brought out his handgun instead. With one hand holding onto Soo Soo, he did his best to fire. It did not take long for his gun to run out of bullets. After that, he leapt up and his leg shot out. Using the wall as leverage, he sent his body to the other side, dodging two of the incoming mini meatballs. Qimu Xi on the other hand, was panicking. When Lun Tai landed, he sent a chair flying forward with a kick. The chair slammed into a mini meatball that was going for Qimu Xi, sending it flying.</p>
 <p>As for Xia Xiaolei, he and Will were forced to run around.</p>
 <p>As the Black Widow continued retreating, Lun Tai recognized the issue and shouted, “Qiao Qiao, stop cutting it! The more you cut it, the more it will spawn!”</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao took a deep breath and controlled the Black Widow to begin a hit and run tactic against the big meatball.</p>
 <p>The big meatball quickly rolled around the room. Whenever the mini meatballs made contact with the big meatball, they will automatically merge together with it.</p>
 <p>“Hurry up and leave this place! This place is too cramped. You cannot fight it here!” Qiao Qiao shouted.</p>
 <p>Lun Tai, who was perspiring all over, shouted, “If we leave, what will happen to you and Roddy?”</p>
 <p>“We are inside. This thing cannot hurt us. This fence is protecting us!” Qiao Qiao replied anxiously. “Hurry up and leave! Go somewhere else and think of something!”</p>
 <p>Lun Tai was a decisive fellow and he quickly said, “All right! This place is unfavourable for us. Let us get out of here and find a better place of engagement.”</p>
 <p>At the same time, the big meatball finished recollecting the mini meatballs into its body. Seeing Lun Tai and the others attempting to run out of the research lab, it quickly rolled toward the door.</p>
 <p>It placed its large body at the doorway, blocking their path.</p>
 <p>Seeing what was happening, Qiao Qiao, who was inside the sealed room, cursed out. She controlled her Black Widow spider to rush forward.</p>
 <p>This time, the Black Widow spider stopped once it was around five metres away from the big meatball. It waved its sickle-like limbs, but chose not to move forward.</p>
 <p>Next, like an opening umbrella, a stream of silvery white spider web sprayed out from the Black Widow spider’s abdomen area.</p>
 <p>The spider web possessed a strong adhesive quality. When they made contact with the big meatball, it clung to its surface firmly.</p>
 <p>After hitting home with its spider web, the Black Widow spider quickly moved its eight limbs and retreated. As it did so, the big meatball was forced away from the glass door.</p>
 <p>“Now! Get out!” Qiao Qiao screamed from the sealed glass room.</p>
 <p>The Black Widow spider pulled the big meatball away with everything it had and Lun Tai and the others quickly dashed through the opening, making their way through the doorway. Lun Tai, who was the last to go through, turned back to look at Qiao Qiao, who was inside the sealed glass room, and said loudly, “Just hold on for a bit. We will go out and figure out a way to lure it away. Then, we will come get you two!”</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao watched Lun Tai and the others run out and breathed a sigh of relief. By then, the Black Widow spider was already issuing out whining sounds.</p>
 <p>Its sickle-like limbs had made contact with the meatball’s body too many times. Its body had been infected by copious amounts of green slime and it appeared incapable of dragging the meatball anymore. As for the meatball, it suddenly stopped struggling. Instead, it bounced forward.</p>
 <p>The bouncing power of the big meatball, in addition to the pulling force exerted by the Black Widow spider, brought the meatball smashing onto the Black Widow spider’s body.</p>
 <p>Despite its tough outer shell, this attack elicited a sharp cry of misery from the Black Widow spider. It was sent flying. As it slammed into the wall, two of its legs were caught in between its body and the wall. When the Black Widow spider finally landed back down, it was obvious that it was no longer able to balance itself properly.</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao quickly summoned the Black Widow spider back into her personal system – the Black Widow spider was by no means weak. However, this was clearly a bad matchup for the Black Widow spider. Considering how its attacks using its eight limbs were ineffective, it was impossible for it to fight against the meatball.</p>
 <p>The meatball rolled around for a while. Then, ignoring Qiao Qiao and Roddy, who were trapped inside the sealed glass room, it turned around and moved outside… it quickly made its way out of the research lab as it pursued Lun Tai and the others.</p>
 <p>“Roddy! We need to figure a way out of here! They are in grave danger!” Qiao Qiao slammed her fists forcefully against the sealed glass wall a few times. Then, she asked, “Do you have any way to open this damned fence?”</p>
 <p>Roddy, “… … …”</p>
 <p>Not hearing any answer from Roddy, Qiao Qiao turned around and saw that he was standing there shakily. His entire body seemed to be quivering and his head was lowered.</p>
 <p>“Roddy?”</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao cried out in shock.</p>
 <p>Roddy finally heard Qiao Qiao. The trembling on his body intensified and he exerted all his strength just to raise his head. His face was greenish pale and his pair of pupils was shining with a green light.</p>
 <p>“Qiao, Qiao Qiao…” Roddy spoke. A sense of struggle could be heard within his tone and he said, “Quick! Run! Don’t come close… … I, I cannot…. control anymore… urghh… …”</p>
 <p>“What?” Qiao Qiao subconsciously took a step back. Roddy’s head slumped down once more. Then, it jerked back up. But this time, there was no emotion within those eyes.</p>
 <p>Roddy’s body contorted and a growl escaped his mouth. He spread open both arms and rushed toward Qiao Qiao.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! … …</p>
 <p>The sounds of gunfire continued to echo from outside the research lab.</p>
 <p>As for Qiao Qiao, she was trapped inside the sealed glass room and was now faced with a terrible crisis.</p>
 <p>Roddy had lost control. He charged maniacally at Qiao Qiao.</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao ran around the sealed glass room in an attempt to dodge. However, the area within the room was limited.</p>
 <p>After dodging Roddy a few times, she found herself backed into a corner. Roddy’s hand caught onto Qiao Qiao’s shoulder and his mouth came biting down on her arm.</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao had already pulled out a dagger with her other hand.</p>
 <p>Roddy’s neck, heart and other areas were exposed. However, when she looked at her best friend, Qiao Qiao was unable to stab him.</p>
 <p>Finally, Roddy bit down on Qiao Qiao’s arm!</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!</p>
 <p>The roar of a motorcycle engine rang out from a distance before a fiery red coloured motorcycle sped by.</p>
 <p>Soon, the motorcycle stopped beside a gas station by the highway.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian stepped down from the motorcycle, removed the helmet and looked at his watch.</p>
 <p>There was a dark look on his face.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian felt that he might have fallen into a trap.</p>
 <p>He had been unable to contact the others through the guild channel, causing a sense of foreboding to rise within his heart.</p>
 <p>Looking at the motorcycle dashboard, he saw that there was almost no fuel left. He stopped the motorcycle beside a gas station and moved to lift the gas nozzle.</p>
 <p>At present, this was the most suitable transport for him.</p>
 <p>Although he also had a Thunderstorm Tank in his Storage Watch, the speed of the Thunderstorm Tank was far inferior compared to ordinary transports.</p>
 <p>It did not take long for him to fill up the fuel tank and he got back up. Then, he continued riding north toward Tel Aviv. However, he had only moved out of the gas station for less than three minutes…</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chen Xiaolian saw something. Beside the highway before him was a silvery white Bentley Continental.</p>
 <p>A young man in casual, white suit stood beside the road with a smile on his face. Seeing the incoming motorcycle, he raised up a thumb, making the international gesture for ‘seeking a ride’.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was suddenly visited by an extreme sensation of absurdity.</p>
 <p>This was a bloody instance dungeon! An instance dungeon where ordinary humans have been cleared away!</p>
 <p>Seeking a ride? A game participant was seeking a ride beside the road?</p>
 <p>…</p>
