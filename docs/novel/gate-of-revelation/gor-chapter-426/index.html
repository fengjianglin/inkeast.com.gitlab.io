 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 426 I Like It!</strong></p>
 <p>Before them all stood a… … little object.</p>
 <p>It was only 40 centimetres tall with dual-track chassis. It had a very square-shaped body with prominent edges and two mechanical arms stretched out from either side of its body. The design for its head was more simplistic, appearing almost no different to a split pair of binoculars…</p>
 <p>Add the yellow paint on the surface of its body…</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was unable to stop himself from exhaling before casting an odd look at Roddy. “This is your surprise?”</p>
 <p>Roddy snickered without replying.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian stared with wide opened eyes. “You… the surprise you mentioned is… is… “</p>
 <p><em>Wall-e??</em></p>
 <p>Indeed!</p>
 <p>Roddy’s surprise was none other than the robot known as Wall-e from the animated movie!</p>
 <p>A glance revealed that it was a DIY product and it had a 70 to 80 per cent similarity to the real thing.</p>
 <p>When the tall and muscular Lun Tai stood beside it, he became like a giant standing beside a baby.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian understood that although Roddy would sometimes act like an idiot, he was not someone who would mess around in a huge way. Chen Xiaolian said patiently, “Since this is a surprise, tell us about it.”</p>
 <p>Roddy revealed an ‘I am amazing’ look on his face and spread both his arms. In a tone commonly used by the host of a wrestling match, he spoke up loudly, “Ladies and gentlemen, I now introduce to you… …”</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Big Miss Qiao had no interest in his nonsense. She reached out and slapped him on his head. “Be serious!”</p>
 <p>“Fine!” Roddy clutched his head and smiled wryly. “I had modified this based on the mining androids from the mine. This is our humanoid multi-purpose combat robot! Mm, based on its outer appearance, you all must surely think it resembles Wall-e. Truth is, I had named it… Adam.”</p>
 <p>“Adam?”</p>
 <p>“Yep. Isn’t the name of the heroine in Wall-e known as Eve? Since we cannot name this robot Wall-e due to copyright issues with this novel, we’ll call it Adam…”</p>
 <p>“Hey! That line will be deleted during publication! <sup><a id="ref1" href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>”</p>
 <p>“All right, all right!” Roddy ran his fingers through his hair. “Adam! Our multi-purpose combat robot!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s eyes lit up. “Tell us, what abilities does it have?”</p>
 <p>“Ha ha!” Roddy walked over with a prideful expression, crouched down beside Adam and patted its body. “It has the AI system of the mining android. I had made some adjustments so it is pretty much fully automated. Of course, you should not try to have it brew coffee or make fried rice for you. It is not that ‘smart’. However, it has basic mechanical and combat functions. It also has an enemy identification system in it.</p>
 <p>“Additionally, it has the energy reactor created by the mine’s control system. Material wise… … Xiaolian, don’t hit me when I say it… … I… used some Star Sand.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian face palmed… … <em>I knew it!</em></p>
 <p>“Don’t show that kind of face! It is definitely not for naught! With its powerful energy reactor, not enhancing it was practically a crime! Listen to me; I had designed it so it you can outfit it with other combat equipment. Moreover, even without combat related equipment installed, it can still be used for excavation, mining and carrying heavy loads. It is capable of basic mechanical actions. After enhancing it with Star Sand, its material strength becomes much stronger. Its power and load capacity are simply astonishing!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian continued looking at Roddy.</p>
 <p>Roddy took a deep breath. “Its maximum load capacity is 1,080 tonnes! At present, the biggest haul truck is the Caterpillar 797 with a maximum load capacity of only 300 tonnes! This little fellow is a match for three combined! I will have you know this; a Caterpillar 797 is 7.5 metres tall! But this little fellow is only 40 centimetres, not even half a metre!</p>
 <p>“Do you know? The weight of a Boeing airplane is only around 300 tonnes. That means this little fellow can lift three Boeing airplanes in total!</p>
 <p>“Additionally, even at maximum capacity, it can still reach a maximum speed of 60 kilometres per hour. That is the equivalent of the maximum speed in the city!</p>
 <p>“When you reduce its load, it will be able to reach a maximum speed of 160 kilometres per hour. Also, did you notice the tracks? It can be used in all weather and terrains! It has a maximum climbing angle of 60 degrees and can ford through water!”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Roddy smiled and said, “Do you want to see it?”</p>
 <p>He suddenly clapped his hands and spoke softly, “Adam, start!”</p>
 <p>The robot’s drooped head suddenly rose up and its binocular like eyes shook.</p>
 <p>“Pull the plane beside you and drag it forward for 20 metres. Go, my baby!”</p>
 <p>The robot’s tracks began moving. Its eyes swept through its surroundings before rushing forward until it was beside the landing gear of the Tidal Fighter. Next, it extended its mechanical arm and casually…</p>
 <p>Lifted the Tidal Fighter up with one arm!</p>
 <p>Adam’s tracks then moved and it effortlessly carried the Tidal Fighter that weighed over a hundred tonnes a distance of 20 metres! After gently putting it down, it moved around in a circle before moving back to Roddy’s position. Stopping beside Roddy’s feet, it then raised its arm and waved it.</p>
 <p>“Good boy!” Roddy laughed out.</p>
 <p>The eyes of Chen Xiaolian and the others nearly popped out!</p>
 <p>“It has a turbine engine and anti-recoil device. If needed, we can install various types of weaponry on it. Cannons or missiles, anything can be installed on it! With its anti-recoil device, we do not need to worry about the recoil from using cannons or missiles. It will be able to become a humanoid weapon in the field of battle! It can also serve as a scout.</p>
 <p>“Its body is already very small as it is. Nevertheless, it can further contract its 40 centimetre-wide body by one third. If the enemy is hiding in something like an air-raid shelter, it can invade the shelter through the ventilation hole… right, it can also camouflage itself.”</p>
 <p>Roddy then said, “Adam, enter chameleon camouflage mode!”</p>
 <p>Adam promptly raised its head and its body quickly whirled about once. Next, the surface of its body swiftly turned transparent!</p>
 <p>While it was still somewhat possible for them to see it, it was clear that it would practically be invisible from afar!</p>
 <p>“Optical camouflage. It reflects the light using its body to create this camouflage effect.” There was a prideful look on Roddy’s face, one with the words ‘Hurry up and praise me!” written all over it.</p>
 <p>There was a very satisfied look on Chen Xiaolian’s face.</p>
 <p>This robot was indeed very good. Although it had used up some Star Sand, it was worth it.</p>
 <p>Truth be told, it could be considered a miniature mech. There was simply insufficient Star Sand for Roddy’s Mech. Thus, using it for a miniature mech was better than nothing.</p>
 <p>“Honestly, it still has some flaws. One such example is its aerial operations. Since I was tinkering with it in the mine, I did not have enough materials to modify it. Now that I am back, I plan on staying inside this equipment warehouse for a few days to install a flying equipment on it to allow it flight capabilities. Once I accomplish that, it will truly become an all-weather, all terrain, multi-purpose combat robot!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian nodded his head. “Not bad. I believe we will still encounter a number of instance dungeons where firearms are allowed. This will help boost our battle power there.”</p>
 <p>“It is controlled through voice commands. I will spend the next few days inputting your voices into its recognition system. In the future, everyone will be able to command it.”</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao, who had remained silent all this time, finally spoke up. “Me too?”</p>
 <p>“Of course!”</p>
 <p>“Good, I will teach it to fry rice.”</p>
 <p>“… … …”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>In the woods.</p>
 <p>Nicole panted as she glared at Tian Lie.</p>
 <p>Although Tian Lie was not panting, his face had turned pale.</p>
 <p>There were scars all over Tian Lie’s face and body. His left arm hung limply; obviously, his arm’s bone had been broken.</p>
 <p>The sword in Nicole’s hand had become twisted and she kept it back into her storage equipment.</p>
 <p>This Floating Angel looked at Tian Lie and clenched her teeth. “Do we continue?”</p>
 <p>Tian Lie grunted.</p>
 <p>The intensity of the short fight between the two of them just now had been subconsciously controlled… … if these two masters had gone all out, the entire residential complex may well be flattened as a result.</p>
 <p>Additionally, the two of them were not at their prime.</p>
 <p>Tian Lie was in such a state.</p>
 <p>The same was true for Nicole as well… … her most powerful Floater was presently with Roddy.</p>
 <p>“So… … a draw?” Nicole raised her eyebrows.</p>
 <p>“If we continue, we will end up terrifying the normal people.” Tian Lie shook his head. “I feel much better now. So, let us call it a draw. You should feel lucky, girl!”</p>
 <p>Nicole gave a harrumph. “What a rude fellow. Are you always this rude to girls?”</p>
 <p>Tian Lie raised his head to look at the sky. “I never fight women. But today is an exception.”</p>
 <p>Hearing that, Nicole’s heart skipped a beat. She felt something familiar and she subconsciously turned to gaze at Tian Lie… … to gaze at his thin and frail stature.</p>
 <p>She harrumphed. “All right! Since this is a draw, I will come again some other day!”</p>
 <p>“You can wait outside the residential complex. But as long as I am here, you can forget about going in unless you defeat me.” After saying that, Tian Lie turned around and left.</p>
 <p>“What advantages will you get from stopping me?”</p>
 <p>Tian Lie turned his head around and revealed a grin. “I like it!”</p>
 <p>He then walked out of the forest. After leaving Nicole’s line of sight, the scars on his face and body quickly healed up!</p>
 <p>He was a very cunning fellow. When he was fighting against Nicole, he had not revealed his ability to transform into liquid metal.</p>
 <p>Likewise, Nicole had also been holding back.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>After Qiao Qiao’s return, the ruins of the resort on the island were transformed.</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao the second-generation plutocrat had stepped forward. After going out for a few days, she managed to accomplish something. Using Qiao Yifeng’s company, she found the company that owned the incomplete resort. She then offered them money to buy up this project!</p>
 <p>The company happily welcomed her offer. They took her money and happily sold it to her.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chen Xiaolian and his guild now had a base that truly belonged to them!</p>
 <p>The entire island now belonged to them.</p>
 <p>Next, Qiao Qiao and Chen Xiaolian went out for a few days to buy some construction materials. Using the Storage Watch, they were able to transport those materials back to the base. When that happened, Roddy’s plan to modify Adam was temporarily interrupted!</p>
 <p>Adam was truly astonishing!</p>
 <p>After Roddy inputted a construction program into it, Adam turned into a super crazy construction worker!</p>
 <p>Super load capacity, understanding of the building blueprint, computing, construction capacity, powerful working capacity, inexhaustible…</p>
 <p>Adam’s tracks rotated quickly as it sped around through the ruins of the resort…</p>
 <p>In but three days, it had used up a great deal of the construction materials that Chen Xiaolian brought back. The incomplete main building of the resort was now fully completed!</p>
 <p>Three days. This small robot with both the width and height of merely 40 centimetres had completed a three-storey resort building in three days!</p>
 <p>“We can’t just keep hiding inside the base. We’ll need to live outside.” Chen Xiaolian explained. “Although staying in the base is safe, we will be cut off from the outside world. We will not be able to communicate with each other and the instance dungeon selection process will be cut off as well. We must only use the base when necessary. Under normal conditions, we should stay on the island instead.”</p>
 <p>After expanding their territory to cover the entire little island, they had to put security as part of their formal agenda.</p>
 <p>The island was surrounded by water, giving them a natural form of isolation from the outside world. However, should someone attempt to spy on them, they would be able to do so from all angles. Thus, it was necessary to set up some defences.</p>
 <p>There were many security devices available in the Exchange System. Some could even be found from among the supplies they had obtained from Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild.</p>
 <p>When their humanoid discount card, Xia Xiaolei, went through the list of security devices available in the Exchange System, the guild entered a round of discussion.</p>
 <p>Roddy and Bei Tai, one was a mechanical and technological fanatic while the other was a military fanatic. They both agreed on a certain device from the Exchange System.</p>
 <p>Tesla Fury!</p>
 <p>Yes, it was something that resembled … … … the Tesla Coil from Red Alert!</p>
 <p>When the two of them found out about the device, they became flushed with excitement.</p>
 <p>However, Chen Xiaolian had firmly rejected it!</p>
 <p>“Don’t joke around! Do you want to kill people? This is a device that could even blow up a tank! We are in a lake! What if there are civilians fishing around here? When they accidentally get too close, they will be roasted! If that happens, how do you intend to settle it?”</p>
 <p>After he said that, the two military fanatics hung their heads in defeat.</p>
 <p>In the end, Chen Xiaolian took the middle way.</p>
 <p>Surveillance probes were placed at several points around the island, places with the best vantage points. They also put up signs in conspicuous locations to inform others that this was a private property where outsiders were prohibited.</p>
 <p>They built a fence around the central area on the island, the area around the resort.</p>
 <p>Some defensive devices with a certain degree of lethality would be installed inside the fence surrounding the resort…</p>
 <p>“An automatic 360 degrees auto cannon?”</p>
 <p>“Scram!” Chen Xiaolian kicked Roddy away. “If a thief comes, he will turn into a honeycomb.”</p>
 <p>“I suggest we use two sets,” said Qiao Qiao. “The first set of defensive system will use tranquilizing shots. Thus, we will not face exposure if some normal people stumble here. We can then install the second set of defensive system inside the main building. This one should have a certain level of lethality. We should probably not opt for guns or cannons. The resulting sound from those will cause problems. We should probably use something that causes electrical shock.”</p>
 <p>“I agree!” Lun Tai, the one with the calm nature, expressed his support for the idea.</p>
 <p>Thus, the agenda was settled.</p>
 <p>With Adam the mighty construction worker, they managed to complete their plan to set up the fences and surveillance probes in but a few days!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was unable to stop himself from sighing. “With this fellow around, even if we are to enter the real estate business, we’ll be able to make a fortune in just a few years…”</p>
 <p>After a week or so, the entire resort looked very different.</p>
 <p>The outer walls and several rooms of the main building had been renovated.</p>
 <p>Adam’s mechanical arm could transform into a drill, soldering iron, etc. As long as it was given a blueprint and the necessary materials, all they needed to do after that was sit down and enjoy the sun.</p>
