 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 569 The Next Step?</strong></p>
 <p>Phoenix was clearly in an absent-minded state.</p>
 <p>The hot cup of tea before her had turned cold, but there was no indication that she would reach out for it at all.</p>
 <p>After some time, Phoenix released a long sigh and raised her head to look at Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>“Zero City’s fall and Thorned Flower Guild’s split… … are those all true?”</p>
 <p>“It is.”</p>
 <p>Phoenix grew silent for a few seconds. Next, she spoke with a different tone, “What about you? Chen Xiaolian, why did you come looking for me? This is such a monumental event. Surely you did not come all the way here just to deliver the news to me? You travelled from China all the way to Europe, just to tell me about this?”</p>
 <p>This time, Chen Xiaolian remained silent.</p>
 <p>Phoenix suddenly stood up and said, “I need to verify the news.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, she simply walked out of the room, ignoring Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>Stepping outside the room, Phoenix saw the woman from the bar standing outside, a glass of fruit juice in hand. Behind her were several gun-bearing subordinates.</p>
 <p>Phoenix gave her subordinates a glance, but said nothing. She continued making her way outside.</p>
 <p>“Boss… … the two inside… …”</p>
 <p>“Ignore them. Follow me.”</p>
 <p>Phoenix led them up through the stairs onto the nightclub above. After opening the door, the deafening noise swept through them, causing Phoenix to knit her brows.</p>
 <p>She tilted her head. Two burly and rough looking men quickly made their way to her side and bowed.</p>
 <p>“I will give you fellows 20 minutes. Clear this place. Stop it all for tonight and get everyone to scram.”</p>
 <p>“… eh? Boss?” One of them became stunned while the other gulped. “Boss, tonight’s business is very good. Besides… … many VIPs came. They are all men and women with status and influence. Getting them to leave at a time like this is probably not…”</p>
 <p>Phoenix narrowed her eyes and said, “Is there a need for me to repeat my words?”</p>
 <p>The two fellows flinched. They dared not say anything else and quickly moved to execute her command.</p>
 <p>Immediately, lights shone through the dimly lit place. All the spotlights were turned off while the super bright ceiling lights were turned on. As a result, the hellish like landscape turned as bright as day. Likewise, the deafening music came to a stop. The singer who was roaring his throat out had his microphone cut off.</p>
 <p>The guests on the floor began to issue boos while the younger men and women raised their middle finger all around. Various shouts of resentment and curses filled the air.</p>
 <p>Tens of gun-bearing men rushed onto the stage and chased off the singer. Next, they picked up the microphone and made an announcement….</p>
 <p>The shouts and cursing within the floor grew louder. Following that, the men on the stage pulled out their guns and raised them up high as they coldly continued announcing something.</p>
 <p>The guests fell silent.</p>
 <p>Phoenix, who was standing in the corner, observed what was going on. Suddenly, she made a finger hooking gesture and the woman from the bar quickly moved over. “Before the guests leave, remember to have them pay the bill!”</p>
 <p>“Eh?” The woman was momentarily stunned. “Chasing the guests off is bad enough. I feel, in order to quell their anger, we can make this night free of charge… …”</p>
 <p>Phoenix glanced at the woman and said, “Do I have a lot of money?”</p>
 <p>The woman dared to reply.</p>
 <p>“In 20 minutes time, I do not want to see a single person here, By that, I mean everyone! Guests, attendants, staff members… … all of you as well! I want this whole place cleared, understand?”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Phoenix then ignored the woman. She turned and headed back inside.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>After finishing the cup of tea, Chen Xiaolian sat for a few more minutes, but Phoenix had yet to return.</p>
 <p>“Oppa, our actions of suddenly coming to look for her is really too unexpected,” Soo Soo suddenly spoke up.</p>
 <p>“Mm?”</p>
 <p>“Unless you have a reasonable explanation for her. However, you just happen to be unable to tell her the reason,” Soo Soo said slowly. “If I were in her shoes, I too, would feel suspicious.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian contemplated the matter for a while. Then, he got up, pulled Soo Soo along with him and walked out of the door. They moved through the passageway and stairs and made their way to the floor above.</p>
 <p>By the time they reached the floor on top, the floor was a mess. Tables were knocked over, lamps were broken and wine bottles and glasses were left crushed on the floor.</p>
 <p>However, the floor that had an atmosphere of anarchy was now empty.</p>
 <p>Thanks to the bright lights shining down from the ceiling, it appeared as though it was daytime there. Phoenix was the only one in sight on the floor. She sat before a table with a tablet before her as she carefully checked something.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian led Soo Soo over.</p>
 <p>Phoenix raised her head and said, “I have checked through several secret sites belonging to the Awakened circle. There are not many news regarding those matters, however, some people are beginning to sense something – thus, for now, I am willing to trust your words.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian nodded his head. “It is the truth.”</p>
 <p>“Fine. Assuming it is true, something as big as this will certainly cause quite a stir. However, what I want to know now is – how is this related to me? Be it the matter of Zero City or the matter with Thorned Flower Guild, how does that relate to me? Why did you run over here to find me?”</p>
 <p>Phoenix stared intently at Chen Xiaolian. “If you cannot be clear on this, Chen Xiaolian, we can forget about being friends.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian sighed. He pulled over a chair and sat opposite Phoenix.</p>
 <p>He did his best to put on a look of sincerity as he looked at Phoenix.</p>
 <p>“I will be honest. I am unable to answer your question… … I myself am uncertain as to why I came looking for you. I… … because of a strange incident I had, I managed to get some clues. These clues are seemingly guiding me to find a select few people… … you are one of them. After finding you, I still need to go find the others from those clues in found. Perhaps, only after I have found and gathered all of them would I discover the purpose of doing so.”</p>
 <p>Pausing for a moment, Chen Xiaolian smiled wryly and said, “I know what I am saying sounds very absurd and illogical. However, Phoenix, I assure you, in the name of our friendship… … every word I said is the truth!”</p>
 <p>Phoenix looked Chen Xiaolian in the eye for one whole minute.</p>
 <p>In the end, the young woman smiled.</p>
 <p>It was a rather complex smile.</p>
 <p>“Fine, since you are using our friendship as an assurance, I will trust you for now. So, now that you have found me, what are you going to do next?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian appeared relieved to hear that. He said, “I want to go find the others I indicate by the clues. The next objective is… … mm, I am not that familiar with Romania. How far is Brasov from Bucharest?”</p>
 <p>“Not too far,” Phoenix replied coolly. “Why?”</p>
 <p>“The next person I need to find, according to the clues I got, will be appearing somewhere in Brasov.” As he said, Chen Xiaolian checked his watch. “Time of appearance is about 46 hours from now.”</p>
 <p>Phoenix looked at Chen Xiaolian and asked, “Brasov? Do you have a more specific location?”</p>
 <p>“Bran.”</p>
 <p>Phoenix furrowed her brows. “The commune Bran?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>“That tourist spot with legends about vampires?”</p>
 <p>…</p>
