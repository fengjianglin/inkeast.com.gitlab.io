 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 622 To Battle, Youngster! &nbsp;</strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The moment their SUV turned into the street, the Thunderstorm Tank opened fire.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The square-shaped turret muzzle suddenly flashed and a beam of light shot toward the SUV that Chen Xiaolian was driving.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian did not panic. His left hand continued holding onto the steering wheel while his right hand pulled out the blade on his back. With a shake of the blade, he sent out a golden light to cover the vehicle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The beam of light struck the surface of the golden barrier and shimmered slightly before disappearing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You drive. Keep going straight, don’t stop.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After leaving those brief words, Chen Xiaolian shattered the windshield with a punch and moved out from the broken windshield.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea did not dither at all. With a jump, he landed onto the driver’s seat and took over the driving position. The SUV simply swerved a little, seemingly not slowing down at all as it continued charging forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Only then did Grace, who was behind, suddenly released a sharp scream.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At that moment, Chen Xiaolian was simply in no mood to care about what was happening within the SUV. He had crawled up to the top of the SUV, his body crouched as his right hand clutched the blade, which he positioned in a downward slant.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Thunderstorm Tank fired another three blasts in succession, but all of them failed to penetrate the barrier that Chen Xiaolian put up. Meanwhile, in the short amount of time that all of that happening, the SUV had made it through half the street.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although the Thunderstorm Tank was large, it was unable to completely block off the four-lane bridge. Bluesea took the path that was right beside the Thunderstorm Tank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>By continuing down the path, the SUV will certainly make its way pass the Thunderstorm Tank before going into the bridge.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Assuming, of course, that the blasts fail to hit the SUV.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>For some unknown reason, since the moment he first laid his eyes on Chen Xiaolian, Bluesea had felt a slight sense of intimacy with him. After Chen Xiaolian killed off the three monsters in the underground parking garage, Bluesea grew even more trusting of Chen Xiaolian, to the point where he would trust him unconditionally.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although it was never spoken out loud, in Bluesea’s mind, Chen Xiaolian had become their group’s leader.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When Chen Xiaolian gave the order, Bluesea, who was a soldier, instinctively responded by obeying.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Grace, who was seated behind, screamed non-stop, but Bluesea simply ignored her. His eyes were focused wholly upon the road ahead. Despite the blasts coming from the Thunderstorm Tank, he continued driving forward as though he could not see them. Their SUV continued speeding toward the opening on the bridge.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As for Chen Xiaolian, he kept his eyes fixed upon the Thunderstorm Tank in front. At the same time, he used Skyblade’s power to create a defensive barrier a few metres around him. He watched as the distance between their SUV and the tank decreased.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After firing another two blasts, only to fail to penetrate the defensive barrier, the people inside the Thunderstorm Tank appeared to have realized that their attacks were not effective. They stopped firing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Next, the Thunderstorm Tank turned and… retreated.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Its tracks moved quickly as the Thunderstorm Tank retreated from the bridge. However, its turret muzzle continued pointing ahead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing that, Chen Xiaolian’s pupils contracted as a feeling of unease rose within him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Bluesea! Step on the accelerator and continue going through the bridge at maximum speed! Don’t worry about what will happen next! Trust me!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian shouted out. Next, he kicked the roof of the SUV to vault forward through the air. After landing, he charged forward at a velocity superior to that of the SUV, rushing toward the bridge.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At the same time, the Thunderstorm Tank had retreated to a spot that was over 200 metres away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian had figured out what the people inside the Thunderstorm Tank wanted to do.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At that moment, however, there were still over 100 metres between him and the bridge-head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Thunderstorm Tank had already reached the area beneath the tower on the other side. It stopped and raised its turret muzzle by a few centimetres. It was aiming at the bridge’s main steel cable on the left, the one on Chen Xiaolian’s side.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It opened fire.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A beam of light shot out, instantly cutting off the main steel cable in its path. Having lost its connection with the bridge, the vertical suspenders, which had been pulled taut, loosened and bounced out with an intense whistling sound. They whipped down on the surface of the bridge beneath them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>If someone had been standing there during that time, that person would be split in half from the unparalleled elastic force behind the vertical suspenders.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After the steel cable was cut off, the left side of the bridge suddenly lurched down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>They were presently at the southernmost area of Manhattan Island and the bridge crossed the East River, connecting the area with Brooklyn. Atop each of the two rising towers on the bridge were two thick metal cables, which supported the weight of the heavy suspension bridge.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Should the two steel cables be cut, there would be nothing left to support the weight of the deck below. That area of the bridge would immediately be crushed by its own weight and fall to the bottom of the river.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Thunderstorm Tank, on the other hand, was stopped atop the other girder. Thus, it would remain safe from harm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The steel cable on the left side for the tower near Chen Xiaolian had been cut off and the bridge area there had begun shaking. Even if nothing else were done to it, time alone would quickly lead to the breakage of the steel cable on the other side, leading to the eventual fall of the bridge there.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Clearly, though, the Thunderstorm Tank had no intention of waiting for that to happen.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After firing the first blast, it quickly turned its turret muzzle to aim at the steel cable on the other side.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At that moment, Chen Xiaolian finally stepped foot upon the bridge.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There remained 200 metres between the two.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing that the turret muzzle had turned to aim at the other steel cable, Chen Xiaolian clenched his teeth and brandished the blade in his hand. Next, he performed a forward hacking motion.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya sat tidily in the cockpit of the Thunderstorm Tank as he watched Chen Xiaolian run toward his position. The corners on Wu Ya’s mouth curled into a sneer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Do you think you can make it?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The crosshair targeting on the screen had already locked onto the second cable. The data shown on the screen revealed that the main turret was rapidly charging up for the blast. In just two second’s time, it will open fire.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Irregularity before him would require at least another five seconds to reach the tank.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After seeing how he was able to block the Thunderstorm Tank’s blasts from earlier, Wu Ya believed that he must possess a fairly decent defensive equipment – no, after arriving in World’s End, all Irregularities would be unable to access their personal system. They will be unable to retrieve any system equipment that they possess. If so, the Irregularity must have been really lucky to have picked up the equipment here.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A shield generator capable of blocking the blasts from a Thunderstorm Tank was at least an [A] class prop.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, that was no longer important.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>By breaking this bridge, you fellows will be trapped inside this Manhattan instance dungeon area for now.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although there was quite the distance between them, using the observation equipment within the Thunderstorm Tank, Wu Ya could clearly see the number of people inside the SUV.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>There are a total of five people, just like what Deiha said. One Irregularity and four Awakened ones. Them gathering together is a good thing. Saves me the trouble of separately looking for them.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Clearly, the youngster who jumped out of the SUV was the only Irregularity among them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In World’s End, there were only two types of people – Irregularities and those who were once Awakened ones. Not only do the latter possess no abilities, they don’t even have their memories as Awakened ones.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It would be more accurate to say they were simply ordinary people.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>As long as I destroy the bridge, I don’t believe those four ordinary fellows can fly!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>As for that young Irregularity…</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>No matter how strong he may be, there is no way he could be a match for me.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya’s hand pressed down on the fire button.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, he then saw something he found hard to believe.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A flaming meteor was flying toward him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian hacked down. What had appeared like a heavy, full-powered hacking move turned light at the end and cut out a piece of the bridge before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The strength behind his move caused the piece of concrete to fly into the air.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After that – Chen Xiaolian assumed a baseball batting stance.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His body turned like a bow before furiously swinging forward. The long blade in his hand was swung as though it was a baseball bat and it drew a perfect curve in the air. It was not the edge of the blade that struck the piece of concrete, but the flat side of the blade.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The piece of concrete shot through the air and instantly broke through the sound barrier. The resulting air friction caused a trail of fire to erupt in its wake as it continued to shoot toward the Thunderstorm Tank.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The air friction caused the surface of the concrete to rapidly peel off. After travelling forward a distance of several hundred metres, just before it reached the Thunderstorm Tank, its volume had decreased considerably.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, when there was less than one metre between the piece of concrete and the Thunderstorm Tank, a layer of blue light flashed out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was the Thunderstorm Tank’s defensive shield.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The piece of concrete slammed into the defensive shield. When it did, its momentum faltered. However, the defensive shield flickered and the piece of concrete pierced through it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The piece of concrete accurately struck the turret muzzle the same instant that light shone out from it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The turret had originally locked down onto the steel cable on the other side. However, the impact of the piece of concrete threw its aim off. The beam of light it fired out shot past the steel cable, missing it. It only managed to cut off the few vertical suspenders beneath the main cable.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As the few vertical suspenders snapped free, the right side of the bridge there lurched down slightly. Thankfully, most of the vertical suspenders remained intact. It will not be falling down just yet.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>By then, however, Chen Xiaolian had arrived before the Thunderstorm Tank.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
