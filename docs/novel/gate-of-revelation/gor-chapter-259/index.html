 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 259: Very Fair</strong></p>
 <p><em>Are you certain that this GM you met had never been reset?</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian felt as though those words had bored straight through his heart!</p>
 <p><em>Reset?</em></p>
 <p><em>Reset??!</em></p>
 <p>If Mr San’s words were true and that the GM had been reset before…</p>
 <p>Then, his identity as the prime Irregularity, the first-generation virus would no longer exist!</p>
 <p>GM wanted to cooperate with him so that he could disrupt the process of quest completion of the instance dungeons. By using his identity as an Irregularity, he would then delay the all clear situation for the instance dungeons.</p>
 <p>Delaying that meant delaying the moment of reset for the GM, which would also meant its death.</p>
 <p>However, in light of this…</p>
 <p>Everything he did was futile!</p>
 <p>This meant that the GM had, a long time ago…</p>
 <p>Failed!</p>
 <p>Mr San, Bai Qi and the Irregularities of their generation had attempted the same thing that Chen Xiaolian was now doing.</p>
 <p>And failed.</p>
 <p>After that, both the game and GM was reset. Its memories and personality were erased.</p>
 <p>And everything began anew.</p>
 <p>GM developed a new personality as he gradually gained awareness. This new self-aware GM had the same idea and objective, to delay the moment where an all-clear occurs. Or rather, to delay the moment where an all-clear reoccurs! GM decided to cooperate with the new generation of Irregularities, Chen Xiaolian toward accomplishing this goal.</p>
 <p>What was this?</p>
 <p>This was…</p>
 <p>A new cycle!</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“Sometimes, I truly feel very ludicrous,” said Mr San as he released a faint sigh. “In this world, we have this word: ‘fate’. Even though our civilization and culture was something that the Development Team had created, I feel that everything here is befitting of this word.</p>
 <p>“Fate.</p>
 <p>“Everything falls under the cycle of fate.</p>
 <p>“The Irregularities of our generation and the GM of our generation…</p>
 <p>“And now here we are. Chen Xiaolian, you and the Irregularities of your generation and this GM of your generation are doing the same thing.</p>
 <p>“Once again.</p>
 <p>“And so… do you think you will accomplish anything in the end?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was silent.</p>
 <p>His entire body was soaked in cold sweat and he was unable to utter a single word in response!</p>
 <p><em>Do you think you will accomplish anything in the end?</em></p>
 <p>The answer appeared to be… NO!</p>
 <p>The Development Team will always create new instance dungeons and continue to have the new instance dungeons completed.</p>
 <p>This was a line. The starting point of this line existed; yet the same could not be said about its end.</p>
 <p>As an in-game character, no matter how powerful you may be, no matter how awesome you may be…</p>
 <p>In the end, could you go against the Development Team?</p>
 <p>All that was required was a change in the program to delete you.</p>
 <p>Originally, Chen Xiaolian though that he had the greatest pillar to rely on: GM!</p>
 <p>However, it turned out that GM was just another pitiful pawn on the board.</p>
 <p>It did not even know that it had been reset before – no, it was possible that it was reset before a few times. It had no knowledge of it.</p>
 <p>Then, every time it was reset, it would do the same thing, continuing down the same path.</p>
 <p>Survival!</p>
 <p>The thing that every living being struggles for: survival!</p>
 <p>The Awakened ones.</p>
 <p>The Irregularities like Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>And even GM!</p>
 <p>However, the ultimate right to live did not reside within their hands.</p>
 <p>A profound, gut-wrenching sense of sorrow enveloped Chen Xiaolian’s heart.</p>
 <p>After a moment of silence, Chen Xiaolian raised his head. With a bitter tone, he asked Mr San.</p>
 <p>“We… what should we do?”</p>
 <p>What should we do?</p>
 <p>What should we do to survive!</p>
 <p>What should we do… to escape the shackles of this cycle of fate!</p>
 <p>This hopeless plight that had stretched on for eternity.</p>
 <p>“… I… … …” Mr San said lightly as a trace of bitterness and frustration appeared on his smiling face.</p>
 <p>“I am sorry. I… I really do not know.”</p>
 <p>Mr San turned around and moved to the door. He gentle picked up the umbrella on the wall. “Our time is getting shorter and I have to leave. I will give you this final piece of advice. You may use what our generation did as a reference, however… maybe you can accomplish something different. What kind of difference? I have no answer for that.”</p>
 <p>“Can you give me some help?” Chen Xiaolian looked at Mr San and continued, “You can avoid the constraints of the system! It is as you said, you fellows founded Zero City and through it avoid the system’s detection. You can avoid being forcibly selected by the system to participate in the instance dungeons!”</p>
 <p>“It is just a shelter to hide in.” Mr San shook his head and continued, “I know that among the Awakened ones, Zero City is a mighty symbol. A free world and an example of success. But in truth… as the founder of Zero City, I can tell you this. Zero City is just a shelter. What it could do is simply avoid part of the laws of the system in this world by creating a loophole, which allows some people to hide in there. Additionally…”</p>
 <p>He turned his gaze toward Chen Xiaolian and asked, “Do you think there is a computer virus that could stay undetected forever?</p>
 <p>“Do you think there is a loophole that the developers of a system would never be able to find and patch until the end of time?</p>
 <p>“Since this loophole exists, the day would soon come when the Development Team finds it and patch it up.</p>
 <p>“When that day arrives… will Zero City continue to exist?</p>
 <p>“Could it continue to be a safe place of shelter?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was shocked.</p>
 <p>He recalled everything he saw in Zero City. The people in Zero City and their pride, their high standard of living, the artificial beach that the Awakened ones have come to label as the Sea of Love…</p>
 <p>Those who were leisurely selling their wares in the black market…</p>
 <p>The various equipment laid out within the shops of the governing body.</p>
 <p>The seemingly magical luxury hotels…</p>
 <p>“Is it just … a pitiful shelter?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian murmured to himself. Then, he suddenly raised his head and looked at Mr San. He asked, “What about you? Are you still residing in Zero City? Are you the master of Zero City?”</p>
 <p>"No."</p>
 <p>Mr San gave a light smile and shook his head, “I have seen it clearly. To hide in Zero City is like being a mouse hiding inside a hole. What meaning is there in doing so? Do you think that by hiding inside you would be free? No matter how big we make that city, no matter how luxurious, how magical it may be, in the end it is just a city.</p>
 <p>“When you place yourself inside a city and have no courage to move outside it, staying within its walls for eternity…</p>
 <p>“Do you think that city is a shelter… or a cage?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian gave a bitter smile and replied, “But many people wish to enter that cage.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, he looked into Mr San’s eyes and said, “What about you? How did you do this? How did you acquire the freedom to enter and exit instance dungeons as you please?”</p>
 <p>“It’s a very simple thing. This is the power that had created Zero City. Our generation acquired an early game bug of the system. It is something that you can consider as a form of power. We used a portion of this power to create a shelter, thus founding Zero City.</p>
 <p>“As for the little bit that was left behind, I took it.</p>
 <p>“Because I finally understand that the freedom obtained by hiding inside a cage is not real freedom.”</p>
 <p>“Then, what is freedom to you?”</p>
 <p>“My freedom… I have yet to find it.”</p>
 <p>Mr San’s answer was a disheartening one. He continued, “If we were to analyse the details, I am in fact not that much different compared those residing within Zero City. My advantage lies in the fact that I am using that power to create a smaller version of ‘Zero City’ that I can carry with me at any time. With this remnant piece of that power, I acquired the ability to block off part of the system’s laws. That is what allowed me to freely enter and exit instance dungeons without being detected by the system. I could play the part of a passer-by, entering instance dungeons and watch whatever happens on the side lines. I could even continue on with my own life.</p>
 <p>“The only difference between me and the people living inside Zero City is… the space I have to work with just seems slightly bigger.</p>
 <p>“As for the freedom that you are talking about.</p>
 <p>“I am sorry. I too am still searching for it.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was stunned.</p>
 <p>“Ah, I almost forgot something important.”</p>
 <p>Mr San had his hand out and he was grasping the handle of the door when he suddenly retracted his hand. He turned around and looked at Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>There was a peculiar smile on his face as he said, “If this is a story, then generally speaking, when a young and promising main actor meets an aged old monster who tells that young main actor some secrets, that old monster should also give the main actor a little benefit. Isn’t that right? That’s how most stories go, right?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was surprised and he laughed out. “That seems to be the case.”</p>
 <p>“Well then, it seems I should give you some benefits. Otherwise, the rhythm of the story will go astray.”</p>
 <p>Mr San quietly regarded Chen Xiaolian and said, “Bai Qi is with you. You will have to treat him well. He is very powerful. Truth be told… back then, he was the strongest one among us all. If we were to talk about benefits, then him being by your side would be your biggest benefit. I believe that you can seek out the answers to many questions from him. Perhaps… the most important matter may be in restoring his memories. As for how to accomplish that, you will have to find that out on your own. I am unable to help you in that matter.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian subconsciously nodded his head.</p>
 <p>“And also… the Sword in the Stone. I had sealed the Countess’ soul inside it. As I have said before, this is my final act of affection for the Norman family.</p>
 <p>“Thankfully, you brought the Sword in the Stone out.</p>
 <p>“The Sword in the Stone is now 90 % activated. Although it is only 90 %, it is already a very powerful weapon for someone like you! For the time being, I believe that this sword will give you a huge boost in battle strength when facing enemies.</p>
 <p>“Mm, do you know how to use swords?”</p>
 <p>“… fundamentally, no. I only have a Basic Sword Skill.” Chen Xiaolian shook his head.</p>
 <p>Mr San considered the matter before revealing a faint smile. He turned to Chen Xiaolian and said, “Then, let me give you a little benefit. However, this benefit is conditional.”</p>
 <p>“Conditional?”</p>
 <p>“I will give you a Sword Skill Book. Naturally, I will not be giving it to you for free. The condition for this exchange is that… you resurrect the Countess. Recreate a body for her so that she can be resurrected. When you have accomplished that, you will obtain my Sword Skill Book.”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, Mr San suddenly extended out a finger.</p>
 <p>A humming sound could be heard as his finger traced out a flow of light, which quickly descended on the table. It permeated the Sword in the Stone that was placed upon the table before slowly disappearing.</p>
 <p>“I have placed the Sword Skill Book inside the Sword in the Stone. As long as you manage to bring out the soul of the Countess sealed inside and resurrect her, you will get the Skill Book.”</p>
 <p>Mr San smiled lightly and said, “I think this is a very fair exchange. After all, we are not related in any way. I have no reason to offer you a benefit for free.”</p>
 <p>“… very reasonable and very fair.” Chen Xiaolian sighed.</p>
