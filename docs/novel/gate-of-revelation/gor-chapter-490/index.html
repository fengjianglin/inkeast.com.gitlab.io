 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 490 This Man Is Not Him</strong></p>
 <p>Slurp! Slurp! Slurp!</p>
 <p>Fatty gobbled up a bowl of noodles in a Heavenly shaking and Earth shattering manner, his huge head almost buried within the bowl. The pot laid out beside him was almost empty. Only some noodles were left inside the pot.</p>
 <p>The stalwart man sat on a bench and watched Fatty quietly as he ate. The man’s fingers were holding onto a cigarette and he would occasionally take a drag from it.</p>
 <p>After Fatty finished his third helping, the stalwart man asked, “Had your fill yet?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Fatty extended his neck out and released a loud burp. Then, he wiped his mouth sheepishly.</p>
 <p>The stalwart man fixed his eyes on Fatty for a moment before slowly asking, “You… … really know Bluesea? He really is your uncle?”</p>
 <p>“I am not lying to you!” Fatty put the bowl down and said loudly, “I am absolutely not lying to you! It is the truth!”</p>
 <p>“So, how did you find me here?”</p>
 <p>“That…” Fatty’s eyes swivelled about for a moment, but his face remained unchanging. He slowly replied, “Uncle was the one who gave me this address. He said you will be at your old home.”</p>
 <p>“Bluesea…” The stalwart man was unable to stop himself from sighing out. A nostalgic expression washed over his face and he subconsciously moved his fingers across his temple. Although his body was still robust, the hair on the sides of his head had grown white. “We have not met each other for 30 years now. Mm… … since leaving the army, I lost contact with him. I did not think that he would still remember this brother of his.”</p>
 <p>“He remembers! Of course he remembers!” Fatty swiftly cried out. “How could he forget? They would always talk about you.”</p>
 <p>“They?” The stalwart man’s expression flickered.</p>
 <p>“Err… … Uncle Qiao Yifeng and the others,” Fatty quickly added.</p>
 <p>“Little Qiao, how is he doing?”</p>
 <p>“He… … should be doing very well.” Fatty’s tone became slightly odd.</p>
 <p>“But if they are looking for me, why didn’t Bluesea and Little Qiao come themselves? Why did they send you?”</p>
 <p>The man’s expression suddenly sank and he jumped to his feet. Although his military years were long gone, his aura remained extraordinary. The killing intent sharpened through his years within the army now radiated out from him. “Speak! Did something happen to them?!”</p>
 <p>The killing intent shocked Fatty and he quickly said, “Ah, no. Nothing happened to them. It is just… I happened to arrive in XXX City, so I decided to come visit a senior and also to make certain that you are here. Since I have found you… … in the future, they would surely come visit.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Fatty began bluffing by telling the man about some of the habits and unique characteristics of Bluesea and Qiao Yifeng. He even mentioned some of the daily matters relating to those two.</p>
 <p>After the man listened to the words spoken by Fatty, he found that those details were similar to what he remembered of Bluesea and Qiao Yifeng. Thus, the doubt in his heart gradually dissipated.</p>
 <p>“You call them uncle. That means you…”</p>
 <p>“My father was one of their old comrade-in-arms.” Fatty then lowered his head and continued, “It is just… … he is no more.”</p>
 <p>“Oh?” The man looked surprised. “The son of a comrade-in-arms? Eh? Which troop did your father belong to? If he is a comrade of Bluesea and Qiao Yifeng, surely I would know of him as well.”</p>
 <p>Fatty was at a loss for words. As he was wracking his brains on how to repair the hole in his lie, the sound of footsteps and some noise came from the outside of the house.</p>
 <p>“Da Feng!”</p>
 <p>“Uncle Feng!”</p>
 <p>“Uncle Feng!”</p>
 <p>Outside, the members from several associations came surging in. The one in the lead was an old man with average height. He was hunching with both hands behind his back. There was also a middle-aged man with glasses beside him. This man had both his hands inside his pockets as his eyes glanced about.</p>
 <p>“Eh? Director Wu? Elderly Village Chief? Why are you here?”</p>
 <p>The stalwart man stood up and gave the man in glasses, Director Wu, a nod. Next, he personally stepped forward to help support the old man and help him sit down. “Elderly Village Chief, isn’t the meeting in the afternoon? Why did you all come find me even though it is just noon? Have everyone eaten?”</p>
 <p>“That is not important.” The elderly Village Chief shook his head and there was a troubled look on his face. “There is a matter that we want to discuss with you.”</p>
 <p>Although the stalwart man appeared straightforward, he was not an idiot. He looked at Director Wu, who was standing beside them. The stalwart man’s face grew dark and he said in a low voice, “Does Director Wu have any new instructions to give?”</p>
 <p>“I wouldn’t dare to presume to give instructions.” Director Wu spoke slowly, “It is about the land inquisition issue. The people from the top had given word. They are willing to pay 1,000 yuans for every mu (1 mu = 1/15 hectare). I feel that this is quite a good thing, so…”</p>
 <p>“I am not selling my land,” the stalwart man said coldly.</p>
 <p>“Sigh, Da Feng!” Director Wu frowned before continuing, “You need to understand the situation here! This issue involves the development of the town. It is not easy to attract this enterprise here. After selling the land here, we can get a sum of money. After that, we can still go work for the enterprise. Either that or go do some small business. No matter what, it would surely be better than digging the soil. Moreover, the price they are giving is not low at all!”</p>
 <p>The stalwart man snorted. “Let us not go into whether the price is good or not! What does this enterprise plans to do? A paper mill! I was a soldier who did not have a good education. However, I at least know one thing. The pollution from paper mills is excessive! This land they plan to acquire is not far from the fish ponds and the fruit bearing trees in the mountain. If a paper mill is to operate here, how are the other villagers to go on with their lives?”</p>
 <p>Director Wu frowned and his tone grew heated. “Da Feng! You have to look at the big picture! This enterprise’s activity involves…”</p>
 <p>“I don’t care about the big picture. I just want to ask, what were you thinking by wooing such a pollution intensive enterprise? Did the Environmental Protection Department of the county or city approve of this? How do the enterprise plan to deal with the pollution issue? This place does not have a sewage facility. Unless they build one, there is nothing to say here!”</p>
 <p>Fatty had remained seated in silence. He listened to both sides as they argued. A few minutes later, Director Wu waved his hand angrily and left. The other exchanged glances and looked at the stalwart man. The elderly Village Chief sat there quietly and puffed a cigarette.</p>
 <p>“What does elder thinks of this?” The stalwart man sighed.</p>
 <p>The elderly Village Chief remained silent and those few people who came together turned their eyes away.</p>
 <p>Looking at those people, he was unable to stop himself from feeling a tightness within his chest.</p>
 <p>These few people were those who were better off in the village. The younger members of their family had already left to work outside. Some had settled in the county or the city and were able to send some money back home… … if the land acquisition were to go through, these people would leave to settle in the city after getting their share of the money. What would they care about pollution?</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, not every household was in that position.</p>
 <p>Seeing how they were silent, the stalwart man sneered. “I understand. The reason you all came today is to advise me to sell.”</p>
 <p>“Uncle Feng…” A young man spoke up.</p>
 <p>The stalwart man glared at him and shouted, “Little Li, as humans, we must not forget our roots! You are now working in the city and have a safe home. However, this land is where you grew up. You want to sell it off and run away, ignoring the other folks?”</p>
 <p>The faces of the other men had turned red. If not for the fact that the stalwart man had quite the influence within the village, these fellows would probably have begun quarrelling.</p>
 <p>In the end, the elderly Village Chief stood up, snuffed his cigarette and said in a hushed tone, “Let us leave!”</p>
 <p>After saying that, he placed his hands behind his back and walked outside. The young man who was about to speak up earlier cried out, “Elderly Village Chief…”</p>
 <p>“Just leave! Have you not lost enough face?” The elderly Village Chief sighed and turned, giving the stalwart man a glance. “Da Feng, I… … sigh, let us not talk about this anymore.”</p>
 <p>“I understand, you have no choice.” The stalwart man smiled wryly. “Your son works in the township investment department. You must be facing even more pressure than me.”</p>
 <p>The elderly Village Chief waved his hand and left with a muffled sigh. As for the others, they too, scattered like birds.</p>
 <p>After the men left, the stalwart man’s zeal clearly fell. He went back to sit on the bench, but was no longer interested in talking. He had also forgotten about the questions he wanted to ask Fatty.</p>
 <p>A few moments later, the stalwart man got up and moved to get some white alcohol from the kitchen. He tore open the lid with his mouth and took a huge gulp.</p>
 <p>There were no dishes for him to eat with the alcohol so he simply poured out some peanuts and green beans.</p>
 <p>Fatty watched as the stalwart man drank before turning to look around.</p>
 <p>The house was very clean and simple. However, it was obvious that there was no woman or children in the house.</p>
 <p>It was lacking a certain atmosphere.</p>
 <p>As the stalwart man was emotionally troubled, his alcohol tolerance fell somewhat. After downing a bottle, his eyes grew glazed. He then turned to look at Fatty and said, “All right, since you are family, you can just stay at my place for today. There is an empty room at the back. Go get some rest there.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, he stood up unsteadily and walked into the room on the left side of the house. He did not even bother to close the door. In less than a few minutes, the sounds of snoring could be heard coming from inside.</p>
 <p>Fatty sat there with a dazed look on his face. Then, he sighed and mumbled to himself. “Father, it seems you are going through a hard life.”</p>
 <p>Naturally, Fatty did not leave. He rummaged around and figured out the stalwart man’s situation. An old bachelor without any wealth. However, his house was clean and tidy. There was also a wooden dummy for martial arts training in the backyard. It would appear that this stalwart man did not give up on his martial arts.</p>
 <p>When evening came, Fatty returned to the reception room. After closing the gate, he did not go to the room and sleep. He saw that there was an old bamboo chair beside the reception room and moved to lay down on it. It did not take long for him to fall asleep.</p>
 <p>After sleeping for an unknown time, Fatty suddenly woke up. His ears could faintly make out the sound of footsteps coming from the outside. Judging by what he could hear, there were quite some people out there.</p>
 <p>Fatty quickly grew alert. As he was about to stand up, a hand reached out to clamp over his mouth.</p>
 <p>“Don’t make any noise. They are coming for me.”</p>
 <p>The stalwart man’s voice came from within the darkness. The man had, at an unknown moment, come to stand beside Fatty.</p>
 <p>Some figures could be seen moving outside. They could also see the rays from flashlights moving about. It would appear that these men did not intend to sneak in. Rather, they were going to barge in and cause a commotion.</p>
 <p>Someone began knocking on the doors of the hall while others began hollering.</p>
 <p>The stalwart man was silent for a moment before turning to Fatty. He said, “The wall of the backyard is not that high. You go out from there.”</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>“They are coming after me. This is the third time this month. The first two times, they only splashed dung and dog’s blood. It seems today is the day they take action.”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, he retrieved a shoulder pole from behind the door.</p>
 <p>“You, you want to fight them?” Fatty’s eyes lit up.</p>
 <p>The stalwart man snorted and said, “Enough, leave now. Remember to tell my two brothers, tell them… … if there is a chance,&nbsp; let us meet again. Leave quickly! Considering how many of them there are, when a fight breaks out later, I might not be able to protect you.”</p>
 <p>By then, the gate doors were already quaking due to the men’s use of force. It did not take long before the doors broke. Even the frames were twisted as a result.</p>
 <p>“Leave quickly!” The stalwart man shouted. Then, wielding the shoulder pole, he charged forward. Kicking the torn down gate, he rushed outside.</p>
 <p>On the grounds outside stood over 20 low lives. They wore different types of clothing and they were all wielding wooden sticks and iron rods. Some were holding flashlights and they waved their flashlight around.</p>
 <p>A few of the iron rod wielding men were at the door. When they saw the stalwart man rush out, they cursed out and charged viciously.</p>
 <p>The stalwart man’s body moved with vigour. He moved to dodge an incoming iron rod before using his shoulder to slam one of the men. With a turn, he sent his shoulder pole out, striking another low life, sending him falling down the ground. Next, he sent his leg lashing out to kick the one beside him away.</p>
 <p>His skills were exceptional. This charge from him was like a tiger pouncing upon a flock of sheep. With merely two to three exchanges, three men were left lying on the ground.</p>
 <p>Would Fatty leave? He stood at the doorway and watched with glittering eyes.</p>
 <p>Ever since his father disappeared, he had not the opportunity to see him fight. Seeing the opportunity to watch his father, Fatty stood by the side and applauded.</p>
 <p>However, after watching for less than 10 seconds, Fatty’s face turned dejected.</p>
 <p><em>No.</em></p>
 <p>Although the stalwart man was able to wield the shoulder pole skilfully and was able to knock down another two men, he quickly suffered a hit on his shoulder and back from the wooden sticks. His body appeared to be staggering after that.</p>
 <p>Seven to eight rod wielding low lives surrounded the stalwart man and it appeared that he would be unable to hold on.</p>
 <p>At that very moment, Fatty’s felt a thunderous thump roaring out from his heart.</p>
 <p>The illusory feelings and emotions that he had been feeling today was suddenly shattered by what he was seeing right now.</p>
 <p>The stalwart man before him… even though he was his father…</p>
 <p>He was no longer Skyblade!</p>
 <p>No longer was he that all-powerful figure who singlehandedly led his guild into Zero City and become one of its resident guilds. No longer was he the Skyblade who could deter the other pillars from the Board of Patriarchs.</p>
 <p>This stalwart man before Fatty… … was just someone who was resurrected and refreshed after Skyblade’s death…</p>
 <p>An ordinary human.</p>
 <p>Indeed, he was just an ordinary human. He appeared to be skilled. The foundation from his soldiering days and the many years he spent training himself in martial arts were still there. However, he was still just an ordinary human. Additionally, he was already in his fifties and was unable to resist the ravages of time. His physical qualities had declined considerably.</p>
 <p>One of the low lives who were knocked down seized the opportunity to grab the man’s thigh, giving the others the chance to rush the stalwart man. The stalwart man received another two hits and he staggered. It appeared he was close to falling down.</p>
 <p>As the others were about to swarm him…</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>A gunshot rang out.</p>
 <p>One of the low lives had raised his iron rod to smash it down on the stalwart man’s head when a bullet struck him in his shoulder. He fell backward to the ground and lost his grip on the iron rod. At the same time, he cried out in pain.</p>
 <p>The others were all shell shocked by the sound of gunfire. They simultaneously stopped what they were doing.</p>
 <p>Fatty stood in the doorway, a gun in his hand. He cast a fearsome stare at the low lives and shouted, “Whoever wants to die, step forward!”</p>
 <p>He moved the muzzle of the gun, making an arc with it and caused the others to subconsciously take a few steps backward.</p>
 <p>“You… you dare pull out a gun? Son of a bitch! You dare pull a gun on us?!” The leader of the low lives was unable to restrain himself from shouting out. “Great! I was just wondering how I should deal with you two! This time you fellows are dead!”</p>
 <p>“One more word from you and I will have you die right now!”</p>
 <p>That low life leader was so terrified he quickly took a step back.</p>
 <p>“Scram!” Fatty snorted. “This senior has no interest in killing too many fellows. Also, take away the one on the ground as well! If you fellows have what it takes, then come face this senior!”</p>
 <p>Although those low lives were ruthless and fairly courageous, they were not idiots. They looked at the rods and sticks in their hands before looking at the gun in Fatty’s hand. They quickly made a wise decision: Retreat.</p>
 <p><em>We are here to work for money. Why the Hell would we risk our lives?</em></p>
 <p>The low life leader had wanted to leave some threatening parting words. In the end however, he chose to shut his mouth and bring the others with him as he left.</p>
 <p>The stalwart man who was in a seated position on the ground looked at the gun in Fatty’s hand. “You… … how could you have something like this? Who gave it to you?”</p>
 <p>Fatty turned dumbfounded and his mouth twitched.</p>
 <p>He chose not to answer. He moved over to prop the stalwart man into the house and retrieved a med kit.</p>
 <p>“Why are you still staying here? Hurry up and leave! Do you know who you have provoked? By using a gun against them, they will…”</p>
 <p>Fatty bit his lips. However, he continued helping the stalwart man. He pulled off the man’s shirt and saw that he was wearing a vest underneath. Bruises and bloodstains could be seen on the exposed muscles.</p>
 <p>Fatty’s eyes turned red and a desire to rush out and kill off those low lives gushed through his heart.</p>
 <p>The stalwart man stared at Fatty. Then, he suddenly said, “Who exactly are you?”</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>“You are definitely not an ordinary child,” said the stalwart man softly. “In that chaotic situation, you pulled out a gun without shivering and could hit accurately with it. Considering your level of marksmanship, it is clear that you are someone who is used to handling guns. Additionally… … your behaviour after shooting a human, to be able to remain quiet and calm, this is clearly not the first time you used a gun to shoot someone! Kid, where did you come from?”</p>
 <p>At that moment, a sharp scream came from beyond the gate.</p>
 <p>It was as though someone had witnessed something terrifying.</p>
 <p>The screams shocked the stalwart man and Fatty and they jumped to their feet. The two of them walked side by side to the gate only to see the low lives running back at them in a crazed manner. The weapons in their hands were gone and only a few of them continued holding onto their flashlights.</p>
 <p>Also… … their numbers appeared smaller… by half.</p>
 <p>It was as though there was an evil spirit pursuing them. They screamed miserably without respite. Some were even scrambling forward on all fours.</p>
 <p>As they swarmed forward, they saw Fatty. When they did, their faces became akin to those who had met a saviour. One of the low lives shouted, “Quick! Hurry! Ghost! There is a ghost! Quickly pull out your gun! A ghost!”</p>
 <p>Fatty remained silent. However, his ears abruptly picked up a sound.</p>
 <p>“Humph!”</p>
 <p>It was a cold, overbearing and hoarse female voice.</p>
 <p>Fatty looked forward and saw a figure in the distance that was slowly making its way here. It was a woman with dishevelled hair and fiery red leather clothes.</p>
 <p>Judging from her looks, she appeared to be someone in her twenties. She had beautiful features. However, she had a thick layer of makeup on and her hair was dishevelled. In the darkness of the night, her appearance resembled that of a female ghost.</p>
 <p>Step by step, she moved forward. With merely two steps, she caught up to the low life in the rearmost position. Then, she snapped her fingers.</p>
 <p>That low life’s head burst open with a “bang” like an exploding watermelon.</p>
 <p>Next, his body slowly dissolved like a melting ice cream…</p>
 <p>The moment Fatty caught sight of the woman, he involuntarily sucked in a breath of cold air.</p>
 <p>“Flame… Aunt Flame…”</p>
