 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 625 Part 2 Thank You </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian looked down, glancing down at the sword in his hand before looking up at Wu Ya with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You…” Wu Ya, who continued standing atop a flying sword, stared at Chen Xiaolian with a dumbfounded look. “You broke my sword array?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In World’s End, all material came from the cleared instance dungeons.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Foods, clothes, transport… … all of them were dependent on the type of cleared instance dungeons.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>If the system were to send in modern-day city-themed instance dungeons like this Manhattan Island consecutively, materials would become abundant in the short term. However, if the instance dungeons were like the Mausoleum of Qin Shihuang, material would naturally grow scarce.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Despite their abilities, the lives of Irregularities in World’s End were almost similar to that of scavengers in trash dumps.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When resources were scarce, it was natural for Irregularities to come into conflict with each other for the sake of supplies.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya, with only the use of his Unity of Five Energies, had managed to establish renown within World’s End.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although he had also encountered several powerful opponents which required him to utilize the Magical Dragon Transformation skill to kill, none of them could so casually destroy his metal element sword array.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>This kid, what power does he possess?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Broke… …” Chen Xiaolian gave a faint smile and said, “So, its is broken. Not convinced? Do you want to bite me?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian flicked the surface of the sword in his hand with his finger, creating a clear ringing sound.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Earlier, he appeared to be struggling to defend himself with the long blade, swinging left and right. However, he was actually waiting.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Waiting for Wu Ya to temper his flying swords.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The alloy blade that he acquired from Deiha was extremely useless. It was unable to handle the full might of Skyblade’s power. However, due to time constraints, there was no opportunity for Chen Xiaolian to find any replacement for it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The sword array that Wu Ya put up just so happened to provide Chen Xiaolian with that opportunity.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The steel bars from within the structure of the bridge were pulled out and forged into flying swords. Using the elemental energy of metal, Wu Ya tempered the flying swords. The longer the tempering process, the higher their level of durability and sharpness.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The moment the long blade in Chen Xiaolian’s hand broke was the time for him to seize the flying sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The flying sword in his hand was still far inferior to the Sword in the Stone. It also did not come with any added skills. However, it was enough for Chen Xiaolian to fully unleash Skyblade’s power for a moment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian turned to look at Wu Ya, who continued to hover in the air before him. There was still a smile on Chen Xiaolian’s face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Do you know? Someone had once told me that his blade is used for hacking.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Next, Chen Xiaolian slowly raised up the sword until it was high above his head. Next… he hacked down with it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Once again, golden light flashed out. This time, the light shining out from the sword was more glorious and dazzling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The blade of light which could seemingly cut through Heaven descended upon Wu Ya.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Roar!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As the sword was hacking down, Wu Ya released a roar that could not have come from a human.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His right arm suddenly swelled up and numerous black symbols appeared on his white skin. It spread at a quick rate.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The symbols quickly spread out to cover his entire arm. Next, pieces of scales grew out as even his fingers turned thick and sharp.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Just before the golden light struck him, Wu Ya moved his right arm before him to block the incoming golden light.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Next, his right arm swung forward to meet the golden light head on.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The golden light collided against Wu Ya’s right arm like a tangible object and a world-shaking sound erupted all around them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya’s body lurched down heavily as the flying sword that he was on had broken apart in an instant. However, he managed to remain in the air, staring intently at the golden light.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The scales that had just emerged from the surface of his right arm were broken up by the golden light and they shattered apart. Rivulets of blood trickled out from the right arm only to disperse into mist within the air.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was a look of intensity on Wu Ya’s face as he gnashed his teeth hard while continuously growling out. It was an expression of extreme pain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even so, his right arm managed to hold the golden light’s advance.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After several seconds, the sword in Chen Xiaolian’s hand finally descended and the golden light, too, dissipated.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya remained standing in the middle of the air. However, his right arm had become bloody. The golden light had nearly peeled off all the scales there. It now hung limply as the bones inside had seemingly fractured into pieces after receiving the attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya’s right arm had expanded so big that it was several times bigger than Wu Ya himself. It was like an ant holding onto a piece of rice that was several times larger than itself, a most peculiar scene.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As for Chen Xiaolian, there was a slight look of surprise on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Skyblade… …</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Was blocked?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>With the exception of that time in Zero City when he was facing Shen, it had never happened before.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Panicking? Terrified? Insect!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After seeing the look of shock on Chen Xiaolian’s face, Wu Ya laughed out savagely. It seemed as though the pain in his right arm was not affecting him in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As for his body, it continued to transform. Scales continued to spread out from the broken scales on his right arm and they covered his entire body in an instant.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His body, too, expanded rapidly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Two rows of sharp teeth sprouted out from his mouth and a tongue slipped out to dance around in the air, making hissing sounds.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After the scales had covered the surface of his skin, thick but sharp claws extended out from all four limbs.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Magical! Dragon! Transformation!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A roar escaped Wu Ya’s throat, a sound that had seemingly escaped from the depths of Hell itself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian lifted his head to look at Wu Ya, who remained hovering in the middle of the air.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tens of metres tall, the colossal body hovered in the sky by flapping its pair of wings. That stance… … he looked just like a…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Dragon!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, a snake-head jutted out from its neck. Its pair of yellow coloured eyes glared at Chen Xiaolian below while revealing a cruel smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You think you’ve won just because you broke my sword array? Foolish insect! You should feel honoured, for you now face the mighty Wu Ya’s true form, Jormungandr!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The surface of the river beneath the bridge was originally calm without a ripple in sight. However, as Wu Ya was transforming, the surface of the river suddenly moved despite the lack of winds. It slowly moved in a circle, rotating and rotating, until a huge maelstrom was formed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Countless streams of water vapours rose up from the maelstrom, each like a water dragon, and they all swirled before converging upon Wu Ya’s damaged right arm. Steam and magic energies emanated from the arm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The right arm, which was wounded and bloody, swiftly recovered. The speed of recovery was such that it was visible to the naked eye.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian looked on with a serious expression and inhaled deeply. He neither turned to run nor attack. Instead, he placed both palms on the hilt of his sword and slowly raised it up above his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This time, the process was slower. Appearance wise, it was as though the sword in his hand weighed a thousand pounds.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His eyes were utterly fixed upon Wu Ya’s pair of yellow eyes, not nudging away in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This enemy before him was most likely… …</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>[S] class!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
