 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 605 Apologize To You First </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix had both her hands clasped behind her back as she coldly regarded Han Bi, who stood before her. Killing intent exuded from her eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It had been roughly one hour since Chen Xiaolian entered the door. The entire time, Phoenix had not diverted her attention away from Han Bi.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Likewise, the same was true for Han Bi.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, the energy wall between them remained there. No matter how much both sides wished they could rip each other, they were unable to do anything about it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Later, when we exit this instance dungeon, I fear that those two will immediately initiate a duel to the death.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Whispered Nicole as she gave Tian Lie a glance. Tian Lie responded with a nod and snickered. “From the looks of it, there is no way to resolve this but through death. How about it? Do you want to make a bet?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What kind of bet? What are we betting?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Each of us will bet on one of them. The one who bets on the winner wins.” Tian Lie spread open his hands and continued, “Since I am the one proposing, you can be the first to choose. As for what we are betting on, up to you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nicole smirked. “Up to me?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie laughed and said, “I am pretty much naked right now. With the exception of my skills, I have nothing else on me. However… … as long as it is something within the outside world, there are not many things that I, Tian Lie, cannot get hold of. Naturally, your own bet must be of the equivalent value.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nicole tilted her head and considered the proposal. Then, she shook her head and said, “I have my Floater. Points or equipment are fairly pointless. It should probably be the same for you. I cannot think of anything worth using as wager.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Ohh, it turns out even the Floating Angel from Zero City knows fear…” Tian Lie grinned. “Since you are afraid of losing, then forget it.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nicole glared at Tian Lie for a long time before chuckling. “Pathetic attempt at provocation…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“And?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I’ll bet on it!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie burst into laughter. “What is the wager?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nicole turned to face Tian Lie and said carefully, “If you lose, I want you to do one thing.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Which is?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Join Chen Xiaolian's guild.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie grew stunned for a moment. Next, however, he broke into a fit of laughter.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nicole frowned and asked, “What are you laughing at?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie held his stomach and continued to laugh for a while before straightening himself. “What a coincidence, my wager is the same as yours. I had wanted to say, if you lose, join Chen Xiaolian’s guild.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nicole became silent. After some time, she nodded her head. “That is very good.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Very good indeed. So, who are you going to choose?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nicole turned to look at Han Bi. “The one called War Tiger is using the mech armour belonging to the Tiger Angel, the traitor of our Angel Corps. Although I do not know how he obtained the armour… … I do not like him. I bet on him losing.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Humph… …” Tian Lie sent a provoking snicker at Nicole. “Denzel, eh? When I was still a member of Thorned Flower Guild, I had faced him once. He was quite the irritating fellow. Not to mention… … he was also a member of Zero City’s Angel Corps. Regardless if this kid had stolen it, seized it, or picked it up… … since he could wear it, it means… … Denzel is dead. Excellent, I bet on him winning!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The two of them exchanged glances. Nicole then gave a harrumph. “Tian Lie, although we are both Chen Xiaolian’s friend, I have once again confirmed one fact – I really detest you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie laughed out and replied, “Likewise!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Soo Soo had been sitting not far behind the two of them, her head lowered as she played a game with her mobile phone. After Nicole and Tian Lie’s chat ended, Soo Soo raised her head to give the two of them a glance before lowering her head once more. After that, she mumbled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Two immature kids. Truly… … childish!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Finally, a shimmer of light shone from beyond the door.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Everyone turned to look at the door.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian slowly emerged from the door. After his figure had exited the door, the door disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At the same time, the energy wall separating both Han Bi and Phoenix disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Done?” Phoenix gave Chen Xiaolian a slight nod before turning to face Han Bi once more. “If so, now… let us begin.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Since Chen Xiaolian entered the door earlier, Phoenix had been resting herself as she awaited her confrontation with Han Bi. At present, both the cool down for her skills and stamina had been fully restored.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Naturally, the same held true for Han Bi.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He did not say anything. He simply gave a grunt as the Tiger Angel mech armour appeared to cover his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Just now, he had observed the fight between Phoenix and Wang Sheng. Thus, he was aware of Phoenix’s fighting techniques. He was also aware of the danger posed by the strange fire.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Thus, Han Bi had made up his mind to not allow their fight to go on for a long time. That was to decrease the amount of time Phoenix could have to unleash her talisman spells. In order to kill off the woman before him, he must seize the advantage with his first move.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Enough.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian slowly moved forward until he was standing between the two of them. He turned his head to look at them both without revealing any emotions. “Stop fighting.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Xiaolian, step aside. Do you know how long I have been preparing to kill him?” said Phoenix icily.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I know,” replied Chen Xiaolian with a nod of his head. “Not only that, you even gave up 130 years of your lifespan for this. However, I will say it once more, stop fighting.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There had been an autocratic look on Chen Xiaolian’s face the moment he stepped out of the door earlier. Now, the intensity of the look only grew.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Since you know that, you should also know that no one can stop me from killing him today.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Han Bi sneered in response. His words rang from beneath his tiger helmet. “Kill me? Are you sure you are not the one who will die today? Chen Xiaolian, you step…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Enough!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian suddenly let loose a shout of rage. His eyes darted toward Phoenix’s face before turning to Han Bi.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Are you two not going to stop this? I told you to stop fighting!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Thanks to Chen Xiaolian’s burst of fury, the atmosphere of hostility that had been swirling between Han Bi and Phoenix instantly turned into shock.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You want to fight? Bring it! Come fight me! You two come at me together!” Chen Xiaolian summoned out two swords, one in each hand. Next, they thrummed as Skyblade’s power flowed out from his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Why should I fight you? The one who snatched Monster’s spot is him!” said Phoenix coldly as she gave Chen Xiaolian a glance.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Han Bi turned to look at Chen Xiaolian and shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You don’t want to fight? Well, it is not up to you!” For some unknown reason, Chen Xiaolian’s face, which had been one of calmness, suddenly turned into one of tyranny. “You don’t want to attack? Fine, I’ll attack!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Just as those words came out from Chen Xiaolian’s mouth, he charged toward Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The stunned Phoenix hastily retreated. Her left hand moved and numerous talismans spread out before her. “Chen Xiaolian, have you gone mad?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian did not reply. He did not stop charging at all. All he did was to change his stance somewhat. Swinging his two swords, he created a screen of light to block off Phoenix’s talisman spell. Thus, the talismans fell upon the swords.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Her Suppression Symbols of Ten Heavens and Eight Desolations did not possess much damaging properties by itself. It was mainly used to limit the movements of her opponent.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>By supplementing it with the True Samadhi Fire skill, however, it transformed into a terrifying skill. By having the symbols from the talismans seep into her opponent’s body, she could implode her opponent with the True Samadhi Fire. The fire, ignited from within the opponent’s body, would be capable of reducing the opponent into ashes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Having faced it earlier, Chen Xiaolian had figured out Phoenix’s combat technique. He had also figured out a way to beat it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The two swords he wielded were just common system weapons. However, after infusing Skyblade’s power into it, the swords became indestructible.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Despite its intangibility, the Suppression Symbols of Ten Heavens and Eight Desolations were not objects that he could simply hack away. Chen Xiaolian brandished his two swords around him with such precision that not a single one of the talisman symbols could hit him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In just an instant, over a hundred talisman symbols had been struck by Chen Xiaolian’s swords. If not for Skyblade’s power, the resulting heaviness of the swords would have made it impossible for Chen Xiaolian to continue holding them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing that the swords had reached its limit, Chen Xiaolian bellowed out as he tossed the swords away. In the blink of an eye, he had summoned out another two swords.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The two swords from earlier crashed to the ground heavily. The tiles on the arena cracked and stone chips flew. It was as though the ground had been subjected to two piling machines.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At the same time, Chen Xiaolian had already arrived before Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix’s pupils contracted. Flames had risen up from the wand in her right hand. “Chen Xiaolian! Back off! You no longer have any chances for revival!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, Chen Xiaolian appeared to have turned deaf. The sword in his right hand stabbed toward Phoenix’s wand. As a result, the True Samadhi Fire burst out and instantly engulfed the sword, turning it into liquidized metal.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The instant the sword melted, Skyblade’s [S] class power burst out as well. A power with unparalleled ferocity struck Phoenix’s wand, causing it to fly away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even though Chen Xiaolian was only wielding an ordinary sword, with the [S] class power, he could not only knock the wand away, he could even smash it into pieces, easily. However, the wand only flew away and was otherwise undamaged at all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In the very next moment, Chen Xiaolian’s palm formed a blade shape and made contact with Phoenix’s neck.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix’s body shuddered and she could only look at Chen Xiaolian in disbelief before falling limply to the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian breathed a sigh of relief. After carefully placing the unconscious Phoenix on the ground, he moved to pick up the wand and handed it to Soo Soo. “Keep an eye on her.”</span></p>
