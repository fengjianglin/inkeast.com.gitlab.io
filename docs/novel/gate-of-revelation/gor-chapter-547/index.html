 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 547 Fallen Soo Soo</strong></p>
 <p>“… yes.” Chen Xiaolian answered Soo Soo’s question and continued, “However, we still cannot confirm it for now. At present, it would appear that there is nope. Additionally, the possibility of this being true is considerable.”</p>
 <p>Hearing his words, Soo Soo then entered a state of silence. Next, remaining barefooted, she walked forward until she was standing before everyone in the room. After that, she acted oblivious to everyone’s presence and picked up the water canteen on the table before pouring herself a cup of cold water.</p>
 <p>The little girl gulped down the cup of water one mouthful after another. After that, she turned around to look at Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>She appeared to be considering something as she slowly spoke up, “A considerable hope, is it, Xiaolian oppa? If that is the case… … that is very good. Sister will have the chance to be resurrected. That is very good.”</p>
 <p>As she said the words “very good”, her eyes showed no trace of joy.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian could sense that the girl before him was giving off the emotion of… … iciness.</p>
 <p>“Soo Soo, what is wrong with you?” Chen Xiaolian stood up and walked over. He then crouched down before Soo Soo and looked right into her eyes.</p>
 <p>Soo Soo did not evade Chen Xiaolian’s gaze; she allowed him to look at her as she looked right back at him.</p>
 <p>“Xiaolian oppa, for you to crouch down before me to talk to me – that is only something adults would do when they are talking to little kids. In your heart, you still think of me as a little child who does not understand anything, is that it?” said Soo Soo as she shook her head.</p>
 <p>“… … …” Chen Xiaolian was at a loss for words and he did not know how to respond to that.</p>
 <p>“Xiaolian oppa brought back a piece of good news. Although it has yet to come to fruition, this thing would probably end on a happy note. Soo Soo feels very happy as well,” Soo Soo said in a hushed tone. However, she had said those words using a cold and mechanical voice. Her actions gave Chen Xiaolian an odd feeling. In fact, he also felt his scalp tingle from that.</p>
 <p>“Soo Soo!” Chen Xiaolian was unable to stop himself from reaching his hand out to embrace Soo Soo. He then said in a whisper, “What is wrong with you? Is it… … do you not feel well? You must have been feeling very sad for the past few days, but now, at least there is hope now. You… …”</p>
 <p>“I am feeling very good right now. Besides, there is hope for sister to be resurrected now. Of course I will feel even better.”</p>
 <p>Unexpectedly, Soo Soo took the initiative to extricate herself from Chen Xiaolian’s arms and stepped back, putting some distance between her and Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>She looked Chen Xiaolian in the eyes and suddenly said, “Next time, Xiaolian oppa, please don’t use this kind of way to talk to me. I mean how you crouch down to talk to me. You keep treating me like a little child.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Soo Soo turned her head to look at the others.</p>
 <p><em>That… what is up with that expression… …</em></p>
 <p>It was an expression of indifference, as though there was no one there; no flicker of emotions. Those who caught sight of her black pupils were unable to stop themselves from feeling an indescribably sense of suppression.</p>
 <p>“Well, since we are done here, I will be going back to rest.” Soo Soo gave Chen Xiaolian a nod. “If there is better news, Xiaolian oppa will certainly tell me about it, right?”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Soo Soo walked back into her room with an air of indifference.</p>
 <p>When the door to her room closed shut, Chen Xiaolian found himself at a loss.</p>
 <p>A few seconds later, Chen Xiaolian stood up and cast a frown at Roddy.</p>
 <p>Roddy tapped his nose and responded, “I… … have not had the time to tell you. For the past few days, Soo Soo’s state… I am not sure what to make of it either.”</p>
 <p>“What is going on?” asked Chen Xiaolian gravely. “Why didn’t you say anything while we were on the road?”</p>
 <p>“… … …” Roddy said nothing.</p>
 <p>Next, Chen Xiaolian sighed. He understood the difficulties Roddy faced – he must have been worried for Chen Xiaolian. Thus, when he informed Chen Xiaolian about what was going on with the others, he had omitted Soo Soo.</p>
 <p>“For the past few days, Soo Soo had been very quiet… … more accurately, she appeared to have changed into a completely different person. Regardless of who she sees, she would display that cold expression. She would not smile … … and there are no other emotions on her face either. She is just like that vengeful spirit from the Japanese movie,” said Roddy with a frown. “Additionally, it would appear that she rarely leaves her room. It is only during meal time that she would come out to get something to eat before returning to her room.”</p>
 <p>“… … …”</p>
 <p>“In the beginning, I assumed that she was overcome by grief. So, I attempted to comfort her to no avail. I also dared not say too much for fear of inciting her emotions.” Roddy smiled bitterly. “Thankfully, you are back… well, I originally thought that she would get better after seeing you. Doesn’t she usually trust and stay close to you? Why is it… … after seeing you, she remains so cold.”</p>
 <p>Before Chen Xiaolian could respond to that, Lun Tai spoke up.</p>
 <p>“Xiaolian, I think there is something really wrong with the girl.” Lun Tai furrowed his brows and there was a very serious look on his face.</p>
 <p>“Why do you say that?”</p>
 <p>“Before this, I had heard you talking about Soo Soo’s dual personality problem. Whenever she receives a shock, she would be forced to assume her second personality. Unlike the first personality, which is that of an ordinary and lovable little girl, the second personality is that of a very gloomy person. For the past few days, I felt that… … Soo Soo had become very unfamiliar!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s face flickered and he said, “You mean to say…”</p>
 <p>“Maybe, after her second personality emerged, it did not revert back… … I am worried. If this keeps up for too long, it might cause a huge problem.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian frowned. “Usually, after her second personality emerges, she would revert to her first personality with just a round of sleep. This time… … could it be that Qiao Qiao’s death brought too much of a shock to her?”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Inside the room…</p>
 <p>Soo Soo stood before a mirror.</p>
 <p>She allowed her hair to remain dishevelled as she looked at her reflection in the mirror.</p>
 <p>Her originally lovable face now wore a look of indifference.</p>
 <p>She looked at her own eyes that were reflected by the mirror and suddenly released a faint sigh.</p>
 <p>“You are feeling very happy, aren’t you? Hearing that Qiao Qiao unnie can be resurrected.”</p>
 <p>She appeared to be talking to herself. “However, you are so stupid. So stupid that I, who shares this body with you, feel ashamed on your behalf.”</p>
 <p>Using one finger, she gently rolled up a strand of her dishevelled hair. Next, she said slowly, “Did you forget? Her father may well be the one who killed our parents. This grudge, could we just let it go?”</p>
 <p>“Sister dying is originally something we should feel relieved for. After all, sister had always treated us so well. If she were alive, I would be unwilling to harm even a finger on her.</p>
 <p>“Originally, I planned to just take revenge on Mr Qiao alone.</p>
 <p>“But what do I do now? Sister can be resurrected ah.</p>
 <p>“Although I also feel very happy to hear that… … what about our revenge?</p>
 <p>“Qiao Yifeng, he must die.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Soo Soo gave a light yawn. “So tired. I will need more time to adapt to controlling this body for so long. I have to go sleep for a bit.”</p>
 <p>Soo Soo stretched out her finger to tap her face on the mirror and said, “You must really want to get out, don’t you? It would be better if you don’t… … you are too weak. Exacting vengeance, just leave it to me. You are better off staying as a sweet little girl.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Soo Soo turned around and got into her bed.</p>
 <p>On the mirror… was Soo Soo’s face.</p>
 <p>The face inside the mirror was filled with anxiousness and her eyes looked on pleadingly…</p>
 <p>…</p>
