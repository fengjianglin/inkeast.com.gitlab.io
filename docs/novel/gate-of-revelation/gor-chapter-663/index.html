 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 663 Not Right </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although the items inside the little cabin were simplistic, they were quite adequate. Qiao Qiao took a few pieces of the dried meat hanging from the rope and cut it into smaller pieces. Then, she pulled out a small iron pot from a cabinet located in the corner. Stepping out, she hauled some of the ice outside and melted it, making a pot of broth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The last time Chen Xiaolian and Bluesea had a meal was before they had left the little village. They had long since grown hungry and were holding on through sheer will. Although the pot of broth lacked fat and seasoning, it was quickly gulped down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Is it enough? Do you want me to make some more?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Qiao Qiao had only drank a few times before putting down the bowl in her hands. She placed both her palms upon her cheeks and cast a smile at Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After downing half the pot of broth, Chen Xiaolian felt full. Bluesea, on the other hand, appeared to not have had enough.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Uncle Bluesea, do you want me to cook up another pot?” Qiao Qiao quickly stood up. However, she saw Bluesea shaking his head as he walked toward the pieces of dried meat hanging in the corner.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea plucked down one of them and held it with both hands. He lowered his head and was silent for a moment before several tendrils emerged from his wrist to envelop the piece of dried meat.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After wrapping themselves over the piece of dried meat, the tendrils immediately turned flat as they swallowed the piece of meat into themselves.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The whole piece of dried meat disappeared in the blink of an eye and Bluesea appeared to be in a better state.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“This method seems more efficient.” Bluesea smiled and he plucked down even more of the dried meats hanging down from the ceiling and used the tendrils to absorb them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In but a flash, all the dried meats had been swallowed up by the tendrils.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian and Qiao Qiao watched while gaping.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>All those dried meats were enough for ten plus meals for a normal adult male. Yet, they were all downed by Bluesea in a matter of minutes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Since waking up on the helicopter, Bluesea had appeared somewhat weak. Now that he had taken in those dried meats, he regained his colour. Rather, he appeared even better compared to his initial state when he had just obtained the Bug Armour.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After swallowing the last piece of dried meat, he flicked his palms and turned toward Chen Xiaolian and Qiao Qiao. He gave a faint smile. “It looks disgusting, doesn’t it?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“A little.” Chen Xiaolian smiled back coolly. “However, it is very effective, no?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes, compared to eating to recover, this method restores my strength at a much faster rate. Truth be told, I have a question.” Bluesea suddenly asked, “After fusing with this Bug Armour, I can no longer be considered an ordinary human, right? So, if you bring me back to the outside world and I get resurrected, will I still have these abilities?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Earlier, they had to fight, kill and escape. Only now did they get the chance to settle down. Thus, he had never considered it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I think… … it should be possible.” Frowning, Chen Xiaolian considered it for quite some time before slowly answering.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If so… … does that mean I can still do something for Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild?” Bluesea was silent for a moment before speaking up again. “Assuming they are not all dead already, that is.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That I cannot be certain.” Chen Xiaolian shook his head slowly. “At any rate, the current situation is different from the norm. How many of Zero City’s residents managed to make it out? How many Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild members are with them? How much strength do these remnant forces possess? I am uncertain about all those. Additionally, after the other Awakened guilds find out that Zero City had been destroyed, what actions will they take? That is an even bigger of an unknown. Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild had a glorious history. But now, I fear it has fallen to become but a common and minor guild. It might end up facing plunderers with tiger-like eyes. Adding your presence alone, I fear…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“One more is always a good thing.” Bluesea released a soft sigh.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“But, Mr Bluesea, there is no need for you to do that.” Chen Xiaolian revealed a pained smile. “You have already died once back in Zero City. You no longer have the identity of an Awakened! Were it not for me, you would not have known at all! There is no longer any relationship between Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild and the current you!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The dead Bluesea is also Bluesea. Dying does not absolve one of his or her responsibilities.” Bluesea shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mr Bluesea…” Chen Xiaolian sighed helplessly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Since the Blood Verdict incident, Chen Xiaolian had known just how much of himself Bluesea had poured into Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild. He would not hesitate to use his own life to extend the guild’s existence for just a little longer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, Chen Xiaolian never expected, that after Bluesea had become an ordinary human, having lost his memories as an Awakened, he would still refuse to let go.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian’s mind raced and his face suddenly flickered. “Wait.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What is it?” asked Bluesea with a frown.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian lowered his head and fell silent for a lengthy period of time before slowly raising his head again. “Mr Bluesea, you will likely become… … the most novel existence in the world.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What do you mean?” Bluesea asked with slightly furrowed brows.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian inhaled and smiled. “Before this, I had informed you that all Players, Awakened ones and Irregularities are under the control of the system. The system would issue out quests and send us into instance dungeons. Although we will possess abilities that ordinary humans could never possess, we, in return, will constantly face life-threatening dangers.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I remember.” Bluesea nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“At present, however, you are different.” Chen Xiaolian pointed at Bluesea’s chest. “You just so happened to become the host for Hammer’s Bug Armour, giving you abilities the likes of Awakened ones and Players. Even so, you remain an ordinary human! An ordinary human with special abilities!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea nodded his head. There was no look of surprise on his face. Instead, he contemplated silently for a moment before releasing a sigh. “Does that mean… … I cannot fight alongside the other members of Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“As expected, you are very astute.” There was a wry smile on Chen Xiaolian’s face as he nodded. “As you are an ordinary human, the system cannot… … or at least, judging from the present state of affairs, the system will not issue quests for ordinary humans! Even if you place yourself within an instance dungeon before it starts, you cannot enter the instance dungeon as a participant and fight alongside your guild members. You cannot even… … re-join Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Is there no solution to the issue?” Bluesea asked softly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No.” Chen Xiaolian hesitated for a moment before shaking his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was not that Chen Xiaolian was unable to fulfil Bluesea’s request.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After successfully bringing Bluesea back to the outside world, he could utilize the metal sphere to turn him from an ordinary human into an Irregularity, giving him back his former memories and abilities in the process.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, Chen Xiaolian had no intentions of doing that.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>For Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild, for Zero City, Bluesea had already given up so much.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The responsibilities that he had to bear had already exceeded the limits of what he should have.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Also, his current state was something that all Awakened ones could only dream of – the power without the need to fight and kill or be killed within instance dungeons. There was no need to bear any responsibilities.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian still held the hope that Bluesea could live in peace.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Is that so?” A trace of disappointment flashed across Bluesea’s eyes and he nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Don’t think so much about it, Mr Bluesea.” Chen Xiaolian patted his shoulder. “After returning, live a good life as an ordinary human.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“We’ll have to wait until we have smoothly gotten out before discussing about that.” Bluesea shook his head somewhat.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“There are no pursuers chasing us right now. Besides, Sister Yun is about to come meet us. What else is there to worry about?” Chen Xiaolian smiled. “We just need to wait for another 10 plus hours.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I fear… it is not that simple.” Bluesea gave Chen Xiaolian a glance. “Something is not right.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
