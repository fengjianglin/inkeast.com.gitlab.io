 <p><strong><u>GOR Chapter 26: Must Survive</u></strong></p>
 <p>We must not continue staying in this cove. This place is too dangerous!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian pulled the two females over and made the decision to leave this place.</p>
 <p>“Let us continue moving forward.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian had no choice but to make this decision.</p>
 <p>Go back? That would mean going through the stone stairway on the cliff! In addition… they had seen a spider corpse upon the stairway before. This meant that there was a possibility of the spiders crawling up there. If they were to encounter those spiders while climbing the stairway, then they would have no place to escape to.</p>
 <p>Go further back? The great hall with Demon Soldiers had been made to collapse and is now blocked off. There is no way to move back.</p>
 <p>The only way out is… to move forward.</p>
 <p>“We’ll go slower, maintain vigilance at all time… hopefully, we will not meet the Wind Slasher Guild members.”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>He brought the two females together with him; the wound on the flight attendant’s thigh had already been tied up. Chen Xiaolian had hesitated and chosen not to give Takashimoto Shizuka the Healing Beast Blood – it was not because Chen Xiaolian was being stingy but because there was only one [Mid] class Healing Beast Blood left!</p>
 <p>There was no telling what they would end up encountering. In case a fight was to erupt, he might require it. Not to mention… only by having himself survive would the two females have any hope of staying alive.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was not being selfish. At a time like this, he had to make this choice.</p>
 <p>He had one of Takashimoto Shizuka’s hand draped over his shoulders as they moved. As for Soo Soo, he had Shizuka use her other hand to hold on to her.</p>
 <p>En, Garfield was up front scouting ahead.</p>
 <p>Although their speed was slow, the three of them exited the cove rapidly. Before them…</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Outside the cove was a cliff!</p>
 <p>A bottomless chasm was laid out before them! Tens of metres away on the opposite area was another cliff.</p>
 <p>The one thing connecting the two cliffs was a rickety iron chain bridge. Although there were some boards atop it, they were basically all rotten. In addition, there was also blowing winds here. Under the roaring winds, the iron chain bridge swayed unsteadily between the two cliffs, akin to a swing…</p>
 <p>Heavily gritting his teeth, Chen Xiaolian turned to look at the pale faced Takashimoto Shizuka, then towards Soo Soo.</p>
 <p>The Japanese flight attendant’s thigh had suffered from an injury while Soo Soo was lacking in strength… it was unlikely that these two females would be able to cross this unsteady iron chain bridge with their own strength.</p>
 <p>“I can bring you across… however…” Chen Xiaolian frowned. “I only have two hands. One will be holding onto the iron chain while the other hand holds on to one person. Thus… I will need to do it twice.”</p>
 <p>The two females understood.</p>
 <p>“Oppa, bring unnie over first. I will wait for you here. I will be obedient and won’t run around,” Soo Soo blinked her big round eyes as she said.</p>
 <p>Those dark round eyes, it was simply too adorable for Chen Xiaolian to resist.</p>
 <p>“Take her over first…” Takashimoto Shizuka whispered. “She is a child, it is more important to protect her safety.”</p>
 <p>“That is enough, stop it,” Chen Xiaolian thought about it. “Truth is, there is not much of a difference… even though this place is not safe, the same could be said about the other side. It does not matter who I send over first, when I am coming back here for the other person, the one on the other side would be left alone… theoretically speaking, the risk is the same for both sides.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian thought about how to proceed. He summoned Garfield back into the system before bringing Soo Soo over the bridge!</p>
 <p>The process in itself was scary but actually of no real risk. The iron chain bridge swayed a lot and the little girl was scared to the point of closing off her eyes. So, Chen Xiaolian hugged her with one hand as she tightly held onto his neck…</p>
 <p>With Chen Xiaolian’s current level of astonishing Physique, his strength was comparable to a low class War Beast. (Four-Eyed War Cat expressed its discontent: Who are you calling a low class War Beast?)</p>
 <p>After crossing the bridge, Chen Xiaolian placed Soo Soo down on the ground before summoning out Garfield to keep her company. If any danger were to appear, this guy would be able to at least do something about it.</p>
 <p>However, as Chen Xiaolian was moving back using the iron chain bridge…</p>
 <p>Boom!!!</p>
 <p>Both cliffs abruptly shook with severe intensity!</p>
 <p>“Earthquake?!”</p>
 <p>It was then followed by the sound of rumbling!</p>
 <p>The ground kept shaking! Stones fell continuously from above the cliffs! Soo Soo who was on the other side began crying as she squatted down on the ground, covering her ears.</p>
 <p>Takashimoto Shizuka was also scared, her ability to stand firmly lost as she fell onto a sitting position on the ground.</p>
 <p>It was then that a loud bang erupted!</p>
 <p>Somewhere on the other side, a place deeper into the instance dungeon… a seemingly vast amount of light flashed out!</p>
 <p>It appeared to be due to something exploding!</p>
 <p>The intensity of the quakes gradually increased!</p>
 <p>The iron chains emitted groaning sounds! The degree of swaying was nearing 360 degrees! Chen Xiaolian who was on it was unable to move forward at all and could only hold on to the iron chains!</p>
 <p>It was at this moment that an unpleasant sound of twisting metal could be heard!</p>
 <p>The iron chain fixed upon Takashimoto Shizuka’s cliff area suddenly issued out a cracking sound! An iron chain broke off. With a “xiu”, it fell down the cliff!</p>
 <p>“Son of a bitch!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian cursed loudly.</p>
 <p>“Mr Xiaolian!”</p>
 <p>Takashimoto Shizuka suddenly stopped crying. She vigorously jumped up from the ground, throwing herself onto the side of the cliff.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian shouted. “Don’t go near the cliff! Stand properly and wait for me to pick you up!”</p>
 <p>Takashimoto Shizuka bit down hard on her lips.</p>
 <p>At present, blood had started flowing from her lips! The weak Japanese flight attendant’s eyes flashed with absolute determination!</p>
 <p>“Mr. Xiaolian! You must go back quickly! Do not come over!”</p>
 <p>“Don’t talk nonsense! Retreat from the cliff side! Wait for me!” Chen Xiaolian was furious. He gripped onto the iron chain and stepped several paces forward.</p>
 <p>Kacha!</p>
 <p>Another iron chain had broken!</p>
 <p>This time around, the breaking sound came from Soo Soo’s area.</p>
 <p>“Mr. Xiaolian! Quickly go back!” Takashimoto Shizuka’s face was filled with tears. “Enough! It is enough! You have done more than enough for us! The iron chain is about to break! Quickly go back!”</p>
 <p>Plop.</p>
 <p>Takashimoto Shizuka knelt down on the ground, clenched her fists tightly and exerted all her strength to shout. “Enough! It is really enough! Don’t risk yourself for us anymore! You have done enough! The chain is going to break! Quickly go back!”</p>
 <p>“I can still try!” Chen Xiaolian gritted his teeth and moved yet another two paces forward. This time though, a “kacha” sound rang out… another heart shaking sound came from the connection point for the iron chains!</p>
 <p>“Go back!”</p>
 <p>Takashimoto Shizuka suddenly jumped up. “Quickly go back! Even if you come over, the iron chain is going to break and you won’t be able to reach the other side! Soo Soo is still over there!”</p>
 <p>“I…” Chen Xiaolian’s heart was filled with regret.</p>
 <p>“Go back! I will be waiting over here. When you are safe, you can think of a way to save me… do not worry about me, I will be waiting here.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was thinking of saying something. However, the weak Japanese flight attendant, Takashimoto Shizuka suddenly seemed to be bursting with courage.</p>
 <p>“If you still won’t go back! I will immediately jump down the cliff!”</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Another loud sound rang out! In the connection area for the iron chains, a small chunk of stone broke off directly and fell into the deep abyss…</p>
 <p>Seeing the iron chain bridge teetering on the brink of collapse, in just another moment…</p>
 <p>“I will really jump!”</p>
 <p>Seeing how Chen Xiaolian was still hesitating, Takashimoto Shizuka suddenly took a step towards the side of the cliff…</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian could see that this Japanese woman was serious!</p>
 <p>“Don’t! I will go back! I will go back!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian understands as well that the matter was no longer possible.</p>
 <p>Three iron chain had broken off in succession. The bridge could collapse at any given moment!</p>
 <p>He quickly retreated until he reached the side of the cliff…</p>
 <p>Just as his feet came in contact with the ground…</p>
 <p>With a bang, the connection point for the iron chain bridge at Takashimoto Shizuka’s side completely broke! The entire iron chain bridge fell down into the abyss…</p>
 <p>Holding on to Soo Soo, Chen Xiaolian quickly retreated…</p>
 <p>The rumbling sounds continued non-stop as the number of broken rocks increased. Both sides of the cliff had an entire piece directly chipped off!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian brought Soo Soo over to a safe area before looking back to the other side. He then breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>Takashimoto Shizuka was still there. She had safely retreated several metres away from the cliff side.</p>
 <p>Countless rocks had fallen down, transforming into an obstruction blocking the path that they had used to exit the spider cove!</p>
 <p>This meant that Takashimoto Shizuka was now eternally trapped on the other side, a place upon the cliff with a surface area of less than tens of metres.</p>
 <p>Taking a deep breath, Chen Xiaolian shouted loudly. “Wait for me! I will definitely think of a way to save you!”</p>
 <p>Takashimoto Shizuka stood there, her face filled with tears. She forced herself to put on a smile; she then waved with all her might and shouted in a loud voice. “You must survive, Mr Xiaolian!”</p>
 <p>She gently rubbed away her tears and murmured. “You must live on… you must.”</p>
