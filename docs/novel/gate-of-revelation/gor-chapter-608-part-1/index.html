 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 608 Part 1 Stop? </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I… go?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie frowned and said, “Zero City’s entrance has always been a highly-guarded secret, what more now… I cannot even find the Awakened survivors of Zero City. How would I go about finding the entrance to Zero City?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Catch.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The punk youngster softly swung his right hand at Tian Lie. The very instant he did so, a small blade appeared within his palm. The small blade flew through the air toward Tian Lie.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After using one hand to receive the small blade, Tian Lie examined it. Besides the exquisite and complicated patterns on the sheath, there was no other noticeable aspect. Even his personal system gave no prompt regarding the small blade.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>That meant… the small blade had nothing to do with the system; it had no equipment characteristics.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“This is…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Something that can allow you to enter Zero City.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Our walk… … is over?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Adam raised his head to look at Shen, who was holding his hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes.” Shen nodded with a smile. “Zero City is a very small place. Just by strolling a bit, you will reach its edge. At any rate… … this place is not as big as the outside world.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The outside world… … very big?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Very big, boundlessly so.” Shen smiled and raised his head to look up at the sky. The dark clouds continued to gather and only a small ray of sunlight was able to pierce through the gaps among the dark clouds.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Boundless…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Adam sat down and fiddled with his fingers. “No one has ever informed me that the outside world is like that… even Gibbs… … he has never been willing to inform me.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Do you want to know about it?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mm.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The outside world, like Zero City, is fake. However… … at the very least, the amount of fake things it has is far greater that those within Zero City. It is more diverse, more colourful. Edges of the world shrouded by cold, blazing hot desert, rainforests, mountains higher than the clouds…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Adam held his cheeks as Shen sat down before continuing. Hearing Shen’s description of the outside world, like a flowing stream of river, the yearning in his eyes grew stronger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Chen-san, there is disorder in your heart.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sawakita Mitsuo walked to stand before Chen Xiaolian while fanning himself. There was a smile on his face as he looked at Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian raised his head to look at Sawakita Mitsuo. He gave Sawakita Mitsuo a nod before lowering his head again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Huh!” Not caring that the ground may be dirty, Sawakita Mitsuo sat down cross-legged before Chen Xiaolian. “I’m old now, my legs can no longer bend down. Come, sit down, accompany this old man for a chat. I believe it will be a while before that big fellow comes out. It is rare for us to be able to meet. We might as well use this opportunity for a good chat.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Sir Generalissimo has given the decree, dare I disobey?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian raised his head again and forced out a smile. Although he was in a bad mood, he could not be too ill-mannered against someone as respectable as Sawakita Mitsuo.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“We are already old acquaintances, why still address me as Sir Generalissimo?” Sawakita Mitsuo laughed. “This old man is just curious. Why did Chen-san actually appear in this instance dungeon?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian’s keen sense allowed him to notice the insinuation within Sawakita Mitsuo’s words. “When you put it that way, Mr Sawakita had already known that… … I will be coming.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes. Not just Chen-san. There is also little Phoenix and…” Sawakita Mitsuo pointed at the distant Han Bi. “The Guild Leader of War Tiger Guild.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian nodded his head. Although Sawakita Mitsuo had not mentioned how he knew, it must surely have something to do with Mr San.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However… why did Mr San have them all gather here?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>According to the Second Middle syndrome patient kid who had proclaimed himself as Nightmare, Mr San said that if the Awakened ones do not unite quickly, a huge calamity will befall them soon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After entering this instance dungeon with Phoenix, he met and joined up with Sawakita Mitsuo and Han Bi, and met the two old monsters. However, Chen Xiaolian could not figure out the connection between his current situation and a calamity.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This instance dungeon was simply something the two old monsters had seized control over and used as a means to hide from the system, a safehouse of sorts. All Chen Xiaolian managed to acquire from them was a chance to resurrect Qiao Qiao.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although resurrecting Qiao Qiao was a highly important matter for Chen Xiaolian, at the end of the day, it had nothing to do with the word calamity.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>If so… what was the calamity that Mr San mentioned?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Also, why have Chen Xiaolian meet up with all of them for that calamity?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, those were but the fleeting thoughts within his mind. Seeing the flickering expressions on Chen Xiaolian’s face, Sawakita Mitsuo laughed out and said, “Chen-san… some things, if you cannot figure it out, then do not keep thinking about it for the time being. Do not give yourself a headache over a problem that you feel you cannot solve for now. Why don’t you… … answer a question of mine first?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Please ask, Mr Sawakita.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I heard that…” Sawakita Mitsuo leaned his body forward ever so slightly and looked directly at Chen Xiaolian. “Zero City appears to have fallen. I wonder if Chen-san had heard anything about it?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian took a deep breath as he looked at Sawakita Mitsuo. He nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It seems… Chen-san did not just hear about it.” Sawakita Mitsuo flipped his fan shut. With clear eyes, he said, “I wonder, can you tell this old man more?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian’s face took a solemn expression and he pondered the matter carefully for a long time. Next, he bowed toward Sawakita Mitsuo while remaining seated. “Zero City’s fall… … I not only know about it. That day, I was in Zero City. However… … I am sorry, Great Teacher Sawakita. At present, I cannot tell you about it.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I see…” Sawakita Mitsuo exchanged glances with Chen Xiaolian for quite some time. Then, he slowly nodded his head. “To be able to, at the very least, get confirmation from Chen-san about Zero City’s fall, this old man… … is satisfied.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Great Teacher Sawakita, I hold a great deal of respect toward you. Thus, I am unwilling to lie to you.” Chen Xiaolian gave a wry smile and continued, “It is just… … there are too many secrets connected to Zero City’s fall. I hope you can forgive me.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Chen-san, you are showing so much sincerity toward a useless old man like me. In recent years, the number of outstanding young men with such politeness is getting scarce.” Sawakita Mitsuo sighed. “However, I have one last question. If possible, I hope that Chen-san can answer it for me.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Great Teacher, please ask.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The one to lead the offensive against Zero City, was it Thorned Flower’s Guild Leader, Shen?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian calmly nodded his head. “Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As soon as he had spoken his answer, a door appeared in the centre of the arena.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie strode out from the door, which then disappeared behind him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I believe there is nothing else that anyone wants to bring up with us, right? Even if there is, I don’t want to deal with it anymore. You fellows, just go away.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie had just stepped out from the door when the punk youngster’s voice rang out. Immediately, without giving anyone the time to react, a curtain of light swept forward. When Chen Xiaolian checked his surroundings, he saw that he was no longer within the colosseum. Rather, he was within a valley.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There were only Soo Soo and Phoenix standing beside him. As for Sawakita Mitsuo, Tian Lie, Nicole, and the others, they had been teleported to some other place.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The timer within the system flashed. It quickly began ticking like normal once more. However, the amount of time passed…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Three days!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Since time was ticking normally, it meant they had left the instance dungeon. It would appear that in the process of sending them out, the two old monsters had split them up according to their groupings when they had entered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian and Phoenix exchanged glances before checking their surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The valley did not appear to be part of some wilderness area. However, it was already close to night time. Looking into the distance, they saw some lights coming from the foot of a hill. It was a small town. Judging by the distance and the constitution of Awakened ones, they will need no more than tens of minutes to reach the town.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However… … Chen Xiaolian wondered where the two old monsters had teleported the others to.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Especially… Tian Lie.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When Tian Lie mentioned Shen’s name, Chen Xiaolian understood why Tian Lie would appear there.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He must have found out about Shen’s disappearance. In fact, it was also possible… he knew that Shen was trapped within Zero City.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The two old monsters must have an inescapable connection with Shen. As for Tian Lie’s appearance, he must have been entrusted by Shen to go there to seek aid.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Just now, everyone was teleported out separately right after Tian Lie stepped out from the door. Chen Xiaolian did not have the chance to ask Tian Lie anything. However…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even if Chen Xiaolian could, then what?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Having reached the line of thought, Chen Xiaolian was unable to stop himself from letting out a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Advise him against it?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie and Shen were friends. They were already acquainted even before Tian Lie and Chen Xiaolian met each other.&nbsp;What reason could he give to advise Tian Lie not to bother with Shen’s matter?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Stop him?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Back in the Tokyo instance dungeon, Chen Xiaolian had experienced Tian Lie’s terrifying power in person.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>So many people had to come together to barely succeed in killing Tian Lie. They had lost Nicole while the rest were seriously injured.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A long time had passed since then and Chen Xiaolian’s strength had improved considerably. Even so, the power he received from Skyblade was, in the end, not really his.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was an insurmountable gap between ‘infinitely close to [S] class’ and ‘genuine [S] class’.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie’s strength was at [S] class, a genuine [S] class.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Furthermore, even if he could defeat Tian Lie, what then?</span></p>
