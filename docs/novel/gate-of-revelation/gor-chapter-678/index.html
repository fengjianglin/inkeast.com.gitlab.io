 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Qiao Qiao and Chen Xiaolian stood side by side. They stood before Bluesea and bowed their heads.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Before his death, Mr Bluesea had said, he hates having others cry in front of him.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mm, I know. He told me that before, back in Zero City.” Qiao Qiao’s tone was very soft.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Come, help me set up a grave for him,” said Chen Xiaolian with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Set up what grave?” Sister Yun was behind them, her hands wrapped around her legs as she sat down with head raised upward. It was unknown what was in her mind. When she heard Chen Xiaolian’s words, she uttered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“During your time, don’t you need to bury your dead?” Chen Xiaolian turned around to look at Sister Yun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“We do. However, do not forget. This is the Yellow Springs.” Sister Yun scoffed. “When the refresh process is restarted, he will be cleared away.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian shook his head and chose not to argue with her about it. Crouching down alongside Qiao Qiao, he used the yellow sand to cover Bluesea.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What will you do next?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian turned to look at Sister Yun. “You said it yourself, this place will be manually refreshed in the end. Could you really be planning on staying here to await your own death?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun turned to face Chen Xiaolian. “You have yet to explain to me why Bai Qi would appear here.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“He is now… … my War Soul.” Chen Xiaolian then briefly recounted his experience within the Mausoleum of Qin Shihuang instance dungeon and the following incidents relating to Bai Qi out for Sister Yun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Why didn't you tell me that before?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“In World’s End, I have no way of summoning him out. Based on my words alone, would you have believed me?” Chen Xiaolian spread his hands.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After considering it for a moment, Sister Yun nodded. “Fine. It is true, before seeing him, I would not have believed your story.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“This matter is also something that I wanted to ask you.” Chen Xiaolian sighed and continued, “Bai Qi had left World’s End using the Lifehymn Music Score, this issue he is facing, will it befall Qiao Qiao?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I don’t know.” Sister Yun shook her head frankly, giving a definitive answer. “That is not my item. I have never used it before, how could I know its functions? Back then, Shen had not told me much.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“At the very least, I should not have any issues.” Chen Xiaolian thought about it. “Shen is still doing all right. I have even encountered him a few times. So… … for the users who have written their names onto the music score, they should be returning as normal.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If you want to use it to bring others back, what method needs to be used?” After pondering for a moment, Sister Yun asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“When the time comes, just make physical contact. It is very simple,” said Chen Xiaolian. “However, the number is limited. It cannot exceed the number of vacant slots on the Lifehymn Music Score. Including me, there can be only a maximum of three people.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What will happen otherwise?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I do not know. But if I have to guess… … perhaps, it simply will not work. When the time is over, everyone could only stay here and there will be no more chance to return.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“All right.” Sister Yun nodded and she entered a contemplative state.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After a long time, she slowly spoke up, “As I have speculated before, the Lifehymn Music Score and my Guiding Link Fire are innately different.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The Guiding Link Fire is the result of some minute fragment that I stripped out from the Oddity. Despite how small it is, it is still a part of the system itself. Thus, it is capable of utilizing some of the system’s functions. Another way of putting it would be, it is ‘legal’.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“As for the Lifehymn Music Score… … regardless of who created it, or how it is the result of upgrading the basic foundation of a prop of the system, I believe it has no relationship with the Oddity. Due to that, for the system, it is ‘illegal’.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“After upgrading its original function, the Lifehymn Music Score can bypass the system to a certain degree. However, it can only bypass it. While the system may not be able to catch it, the system can still restrict it.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Then, do you have any methods of dealing with it?” Chen Xiaolian knitted his brows. “This is the most important part. If Qiao Qiao leaves here only to be thrown into an instance dungeon, where do I go to find her? Besides… … Bai Qi is now in such a messy state. Even now, I have no idea how I should go about restoring him to normal. I do not want Qiao Qiao to become like that.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“About that, you do not have to worry.” Sister Yun shook her head. “If I am not mistaken, she will not be triggering the system’s restrictions.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That… … what does that mean?” Chen Xiaolian did not understand Sister Yun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You can consider World’s End as a warehouse for discarded goods.” Sister Yun considered before saying, “Be it Irregularities or Awakened ones, after dying, they will all be tossed in this warehouse. After a while, they too, will be cleared off. At present, however, the system does not realize that Irregularities exist in here. Thus, all the Irregularities could stay here forever.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That I understand.” Chen Xiaolian nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The warehouse has a restoration passageway. It is for the sake of satisfying certain conditions and the need to resurrect certain target objectives. Be it the one from Lifehymn Music Score or the Guiding Link Fire, all of them will have to use this restoration passageway.” Sister Yun then continued, “In Bai Qi’s case, before dying, he did not write his name down on the Lifehymn Music Score. Thus, it will be illegal for him to go out using the restoration passageway.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Imagine there is a guard for the passageway entrance. The guard will mechanically carry out his orders, to check whether those leaving this place have the clearance to do so. Yes, they will be allowed to leave. No, they will be stopped.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The function of Guiding Link Fire is to give the one it wants to bring out an exit permit, even though that person has already entered this warehouse. The Lifehymn Music Score’s exit permit on the other hand, could only be given before the target enters this warehouse. It cannot give someone who is already inside this warehouse that exit permit. Thus, in order to bring someone who is already inside this warehouse out, there is a need to put on a disguise to trick the guard. For example… … putting the person into a box. Disguise the person as cargo and use someone with the exit permit to bring it out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The size of the box is set. People, however… … are not the same. You can consider the varying power levels of everyone within this warehouse as the equivalent for their sizes. Some are small and could easily fit inside the box. Some who are too powerful, are far too big for the box. If so… … for those who are too powerful and cannot fit inside the box, what needs to be done?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian hesitated for a moment before slowly replying, “If you absolutely have to bring it out… … cut it?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Correct.” Sister Yun nodded her head, expressing her satisfaction at Chen Xiaolian’s understanding. “If you absolutely have to put a giant into a little box and trick the guard, you can only cut out the other parts, leaving only the heart and brain, the core parts. The more powerful the person is, the more parts need to be cut off. That is necessary in order to ensure that the person could be successfully placed inside the box.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I think I more or less understand what you are saying.” Chen Xiaolian nodded his head. Sister Yun’s analogy was quite easy to understand. “In other words, Bai Qi was too strong. Thus, after leaving, he ended up in this state?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes.” Sister Yun nodded her head. “Be it me or Bai Qi, both of us are far too large to fit inside the box. Thus, the Lifehymn Music Score will definitely proceed to cut us so as to make us fit inside the box. As for Qiao Qiao… … I believe she has yet to reach that level.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“This level… … what exactly is it? Do you know?” Chen Xiaolian asked gingerly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I am just guessing,” Sister Yun replied frankly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Fine…” Chen Xiaolian replied with a wry smile. “In other words, you do not know if I can safely bring Qiao Qiao back with me?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I do not care whether you are willing to make that bet or not. If you are afraid, you can choose to let her stay here.” There was an indifferent look on Sister Yun’s face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Is there even a need to choose?” Chen Xiaolian gave a chuckle. “Why do you think I went to all this trouble of entering World’s End?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He reached out his hand to grab Qiao Qiao’s hand. “We will go back together. Even if she does end up like Bai Qi, I will do everything I can to restore her.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“All right.” Sister Yun nodded. “Next, I will tell you how to find us.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Wait…” Chen Xiaolian was stunned. “Find us?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Is there something wrong?” Sister Yun gave Chen Xiaolian a calm look.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Of course.” Chen Xiaolian revealed a rueful smile. “Firstly, didn’t you say Qiao Qiao will not be thrown into an instance dungeon like Bai Qi? Secondly, back then, you didn’t say you want to come with me, did you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“When did I say Qiao Qiao will not be tossed into an instance dungeon?” The first sentence coming out of Sister Yun’s mouth caused Chen Xiaolian’s heart to fall into ice. “Losing awareness of oneself and getting thrown into an instance dungeon are two completely different matters.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You… … go on.” Chen Xiaolian sighed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“In order to ensure successful loading of a target into the box, people who are too powerful will be cut, leaving only their core parts behind. As Qiao Qiao’s strength is insufficient, she can enter as she is. However, regardless of whether or not she is cut, the thing to leave through the restoration passageway is a box, a box containing her. Since she has been placed inside a box, the label on the box will not be ‘human’. Rather, it is ‘cargo’.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Cargo possessing power but no human identity. Naturally, the system’s default method of processing such matters is to just throw it into an instance dungeon. The only difference is that, after entering the instance dungeon, Qiao Qiao will continue to be self-aware. As for Bai Qi and me… we cannot.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… … …” Chen Xiaolian and Qiao Qiao exchanged glances. Both released faint sighs.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, the two of them were not too frustrated.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Because Sister Yun had mentioned something earlier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“How to find us.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“After I leave this place, where should I go to find you two?” Chen Xiaolian quickly asked this critical question.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Every instance dungeon has their own corresponding serial number. Follow the number and you can find the name, location and even the starting time of the instance dungeon. As ‘cargo’, I can make the Lifehymn Music Score display out that information.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Something like that, you… … how will you do it?” Chen Xiaolian was amazed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Don’t forget…” Sister Yun gave Chen Xiaolian a glance. “I am among the few who had gotten in contact with the most important rules of the system. Something as minor as this, how can I not be capable of doing that?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Fine…” Chen Xiaolian rubbed his forehead helplessly. Every time he looked at the young and beautiful face, he would naturally forget the fact that she was an ancient monster.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Are there any other questions?” Sister Yun gave Chen Xiaolian another glance.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes.” Chen Xiaolian nodded his head. “Why did Bai Qi appear? Why did he end up fighting you? In World’s End, personal system cannot be accessed. There is no way I could have summoned him out.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It is probably because… … he sensed the power on me.” Sister Yun sighed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Sensed?” Chen Xiaolian did not understand. “But we have already met each other before! If that is the reason, why didn’t he appear sooner?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That fellow…” Sister Yun cast a cold gaze at Chen Xiaolian. Although Chen Xiaolian knew that her gaze was not actually directed at him, he could still feel a chilling sensation moving toward him. “Before leaving, he left a portion of his power on me.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What?” Chen Xiaolian was shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Due to the existence of his power, my power became suppressed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Back then, he had remained unconscious within your body. Due to the absence of your personal system, you were incapable of summoning him out while he too, could not sense what is outside. Later however, I went to destroy the restrictive barrier that he left behind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It was probably that incident, which caused the power he left on me to somehow resonate with him. He could sense the power he left on me. Thus, he came out to reclaim it.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“However, Bai Qi… … why did he do that?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I do not know. In fact, back then, I didn’t even know about this. You should know, I have not fought anyone in a long time.” Sister Yun gave a harrumph and a trace of arrogance flashed across her face. “Even though a portion of my power was suppressed, with Bai Qi’s departure, who in World’s End could be a match for me? For me, killing someone with 10 moves or one move, will it make a difference?”</span></p>
