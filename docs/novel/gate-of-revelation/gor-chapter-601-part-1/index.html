 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Assuming the masters here could casually create an [S] class powerhouse from thin air… … how strong would that person be?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian was thoroughly shocked. However, a spark of thought flashed through his mind. Something had seemingly flickered within his mind. Unfortunately, the thought was fleeting and disappeared before he could fully grasp it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even so, Chen Xiaolian could instinctively sense something wrong here.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Something is definitely not right here!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Such a powerful existence cannot possibly exist!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Otherwise, the balance of the game would be turned upside down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Avenging Angel stood before Chen Xiaolian. Reaching out with his hand, he gripped Chen Xiaolian by the throat and hoisted him up. Next, the Avenging Angel sent a punch toward Chen Xiaolian’s abdomen area.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The punch elicited several intense coughs from Chen Xiaolian. Next, the Avenging Angel tossed him onto the ground. Chen Xiaolian, who had been discarded upon the ground, did not even have the strength to get up. He could only kneel there as he puked. The intense pain rocking his abdomen area was incredibly severe.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Have you fallen into despair? Knowing that your opponent is too strong, knowing that no matter how you fight, even if you exert all the strength you have, you will not be able to win. Have you fallen into despair? Is that why you are lying on the ground, unwilling to get up?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The voice from the sky spoke up once more, carrying with it a boundless amount of ridicule.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“He he… …” Chen Xiaolian snickered in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mm?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Ha ha ha!” Chen Xiaolian raised his head. However, he did not raise his head to look at the Avenging Angel before him. Rather, he raised his head up to look coldly at the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Avenging Angel, who had raised his sword once more, suddenly lowered the sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What are you laughing at?” asked the voice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Have you been reading too much Japanese manga?” Chen Xiaolian sneered and continued, “Those two-dimensional words from big BOSSES, where did you learn that from?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You have quite the mouth.” The voice sneered. “Since that is the case, just go die.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Oh? You want to kill me?” Surprisingly, there was no sign of fear on Chen Xiaolian’s face at all. “I am eagerly awaiting that moment.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You… what did you say?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Am I wrong?” Chen Xiaolian laughed out. “Kill? Go ahead. I am curious as to when you will do so.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As he spoke, Chen Xiaolian straightened his body. “I kept getting the feeling that there is something wrong. Only now did I realize it.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian then pointed up at the sky. “You, cannot kill me! Oh, that is not right. I mean, you simply cannot kill any participants! Am I right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… … …” The voice grew silent for a moment. Next, it scoffed and said, “Nonsense, I had nearly killed you in the third stage. You had nearly died to Phoenix. If not for the fact that you possess the Lifehymn Music Score, you would have died by my hands.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No, the one who nearly killed me was not you, it was Phoenix.” Chen Xiaolian shouted loudly. “Trying to play god? How much longer to you plan on putting up this charade before me? Humph!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… … you…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian cast a dismissive look at the Avenging Angel before him before pointing a finger at him. “He cannot kill me because he is your creation. He was created from thin air. If I have to guess, you had utilized a certain method to occupy this instance dungeon, turning this place into your domain. Thus, inside this place, you are infinitely powerful! Any participant who enters this instance dungeon, no matter how powerful they may be, they will be unable to fight you. Because in here, you are the equivalent of the system.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“How could the participants go against the instance dungeon? The rules within this place is under your control. Thus, no matter what they do, they will be unable to fight against you.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“And yet… … although you are as powerful as the system, you also have a fatal weakness.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“And that weakness is… … the system does not have the authority to kill of any game participants!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Thus, within this place, you, an existence similar to the system, cannot directly kill me or any other game participant!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If you want to kill someone, you will need to utilize some other methods. For example, the three stages earlier. You were simply trying to be mysterious! You had pushed the level of difficulty in the first two stages to such a high level, making it so hard to clear. However, even if we did nothing there, we would not have died in the first two stages because the rules forbid it!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The third stage is where you really had the chance to kill me. You managed to control one of my companions. Utilizing her hand, you thus gained the ability to kill me!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Let me guess. You do not have the authority to kill any one of the participants in this instance dungeon because you are just a counterfeit system-like existence!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After a lengthy period of silence…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“How did you find out?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I should have figure it out long ago.” Chen Xiaolian sighed. “A pity, I had only figured this out just now.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Oh?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You are too strong. So much so that I can hardly fight back… … I already possess the ability to unleash short bursts of [S] class power, but your strength is such that I do not even know what to make of it… I had encountered such a powerful existence once before. However, that was under special circumstances.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“From a theoretical point of view, existences as powerful as you fellows are an impossibility – it is a violation of the game balance.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Most importantly, just now, you had created an [S] class powerhouse from thin air.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That power… … made me thought of an issue.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What issue?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“We have entered this instance dungeon for a long time now. You, you are so powerful. Logically, given how powerful you are, if you wanted to kill us, you could have taken action much earlier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“My group had been split up for a long time now. I do not know what happened to the others but my team had encountered quite a bit. There were the snow-capped mountains, the forest, various monsters… … if you wanted to kill us, not suffering from a single loss of life at this juncture would have been an impossibility.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“From the beginning until now, we had not experienced any real life and death situations – the only time I nearly died was when you made use of Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Thus… … I figured it out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Since you are so powerful, why didn’t you kill us along the way?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The only explanation here is, either you never wanted to kill us or you simply cannot kill us!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Avenging Angel sent Chen Xiaolian flying with a kick.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His body skidded across the airport runway and smashed into the terminal building.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The tempered glass of the building was smashed apart. Chen Xiaolian, who lay amid a pile of damaged waiting chairs, coughed out blood. Despite that, his face revealed no fear. Instead, he laughed loudly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! It is so funny I am going to die from laughter!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Another voice suddenly spoke up from the sky. This voice sounded deeper. However, it sounded as though it was struggling to breathe due to excessive laughter.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
