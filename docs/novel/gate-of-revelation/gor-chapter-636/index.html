 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 636 Wait Here </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Is this the town? How many people are there?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast, who was looking at the town from afar, asked Duan Gang and Jaina behind him without looking back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“For fear of alerting them, I could only observe them from the outskirts.” Duan Gang bowed toward Sebast before replying, “There are roughly a hundred of them. There is no way to get a more accurate number.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Not too many.” Sebast nodded. “If that is the case, let’s do this quickly. Clear this up quickly and you two can go report this earlier.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes. Thank you for your help, Mr Sebast.” Both Jaina and Duan Gang nodded courteously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mm… … although there are not too many of them, the area is fairly big. It will… … take quite some time.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even as he spoke, Sebast had already stretched out his hand. The nail on his right hand’s index finger rapidly grew out to form a sharp blade. Next, he used it to gently cut a line across his left palm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Dark red blood flowed out from the wound and dropped onto the ground. However, after falling onto the dry ground, the droplets of blood were not instantly absorbed. Instead, the blood droplets wriggled like a snake and moved toward the little town.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The blood droplets moved forward, leaving a dark red trail behind them. It did not matter how far they went, the volume of the flowing blood droplets did not decrease at all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The blood droplets flowed quickly. When they reached the little town, they spread apart. It appeared as though they were leaving a certain pattern on the ground with the colour of blood. They kept flowing forward until they disappeared from view.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As the blood droplets flowed, Sebast had his eyes partially closed, neither saying a word nor moving.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Yang Lin, who was inside his own residence, was carefully wiping the disassembled parts of an assault rifle placed on the table before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Beside the light machine gun’s parts were three other firearms of varying length. A partially filled box of ammunition rested beside the firearms.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Daniel and Grace sat opposite Yang Lin. They too, were holding onto firearms.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yang Lin…” Daniel broke the silence. “Do you think… … what Bluesea said will really happen?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I trust him.” Yang Lin continued wiping the parts. Then, he began assembling them. Without turning his head to face Daniel, he spoke, “Back in Manhattan, you two have seen those fellows as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“But… … this world is very big after all. We… … they may not be able to find us… …” There was a highly contorted look on Grace’s face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Yang Lin raised his head to look at her. “And if they do find us? Do you plan on getting caught off guard and be killed like a chicken?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Even if we did prepare… … then what?” Grace suddenly stood up and slammed the assault rifle in her hands down on the table. “Look at this! Look at this and recall the monster we encountered! If they really appear again, do you really think we can resist them using these things?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Whether we can or not is one thing. Whether we choose to do it or not is another.” Yang Lin looked at Grace. “There is the good old saying, better to die a glorious death than live in dishonour.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Grace’s face grew flushed for a moment. Then, she stared at Yang Lin. “What if I am unwilling to die a glorious death?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I fear… … it is not up to you,” Yang Lin said coolly. “Before leaving, Bluesea had informed me that the Irregularities want to restore the refresh function of this World’s End to ensure their survival. What bargaining chip do you have to offer them? Besides… … even if we manage to avoid getting killed by them; should the World’s End regain its refresh function, we will still die.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You mean to say… … no matter what, we will die anyway?” Grace stared at Yang Lin. “If so, what is the point in you making all these preparations?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If I remember correctly, Grace, you are a Swiss, right?” Yang Lin looked at Grace before shrugging. “In the last World War, your country hypocritically declared itself neutral while secretly making deals with the Nazis. As its citizen, you probably don’t understand the word integrity.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You…” Grace’s face turned furious. Just as she was about to retort, Yang Lin furrowed his brows and turned to look at the wall. At the same time, he raised up his hand, making a silencing gesture. “Stop talking!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The scent of blood had reached Yang Lin’s nose.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tracing the scent of blood Yang Lin’s gaze then fell upon a line of blood that was quickly making its way through the surface of the wooden floor.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was a small hole between the two wooden planks serving as the flooring. The line of blood moved in a straight line, going through that small hole and out through the other side.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That… … what is that?” Daniel stood up, a look of alarm on his face. He raised the rifle in his hand and aimed it at the line of blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Let’s go out and have a look.” Without showing any hesitation, Yang Lin picked up his light machine gun and moved toward the door. Pushing open the door, he walked out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The line of blood had indeed moved out of the house, drawing a straight line through the lawn before moving into the house across the street.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“They are finally here.” There was no emotion on Yang Lin’s face as he cocked his rifle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Then… … what should we do? Run?” Grace panicked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Can we?” Yang Lin gave Grace a look of indifference.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It is done.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast slowly opened his eyes. Then, he raised his left hand, its palm directed toward the little town standing before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The cut on the palm had long since stopped bleeding. However, after Sebast raised his hand, a gleaming light the colour of blood shone faintly from the wound on his palm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The moment the blood coloured light shone from his palm, the pattern drawn out by the droplets of blood earlier followed suit and shone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A bird’s eye view revealed that the pattern left by the blood droplets had formed a large hexagram spell array, which enveloped the whole town.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast’s group was standing on one of the hexagram’s corner.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Move out. From this moment on, not a single person from this town could take even a step out.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast turned to reveal a bright smile on his face as he took the first step forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Both Duan Gang and Jaina revealed looks of joy. Duan Gang retrieved a short stick from his chest. With a flick of his hand, two blades of light shot out from both ends of the short stick.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As for Jaina, she summoned her flying skateboard from her storage equipment and jumped on it. At the same time, she also retrieved a rocket launcher.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Storage equipment, flying skateboard… … you picked up some pretty good items in this refresh cycle. Your luck is pretty good.” Sebast gave Jaina a glance and smiled. “However, be careful where you fly. Don’t bump into the edge. The spell array… … cannot differentiate between friend and foe.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Having said that, Sebast made a grasping motion as he retrieved a thick alloy shield from his own storage equipment. Next, he hurled it toward the edge of the spell array.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When the alloy shield reached the area above the line of blood, a curtain of light suddenly shimmered out from the line of blood. The alloy shield struck the curtain of light and was immediately wrapped in purple coloured electrical current.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In a flash, the shield was liquefied into a pile of molten iron and it fell onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes… … I will definitely be careful!” Looking at the pile of molten iron, Jaina felt a chill moving down her spine. She hastily nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Then, move out! Go clear the Awakened ones inside this instance dungeon!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A grenade warhead descended from the sky to strike one of the residential buildings, blowing up the wooden house as a result. After that, what remained of the house burned violently.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A man who was engulfed in flames screamed as he ran out from the house. However, he was greeted by an attack from a blade of light.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Duan Gang grinned as he looked down at the body that was cut in half. Due to the intense temperature of his weapon, the cut areas on the corpse had already carbonized. No blood flowed out from the corpse.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Done, next one.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast did not attack. He had both hands clasped behind him as he slowly moved forward. He wore a monocle on his left eye. Dots of light could be seen on the surface of the monocle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Up in the sky, Jaina, who was flying through the sky with her flying skateboard, aimed at the house that Sebast had pointed out with the rocket launcher. Duan Gang rushed forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Once again, the warhead struck the house. This time, no one rushed out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Next,” said Sebast. One of the dots on the monocle had disappeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>By then, the residents staying within the little town’s houses had begun rushing out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The sounds from the two prior explosions had reached everyone’s ears.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Forget it, just shoot randomly.” Seeing the dots on the monocle moving in a chaotic manner, Sebast waved toward Jaina. “Let them run.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes, Mr Sebast.” Jaina nodded. Then, raising the rocket launcher in her hands, she aimed at a spot with the highest count of Awakened ones. Next, she pulled the trigger again and again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The sounds of explosions erupted one after another and the town was immediately transformed into a sea of flames.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Looking from above, the Awakened ones were like a swarm of provoked ants. They scattered about madly as they ran for it even as the explosions and flames devoured them. Despite seeing that, Jaina showed no trace of concern on her face. She continued to aim calmly and fired, again and again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This was just a simple clearing duty. There was no need to mix personal feelings into it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Back in the outside world, Irregularities were a special existence. Be it the Development Team, Players, or other Awakened ones, Irregularities had to hide their identity from them all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After coming into World’s End and staying here for a long time, the Irregularities saw the Awakened ones, who no longer possess their abilities and memories, as nothing more than ants.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Irregularities would not even go kill them; they would just ignore them. After a certain time period, when the next refresh cycle came, the batch of Awakened ones will be cleared off.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Naturally, this time, things had taken an abnormal turn.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Awakened ones were quick to discover that the woman on the flying skateboard was the culprit behind the explosions. Panicking, they than dispersed in all directions as they ran away from the town.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Jaina began shooting the warheads with the intent to drive the Awakened ones to the edge of the little town.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Soon, someone had made it to the edge of the hexagram spell array, the first victim.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The curtain of light shimmered out and electrical current flashed. The Awakened one was caught off guard and was immediately turned into charcoal. It happened so fast, he did not even manage to issue out a scream.</span></p>
