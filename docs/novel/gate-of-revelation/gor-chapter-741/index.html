 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 741 Command </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Slowly, Chen Xiaolian opened his eyes. The first thought to come to mind was – <em>I am still alive?</em></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He hastily got up. Lowering his head, he looked down at his own body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Neither his arms nor legs were missing. Even the Sword in the Stone was still in his grip.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Beneath him was a stretch of cushy green-coloured grass surrounded by endless sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>I… I have returned to Room Zero?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian slowly got up, his heart still in a state of shock.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Duwei was clear about it. The price he needed to pay in order to use the Oddity to activate the refresh process was his life.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, he was still alive.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Everything just now… … was that just a dream?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Throw away your uncertainties. This is not a dream.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Duwei’s voice spoke up from behind him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian jerked his head backwards to see Duwei standing behind him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, his face was ugly to behold.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Back then, when Bai Qi had appeared, Duwei had only revealed a slight look of irritation. At present, however, the calm smile on his face had utterly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The refresh process… … failed?” Chen Xiaolian asked with a frown.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No.” Duwei considered for a moment before slowly shaking his head. “However, it was not a complete success. At the last moment, the Development Team noticed the refresh process and forcibly stopped it. Your life was saved as a result.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What about the people from Zero City? What about them?” Chen Xiaolian interrupted Duwei.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Almost everything has been restored to its former state. The slaughter that Bai Qi caused has been erased from the timeline. All those people have returned. Additionally, they do not remember what happened earlier. For them, they are presently at the time when the system had just stopped,” Duwei slowly explained. “As for Bai Qi, he should have returned to being your War Soul now.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian checked his personal system and saw that Bai Qi had returned back there. He was displayed there as a War Soul. “He… … what will happen to him in the future?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“As long as you do not release him out here, it will be fine.” Duwei’s answer eased Chen Xiaolian’s worried heart. “Room Zero is the most unique place for Zero City. If we are to consider the Longevity Palace as the power source for Zero City, then this place is the bridge. Bai Qi had never obtained authority over Zero City. However, because we left a seat for him, he was able to temporarily escape the constraints of the system. That was how he recovered his cognitive abilities and unseal his power. Mm… … part of it, anyways. I believe you will not make the stupid decision of releasing him out here again.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian thought about it. “I get it. If everything here is all right, what is the problem?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The command.” Duwei released a heavy sigh. “The command you gave to open up all the exit passageways. That was not refreshed back to its former state. I believe the Development Team must have noticed that Zero City’s main gate was open the moment you opened it. They will disregard everything in order to destroy Zero City.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Then, right now …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Right now, I believe the Electronic Guardians have begun gathering up. Also, that man…” There was a peculiar expression on Duwei’s face. It looked as though he was smiling. And yet, it resembled a hopeless expression. “He will not let this opportunity slip past his hands.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Shen?” Chen Xiaolian nodded his head. “I recall the conversation between you and Bai Qi. When your group chose to give up Zero City, every one of you wanted to take the Oddity for themselves. However, none of you possessed the ability to do so. As such, you all had to leave it within Zero City. But now…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You guessed it.” Duwei slowly nodded his head. “He already… … possesses the ability to take the Oddity for himself.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What will happen if he obtains the Oddity?” asked Chen Xiaolian with a frown.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I cannot be certain.” Duwei shook his head. “However, one thing is certain. What he wants is not what we want. Our ultimate pursuit is to simply escape the shackles of the system, but he…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Duwei considered his words for a moment. “Him and us. We are not the same… … kind.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I understand.” Chen Xiaolian nodded his head. “Be it Irregularities or Awakened ones, all of us belong to this world. We simply want to stop being slaves to the system. However, I do not get it. As a Player, what is it that he wants?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Duwei turned to look at Chen Xiaolian. After some time, he abruptly smiled. “No, he is not a Player.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What do you mean?” Chen Xiaolian stared with widened eyes. He could feel his scalp going numb.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen was the Guild Leader of Thorned Flower Guild. That was something known to everyone within the Awakened circle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>How can the Guild Leader of a Player guild not be a Player?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Rather… … if he was not a Player, then… … what was he?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Back then, he was a member of our group. If he was a Player, how could we have come together to build Zero City?” Duwei chuckled. “At that time, we all thought that he was an Irregularity as well. As for him, his performance was similar to that of an Irregularity. For example… … every time he killed either a Player or an Awakened, a metal sphere would drop out. His performance is very good, so much so that none of us back then realized that he was different.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If so… … just what is he?” Chen Xiaolian clenched his fists.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“He is… … GM,” Duwei looked Chen Xiaolian right in the eye and whispered out. “The first ever, different from all the other GMs to follow.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Different?” Chen Xiaolian knitted his brows. “What does that mean?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I don’t mind telling you that. However, do you have the time to be listening to me?” Duwei shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Damn!” Chen Xiaolian slapped his thighs as he recalled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Thanks to the Development Team stopping the refresh process earlier, he had survived. However, the command he gave to open up the main gate remained. Additionally, it was an irrevocable command.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“There is no longer any way to stop the incoming invasion.” Duwei smiled wryly. “If I am not mistaken, the system have already issued out a quest to organize all the Players to attack Zero City. As for Shen… … he is on his way here for the invasion. It would appear that all the things we did earlier was useless.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No… they weren’t useless.” Chen Xiaolian gritted his teeth. “At the very least, they have been revived! As long as they are still alive, there will be hope! They just need to escape from Zero City before the invaders arrive.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Do you really think they will listen to you?” Duwei raised his brows. “Throughout the years, those guilds residing within Zero City had gained a great deal of benefits from the city. And now, you want them to give it up with your words alone? Do you think you have that kind of reputation?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian fell silent.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Additionally, you must not retain the memories of what happened earlier.” Duwei’s words caused Chen Xiaolian’s body to shudder.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Why?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Because… … you must not let Shen figure out that you have obtained authority over Zero City. Once he finds out about that, he will attempt to obtain it through you. If Shen wants to capture you, he will be able to do so. Unless he considers you as someone insignificant.” There was a serious expression on Duwei’s face. “And the best way to stop someone from leaking out a secret will be to have that person forget about that secret.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Why does he need to obtain the authority through me?” Chen Xiaolian became confused. “He is one of Zero City’s founders. He should already have authority over it!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“His authority was removed. His seat remained, though.” Duwei turned around to look at the stone slab behind him. “How else could he be incapable of entering Zero City all these years?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing Chen Xiaolian’s desire to ask more questions, Duwei shook his head. “If you truly want to save those people within Zero City again, you should not continue chatting with me here.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“One last thing.” Chen Xiaolian clenched his teeth heavily. “Earlier, you mentioned that an ordinary death will allow me to meet other dead Irregularities, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes.” Duwei nodded his head. “However, surely, you don’t plan on just buying a one-way ticket?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“So, if I want to bring someone back, what do I have to do?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Duwei smiled. “Even if I do tell you about it, will you be able to remember?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He then continued, “Don’t worry. If you can truly escape from Zero City, I will have someone you trust go tell you what to do.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Who?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mr San.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“All right.” Chen Xiaolian nodded his head. “How do I remove my memories?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Zero City will help you with that. You only need to give him the command.” Duwei shut his eyes for a moment. Then, he opened his eyes and said, “I assure you, when we meet once again, I will tell you everything you want to know.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Everything?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Everything.” Duwei nodded. “Now, command Zero City to delete your memories and go try save the people of Zero City. After that… … everything will depend on your luck. If you can escape from Shen, the day will come when we meet once again.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“All right.” Chen Xiaolian sighed. “I hope you are not lying to me. I also hope that you will honour your promise.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Zero City! Delete the portion of my memories starting from when I got my own place until this point in time! Next, send me back to my room! Also…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Do everything you can to stop Shen from obtaining authority over you!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Command accepted. Now executing.”</span></p>
