 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 437 Finish You Off! Right Here!</strong></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian walked out of the hospital, his state of mind an enigma as he got into the car parked beside the street.</p>
 <p>Due to what the system had done, the inside and the outside of the hospital area were two completely different worlds. Chen Xiaolian sat in the car and watched, his brows raised as he looked at the doors of the hospital where doctors, nurses and patients would come and go.</p>
 <p>He then checked the timer in his personal system.</p>
 <p>There were 13 more minutes before the advent of the Fallen Avenger.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian started up the car and drove toward the centre of the city.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Arles Street, a street in the east of Jerusalem. This place was originally close to the residential area of the Palestinians. As it was originally an old town, its streets were narrow and facilities aged and broken down. The standard of healthcare there was poor and the people there a chaotic mess.</p>
 <p>At the end of the U-shaped street was a seemingly dilapidated warehouse. Its walls were worn out, but its fence door was locked.</p>
 <p>Inside the warehouse were members of Thorned Flower Guild. All of them had arrived.</p>
 <p>The muscular two-metre tall man was assigning work for the members.</p>
 <p>“Hurry it up. We will soon be setting off for Tel Aviv! Load up all the quest targets into the vehicles…. split them up as well, one in each vehicle!”</p>
 <p>One of the members approached the muscular man. He lit up a cigarette and puffed before turning to face the muscular man. There was hesitation on his face and he whispered, “I say… not killing them and discarding the advantageous information. This decision…”</p>
 <p>“… … …” The muscular man abruptly turned around. He cast a cold pair of eyes at the man for a few seconds before speaking up with a cold tone, “I will pretend I never heard what you just said… additionally, you would do well never to say things like that in the future, do you understand? In Thorned Flower Guild, the Guild Leader’s orders are absolute!”</p>
 <p>“… … even more so than the system?”</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The muscular man sent his fist flying out, knocking the other man down the ground! As the man spat blood, the muscular man stamped his foot down on the man’s chest and looked down on him with a hawk like pair of eyes. “Yes! It is absolute! Even more so than the system!”</p>
 <p>The man lying on the ground gasped for breath and struggled. Seeing that, the muscular man retracted his leg.</p>
 <p>The muscular man watched as the other fellow struggled to get up from the ground. He sneered. “Are you feeling resentful? You had better realize your own identity! Don’t think that just because you had managed to get past a few instance dungeons, you are some hotshot! You are just a peripheral member of Thorned Flower Guild; you are far from qualified to be questioning the Guild Leader’s decision. You can either obey and execute the given orders or disobey and go die.”</p>
 <p>“… … …” The other fellow instantly shrank back his head and swallowed whatever words he had in mind.</p>
 <p>The muscular man then muttered to himself. He turned around and moved to the side where he continued overseeing the others. As he did so, he continued muttering to himself, “I hate these opinionated rookies. Just because they have lived through a few instance dungeons, they really think they have become veterans.”</p>
 <p>After a pause, he raised his head and shouted loudly, “Hurry it up! Hurry! Don’t dawdle about!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian drove the car into the new city area. As he did so, he also checked the map a few times to find what he was looking for.</p>
 <p>This place was a newly built plaza. Its surroundings were very beautiful; in the middle of the plaza was a large pool that was neither too deep nor too shallow. Stone sculptures were placed around the pool.</p>
 <p>The pool was circular in shape and there were four stone platforms built above the surface of the water, paving the way across the surface of the pond.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian stopped the car outside the plaza and got out of the car. Then, he walked into the plaza.</p>
 <p>After assessing his surroundings, he nodded with satisfaction. Then, he simply moved toward the intersection point of the stone platforms. When he reached the middle point, he stopped.</p>
 <p>The stone platform’s point of intersection rested above the surface of the pond’s water. It was around five to six metres wide. Stone benches were placed on either side for others to rest.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian sat down on the stone benches.</p>
 <p>The plaza was empty, devoid of any figures. Thus, Chen Xiaolian did not hesitate to pull out a packet of cigarettes. After lighting one cigarette, he took a few silent puffs.</p>
 <p>He watched as the cigarette smoke swirled in the air and entered a state of contemplation.</p>
 <p>After one minute had passed, he raised his head and released a wry sigh. “Guild Leader? Interesting…”</p>
 <p>He suddenly got up and started to get busy.</p>
 <p>He pulled out a jar from his Storage Watch. Unscrewing it, he then carefully poured its contents into the pond.</p>
 <p>After the jar was empty, he quickly pulled out a second jar.</p>
 <p>He only gave a frown in response to the pungent scent resulting from his actions.</p>
 <p>After emptying around five to six jars, large tracts of strange reflections could be seen floating on the surface of the pool water.</p>
 <p>Glancing at the pond, Chen Xiaolian was satisfied with the way the poured liquid spread through the pond.</p>
 <p>Next, he pulled out a silver thermo flask.</p>
 <p>This time, Chen Xiaolian practiced even more caution. He stood at the edge of the stone platform, unscrewed the cap and poured the liquid contents of the flask that gave off a faint silvery shine into the pond. At the same time, he stepped forward.</p>
 <p>He moved in a circle around the stone platform. After completing the circle, Chen Xiaolian also poured a portion of the silvery liquid onto the stone platform.</p>
 <p>He poured carefully.</p>
 <p>After having done all those, he put the silver thermo flask away.</p>
 <p>He then pulled out a peculiar looking handgun. Next, he retrieved several magazines. Before him were several boxes that he had pulled out from his Storage Watch. He opened them to reveal that they all contained spirit-force bullets.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian hastily loaded the bullets into the magazines.</p>
 <p>He used less than five minutes and filled up five to six magazines. He pushed one of the magazines into his handgun and kept the others somewhere on his waist.</p>
 <p>He checked the time…</p>
 <p>Only 48 more seconds before the advent of the Fallen Avenger.</p>
 <p>The corners of Chen Xiaolian’s mouth curled into a cold smile and he summoned the Sword in the Stone and pulled out a small bottle of mineral water.</p>
 <p>He unscrewed the bottle to reveal that it contained the same silvery liquid. Next, he carefully and evenly poured the liquid onto the blade of the Sword in the Stone! He did so carefully and attentively.</p>
 <p>He was unwilling to waste even a single drop.</p>
 <p>When he had finally emptied the bottle, he tossed the bottle away and gently brandished the Sword in the Stone in his hand.</p>
 <p>Under the rays of the moonlight, the Sword in the Stone shone with a silvery light.</p>
 <p>A gust of wind blew and a cluster of dark clouds came forth, blocking the moonlight and darkening the night sky.</p>
 <p>“10, 9, 8, 7, 6…” Chen Xiaolian took a deep breath.</p>
 <p>Finally, a swirl of black coloured flames suddenly emerged from the centre of the air somewhere not far away from his location. The flames raged fiercely and a crack appeared amid the flames! A hand clad in steel gauntlet reached out from beyond the crack. The palm of the gauntlet that was mottled with rust clawed the air, as though attempting to grab something and a sharp cry rang out, a cry that would cause a chill to run down anyone’s spine.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s body shuddered.</p>
 <p>“Lancelot, it has been a while! You… … idiot!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Within the Gothic-style building in the city centre, several figures remained before the oval shaped table inside the large conference hall.</p>
 <p>Mene was still at the foremost spot and Gattuso was right beside him.</p>
 <p>Strangely enough, at that very moment, those figures had donned on some very strange looking ‘clothes’.</p>
 <p>Everyone was wearing armour that looked similar to those from the medieval era. A long knightly sword was placed before Mene.</p>
 <p>A warhammer was resting on the floor beside Gattuso’s chair and Gattuso’s eyes were grim as he stared at the table.</p>
 <p>There at the centre of the table was a crystal ball.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a darkness drifted out into the clear surface of the crystal ball. It was as though someone had spilled a drop of black ink onto a basin of clear water; the darkness quickly spread through the surface of the crystal ball.</p>
 <p>The corners of Mene’s eyes twitched.</p>
 <p>Gattuso, on the other hand, jumped up, his face ugly to behold. “Who DARES! Who dares to unleash such dark powers inside this holy city?!”</p>
 <p>Mene looked dissatisfied. He looked at his companions sitting before the table and took a deep breath before getting up.</p>
 <p>“I can feel it. An evil force has appeared in the city. A mighty demon has brazenly appeared in our holy city. This is an act of blasphemy against the Light!”</p>
 <p>Pausing for a moment, Mene shouted, “Evil must be eradicated – by our hands! Only after it has been purified by us will it meet its end.”</p>
 <p>“By our hands!” The several figures before the table, Gattuso included, stood up. They growled in a stern, devout and furious tone.</p>
 <p>“Move out!” Mene grabbed the knightly sword place before him.</p>
 <p>They rushed out from the hall.</p>
 <p>At the same time, several beams of light descended onto the square before the stairs leading into the Gothic-style building.</p>
 <p>After the roaring sounds faded away, the beams of light turned into several silhouettes.</p>
 <p>White fur, powerful body enveloped in a faint white, holy light.</p>
 <p>Several creatures that appeared like white horses appeared in the square. Their silver saddles flashed with light.</p>
 <p>These were no ordinary horses… on each of their forehead, in between their eyes, was a spiral shaped horn.</p>
 <p>Unicorns!</p>
 <p>“Brave warriors of God! Straddle our mounts and go eradicate this evil! Purify the demons with the power of light!”</p>
 <p>Mene led his companions and they got on their mounts. Then, with Mene in the lead, they roared and their unicorn mounts galloped forward.</p>
 <p>The speed of the unicorns was astonishingly fast. Additionally, every stride they took created a strange rhythmical sound and they moved like the wind.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“Roarrr!”</p>
 <p>The Fallen Avenger stood before Chen Xiaolian. The crack amid the black flames behind him disappeared completely and he dragged a large black coloured long sword with his hand.</p>
 <p>Two ghastly flames stared through his helmet, staring at Chen Xiaolian. His body then jerked and he released another sharp roar! It was a wail like roar.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian could practically feel the sound waves striking him in his face. Clearly, the roar carried with it a form of spiritual attack. The Sword in the Stone quickly activated and a warm and holy power flowed through Chen Xiaolian’s body. He then stared back at the Fallen Avenger with a grin. “It seems you still remember me, Lancelot!”</p>
 <p>The Fallen Avenger raised his long sword and strode toward Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>Chi!</p>
 <p>However, he had stepped right onto the silver coloured liquid. Black smoke instantly burst out from his feet.</p>
 <p>The Fallen Avenger staggered and released a painful roar.</p>
 <p>“It hurts a lot, doesn’t it? Even though you are just a spirit entity without a body, it still hurts, doesn’t it? How do you like the holy water?” Chen Xiaolian coldly regarded his opponent. Next, he pulled out a lighter. With a snap, he lit the lighter before tossing it into the pond.</p>
 <p>Woosh!</p>
 <p>The oil floating on the surface of the water was immediately lit on fire. The flames spread out rapidly.</p>
 <p>All the oil on the surface of the pond caught on fire.</p>
 <p>The stone platform in the middle of the raging inferno became like an isolated island within a reservoir.</p>
 <p>“Today, I must finish you off! Right here! Neither of us will escape, Lancelot!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
