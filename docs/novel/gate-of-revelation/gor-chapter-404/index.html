 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 404 I Don’t Know</strong></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian exhaled as his body staggered.</p>
 <p>He could feel an additional presence within his mind. The golden symbols flying about made Chen Xiaolian enter a somewhat dazed state.</p>
 <p>He was unable to understand what those golden symbols meant. However, he could sense something strange about them. Those things appeared connected to him somehow. A very close connection. Furthermore, it appeared to be naturally complementing his consciousness.</p>
 <p>It was as though it was all part of something he knew of.</p>
 <p>This state of partial consciousness continued for an uncertain period of time. When Chen Xiaolian finally regained an iota of his consciousness, he let out a long gasp.</p>
 <p>His mind was in a rather exhausted state, similar to how he would feel after spending a long time reading. He felt like he had just finished reading up a very long masterpiece or some arduous time-consuming mental work.</p>
 <p>Despite the exhausted state, he felt his body firing up in excitement. There was also a faint feeling of satisfaction.</p>
 <p>“You're awake?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian heard Skyblade’s cold voice. The voice contained traces of dissatisfaction and anger.</p>
 <p>“Err…” Chen Xiaolian kneaded his own forehead and glanced at his right hand.</p>
 <p>His fingers were still tightly gripping onto the hilt of the Sword in the Stone.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian exerted force to pull out the sword from the jade wall.</p>
 <p>An obvious crack was left on the jade wall. Observing that the unparalleled jade wall had been reduced to such a state, a peculiar feeling inexplicably emerged from Chen Xiaolian’s heart.</p>
 <p>It seemed as though he had acquired something from the jade wall? The jade wall appeared different compared to earlier.</p>
 <p>It would appear that the lustre of jade had turned somewhat dim.</p>
 <p>Originally, the jade wall was exuding a soft white lustre. But now, the jade wall had turned dim and dull.</p>
 <p>While it remained white, the colour was now hard and cold.</p>
 <p>“Now, tell me what happened.”</p>
 <p>Skyblade’s voice was very cold.</p>
 <p>“What?” Chen Xiaolian frowned.</p>
 <p>Skyblade gave a snort. “I heard a strange sound just now. What did you do to the jade wall?”</p>
 <p>“I…”</p>
 <p>Without waiting for Chen Xiaolian to finish, Skyblade bluntly interrupted, “After hearing that sound, I asked you about it. But, you did not answer me at all. As I am unable to move or see, I could only wait. I had asked you a few times, but you did not answer me at all. If not for the fact that I could hear the sound of your breathing, I would have assumed that you had died. Or, perhaps you had run away by yourself.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian remained silent.</p>
 <p>“Tell me. Just what had happened. What did you do to the jade wall? Also, when you weren’t responding to me just now, what happened to you?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian hesitated – he did not know how he should explain matters to Skyblade.</p>
 <p>Tell Skyblade that he had used his sword to stab the jade wall, causing a crack on it?</p>
 <p>Heaven knows if Skyblade would fly into a fit of rage.</p>
 <p>Additionally… … Chen Xiaolian was still hesitating on something. Even now, Skyblade had yet to understand that he had become a blade.</p>
 <p>If he knew, he would probably go mad, right?</p>
 <p>“Kid, did you really think I have no way of reining you in?”</p>
 <p>The instant Skyblade uttered those words, Chen Xiaolian’s heart turned tense!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian suddenly felt a raging wind blow up before him!</p>
 <p>He subconsciously took a step back while raising the Sword in the Stone in his right hand…</p>
 <p>Clang!</p>
 <p>A sharp beam of light shot forward only to be deflected by Chen Xiaolian’s Sword in the Stone. The act caused Chen Xiaolian’s purlicue to sear and his whole body was thrown back by the powerful force behind the attack!</p>
 <p>He could feel his feet skidding across the floor…</p>
 <p>A cracking sound could be heard as a crack appeared on the floor!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian felt both his hands quaking heavily. When he turned to regard the Sword in the Stone, he saw that the blade was still vibrating from the shock!</p>
 <p>“You?!”</p>
 <p>“Humph!”</p>
 <p>Skyblade sneered.</p>
 <p>Next, several faint silver coloured lights appeared in the middle of the air. The lights appeared around Chen Xiaolian and transformed into sharp blades each. Then, they all shot toward Chen Xiaolian from all directions at a furious rate!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian had no time to say anything. He could only instinctively raise the Sword in the Stone in his hand and give it his all to deflect them! He subconsciously utilized the skill he was most familiar with, the Demon King of Confusion’s War Axes.</p>
 <p>After Chen Xiaolian executed the Demon King of Confusion’s War Axes, sounds of collisions erupted without respite as the blades of light continued to descend upon him one after another. He swung the Sword in the Stone up and down to continuously block off the attacks. However, under the barrage of the numerous blades of light, he fell into a miserable state.</p>
 <p>Skyblade sneered. “Are you still not going to say it? My attacks are only going to get stronger.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian gritted his teeth. “I, what do you want me to say? I don’t even know what…”</p>
 <p>“Hah! Stubborn kid!” Skyblade shouted with pride. “Once again! I’ll just beat you up until you confess!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian widened his eyes when he saw even more blades of light appear in the air around him. After materializing, the blades of light floated up in the air.</p>
 <p>“While I may not kill you, I can still break your hands and feet… furthermore, if I lose my temper, I might fail to hold back and you could end up dying! You had better beg for mercy if you can’t hold on!” Skyblade cackled loudly a few times.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian rapidly narrowed his eyes! He watched as the countless blades shot toward him from all over like a tempest!</p>
 <p>Block!</p>
 <p>Block!</p>
 <p>And block again!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian exerted his all to brandish the Sword in the Stone and struggled to block them. However, as the rate of the incoming blades became more intense, Chen Xiaolian’s circle of defence gradually became smaller and things became even harder.</p>
 <p>After hacking down each blade of light with the Sword in the Stone, even more blades of light appeared.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian could feel that his strength was rapidly declining! Every slash, every collision felt like getting hit by a battering ram!</p>
 <p>The Sword in the Stone’s skill had been activated!</p>
 <p>His physical strength was instantly restored. However, Chen Xiaolian was shocked to find that he could only barely hold on for a while before falling into a weakened state once more. His circle of defence was chipped down to only a few square inches and his rate of breathing gradually became ragged.</p>
 <p>At that moment, he grunted and swore out, “You madman! Just what are you trying to do? I told you, I don’t even know… son of a bitch! I don’t even know what... what happened!”</p>
 <p>In one breath, Chen Xiaolian hacked down three blades of light. However, the fourth grazed past his shoulder, causing blood to splash out. Chen Xiaolian was furious and was about to summon out Bai Qi!</p>
 <p>It was at that moment that something strange occurred.</p>
 <p>Several blades of light descended before Chen Xiaolian. With his exhausted state, he would not be able to block them off. Chen Xiaolian had even made preparations to take the hits.</p>
 <p>It was then that a flash of light fired out from within his mind.</p>
 <p>The Sword in the Stone in his right hand suddenly moved through a bizarre trajectory and turned around. Gently turning up, the tip of the sword made contact with the tip of the blade of light!</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>The sound from this collision was clear and short!</p>
 <p>This sound was very different from the sounds of intense collisions that occurred earlier.</p>
 <p>Also, Chen Xiaolian could intuitively feel something. He could feel power!</p>
 <p>Just now, every time he blocked a blade of light, he would feel as though he had been struck heavily by a battering ram. Having to endure the brunt of the enemy attack made him lose his strength rapidly!</p>
 <p>But this time…</p>
 <p>The blade of his sword appeared to have only lightly tapped the tip of the enemy blade of light!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian did not even feel the resulting aftershock from the collision. If was as though he had poked it using an embroidery needle…</p>
 <p>The blade of light before him suddenly shattered!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s first reaction was:</p>
 <p><em>Did I do that?</em></p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>The Sword in the Stone continued dancing without respite. Additionally, its speed gradually increased! Every twist taken by the blade of the sword was bizarre and elegant.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian appeared to be simply standing there while his right hand held onto the Sword in the Stone, which flew about up and down.</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, wherever the blade of the sword went, specks of light would appear from the surface of the tip of the sword. Every time it stabbed forward, a shining speck of light would be left in the air and it slowly faded away.</p>
 <p>The rate at which Chen Xiaolian stabbed out with the sword became faster, faster, and even faster!</p>
 <p>He himself appeared unaware of it! The intense tempest like blades of light around him no longer appeared to be a wall of chaos in his eyes. He could now clearly make out the gap between each blades of light. At intervals, the tip of his sword would stab out and accurately strike the tip of the blades of light!</p>
 <p>A true collision never happened again!</p>
 <p>Even more blades of light appeared inside the room and they all shot toward Chen Xiaolian one after another.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s sword on the other hand, moved even faster. In the end, it was not possible to even discern the shadow of the blade of the sword! All that could be seen was the numerous specks of light appearing around his body.</p>
 <p>The specks of light increased in number and they finally formed a clump of light!</p>
 <p>They enveloped Chen Xiaolian’s body in a sphere of light!</p>
 <p>No matter how many blades of light there were, they were unable to break through the sphere of light!</p>
 <p>Although Chen Xiaolian’s actions were fast, it would appear that he was becoming more relaxed.</p>
 <p>In the end, something strange seemed to awaken within his mind and he was unable to stop himself from opening his mouth to give out a loud roar!</p>
 <p>His right hand moved in a natural manner and the Sword in the Stone drew a circle in the air before being vigorously thrust into the floor!</p>
 <p>Weng!!!</p>
 <p>The dense number of specks of light that were hovering around Chen Xiaolian’s body that had yet to fade away suddenly lit up in unison all of a sudden! They shone brightly!</p>
 <p>Next, the countless specks of light expanded outward quickly!</p>
 <p>Under the barrage of the specks of light, the blades of light that were floating in the air were pierced and crushed!</p>
 <p>All of these happened in a split second. When the specks of light scattered outward, the entire room became engulfed in intense light.</p>
 <p>In just an instant, the innumerable blades of light inside the room were crushed by the wave of light.</p>
 <p>Seeing the countless blades of light fading away, Chen Xiaolian’s eyes became wide open as he stared…</p>
 <p><em>This, did I do all this?</em></p>
 <p><em>Me?</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian took a breath.</p>
 <p>Skyblade too, fell into a state of silence. After a while, he chose not to continue creating the endless blades of light. Instead, he coldly said, “What skill did you use?”</p>
 <p>“I… I don’t know…”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian cast a lost look at the Sword in the Stone in his right hand.</p>
 <p>The Sword in the Stone was still thrust into the floor beneath his feet!</p>
 <p>…</p>
