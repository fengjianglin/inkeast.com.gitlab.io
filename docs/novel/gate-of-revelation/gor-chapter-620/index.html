 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>GOR Chapter 620 Wu Ya’s Secret&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mister… … Mr Wu Ya!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Deiha quickly opened up the hatch and ran out of the Thunderstorm Tank to welcome him. Although Deiha knew that Wu Ya had not suffered from any injuries in the earlier fight, there was no reason not to show concern at a time like this.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, after having taken only a few steps forward, Deiha halted. There was an awkward look on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The man who was walking toward him…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Had nothing on his person, utterly naked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Giving it a little thought, Deiha immediately understood. After abruptly transforming into such a gigantic snake-headed dragon, could the clothes on him not get ripped apart?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Deiha frantically lowered his head, not daring to look at Wu Ya, who was right before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, there was no trace of embarrassment on Wu Ya’s face at all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>With a faint smile on his face, Wu Ya stepped toward Deiha in such a way that it seemed as though he was still well-dressed and had just finished lunch. This demeanour, it was like a noble who was taking a stroll around his own courtyard, enjoying the sunshine.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You did well. The Thunderstorm Tank is not damaged at all. If anything had happened to the tank, I would have a headache to deal with.” After stepping before Deiha, Wu Ya gave him a courteous nod and said with a smile, “Right, I forgot. Your name is…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Deiha. My name is Deiha, Mr Wu Ya.” Receiving such an act of courtesy from Wu Ya overwhelmed Deiha, who hastily replied with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Just now, when they were inside the tank, Wu Ya had shown an impatient and indifferent attitude toward him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After transforming into the snake-headed dragon, it too, spouted the word “insect” as it killed off the Karra beast. Such was his tyrannical attitude.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Now, however, he has suddenly turned so courteous. Not only is he smiling at me, even the words he is using are so polite!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Deiha’s heart thumped uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although they were both members of the coalition, Deiha was well aware of the fact that he himself was just a minor character, a very, very minor character.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Were it not for the urgency of the unexpected situation, those old guys – experts like Wu Ya – would not have had to establish the coalition and recruit members to deal with the refresh problem. As for Deiha, it would have been impossible for someone like him to talk to an Irregularity of Wu Ya’s level like an equal, much less fight alongside him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>And now, Wu Ya was showing such friendliness toward him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Deiha could already see it, the future where he would hug Mr Wu Ya’s thigh. &nbsp; <a href="#footnote_1">[1]</a><a href="#footnote_3"></a></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After each of the cleared instance dungeons entered this World’s End, he would be able to follow Mr Wu Ya and pick whatever equipment he wanted – naturally, that was after Mr Wu Ya had picked what he wanted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Deiha understood that he was very weak.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Back in the outside world, he only had average strength. Additionally, the route he took was in technology and equipment. After entering World’s End, he could no longer access his personal system. Thus, all of his equipment and props could no longer be retrieved. As a result, his comprehensive level of strength fell even further.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was a type of bird known as the trochilus bird. After a crocodile was done eating, it would open its jaws. Then, the trochilus bird would enter the crocodile’s open mouth and feed on the decaying meat between the crocodile’s teeth, cleaning the teeth for the crocodile while filling its own belly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Deiha also knew that, in this World’s End, he could never become a crocodile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At present, however, a big crocodile known as Wu Ya had seemingly taken a liking to him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>If so, he will hug onto this crocodile tightly and become its trochilus bird.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mm. Well then, Mr Deiha, can I trouble you to help me retrieve a set of clothes from the Thunderstorm Tank?” said Wu Ya with a gentle smile. “They are in the storage compartment on the left of the cockpit. Any set will do.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“My Wu Ya, please just call me Deiha! It is my pleasure to serve you!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Ever since he entered this World’s End, this was the first time someone had called Deiha “Mister”. Additionally, the one to do so was an expert like Wu Ya. If not for the fact that there were still matters that needed to be done, he would have gotten on his knees and started crying.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Deiha swiftly rushed into the Thunderstorm Tank. After retrieving a complete set of clothing from the storage compartment, he came out and handed he clothes over to Wu Ya.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Thank you,” said Wu Ya with a smile as he accepted the clothes. Next, he slowly and orderly put the clothes on.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He dressed himself carefully. Beginning with the underwear, next the socks, then the trousers… … as he was putting on the clothes, Deiha stood awkwardly beside him, not knowing where he should look.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was truly an awkward moment for him. After what felt like a decade, Wu Ya was finally done putting his clothes on. Patting his clothes, Wu Ya revealed a satisfied smile at Deiha. “You have had to work hard, Mr Deiha. You see, having a body transformation skill is actually very troublesome. In this World’s End, it is not easy to find clothes to fit my body.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No, no, that…” Deiha waved his hand, not knowing how to express his feelings of humility.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Enough, there is no need for you to be so courteous. Right, since you are the one who asked me to help you with the clearing of this instance dungeon, give me a simple explanation of the situation.” Wu Ya waved his hand, indicating that Deiha should relax. “Judging by your earlier reaction, you must have encountered a Karra beast in this instance dungeon before, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes.” Deiha nodded furiously. “I had seen one before. However, that one was only around several metres tall, far inferior compared to the one from earlier. Besides… … I have never encountered such a monster before this. I didn’t even know its name.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Indeed, the Karra beast is very uncommon.” Wu Ya nodded his head and said, “Also, only a mature Karra beast would possess any significant combat power. Ordinary younglings do not even know how to utilize protective shields. They are actually very easy to deal with. Naturally – it might be a little difficult for someone like you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>A little difficult?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Deiha did not know whether to laugh or cry. If he had not quickly made his getaway, the youngling Karra beast would have long since devoured him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Still, no matter.&nbsp;Karra beasts are territorial creatures. No more than one Karra beast will appear within an area. Since I have already killed off one, there will be no need for us to worry anymore.” Wu Ya gave Deiha’s shoulder a comforting pat, giving him another feeling of terrified reverence. “We should talk about the targets we need to clear. How many of them are there?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes!” Deiha quickly replied. “In the beginning, I encountered a four-man team, comprising of three men and one woman. They appear organized. The four of them did not possess any special abilities, just ordinary Awakened ones who had lost their memories. However, they have guns and ammunition. Also, they appear to have had training in handling guns. That is why… … I was unable to kill them off right there and then.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya nodded. “Continue. What about the Irregularity?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The Irregularity… … seems to be together with the four Awakened ones. I suspect he may be the one we are looking for.” Deiha carefully recalled what happened earlier and continued, “He is not too old, probably somewhere in his teens, a youngster. About his attributes… … I only saw that he was very fast and his melee skill is very strong. However, I do not know the details of his skills. Right, when I was confronting him, a Karra beast had suddenly appeared. He may have… … died.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Four Awakened ones and one Irregularity, is it?” Wu Ya nodded. “No problem. I will handle it properly. From now on, I will be taking on this instance dungeon.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I… I really do not know how to express my feelings of gratitude!” Deiha trembled in excitement. “Then… … what should I do?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You?” Wu Ya smiled. “You do not need to do anything. Just be at ease and stay here.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Really?” Deiha became overjoyed to the point where it showed on his face. “Then… … then, I will wait for your return after you successfully cleaned up those fellows!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No.” Wu Ya raised up one finger before him and waved it left and right. “Mr Deiha, when did I say I will return for you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I… … I don’t understand… …” Deiha smiled as well. However, a slight feeling of foreboding was inexplicably rising from his heart.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It felt as though, something terrible was about to happen.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Right, you must be feeling puzzled, aren’t you? Why would I suddenly become so… mm, polite toward you.” Wu Ya reached out his fingers to pick up a strand of Deiha’s hair and gently stroked it with his fingers. “Mr Deiha, do you want to know why?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I… … I do not know…” Deiha forced out a laugh. His stomach and calves were convulsing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I have never been a good-tempered person.” Wu Ya shrugged and withdrew his hand. “The only exception is toward people who are about to die. I will always be more courteous toward those type of people. After all, this will be your last chance to enjoy something in life. You see, I am actually a very kind-hearted person, no?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Deiha felt as though something heavy had hammered his heart. His eyes were bulging as he stared at Wu Ya, his chin trembling uncontrollably. “Mr Wu Ya, you… … are you joking with me?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I don’t like to joke around.” Wu Ya shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Why?!” Looking at Wu Ya’s expression, Deiha felt himself on the verge of suffocating. With a hoarse tone, he shouted out in despair, “I… … what did I do wrong? Mr Wu Ya!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Wrong? No, you did not do anything wrong. It is just… … mm, just bad luck. It is not easy to kill off a mature Karra beast. So, I had to assume my Jormungandr form.” There was a calm expression on Wu Ya’s face. “Think about it, have you ever heard anyone talk about me transforming for battle?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Deiha’s teeth chattered. He was no longer capable of talking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No, right?” The smile on Wu Ya’s face grew even more remarkable. “The reason for that is very simple, because all who had witnessed that feat are dead.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Wh… … why?!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Deiha could no longer suppress the dread in his heart. He stumbled a few steps backward and leaned against the Thunderstorm Tank behind him as he gasped for breath.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“There is no particular reason. But if you really want one, mm…” Wu Ya tilted his head and considered. “It is probably because I do not like having others see my naked body. All right, I cannot continue wasting time here with you. I still need to go clear this instance dungeon area. Right, do you mind taking a few steps to the side? I do not want your blood to stain my Thunderstorm Tank. Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I… … I get it! It is because yours is too…” Deiha immediately cried out hoarsely. However, before he could finish his words, he was halted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Just before he could utter the final word, Wu Ya’s hand shot out at lightning like speed and his index finger stabbed into Deiha’s head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Deiha’s mouth fell wide and his face froze instantly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya pulled out his finger; blood and brain matter slowly trickled down. Frowning, Wu Ya reached out to tear off a piece of Deiha’s clothing to carefully clean his finger before tossing it to the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Having lost his life, Deiha’s body fell backward. The pair of eyes on his face were round. There on his forehead, between his eyebrows, was a deep, black hole.</span></p>
