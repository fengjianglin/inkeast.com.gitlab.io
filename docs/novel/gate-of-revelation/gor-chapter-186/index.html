 <p><strong><u>GOR Chapter 186: Vengeful Spirit&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
 <p>After he was done, Dr Mu stood up, took a few steps backward, pulled off the gloves and threw them aside. He then accepted a bottle of water from Chen Xiaolian and took a few mouthfuls before seating himself onto the seats beside them. He breathed in and out a few times.</p>
 <p>“Are you all right?”</p>
 <p>“I’m good,” Despite the pale expression on Dr Mu’s face, he was able to remain fairly steady.</p>
 <p>“What is the result of your examination?” Chen Xiaolian asked.</p>
 <p>Dr Mu pondered for a moment before slowly saying.</p>
 <p>“According the examination, the deceased is a woman. Her gender was apparent; there isn’t much fat beneath her skin, so, she should not be too old – since humans usually become fatter in their middle and later years. This happens because the elderly face a decrease in strength, causing them to have less exercise. This results in an accumulation of fat beneath their skin. Additionally, from the state of her breasts and ovaries, she should be in the prime of her life. I judge that she should be around 30 years old.</p>
 <p>“Regarding fatal injuries… I found two spots. Obviously, since I am not a professional forensics personnel, and also the fact that I am lacking the necessary tools and equipment, there might be some omissions in this deduction of mine. There may be more fatal injuries and that I simply failed to locate them.</p>
 <p>“At present, I can see two fatal injuries.</p>
 <p>“The first is located on the neck where the point of entry is from the left side. It pierced in through the throat and into the artery.</p>
 <p>“The second is located at the heart. It was done accurately; it was pierced in right in between the ribs.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian nodded his head. “Is that it? Are there anything else?”</p>
 <p>Dr Mu hesitated for a moment. It appeared that he had wanted to say something. However, there was hesitation on his part.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was able to notice that and he slowly said. “Do not worry. Just speak whatever it is you can think of.”</p>
 <p>“This is only my personal deductions. Or perhaps, just my opinion. I do not want it to interfere with your work…”</p>
 <p>“No, please speak your mind. We will only use it as a reference,” Chen Xiaolian comforted him.</p>
 <p>Dr Mu considered what to say. “How should I put it… I feel that this approach is… very familiar.”</p>
 <p><em>Familiar?</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was shocked.</p>
 <p>“What I meant by that is… I am a doctor,” Dr Mu revealed a bitter smile. “I can’t help but feel that the methods used appear doctor like. More accurately, only a skilled surgeon should be able to do this.”</p>
 <p>He then gestured with this hands. “You know, the human heart that is located on the left side of the chest is protected by ribs. To stab something into the heart in one go is not an easy feat. There is a high probability that the stab would end up striking the ribs. However, that is not the case with this situation. The murderer’s stab pierced accurately through the gap between the ribs without touching the ribs and into the heart.”</p>
 <p>As Chen Xiaolian was considering Dr Mu’s words, Phoenix’s voice came from behind him. “However, that cannot prove that a doctor did it. It could be that the murderer is a very skilled professional killer.”</p>
 <p>“Naturally, such a possibility exists,” As they were discussing matters within his field of profession, Dr Mu became much calmer and he was quick to reply. “I am simply pointing out some of my speculations. Besides the fatal wound on the heart, there are other indications as well. Due to those indications, I suspect that the murderer may have a high level of mastery in medical knowledge.”</p>
 <p>“Oh? Such as?”</p>
 <p>“It’s the internal organs that were cut out and thrown to the side,” Dr Mu said. He forcefully shook his head and exhaled. “You may not understand me by words alone.”</p>
 <p>Next, Dr Mu stepped forward again.</p>
 <p>He moved until he was beside the internal organs strewn beside the corpse.</p>
 <p>“Many of the internal organs for a human are placed closely together. For example, the liver and the gallbladder, the pancreas, spleen, stomach… those parts are all located very close to one another.</p>
 <p>“I noticed that when the murderer was cutting open the abdomen, he cut out many of the internal organs and threw them out… I was unable to understand the reasoning behind this action of his.</p>
 <p>“However, looking at the way the murderer operates, I had this feeling that the murderer’s methods were similar to that of a skilled surgeon.</p>
 <p>“Because… generally speaking, only a surgeon would be so proficient toward internal organs and dissection techniques.</p>
 <p>“You see, while the murderer was cutting out the internal organs… I have examined them and found that the liver and gallbladder are in a undamaged state! There are no traces of cuts on the surface of the liver at all.</p>
 <p>“The same holds true for the spleen, pancreas, stomach sac and others.</p>
 <p>“When I was examining the corpse, I found that the colon is also in a complete state. There are no cuts on it at all!</p>
 <p>“You have to know this, when removing the liver and stomach sac… those two parts are located very close to the colon. That is especially true for the liver. Through my examination earlier, there are no cuts at all on them!</p>
 <p>“The average people could not possibly be so skilled!</p>
 <p>“This is not a matter of just picking up a knife to cut meat. Every internal organ was cut out in a complete state where no damage was caused to the main parts! This is something very difficult to accomplish, something that ordinary people could not do!</p>
 <p>“I am willing to bet. Ordinary people would not even be able to identify many of the parts!</p>
 <p>“Additionally… if the murderer is really a surgeon. I will have to admit that this fellow’s expertise with the scalpel is higher than mine.</p>
 <p>“I thought about it. If I had to be the one to do the dissection, I would not be able to guarantee that I could cut out so many internal organs without making a single mistake and cuts on the organs.”</p>
 <p><em>Perhaps it was done by a doctor with a high level of mastery – well, that counts as a clue.</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian noted that down.</p>
 <p>“Also…” Dr Mu hesitated once more. However, he appeared to have figured something out – since he’d already said it, there was no need to refrain.</p>
 <p>He took a deep breath. “The fatal injury on the deceased’s neck shows that the wound was inflicted from the left into the right.</p>
 <p>“This could mean… the murderer may be left-handed and held the knife with his left hand. Or… I cannot be certain that he must certainly be a left-hander. However, the murderer is someone who can use his left hand. It is possible that the murderer is an ambidextrous person.”</p>
 <p><em>All right!</em></p>
 <p><em>A skilled surgeon who may be left-handed, or ambidextrous.</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian looked at Dr Mu. “Is there anything else?”</p>
 <p>Dr Mu reflected for a moment. “None at the moment.”</p>
 <p>“Very well, thank you. You've helped us a lot.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Phoenix moved over with a handbag in her hand.</p>
 <p>It was a very chap and flashy handbag.</p>
 <p>“This belongs to the deceased,” Phoenix said coolly. “I’ve inspected the contents of the handbag. There is a mobile phone, purse and…”</p>
 <p>As she spoke, she furrowed her brows and opened the handbag to let Chen Xiaolian inspect the contents.</p>
 <p>Glancing at it, Chen Xiaolian saw a cheap looking makeup kit, a small bottle of perfume and…</p>
 <p>A long row of… condom packs!</p>
 <p>“There is a lot of cash in the purse,” Phoenix frowned.</p>
 <p>Considering the matter at hand, Chen Xiaolian came to understand Phoenix’s meaning.</p>
 <p>In a developed country like Europe and the US, people rarely carry a great deal of cash with them. Especially now that money had gone paperless, most people would not carry much cash with them. Not only would that be inconvenient, it was also unsafe. The majority of the people would prepare the necessary amount beforehand and only bring some change with them.</p>
 <p>Under most circumstances, those who would use cash. … they were people involved in illegal transactions such as drug trafficking or…</p>
 <p>Looking at the pile of condoms and the stacks of cash inside the purse…</p>
 <p>Clearly, the deceased woman was highly likely a… sex worker, en, a prostitute <sup><a id="ref1" href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
 <p>“We… can we leave this place? I want to go back,” Dr Mu who was standing beside inquired. “Also, I think I should still…”</p>
 <p>“You still want to report this to the police, right?” Chen Xiaolian turned his attention to Dr Mu.</p>
 <p>Dr Mu did not say anything. However, his attitude and expression clearly stated everything.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was not surprised – this was a normal reaction after all.</p>
 <p>“I am sorry, Dr Mu. I cannot let you go away like this,” Chen Xiaolian sighed. “You will have to come with us.”</p>
 <p>“… … what?” Dr Mu became somewhat nervous. “You… you people cannot do this! You people do not have the right, I… I…”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian gripped his shoulder and said. “Believe me; this is for your sake!”</p>
 <p>“No, I want to…”</p>
 <p>Dr Mu tried to struggle.</p>
 <p>It was at that instant…</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The sound alerted everyone who was standing on the platform.</p>
 <p>A lamp that was located some distance away suddenly burst!</p>
 <p>Before they could calm themselves…</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang bang bang bang!</p>
 <p>Bursting sounds rang out in succession! The lamps on the platform burst apart one after another. Soon, the entire platform was engulfed in darkness!</p>
 <p>The first thing Chen Xiaolian did was to grab onto Dr Mu. He placed Dr Mu right beside himself. Lun Tai and Bei Tai quickly moved over and the three of them placed themselves around Dr Mu.</p>
 <p>The platform had fallen into darkness!</p>
 <p>In the darkness, Chen Xiaolian heard Phoenix’s voice. “Do not panic, be quiet! Dagger, Monster, follow me. Titan brothers, watch our backs!”</p>
 <p>Then, a cold breeze suddenly blew toward them from the distant rails.</p>
 <p>When the cold breeze hit everyone’s body, Chen Xiaolian felt a surge of cold air penetrating his entire body!</p>
 <p>It felt as though he was standing within a world of ice and snow! The bone chilling cold spread through his body!</p>
 <p>Goosebumps broke out throughout his body!</p>
 <p>“Look! What is that?”</p>
 <p>He heard Bei Tai’s voice.</p>
 <p>Not far away, a faint green coloured speck abruptly appeared within the darkness.</p>
 <p>The green coloured light began moving as it increased in size. It then came together…</p>
 <p>To form a… translucent human figure!</p>
 <p>It clearly had the shape of a woman. However, the figure was translucent and it fluttered about. Her legs could not be seen, and was instead a mass of chaos.</p>
 <p>A sigh. It was as though the sound had entered through his ears and into his heart!</p>
 <p>After that, a voice filled with vengeance rang out!</p>
 <p>“Who? Who killed me? Who touched my body?!”</p>
 <p>The translucent and illusory figure suddenly turned around.</p>
 <p>Even in the darkness, Chen Xiaolian was able to accurately feel that the woman’s face, her eyes…</p>
 <p>They were staring intently at him…</p>
 <p>No!</p>
 <p>It would be more accurate to say that they were staring intently at the one beside him… Dr Mu!</p>
 <p>“Aah!”</p>
 <p>A sharp and shrill scream rang out!</p>
 <p>The sound was extremely harsh and brought with it a peculiar magic. It felt as though the sound had been magically transmitted into their ears! Chen Xiaolian, Lun Tai and Bei Tai felt pain in their eardrums. The feeling of pain even penetrated its way into their minds!</p>
 <p>“It’s a ghost?” Lun Tai shouted loudly as he tightly clutched his ears.</p>
 <p>It was then that the female ghost, whose eyes were staring intently at Dr Mu, suddenly revealed a grim and ferocious expression. She screeched and charged forward!</p>
 <p>“Take him away!” Chen Xiaolian did not hesitate. He pushed Dr Mu to Lun Tai even as he summoned out the Fearless War Axe. He rushed forward to intercept the female ghost.</p>
 <p>Head Cleaver!</p>
 <p>His war axe drew an arc as it cleaved down toward the female ghost.</p>
 <p>A cold flash accompanied this axe strike!</p>
 <p>However, the war axe simply went through the female ghost! Without encountering any resistance, it whistled down.</p>
 <p>At that same instant, Chen Xiaolian’s body, together with his war axe went pass the female ghost’s body!</p>
 <p>In that same moment, Chen Xiaolian felt as though he had just charged through freezing cold water. The freezing feeling nearly suffocated him!</p>
 <p>When he was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief, he came to realize that the female ghost had completely passed through his body.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian quickly turned around to see the female ghost pouncing toward Dr Mu.</p>
 <p>Dr Mu was being pulled by Lun Tai as they ran away. They ran toward the top of the subway station.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian pulled out a handgun and fired!</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>Two shots rang out but the bullets simply flew through the back of the female ghost before striking one of the pillars, causing sparks to fly!</p>
 <p>The female ghost did not slow down and she continued to chase after Lun Tai and Dr Mu.</p>
 <p>Bei Tai howled out. He tore out a seat that was fixed onto the side and hurled it forward. Unfortunately, the seat too struck thin air as it sailed past the female ghost.</p>
 <p><em>Ghost?</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s heart sank!</p>
 <p>It would appear that their weapons and normal attacks would not work on ghosts!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian quickly reconsidered all the attacks within his arsenal.</p>
 <p>If it’s a ghost, it should be a spiritual entity.</p>
 <p>However, against spiritual entities… both Lun Tai and Bei Tai’s skills would have no effect. Lun Tai’s skill is Muscle Fruit while Bei Tai’s skill is Air Incarceration. These two skills can only affect material bodies. It would likely be of no use against spiritual entities!</p>
 <p>As for me…</p>
 <p><em>Maybe only… Bai Qi?</em></p>
 <p>After he thought of that, Chen Xiaolian hesitated for a moment before making up his mind.</p>
 <p>But before he could summon out Bai Qi…</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Another gunshot rang out!</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>A silver coloured light exploded out behind the female ghost! The female ghost let out a miserable shriek!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian quickly turned around. Standing not far away from him was Phoenix!</p>
 <p>Thanks to the faint green coloured light emanating off the female ghost, he was barely able to make out Phoenix’s figure.</p>
 <p>The young woman was standing straight. Next, she took a step forward, a big and unique looking revolver in her right hand. Her arm was straightened as she pointed the revolver at the female ghost. Then, she pulled the trigger once more.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>This time, the silver light caused the female ghost's head to explode!</p>
 <p>The female ghost turned around, her face a swirl of chaos. She roared out with resentment before her body collapsed apart and disappeared.</p>
 <p>“I have my eyes on you! I won't let you escape from me!”</p>
 <p>After releasing the sharp and ear-piercing words, the figure of the female ghost completely dissipated.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>…</p>
