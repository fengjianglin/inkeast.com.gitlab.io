 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 627 Neverending </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Foolish insect! Did you really think you can kill the mighty Wu Ya?!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya’s roar reverberated through the sky like a clap of thunder.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His left arm was utterly gone and blood stained the left side of his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As for his right arm, although it was still twisted in a peculiar way, it was no longer hanging limply. From the looks of it, it could now move.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Scars covered the snake head as a major portion of the scales there had been blown off, revealing the bloody muscles and folds beneath the skin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tens of minor holes marred his dragon wings. Yet, it was still able to carry Wu Ya through the sky, albeit barely.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian pushed his knees, forcing himself to suppress the feeling of pain, the feeling of having ten thousand blades stabbing into his body, down. Straightening himself, he looked up at Wu Ya, who flapped his wings to fly toward Chen Xiaolian. A rueful smile appeared on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In but moments, Wu Ya was near the bridge. His bright yellow eyes were filled with rage and they glared at Chen Xiaolian and the others, who looked like ants before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Insect! Have you used up all your tricks?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“We are going to die… … we are so going to die… …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Grace, who was seated limply inside the SUV, looked out with a blank expression on her face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Due to the vastness of Wu Ya’s descending body, he ended up covering the light from the sky, casting a huge shadow on the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The terror brought about by this colossal monster at such close range was incomparable to what they felt when they were just watching it from afar.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Grace did not doubt Wu Ya’s ability to crush their SUV into pieces with just one finger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although the feeling of terror did not turn Daniel limp, his entire body had turned taut and he gripped the SUV’s doorknob tightly. It was so tight that his knuckles had turned white.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Among them, only Yang Lin raised up his gun. He raised the gun outside the window, aiming it at Wu Ya. Despite his accelerated rate of breathing, his face remained calm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea lifted his head to look at Wu Ya, who was still up in the sky. Then, he turned to look at Chen Xiaolian. With a calm look, he said, “You can beat him, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian exchanged glances with Bluesea before revealing a bitter smile. “I… … don’t know.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>This fellow… … is seriously powerful!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was not as though he had never encountered such an opponent before.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Back in Zero City, while using Skyblade’s power to participate in Blood Verdict, he had faced an opponent capable of transforming into a dragon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>That man known as Jacob was also a renowned expert from the Knights of Darkness Guild. However, Chen Xiaolian only needed one hack to decapitate Jacob, who had transformed into a colossal dragon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Since that day, Chen Xiaolian’s mastery of Skyblade’s power had only grown deeper. The attack he used against Wu Ya earlier was more powerful compared to the one he unleashed back when he was participating in Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild’s Blood Verdict.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>And yet, this snake-headed dragon had only been wounded by his attack, albeit seriously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian lowered his gaze to look at the pile of powder on the ground. He gave a silent sigh.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>If he had Skyblade in his hand or the Sword in the Stone, he may be able to continue fighting.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although he received an [S] class power from Skyblade, Chen Xiaolian only knew of one way of utilizing the power – he could only use it when holding a weapon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Without any weapon in hand, Chen Xiaolian had no idea how to use it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After all, that was not his own power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>While gasping for breath, Wu Ya raised up his right arm and another sphere of light appeared upon his right palm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>One third of the bridge near Manhattan had already collapsed and there was nothing on the ground before Chen Xiaolian. He stood there at the edge of the collapsed bridge and looked up at Wu Ya.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was no weapon to be found nearby.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The sphere of light that Wu Ya was creating, be it its size or its speed of formation, was far inferior compared to the earlier one. It was clear that Chen Xiaolian’s earlier attack had greatly damaged his strength.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, regardless of how damaged Wu Ya was, the present Chen Xiaolian had no opportunity to counter attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Using his strength, Skyblade established Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild’s renown and earned the qualifications to make his guild a resident guild of Zero City. There was no way a figure like that would require a sword in hand to unleash his powers. However, when he ‘lent’ his power to Chen Xiaolian after he was turned into a blade, he only informed Chen Xiaolian the method of unleashing it through weapons.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Considering his position in the guild, Chen Xiaolian had taken the physical and melee skill route when enhancing himself. He had no long-ranged skills.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As for the Four-eyed War Cat and Bai Qi, those two summon-type skills could no longer be used in World’s End.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Since coming here, Chen Xiaolian could only rely on the sword he seized when utilizing Skyblade’s power for battle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, that earlier all-out attack had utterly exhausted him. Furthermore, where on this empty bridge could he find a sword capable of withstanding Skyblade’s power?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian lowered his head. After a moment, he looked up. Then, he slowly extended his right hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was a simple move. He raised the palm of his right hand to face Wu Ya, who was up in the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Thank you for risking your life to come save me, Mr Bluesea.” Chen Xiaolian turned to give Bluesea a smile. “I do not know if I can kill him or not, but I will have to trouble you to carry me up the SUV later.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“All right.” Bluesea looked up at Wu Ya, who still had a savage expression on his snake face, and the white sphere of light that was gradually forming upon his right palm. Bluesea gave a simple nod, his face calm, not the slightest trace of fear could be seen on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Finally, the white sphere of light in Wu Ya’s palm reached completion.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Although you are already very close – in the end, you are still not [S] class! Return to ashes, insect!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He lifted the sphere of light up high. Wu Ya, who was about to hurl the sphere of light at the bridge, was extremely confident that this attack will kill off Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At that same moment, light abruptly flashed across Chen Xiaolian’s eyes. An illusory figure shimmered into existence behind him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A Goddess of War wearing exquisite armour. The sword in her hand was swiftly raised up. Then, it slashed down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Goddess of Dawn.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Overwhelming Sunlight Purification!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian could feel all his strength leaving him as his body rapidly grew weaker and weaker. Also, it was not just his own strength. Rather, it also included – Skyblade’s power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>That… … that was right.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The skill to combust all the attributes within his body to release one singular attack could also include the power that Skyblade left behind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The power that Skyblade left in Chen Xiaolian’s body was neither that of his prime nor all of his power. It was like a tree without roots. Every bit Chen Xiaolian used meant the power will be reduced by that much. Even so, it was still the power of an [S] class powerhouse.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Following the Goddess of War’s slashing motion, the surging power transformed into a beam of light, which blasted forward from behind Chen Xiaolian toward Wu Ya.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That is impossible!!!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The moment Wu Ya saw the silhouette of the Goddess of War, he screamed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Overwhelming Sunlight Purification?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>The Overwhelming Sunlight Purification skill which combusts all attributes to unleash one singular attack?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>An Overwhelming Sunlight Purification from a quasi-[S] class expert combusting all of his attributes?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Naturally, Wu Ya had seen the skill before. However, he had never seen anyone above [A] class using it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Before Wu Ya could hurl down the sphere of light in his hand, the beam slammed into him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>With a wretched bellow, the surface of Wu Ya’s body began to fall apart. The black scales on him seemed as though they had fallen into a powerful acid and they rapidly dissolved to reveal the flesh beneath. Those too, were slowly eroded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya frantically twisted his body in an attempt to hurl the sphere of light in his hand. However, he was no longer able to muster the strength to do so. The beam of light bombarded him non-stop. In but the blink of an eye, a large hole had appeared on his abdomen area.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian’s earlier attack had fractured Wu Ya’s right arm, which was now raised up high. At that very moment, the right arm no longer had the strength to continue its upright position. It fell limply and the sphere of light, which Wu Ya had failed to hurl down, fell on his own head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Without a sound, the sphere of light expanded tens of times in size and the vast explosion of light engulfed Wu Ya’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Both Bluesea and Chen Xiaolian were forced to close their eyes in face of the blinding flash of light.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The silhouette of the Goddess of Dawn behind him flapped her wings once before slowly disappearing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Then, Chen Xiaolian’s body turned limp as he could no longer support himself. He fell down onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Up in the air, the explosion of light disappeared and colossal but partially mutilated Wu Ya fell slowly and crashed into the river beneath the bridge.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Chen Xiaolian!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea forced himself to open up his tearing eyes and rushed to Chen Xiaolian’s side to help him up. “Are you all right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian opened his eyes to look at Bluesea. However, he was weakened to the point where he could no longer speak up. All he could do was to slowly nod while his eyes turned to look at the other end of the bridge.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Gritting his teeth, Bluesea placed Chen Xiaolian over his shoulder and swiftly made his way to the SUV behind them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The SUV roared to life and sped toward the other end of the bridge.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Hearing the sound of the SUV, a feeling of relief slowly washed over Chen Xiaolian and he closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After Bluesea and the others had disappeared far away, the calm surface of the river water suddenly swirled, turning into a maelstrom.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya’s naked figure slowly floated up to the surface of the river and he struggled to climb up the river bank.</span></p>
