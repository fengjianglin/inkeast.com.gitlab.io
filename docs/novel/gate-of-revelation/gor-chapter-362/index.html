 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 362 Woman’s Intuition</strong></p>
 <p>Today, their group had stopped to rest twice. In the afternoon, they reached an area where the river was barely flowing and Hans finally gave the order for them to start their engines, using the propellers to move their boats forward.</p>
 <p>Sighs of relief accompanied this order, as everyone had long since been exhausted. They had barely any more strength left in them and the speed at which they were going had fallen to the lowest possible.</p>
 <p>After starting up the engines to propel their boats, the speed at which their fleet was moving improved.</p>
 <p>When night fell, their fleet stopped to rest once again.</p>
 <p>To everyone’s relief, no rebel soldiers appeared to be pursuing them. Relieved looks were etched on everyone’s face; it was as though they had just made it out of a calamity. Even those whose faces were originally slack now had a more livelier look in their faces. This was what people call hope.</p>
 <p>Their fleet of boats were stopped on both sides of the riverbank. Hans did not stop them from doing so because this part of the river was relatively narrow. Some parts of one of the sides were unable to accommodate the boats.</p>
 <p>They were all comforted to see that the grounds of the riverbank here was moist. This place should be quite far from any roads. Thus, even if the rebel army did send soldiers to sweep around, they would not come to this place.</p>
 <p>There were also no grasses here. Thus, there was no need to be too worried about lions or other wild beasts. In the continent of Africa, the grasslands were the territory of the lions. However, it was rare for a pack of lions to operate within the forest.</p>
 <p>Randall and his men put up a perimeter alarm along the east coast before allowing everyone to do as they like.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian who was at the riverbank fixed up another pot, using it to boil some mineral water to drink… he was not about to drink the dirty water from the river.</p>
 <p>The surrounding refugees could only watch on helplessly. They had managed to gather dried grass and firewood to start a fire. Unfortunately, they lacked water… they were running away and the space in the boats were limited. How were they to bring water with them?</p>
 <p>They placed worn-out pots on the campfires and poured water from the river inside the pots. Then, those groups of people sat down and just watched.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian pulled out an energy bar and munched down on it. This time, no one came to trouble him. Chen Xiaolian had deliberately placed the golden Desert Eagle on the ground right next to his hand.</p>
 <p>Although there were some nearby who looked on with reddened eyes, Chen Xiaolian simply ignored them.</p>
 <p>He had used the engine to move his boat all this time, leading to the consumption of quite a lot of diesel. However, Lin Leyan had clearly recovered considerably.</p>
 <p>During the day, she had managed to get some sleep. Although it was just a nap while leaning upon Chen Xiaolian’s body, she did manage to recover somewhat.</p>
 <p>For dinner, Chen Xiaolian cooked instant noodles and sausages.</p>
 <p>Lin Leyan was now at the point where she had become unfazed by Chen Xiaolian’s endless magic trick like performance. Due to how tasty the Aged Jar Pickles instant noodles were, she finished up an entire bowl’s worth of it. Chen Xiaolian also gave her a piece of chocolate. However, she secretly gave it to the few African children who were staring at them.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian simply watched and did nothing to stop her. He sighed.</p>
 <p>The other refugees were also eating dinner. Although they did not bring much food with them, it was at least enough to fill their stomachs.</p>
 <p>Seeing how Chen Xiaolian’s side had instant noodles and sausages, some of the refugees felt envious. However, after what had happened to those African men in the day, no one dared to come over to ask for food.</p>
 <p>Even so, when Lin Leyan handed the chocolate to the children, someone finally lost their patience.</p>
 <p>Although they were unable to rob him, some could still resort to intellect…</p>
 <p>An African woman walked over.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was unable to discern the age of African people. However, he felt that this woman was not too old. Additionally… it would appear that she was quite the wealthy person.</p>
 <p>In Kombia, the method of distinguishing between the poor and rich was very simple.</p>
 <p>Poor thin and rich fat.</p>
 <p>For this poor country that had hit the poverty line, that was basically the standard.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian noted however that although this woman was somewhat fat, her body was considerably well proportioned… it would appear that she had a habit of exercising.</p>
 <p>Now that was something else!</p>
 <p>This was a country suffering from food problems and everyone here was more concerned with getting enough to eat and acquiring fuel and water. For someone here to worry about becoming too fat and exercise, that can only be someone who was extremely wealthy.</p>
 <p>“Is there a problem?” Chen Xiaolian looked at the approaching African woman. Her face appeared somewhat reserved. Yet, he could faintly sense a haughtiness within her face, causing him to dislike her.</p>
 <p>“I want to make a deal with you.”</p>
 <p>“Not interested.” Chen Xiaolian shook his head.</p>
 <p>The African woman was momentarily shocked. She then took a deep breath and said slowly, “During daytime, I saw that you had beef jerky.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian narrowed his eyes and he raised his head to look at the woman in an amused manner.</p>
 <p>“I don’t mean you any harm,” said the African woman with a smile that carried a certain trace of loftiness. “I can barter with you. Additionally, I won’t be taking advantage of you.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian smiled and asked, “What do you plan on giving me? Kombian money?”</p>
 <p>“Of course I won’t be giving you those useless papers.” The African woman shook her head. “The barter I am talking about is not about money or wealth. At this moment, even if I am to give you gold, would that be useful? You can neither eat nor drink it.”</p>
 <p><em>This is interesting</em>. Chen Xiaolian was somewhat taken aback and he glanced at the African woman.</p>
 <p>“What are you planning to use to barter?” Chen Xiaolian smiled. “It you want jerky, I do still have a bit of them.”</p>
 <p>The African woman took a deep breath before replying, “Diesel.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian froze.</p>
 <p>Diesel?!</p>
 <p>“I noticed that you’ve used up a lot of diesel today, far more than the others. If I had to guess, you don’t have much left, right? You will surely not have enough diesel for tomorrow.” The African woman then lowered her voice and said, “I have some extra diesel that I can use to exchange for food with you.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian frowned. “Where did you come from?”</p>
 <p>The African woman did not directly answer. She turned her head and pointed in a backhanded move at a certain direction and said, “That’s my team.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian looked and saw a group of robust looking young men seated together. There were also three men standing not too far away from the African woman. They appeared to be lounging around but their eyes were focused. Additionally, Chen Xiaolian noted that the spots that they were occupying were very well selected.</p>
 <p>There was a professional atmosphere around them.</p>
 <p>Bodyguards?</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian looked at the African woman and wondered what her identity might be.</p>
 <p>“My team have enough manpower, allowing us to save up on a lot of diesel today. Among all the teams, my team used the least amount of diesel.” The woman said coolly. “I have some assets that I can use to barter with you.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian quickly judged that this woman was not telling the truth.</p>
 <p>Even if they do possess enough manpower, using manpower alone to save up on diesel… how much could they save?</p>
 <p>It must be… when the diesel was being distributed, this woman must have found a way to get some more!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian frowned.</p>
 <p>He thought back to the time when the diesel was being distributed. Back then, Randall had been up to something.</p>
 <p>“You know Randall?” Chen Xiaolian simply asked out.</p>
 <p>“… … …” The African woman was shocked for a moment. She stared at Chen Xiaolian and hesitated for a bit before replying in a hushed tone, “I gave him a little gift.”</p>
 <p>“Oh? Kombian goods or money?”</p>
 <p>“A piece of gold, not too big… just a little bigger than your gun,” said the woman who pointed at the golden Desert Eagle lying beside Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p><em>That’s bloody big, man!</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian sighed.</p>
 <p><em>That damned Randall. You bastard!</em></p>
 <p>“Are you up for the exchange or not?” The woman frowned. “I am just paying for the mistake I did earlier. When we ran, we did not take too much food with us. Besides, my men… they need enough food to maintain their strength. Only then could they have enough strength to protect me in times of danger.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian considered it. Then, he suddenly shouted, “Hey! Where’s my old friend?”</p>
 <p>The African minister suddenly appeared from who knows where. There was a huge smile on his face and there was the atmosphere of a minion coming from him. “I am here. Old friend, is there anything you need me for?”</p>
 <p>“Where is your helmet?”</p>
 <p>“Eh?” The African minister was momentarily taken aback. Then, he responded by quickly reaching to feel his backside. He had used a rope to tie the pot to his belt.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian did not extend his hand to hold the pot. Instead, he had the African minister hand it to the African woman.</p>
 <p>“Fill it with diesel and I will give you 500 grams of jerky,” Chen Xiaolian said coolly.</p>
 <p>500 grams of jerky. Five times the amount of raw meat was needed to make jerky.</p>
 <p>The woman’s team had ten members in total. Distributing the meat equally would give each of them around half a jin (250 g). That should be enough food for them. (1 kg = 2 jin.)</p>
 <p>The woman swiftly nodded her head and answered, “Good! It’s decided them!”</p>
 <p>The pot of diesel was soon handed over and Chen Xiaolian poured it into his boat’s fuel tank. Then, he handed a bag of unopened jerky to the woman.</p>
 <p>“Happy doing business with you.” The woman glanced at Chen Xiaolian and said, “Maybe on the way we can…”</p>
 <p>“I’m not too fond of doing business. This is a one-time thing.” Chen Xiaolian shook his head and showed no interest in continuing to chat with her.</p>
 <p>This exchange between them had caused others to look at him covetously. However, Chen Xiaolian chose to ignore them.</p>
 <p>Rather, he did something else. Something outrageous…</p>
 <p>When night came, he sat on the riverbank…</p>
 <p>Chi…</p>
 <p>That sound attracted the attention of many surrounding people.</p>
 <p>Next, some of them nearly swore out!</p>
 <p><em>You’re simply being too infuriating!</em></p>
 <p><em>We’re all refuges here! We have to drink water from the river, eat potatoes and bread.</em></p>
 <p><em>The fact that you could drink mineral water and eat noodles and sausages was one thing.</em></p>
 <p><em>But now… but now…</em></p>
 <p><em>Now you sit on the riverbank and enjoy yourself with a can of cola?!</em></p>
 <p><em>How are we supposed to endure this argh!</em></p>
 <p><em>Rather, as if drinking that cola wasn’t bad enough, do you have to go so far as to stretch your neck and burp?!</em></p>
 <p>Lin Leyan approached from behind and sat down beside Chen Xiaolian. She knitted her eyebrows and looked at Chen Xiaolian and the can of cola in his hand.</p>
 <p>A Chinese label could clearly be seen on its surface!</p>
 <p>“Where did you…” Lin Leyan’s question was only partly out of her mouth when she suddenly shook her head. “Forget it, I’d better not ask. Even if I did, you won’t be telling me the truth.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian shrugged his shoulders.</p>
 <p>“I’m very curious. These food and drinks, where did you keep them? Could that backpack hold so many items?”</p>
 <p>Once again, Chen Xiaolian shrugged his shoulders.</p>
 <p>“Could it be you know magic? Or Dao techniques?” Lin Leyan asked.</p>
 <p>“You’ve been reading too much fantasy novels, haven’t you?” Chen Xiaolian gave a harrumph and glanced at her.</p>
 <p>“Don’t forget, I am from Taiwan. Those fantasy novels from your country… the first generation of writers were nurtured by us Taiwanese. Of course I’ve read fantasy novels.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was speechless.</p>
 <p>He was an author of online novels after all. He knew full well that what Lin Leyan said was the truth.</p>
 <p>At present, the fantasy novels were very popular in China and the best authors were able to make an absolute killing in earnings.</p>
 <p>However, the truth remained that the first generation of fantasy novel authors had to rely on the Taiwanese market for a living.</p>
 <p>Back then, the websites in China had yet to be developed and there was no such thing as paid authors. Most would upload their works on websites in China to earn popularity before selling their works to the publishers in Taiwan. Then, their works would be printed out and sold in Taiwan.</p>
 <p>One novel for a few thousand yuan, a little money for their living expenses.</p>
 <p>The nurture given by the Taiwanese market to the first generation of online fantasy novel authors was what stopped them from dying of starvation.</p>
 <p>“Why don’t you say I am a robot cat with a 4D pocket?” Chen Xiaolian deliberately put on a smile.</p>
 <p>Lin Leyan sighed and her smile faded.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian handed the can of cola to Lin Leyan who accepted it, took a gulp and placed it down.</p>
 <p>“Come, accompany me… go somewhere else for a bit.”</p>
 <p>“Mm?”</p>
 <p>Lin Leyan’s face became somewhat pink and she said, “I… I want to go… relieve myself. I dare not go alone.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian sighed and stood up.</p>
 <p>Observing Chen Xiaolian and Lin Leyan walk side by side as they headed into the forest, the Caucasian woman who was lying on the ground could not help but curse out in a whisper.</p>
 <p>“What do you think they are going to do?” the African minister suddenly asked in a low voice.</p>
 <p>“How would I know?” the Caucasian woman grunted.</p>
 <p>There was a lewd smile on the African minister’s face as he said, “Could it be that they could no longer resist themselves? Do they plan on doing that?”</p>
 <p>The Caucasian woman rolled her eyes and said coldly, “Move your hands.”</p>
 <p>The African minister gave an awkward smile and retracted his hand that was placed on the Caucasian woman’s thigh. There was a trace of irritation on his face.</p>
 <p>“This should be far enough, right?” Chen Xiaolian had a tactical flashlight in his hand and was walking in front. He shone the light around and saw that there were no signs of danger in their surroundings. As they were walking through the forest, Chen Xiaolian had also secretly summoned out his Four-eyed War Cats.</p>
 <p>Three Four-eyed War Cats were prowling around the forest in the vicinity, ensuring that Chen Xiaolian would not encounter any danger.</p>
 <p>They had moved quite far away from their camp and Chen Xiaolian stopped.</p>
 <p>“Will this place do?” Chen Xiaolian looked at Lin Leyan.</p>
 <p>Lin Leyan forcefully bit her lips. She clenched her hands and stared into Chen Xiaolian’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“Why are you looking at me like that?” asked Chen Xiaolian with a frown.</p>
 <p>Lin Leyan suddenly rushed forward.</p>
 <p>A gust of wind arrived as Lin Leyan jumped into Chen Xiaolian’s bosom. Fearing that she might end up falling on the ground, he did not choose to dodge.</p>
 <p>Right after the young woman landed on his chest, Chen Xiaolian found his lips making contact with Lin Leyan’s.</p>
 <p>This was a standard kiss.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was dumbstruck for a few seconds. However, he quickly responded and pushed Lin Leyan away.</p>
 <p>Lin Leyan gasped and she looked at Chen Xiaolian in a provocative manner. “What’s the matter? Don’t tell me you don’t like women?”</p>
 <p>“I like you a lot,” said Chen Xiaolian as he looked at Lin Leyan. “But not the ‘like’ between males and females.”</p>
 <p>Lin Leyan stared at Chen Xiaolian and said, “I like you. It’s the ‘like’ between males and females.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian furrowed his eyebrows and sighed. “You are being too impulsive tonight.”</p>
 <p>Lin Leyan flushed. However, she quickly reached out with her hand to grab hold of Chen Xiaolian’s hand… guiding it past her outer jacket before placing it on her t-shirt in the breast position.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian could feel that her bra was the sports bra without steel wires. It was very soft and flexible. Additionally… the size was amazing.</p>
 <p>Lin Leyan leaned closer and her hot breath blew on to Chen Xiaolian’s face.</p>
 <p>“Don’t tell me you are not tempted. Don’t tell me you are not feeling anything. Don’t tell me you don’t want to.” Lin Leyan spoke in a quavering voice. “I can give myself to you right now, right here.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s fingers could feel the heat, the warmth, the softness, the flexibility…</p>
 <p>His heart was pounding uncontrollably!</p>
 <p>Lin Leyan’s soft body leaned on his chest and he could feel her trembling due to anxiousness.</p>
 <p>It was exactly this kind of trembling that would make a man especially tempted!</p>
 <p>In this secluded and dark place, a young passionate woman was gazing at him with a loving expression while leaning on him with her soft and supple body. She grabbed his hand to place it on her soft breast and whispered into his ear, “I can give myself to you right now…”</p>
 <p><em>In such a situation…</em></p>
 <p><em>Of all the men in the world, nine out of ten would probably be swayed, right?</em></p>
 <p><em>Maybe I would regret today’s decision…</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian mumbled to himself.</p>
 <p>After a great struggle, he finally pulled his hand back and took half a step back. Then, he lowered his head to look into Lin Leyan’s eyes.</p>
 <p>There was a defeated look on her face!</p>
 <p>“I… am I that unattractive?” She bit down on her lips.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian took a deep breath and placed both hands on her shoulders, holding her to stop her from falling. At the same time, he also put enough force to ensure that she did not try to fall into his chest again.</p>
 <p>“Actually… I am very tempted,” Chen Xiaolian said sincerely. “It’s the truth, you have a voluptuous body. Any male would be tempted. However, just because one is tempted does not mean one has to act on it. That is simply primal instinct.”</p>
 <p>“I am clean. I told you before, I am a virgin.”</p>
 <p>“I know. I trust you.” Chen Xiaolian sighed. There was a clear look in his eyes as he looked down at his chest. He retracted one hand to place it on his heart. “But, this place of mine… there is already someone there.”</p>
 <p>“… … …” Lin Leyan silently looked at Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>“You’ve experienced way too many struggles for life and death in the past few days. Since I was the one who saved you, it is very easy for a woman to mistake the need for security and gratefulness toward her saviour as some other special feeling,” Chen Xiaolian slowly said.</p>
 <p>“I feel very safe and comfortable when I am with you,” whispered Lin Leyan. “I really like you.”</p>
 <p>“I'm a few years younger than you.”</p>
 <p>“Then just consider me an old cow that likes tender grass, all right?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian could not help but break into a smile.</p>
 <p>Lin Leyan’s eyelids drooped down and her body shook at an even greater rate. She dared not look into Chen Xiaolian’s eyes. “I am not asking much. I just want to… give you once. Just once. Just once is enough. I am not asking for some long-term commitment. I have already thought it through; I won’t be marrying anyone. I will be spending the rest of my life travelling the world as a volunteer. Maybe I will keep doing this until I’m 50, until my body can no longer continue on. I mean it, I am not asking for anything. I just want to give myself to you, to someone whom I like.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian smiled and said, “Even so, is there a need to do it here at a place like this? At a time like this? Just think about it carefully. I never thought you are someone with so much courageous.”</p>
 <p>“I am not being courageous, rather…” Lin Leyan raised her gaze. “I have a hunch.”</p>
 <p>“What is it?”</p>
 <p>The young woman looked at Chen Xiaolian and said gravely, “Don’t try to lie to me and don’t try to play it off. I know… once we leave this place, once we safely make it to Congo… once it’s safe, you will instantly leave! I may never see you again.”</p>
 <p>“… … …” Chen Xiaolian did not say anything.</p>
 <p>Lin Leyan’s guess…</p>
 <p>Was very accurate!</p>
 <p>That was indeed what Chen Xiaolian planned on doing!</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian and Lin Leyan returned to the camp. The amount of time they spent away from the camp caused the African minister and the Caucasian woman’s imagination to run wild. Especially when they saw how Lin Leyan’s face was flushed and her clothes were rather untidy. Seeing that caused their imaginations to go even wilder.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian did not feel disturbed. At any rate, he did not do anything at all.</p>
 <p>After returning to the camp, Chen Xiaolian was about to sit down and rest when he suddenly heard sounds of quarrel and condemnation coming from somewhere not far away!</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Two African boys were quietly seated beside their campfire. Before them were several large eggs of some animal.</p>
 <p>After those eggs were well cooked, the African boys broke it open and a fragrant aroma quickly wafted into the air.</p>
 <p>Coincidentally, the African woman from earlier was right beside them and she noticed the eggs placed before the two boys. Attracted by the size of those eggs, she gave it an extra glance. Then, her face immediately sank! She immediately shouted as she moved over and hauled up one of the boys. She shouted, “Where did you get it from?”</p>
 <p>The boy was scared and he quickly pointed in a certain direction and said, “There… there… we dug it out from the soil there! Let me go!”</p>
 <p>There was paleness on the African woman’s face and she looked around in horror.</p>
 <p>It was at that moment that a series of wretched cries suddenly echoed out from within the camp!</p>
 <p>At the same time, several fellows ran out in confusion. Some were simply crawling as quickly as they could as the ones in the back screamed frantically, “Crocodile! Crocodile!”</p>
