 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 642 How Powerful?</strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun knitted her brows. She looked at Sebast and said, “Bat?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast extended a finger out and shook it twice as he shook his head. “Wrong, I am of the Bloodclan. A Bloodclan magus.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No difference,” said Sister Yun with an air of indifference.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Enough. You managed to break my spell array and look fairly strong. However, I am not here for you,” said Sebast with a smile as he turned to face Chen Xiaolian. “You are Chen Xiaolian?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes.” Chen Xiaolian nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This fellow had uttered Chen Xiaolian’s name the moment he appeared. That meant… … they could no longer pretend to be Irregularities who knew nothing of what was going on and enter the Coalition’s headquarters.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Excellent.” Sebast nodded with a satisfied look. “I want to ask one thing from you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast performed a slight bow, a gentlemanly gesture and said, “Take me… … away from this Godforsaken place, away from World’s End!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian’s heart gave a thump and he stared intently at Sebast.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Since entering World’s End, the only time he had mentioned that he could return to the outside world was to Sister Yun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Are you curious as to how I found out?” Sebast shook his head with a smile. “However, there is no need for you to know that much. Just… … be obedient and bring me back.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I’m sorry, but the tickets are sold out.” Chen Xiaolian shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Qiao Qiao was the one he came here for. It was only natural for him to bring her back with him. And now that he had met Bluesea, Chen Xiaolian could not let Bluesea remain here only to await his deletion in the hands of the system.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After excluding himself, only two other empty slots remained within the Lifehymn Music Score.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was something else. The blond youth before them had an elegant smile on his face all this time and had been courteously well-mannered. However, Chen Xiaolian sensed a faint atmosphere of blood coming off him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Fine. I have already expected you to reject me. Still, it matters not… …” Sebast stepped forward while maintaining his smile. “I believe I can slowly persuade you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Persuade?” Chen Xiaolian sneered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes.” Sebast nodded with a look of sincerity as he stretched out both his hands. “Using… … this.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The moment his hands rose up, the surrounding temperature abruptly plummeted. Even the uniform glow of light coming down from the sky became somewhat bleak.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian’s heart began palpitating furiously, seemingly on the verge of jumping out from his body. With great difficulty, he recollected himself. Even so, the bleak atmosphere continued to pervade his body. It was as though there were numerous needles piercing his skin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>What he was feeling was not an attack. Rather, it was the atmosphere released before the other fellow unleashed his attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>This blond fellow… … his strength is probably not inferior compared to Wu Ya.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Why is my luck so bad!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian cursed inwardly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Before coming here, Chen Xiaolian had deduced that there must be a considerable number of ancient monster-level fellows here.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, Irregularities were unlike Players, Awakened ones and the Development Team. They were BUGs that would only appear once in a while. Additionally, it was unlikely for every Irregularity to be lucky enough to receive the GM’s attention and be provided assistance.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>For most Irregularities, the regular path for them would be to arduously endure a small number of instance dungeons only to be killed by either monsters, Players, or other Awakened ones. They would not even have the chance to develop themselves.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was no personal system within World’s End. It was also impossible for them to preserve their equipment and props for a long time. Although they could live indefinitely, increment in strength for them was highly finite.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Since arriving in World’s End, Chen Xiaolian had encountered a total of five Irregularities. Among the five, only Deiha and Terry could be considered of average level. That Hammer fellow; in the outside world, his strength was likely sufficient to qualify him to become a member of the Angel Corps.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>And now, there was this blond fellow. Judging by the atmosphere he was exuding before even making his move, he was likely on the same level as Wu Ya, an [S] class expert.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Back when facing Wu Ya, Chen Xiaolian had to fight with everything he had. He even had to utilize his final card, the Overwhelming Sunlight Purification skill, in order to finish off Wu Ya. Unfortunately, that meant his own attributes had been completely combusted in the process. Thanks to the Power Propagation Serum he took back in the Tokyo instance dungeon, his attributes were slowly recovering. However, at present he had only recovered up to 30 per cent of his original strength.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Additionally, Skyblade’s power had also been combusted when he utilized the Overwhelming Sunlight Purification skill. Since that was not Chen Xiaolian’s own power, the Power Propagation Serum will not be restoring it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In other words, before leaving World’s End, something that could only occur when the Lifehymn Music Score’s timer ended, there was no way for Chen Xiaolian to recover his previous quasi-[S] class strength.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Have you realized… … my power?” Sebast smiled as he stepped even closer. Every step he took was done with a genteel manner. However, each step caused the ground around him to shake.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Yet, when he lifted up his feet, there was no footprint on the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast moved forward slowly. For every step he took, the smile on his face would turn increasingly peculiar.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although he had not attacked, he had already secretly channelled his aura. All of them were focused on his footsteps.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Unless necessary, he did not want to attack Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was not because he was on guard against Chen Xiaolian’s strength. Wu Ya was an infamous figure within World’s End. All within this world knew that he was an [S] class expert. Thus, even though Chen Xiaolian had managed to defeat Wu Ya, he must surely be in bad shape as well. Should they end up fighting each other, Sebast was confident in his ability to casually defeat Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, Sebast was uncertain what the method to taking someone out from World’s End was. He feared accidentally wounding Chen Xiaolian and foiling his own plan.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As for the other two…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast did not even care about them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The man was likely the one that Grace had informed him about, Bluesea. For Sebast, an Awakened who had already lost his memories and abilities was no different from an ant.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>And the woman… … although he did not know who she was, Sebast was someone who knew every reputable Irregularity within World’s End. Thus, despite her display of breaking his spell array, in his opinion, she was definitely not a noteworthy expert.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As long as he could take down Chen Xiaolian, he would be able to easily kill the other two.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Each of Sebast’s steps rang out with a clear, resonant sound. After having taken less than 10 steps, Sebast saw that Chen Xiaolian’s eyes were becoming dazed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Success!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As he had expected, Chen Xiaolian had received serious injuries after his fight against Wu Ya.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast’s footsteps were not merely exuding an imposing presence, they were also initiating a mental attack. As long as his strength was enough to suppress the target, he will be able to take his target by surprise and defeat the target’s mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A small opening had opened within Chen Xiaolian’s mental defences. All Sebast needed to do was to push a little more…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The thought had just appeared within Sebast’s mind when a cold harrumph abruptly rang out within his ears.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The harrumph was not loud but had a piercing quality to it. Like a sharp knife, it struck Sebast’s eardrums.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The sound interrupted all the preparations he made for his next step, causing Sebast to lose his momentum. His foot stepped softly onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After the sound of the cold harrumph rang out, Chen Xiaolian, who had revealed a trace of absent-mindedness, suddenly recovered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Two gazes fell upon Sister Yun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian’s gaze was filled with gratitude while Sebast’s was filled with vigilance and fury.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun looked back at Sebast without revealing any fear. Next, she swung the spear in her hand, creating a gully on the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The gully was only as wide as a finger. However, they could not see how far down it went.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Stop your confusion skill. I do not like killing people. So, if you do not cross this line, you will not die,” said Sister Yun with a calm voice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast’s eyes grew grim. He regarded Sister Yun for a long time. Then, he extended a thumb to point at himself. “Sebast. What is your name?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No need for you to know.” Sister Yun shook her head. “Leave now. I will forget this ever happened.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Is that so?” After another moment of silence, Sebast suddenly laughed out. “It seems you have not heard of me. You also didn’t know… … I had killed Wu Ya.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Wu Ya?” Chen Xiaolian was shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That is right.” Seeing the look of shock on Chen Xiaolian’s face, a prideful expression appeared on Sebast’s face. “Now that we’re on that topic, I should thank you. If not because you had grievously wounded him, I would have no chance to suck his power…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian secretly tightened his fists.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He had failed to kill Wu Ya with an all-out attack with Skyblade’s power. Even after using the Overwhelming Sunlight Purification skill, which left him partially crippled, he was still unable to kill off Wu Ya.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Since obtaining Skyblade’s power, that was the first time Chen Xiaolian had faced off against an [S] class expert. However, even after doing all that, the result was merely heavy injuries on both sides.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Regardless if Sebast had absorbed Wu Ya’s strength to reach [S] class, the current Chen Xiaolian was likely incapable of facing off against Sebast.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Beside him…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian turned to look at Sister Yun, who maintained a look of indifference. “Who is Wu Ya? Sorry, I can’t remember the names of small fries.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast was momentarily taken aback. Next, he lifted his head and laughed out. “Enough! I do not know who you are. However, as an Irregularity in World’s End, you actually do not know the names of the [S] class experts here? Even if you are trying to put on an act, this is not the way to do it!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After saying that, Sebast stamped forward heavily until he stood before the gully that Sister Yun had made. One more step forward and he would have crossed the line. “I want to see what abilities you can use to kill me if I cross this line! Me, a powerful [S] class expert!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I do not know what the crap [S] class means. However, you say you are powerful?”</span></p>
