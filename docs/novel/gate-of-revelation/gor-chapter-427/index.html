 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 427 New Instance Dungeon</strong></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian stepped out of the training room.</p>
 <p>He had simulated the deserted island’s underground palace instance dungeon once more and went in for three days.</p>
 <p>After coming out, he saw that everyone had come together and were waiting at the central resting area.</p>
 <p>Even Roddy, who had shut himself inside the equipment warehouse to tinker away with the mechanical equipment, had come out.</p>
 <p>“Did something happen?” Chen Xiaolian saw the serious looks on everyone’s faces. Xia Xiaolei though, looked eager.</p>
 <p>Lun Tai snickered and took a step forward. “It seems our vacation may be over.”</p>
 <p>“Oh?” Chen Xiaolian was immediately able to understand what he meant.</p>
 <p>Soon, Lun Tai sent forward a system prompt to Chen Xiaolian through the guild channel.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian glanced through the contents and his eyes lit up. “Instance dungeon notification?”</p>
 <p>Lun Tai looked around and saw that everyone was looking at Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>He then spoke up slowly, “This morning, when we were on the island outside the base, we received this system prompt. Thus… … everyone has been awaiting your decision.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was silent. He walked to the side and found a chair to seat himself. Xia Xiaolei and Roddy quickly bounded over enthusiastically, one of them serving a cup while the other pouring water into the cup.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian turned to look at them. “Eh? You two? Ah, could it be you two wish to participate in this instance dungeon?”</p>
 <p>There was a slightly aggrieved look on Xia Xiaolei’s face. “Guild Leader, I have been left behind so many times, I almost feel like I don’t exist at all.”</p>
 <p>Roddy smiled and said, “I have configured the equipment that we obtained. Now, we finally have the chance to test them out.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian nodded his head and looked at everyone. “What do you all think?”</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao did not say anything, but Chen Xiaolian understood what her expression meant: <em>I will follow your decision</em>.</p>
 <p>Lun Tai contemplated in silence for a moment before speaking out in a very cautious manner, “Although this base allows us to avoid instance dungeons… … Xiaolian, I feel that staying in a safe place will not help in developing the guild and our members’ strength. I have checked the system prompt. The difficulty level for this instance dungeon is not too high, so we can consider participating in it to train our guild.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, he paused for a moment before continuing, “If this instance dungeon’s level of difficulty is high, I would never advocate going in. Since we have the capital, there is no need to take such a risk. However, I feel that this instance dungeon fits the criteria needed to train ourselves.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian nodded his head.</p>
 <p>He too, had seen the system prompt. This instance dungeon’s level was… [B] class.</p>
 <p>After making some calculations, it seemed as though this instance dungeon was the least difficult one among all those that their guild had faced thus far.</p>
 <p>But the thing that tempted Chen Xiaolian the most was this sentence in the system prompt.</p>
 <p>[This instance dungeon does not restrict the usage of modern firearms.]</p>
 <p>After reaching that line of thought, Chen Xiaolian nodded his head. “How long before this instance dungeon opens?”</p>
 <p>“We received this system prompt in the morning. It stated that we should arrive at the instance dungeon area by 48 hours. We still have 40 hours to go, plenty of time. After deducting the time taken for the trip, I believe we still have time to prepare our equipment.”</p>
 <p>Naturally, the one who answered him was Lun Tai. At present, everyone in the guild had come to regard Lun Tai as the second in command after Chen Xiaolian. In other words, he was the Deputy Guild Leader. Lun Tai was a veteran who was calm most of the time. He was also very loyal and the oldest among them. Thus, everyone was willing to take him as the Deputy Guild Leader and obeyed his orders whenever Chen Xiaolian was not around.</p>
 <p>“All right. I agree with everyone’s views. I believe we do need to train ourselves.” Chen Xiaolian considered it. “However… … there is a need to leave someone to look after our home.”</p>
 <p>Given Meteor Rock Guild’s present comprehensive assessment, they were allowed to send in up to 10 members for this [B] class instance dungeon… … they can send in everyone.</p>
 <p>Naturally, that was not Chen Xiaolian’s intention.</p>
 <p>“We must have someone stay behind in this island base. The things here are not complete. Additionally, we also want to make sure there are no spies. Thus, we need to leave someone behind.” Chen Xiaolian glanced at the others.</p>
 <p>Clearly, no one was willing to stay behind – perhaps the timid Qimu Xi was willing. However, Chen Xiaolian felt that someone like her was the most in need of going for training.</p>
 <p>“I’ll say this first, but I’m not staying behind! I have been left behind so many times I am pretty much suffocating to death!” Xia Xiaolei spoke up.</p>
 <p>“This instance dungeon allows the use of firearms. It is a natural fit for my Mechanical Heart skill. Additionally, I cannot be absent when we use our new equipment,” said Roddy.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian sighed.</p>
 <p>“If so…” He turned to look at Bei Tai.</p>
 <p>Bei Tai revealed a bitter smile of understanding. “Guild Leader… …”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian said patiently, “Soo Soo is still a little child. Although she is also an Awakened, it is not right to leave her to look after the base. Roddy’s skill is of the mechanical type. Since we are going to test out our new equipment, we will need him. As for Xiaolei… … he does indeed require training. Mm, the same is true for Qimu Xi. Qiao Qiao also faces the same issue, the lack of experience. She had been forced to stay in Zero City for too long. Thus… … you’ll have to bite the bullet this time, Bei Tai.”</p>
 <p>Bei Tai sighed. “… … all right… … I’ll stay.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian nodded his head. “Then, I will be assigning the tasks. Lun Tai, Roddy, you two are responsible for the arrangement of the equipment. Xia Xiaolei, you are responsible for preparing our medical supplies. Qiao Qiao, Qimu Xi, you two are responsible for preparing our daily supplies. Mm, this time, Bei Tai will be staying behind. Everyone, get ready, we will be leaving in 12 hours…”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Chen Xiaolian turned to Roddy. “This time… … we’ll be bringing out the Tidal Fighter! Roddy, you’ll be the pilot.”</p>
 <p>“No problem, leave it to me!” Roddy laughed out.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>The entrance to the residential complex…</p>
 <p>In the security booth, Tian Lie, who was holding onto a meal box, saw Nicole walking in.</p>
 <p>Tian Lie raised his head. There was no one else inside the security booth. He lowered his head, used a pair of chopsticks to clip a chicken drumstick and quickly said, “Give me a few minutes. When I’m done with this drumstick, we’ll go to the forest and fight.”</p>
 <p>Nicole suddenly revealed a smile.</p>
 <p>She looked at Tian Lie and said, “I am not here to fight you today.”</p>
 <p>“Mm?” Tian Lie was momentarily surprised.</p>
 <p>“Da Gang, I have been coming here every day and we have been fighting each other. Haven’t you had enough?” Nicole grunted. “You know all too well that we have our own reservations when fighting. Neither of us can go all out and we will always end up with a draw. Continuing our fight is pointless.”</p>
 <p>“So, what do you want?” Tian Lie retorted with a grunt.</p>
 <p>Nicole took a deep breath and faced Tian Lie with a serious expression. “Don’t think I am unaware… … truth is, Chen Xiaolian and the others had left you behind.”</p>
 <p>“… … …” Tian Lie did not say anything.</p>
 <p>“I had not gone anywhere far from here for the past few days and just stuck around. Thus, I am certain that Chen Xiaolian and his guild had not returned for a long time – I am not an idiot. How can I not figure out what is going on?”</p>
 <p>“Speak your mind then!” Tian Lie shook his head.</p>
 <p>“This is Chen Xiaolian’s home. Yet, they had not returned for so many days… … naturally, they would not have gone on a vacation. Clearly, they had abandoned this place and found another one. As for you… … you can no longer follow them. Simply put, they had left you behind. In that regard, you are no different compared to me.”</p>
 <p>Tian Lie finally laughed out.</p>
 <p>“You admit it?” Nicole was somewhat surprised.</p>
 <p>“Why not?” Tian Lie looked at Nicole. “I was left behind by them… … because to them, I am just an ordinary human. They are all part of an Awakened guild. Surely you understand what that means. As the intensity of their fight grows, they will be unable to live among the ordinary. They must have found a secret base for themselves. Thus, I am no longer capable of following them.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Tian Lie used his pair of chopsticks to point at Nicole. “But that does not mean I will just sit and watch while you spy on them.”</p>
 <p>“Eh?”</p>
 <p>“Unlike you; I have no intention of doing anything to Chen Xiaolian and the others. Let us be honest, if I did have any malicious intentions, I would have countless opportunities to harm them back when I was living with them. You on the other hand, I do not even know where you are from. Thus, I will not allow you to move about freely.”</p>
 <p>Nicole was silent for a full minute – only after Tian Lie had finished the chicken drumstick did Nicole open her mouth. “What if I tell you I have no malicious intentions?”</p>
 <p>“?” Tian Lie’s eyes lit up.</p>
 <p>“I can use a contract to prove it. Using the magical contract of the system to prove it,” Nicole said coolly. “Truth be told, I am trying to get close to them because… … of personal matters. There are some personal matters that I want to confirm.”</p>
 <p>Tian Lie threw the chicken drumstick into the trashcan and turned around. “Tell me why you are here.”</p>
 <p>“This morning, I received the system prompt for an instance dungeon,” said Nicole with a smile.</p>
 <p>Tian Lie remained silent. However, the corners of his eyes twitched slightly.</p>
 <p>Nicole noticed the subtle change and she smiled triumphantly. “Ah! It seems I was right to come! Da Gang, you did not receive the prompt for the instance dungeon, right?”</p>
 <p>“… … …”</p>
 <p>“The selection of participants for instance dungeons works by randomly selecting some Awakened ones who are in the same area. Clearly, the system had selected me while leaving you out. If I am not mistaken, Chen Xiaolian and his guild should be somewhere in this area as well. Thus, there is a high chance that they were selected as well.</p>
 <p>“In other words… … Da Gang, when I go participate in this instance dungeon, I might encounter Chen Xiaolian and his members.”</p>
 <p>“Get to the point. I hate beating around the bush, especially when a female is doing it.” Tian Lie pursed his lips to the side.</p>
 <p>Nicole looked straight into Tian Lie’s eyes and said, “A cooperation!”</p>
 <p>“Cooperation?”</p>
 <p>“A cooperation!” Nicole nodded her head. “Since we hold no ill will toward them, there is no need for us to fight each other. You want to get close to them, but you do not know the contents of this time’s instance dungeon… … I can tell you about it and bring you with me into the instance dungeon. Then… … after we enter the instance dungeon, we’ll cooperate.”</p>
 <p>“A temporary team?” Tian Lie smiled.</p>
 <p>“Correct. Consider it a temporary team,” said Nicole with a very serious tone. “We will get the opportunity to get closer and observe Chen Xiaolian’s team. Maybe we can change our appearances to make contact… … I will try to find the answers I am looking for while you go do whatever it is you want to do. How about it?”</p>
 <p>After a moment of silence, Tian Lie suddenly moved over and extended his hand.</p>
 <p>Nicole hesitated for a bit before reaching out with her hand. Then, the two of them shook hands.</p>
 <p>“So tell me, where is this instance dungeon at?”</p>
 <p>“A [B] class instance dungeon that does not restrict firearms. It is probably a modern technological type. At present, it is not possible to tell if any futuristic technologies are involved. However, considering the fact that it is a [B] class, some extraordinary level of technology is unlikely to appear. As for its location… …”</p>
 <p>Nicole frowned. “Jerusalem.”</p>
 <p>When Tian Lie heard that, he froze for a moment. Then, he laughed out while pointing at Nicole. “Ha ha ha ha! I know why you would find me for a cooperation! Now I believe that you hold no ill will against them! You ran all the way here because you are worried that they might be in danger. You want to ask for my help in protecting Chen Xiaolian and his team. Ha ha ha ha ha ha….”</p>
 <p>Nicole sighed. “It seems you know quite a bit as well.”</p>
 <p>“Of course.” Tian Lie sneered. “A [B] class instance dungeon is not that difficult. But… … … Jerusalem… … that is a dangerous place! In the Awakened circle, no one would be willing to provoke those fellows. How unexpected, the location for this instance dungeon that the system had arranged is those fellows’ territory? This is very interesting!”</p>
 <p>Nicole sighed again. “This is what I am worried about… the number of people who know about this is limited. When Chen Xiaolian and his guild see that this instance dungeon is only a [B] class, they might end up underestimating it.”</p>
 <p>Tian Lie’s eyes lit up. “You are right! Those fellows are all rookies. Ah, that Lun Tai and Bei Tai have some experience, but they are still weaklings. There is no way they would know of those fellows residing in the holy city. The number of Awakened ones who know of them are few and far between…”</p>
 <p>The thrill and glee on Tian Lie’s face gradually increased…</p>
