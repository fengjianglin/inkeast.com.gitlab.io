 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 607 Part 2 Tian Lie’s Request </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie looked down and saw whiteness beneath his feet. The white floor spread out to the horizon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The punk youngster was standing beside him while the red-haired woman from earlier was sitting cross-legged within the space.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“As expected, you weren’t watching what is going on outside. I believe you do not know what this kid said to me just now.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The red-haired woman ignored the punk youngster, choosing not to turn around at all. It would appear that she was sulking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Ignoring me?” The punk youngster smiled and shrugged. He turned to look at Tian Lie before turning his attention back to the red-haired woman. “It seems you have no interest at all in Zero City’s disappearance.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The red-haired woman had been seated cross-legged some distance away. However, without making any move, she suddenly appeared before the punk youngster.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Come again? Zero City disappeared?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I am not the one who said it. He was the one who told me about it.” The punk youngster shrugged once more and pointed at Tian Lie.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The red-haired woman regarded Tian Lie in a hesitant manner. “You say Zero City has disappeared… … just what has happened?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“To be exact, Zero City did not disappear, it has fallen,” said Tian Lie calmly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Nonsense!” The red-haired woman scoffed. “You don’t even know what Zero City is! That is an independent system! Within Zero City, the main control system possesses an authority equivalent to that of the system’s GM! How could it become compromised? It is impossible for the system’s Electronic Guardians to even find its entrance point!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie spread open his hands. He did not say anything. Instead, he calmly looked at the red-haired woman.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Enough, I believe there is no need for us to question that now.” The punk youngster sighed and continued, “Let him finish first.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After saying that, the punk youngster turned toward Tian Lie and said, “Tell us what you know, all of it, no matter how minor it may seem.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie revealed a wry smile and shook his head. “Due to certain reasons, I do not know much. Only two things are certain – Zero City has fallen and Thorned Flower Guild has split due to Shen’s disappearance.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You are certain that Shen’s disappearance is related to Zero City’s fall?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie shook his head. “No. However, I managed to make contact with several Awakened members of Thorned Flower Guild. According to them, Shen was last seen leading the Player members of the guild to complete a system quest: The siege of Zero City. After that, he was never seen again.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“By assembling every Player… add the system’s Electronic Guardians in, strength wise, taking down Zero City does not seem like an impossibility. Besides, the one leading them is Shen…” The punk youngster mumbled to himself. “However, the location of the entrance to Zero City is ever changing. Additionally, there is also the internal defensive mechanism. How could the system issue out a Player quest with Zero City’s entrance location?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I am not sure about that. I can only be certain that Zero City was indeed attacked. The other combatants who had followed Shen in were all teleported out of Zero City – those that were not killed in combat anyways.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Those who attacked Zero City were teleported out… …” The punk youngster pondered the matter. “If so, what about the people within Zero City?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Who knows?” Tian Lie shrugged. “All of Zero City’s contact personnel within the outside world are unable to contact their superior. However, I think… … it is unlikely that all of them had died.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It really is… … interesting.” The punk youngster turned to look at the red-haired woman, who had remained silent all this time. “I believe you feel the same.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The red-haired woman sent a glance at the punk youngster and said, “It seems that Shen is trapped in Zero City.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The punk youngster nodded in assent. “That is the only possibility. The only question is… … who could possess the ability to trap him within Zero City. Could it be…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Before he could finish his words, the red-haired woman shook her head. “You mean that San? Impossible. He had once vowed never to interfere in matters related to Zero City anymore. Besides… to trap Shen? Since neither of us can do it, he will be no different.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That is true… I am growing even more intrigued now.” The punk youngster smiled. “You see, such an interesting incident is a rare occurrence. It won’t do to miss this situation with Shen.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The red-haired woman nodded her head and said lackadaisically, “Makes sense.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A look of joy suddenly appeared on the punk youngster’s face. “Good. When do we set off?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“We?” The red-haired woman abruptly rolled her eyes and said, “All I said was, your words made sense. When did I say I will be going with you? It doesn’t matter if you just want to join in the fun, or if you want to save Shen; if you want to go, just go. What does that have to do with me?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The punk youngster’s throat froze and he grew speechless as he stared at the red-haired woman. After a long time, he sighed and shook his head. “Fine, you win. I will stay behind and accompany you in this game of attrition. Let’s see who will win.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After saying that, the punk youngster turned to Tian Lie and spread his hands. “Negotiation failed. It seems Shen will have to fend for himself.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie frowned as the punk youngster turned away. Stunned, he said, “You do not want to save Shen?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The punk youngster turned to look at Tian Lie. Giving him a rueful smile, he said, “It is not that I do not want to. Rather, I cannot. If she doesn’t leave, I have no way of leaving as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie shook his head. “I do not understand.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The punk youngster turned to give the red-haired woman a glance, the same rueful smile on his face. “This woman… … back then, we had obtained the authority to this instance dungeon together. I believe you have already witnessed just how much control the two of us possess within this instance dungeon.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Within this instance dungeon…” Tian Lie considered. “You two are omnipotent, practically like the system itself.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Correct.” The punk youngster nodded. “However, there is a problem. Back then, due to certain reasons, the two of us obtained this instance dungeon and equally split the authority here. The two of us feel… feel very resentful. I mean, really, really, resentful!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You might be thinking that the relationship between us two is pretty good, right? Wrong. A long, long time ago, we were indeed friends. It was not just us two, there was also Shen and… … several other bizarre weirdoes. However, due to certain circumstances, we all went our separate ways. Some of us remain friends, some became like strangers, some felt disgusted at some others, some… mm, want to kill each other as soon as they meet.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You two…” Tian Lie looked at the red-haired woman.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mm… me and her, we haven’t exactly gotten to the point where we would want to kill each other. However, be it me or her, neither one of us wants to live with the other in this instance dungeon. Even more importantly, however, neither of us wants to share the authority over this instance dungeon with the other.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Throughout the many years, we have come to know everything about this instance dungeon. The instant one of us leaves this instance dungeon, the remaining one will be able to quickly seize the other half’s authority over this instance dungeon, kicking the other one out completely. Thus…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The punk youngster sighed. “For so many years, the two of us have been restraining each other, staying within this instance dungeon and having the other trapped inside like within a prison.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie looked at the punk youngster before turning to look at the red-haired woman, who gave off a frosty atmosphere. He smiled wryly and said, “When you put it that way, you really have no way of following me out to save Shen.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Although I do owe Shen quite the favour… … it is not to the point where I can give up this instance dungeon.” The punk youngster spread his hands and said, “However… … if you really want to help him, I am not completely without a solution.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What solution?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You go!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
