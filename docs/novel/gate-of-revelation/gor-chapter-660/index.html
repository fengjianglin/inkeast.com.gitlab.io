 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 660 Suicidal Attack </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian carried Bluesea on his shoulder as he hastily ran down the mountain with Qiao Qiao.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was a zig-zagging path. The closer they get to the foot of the mountain, the longer the straight section of the winding path. As Chen Xiaolian reached the first corner, he saw that their pursuers had made it to the entrance leading to the mountain path.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Damn it! They are faster than us!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As Chen Xiaolian ran, he turned to face Qiao Qiao, who was running beside him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I know.” Qiao Qiao nodded her head. “Do you have any mode of transport?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Previously, we did find a Devourer fighter aircraft, but it was destroyed.” Chen Xiaolian clenched his teeth. Then, using the Sword in the Stone, he swung at the cliff in a haphazard manner. As he was running forward, sizable rocks fell down to obstruct the mountain path.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That won’t stop them.” Qiao Qiao shook her head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Every second counts! Delay them so that Zhao Yun can meet up with us.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Zhao Yun?” Qiao Qiao was stunned to hear that name. However, Chen Xiaolian pulled her forward. “Don’t stop! She is the companion I was talking about earlier! She is currently drawing their main force away.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You are certain she will come to provide support?” asked Qiao Qiao with a frown.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If you witnessed her killing an [S] class expert before, you will also… … be careful!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian leapt up. Next, he twisted his body 180 degrees while still in mid-air. Then, his hands, which were gripping the Sword in the Stone, swung to smash an arrow beam away. When his feet landed on the ground, he continued running down and said, “You will also be as confident as I am.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I fear we won’t be able to hold on until then.” Qiao Qiao sighed. “The lower we go, the longer the straight section becomes. Besides, they are slowly catching up. Why don’t we…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Fight head on?” The two of them finally made it past another corner and were able to temporarily hide from their pursuers view. Chen Xiaolian looked at Bluesea, who was resting on his shoulders. With a heavy face, he shook his head. “He is still unconscious. As we need to care for him, I fear we may not be able to deal with them successfully. Unless…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Using the Sword in the Stone’s skill?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes.” Chen Xiaolian hesitated for a moment as he looked at the mountain path before him. “But it has a cooldown time of 24 hours while there are only 18 or so hours before we get to return. If we use it here, we will have no more cards to play later.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I know.” Qiao Qiao gritted her teeth and said, “But do you have any other plan?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… no.” Chen Xiaolian grew silent for a moment. Sighing, he turned to look at the edge of the winding path behind him. The figures of the two Irregularities pursuing them had appeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Both the silver longbowman and the Sentinel mech had stopped firing at them. Instead, they focused on giving chase.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It would appear that they, too, have realized that long-ranged attacks were insufficient to kill Chen Xiaolian’s group.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At the same time, it meant that they were confident in their melee capabilities.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Let’s do it! On the next turn!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian and Qiao Qiao exchanged glances and nodded to each other.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After making the turn, Qiao Qiao immediately transformed into a black shadow once more and slowly descended into the ground. As for Chen Xiaolian, he continued running forward until he was a few hundred metres ahead. There, he placed Bluesea behind a statue, hiding him from view, before turning to rush back toward the corner.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Not far away from the corner were another two statues, one on either side. Chen Xiaolian hid himself behind one of them and silently waited for their pursuers arrival.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Sword in the Stone’s skill could only be used once. Chen Xiaolian was hoping that he could preserve the skill instead of using it now.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, if it really came down to it, he would have to use it for this fight. He may even… … have to use the Overwhelming Sunlight Purification once more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian closed his eyes as he positioned his ears to the side, straining them to listen to the sound of the incoming footsteps. They were growing louder and closer. He carefully pulled out the spear that Sister Yun had given him from his back. He then grasped the spear handle with both hands.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Listening to the sound of their pursuers’ footsteps, Chen Xiaolian was able to roughly judge where they were.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At that very moment, they had reached the end of their straight section. They will be appearing through this corner soon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian’s heart thumped heavily as his hands tightened their grip on the spear handle. In the very next instant, he will be initiating his attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, at that very moment, the sound of footsteps suddenly stopped.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian was surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It may have been possible for the silver longbowman to lessen the sound from his footsteps. However, there was no way the heavy footsteps from the Sentinel mech could just disappear. Unless it had stopped moving.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Wait…</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Sentinel mech?!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Damn it!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Qiao Qiao! Be careful!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian kicked the ground with both feet and dodged to the side. As his body was flying through the air, an electromagnetic blast pierced through the thick mountain wall before destroying the statue that Chen Xiaolian was hiding behind just moments before.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The moment he jumped, Chen Xiaolian recalled that Sentinel mechs had radars on them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The mountain wall could block their line of sight. However, could it block the Sentinel mech’s radar detection ability?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Qiao Qiao, who had transformed into a black shadow, and was moving underground, was also affected by the shockwaves from the electromagnetic blast. With a wretched cry, she flew out from underground. Her face pale, she turned to glance at Chen Xiaolian once before entering her Anti-materialization form once more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although the Child of Darkness skill allowed her to dematerialize her body, she was still not completely immune to energy-based weaponry.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At the same time that Chen Xiaolian had jumped away, the silver longbowman made his way through the opening on the wall that the Sentinel mech had created with lightning-like speed. Turning his body sideways, he pulled his bowstring.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Despite only pulling the bowstring once, he shot out five arrow beams. Each of the arrow beams were inferior in strength compared to his previous arrow beams, but all of them were aimed at five areas on Chen Xiaolian’s body while cutting off all dodging possibilities.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When Chen Xiaolian’s feet landed on the ground, he did not duck to either his left or his right. Instead, he clenched his teeth and charged forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Three of the arrow beams missed while the other two grazed his waist and his thigh, leaving deep, bloody scars on him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At the same time, Chen Xiaolian unleashed the Demon King of Confusion’s Triple War Axe.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Head Cleaver.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The skill was practically the first melee skill that Chen Xiaolian acquired and was only [B] class. Still, having used it so many times, Chen Xiaolian had become proficient in it to the point where he could grasp the underlying principles of the moves.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>While the skill was an axe technique, it was also a pole weapon technique. Thus, Chen Xiaolian was still able to easily execute the skill using a spear.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When the silver longbowman moved to confront Chen Xiaolian’s move, his face remained emotionless. Raising his longbow, he moved the bow tip up to meet Chen Xiaolian’s attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Impish Teeth Displacer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Ear Gouger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian continued executing the next two moves, but all of them were blocked by the longbowman.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As they were so close, Chen Xiaolian finally got to lay his eyes on the longbow in the Irregularity’s hands.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The longbow was completely silver and white in colour. The length of the longbow was the equivalent to that of an ordinary human’s height. On the middle section of the longbow were countless symbols, but there was no way for him to grasp what was inscribed there.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Affixed upon either end of the longbow was a slender single-edged blade. A chilling light reflected off the surface of the blades.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even though the spear that Sister Yun had created using her skill was not on the same level as the Sword in the Stone, it was definitely not some common good. Yet, after clashing against the spear a few times, no mark could be seen on the surface of the longbow.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing as the longbowman had dared to rush so close, it naturally meant that he was confident that his melee capabilities were not inferior to his marksmanship.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After blocking Chen Xiaolian’s Three War Axes, the longbowman revealed a sneer as he swiftly swung his longbow forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>So fast!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian was shocked. He jerked his head to the side, barely avoiding the single-edged blade on the longbow. Although the blade had not made contact with his cheek, a shallow scar had still appeared on his cheek.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The longbowman was not done with his attack. He swung the longbow to the right and the bowstring swept toward Chen Xiaolian’s neck.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Looking at the bowstring, which was as fine as a strand of hair, Chen Xiaolian was well aware of what would happen if he were cut by it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian jerked down his head, his movement speed suddenly doubling, allowing him to avoid the cutting attack from the bowstring by a hair’s breadth. Then…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The spear slid backward quickly before shooting out from his waist like a venomous snake.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Charging Stinger skill!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although Chen Xiaolian had yet to fully recover his attributes after utilizing the Overwhelming Sunlight Purification skill, utilizing the skill allowed his Agility attribute to instantly rise to [B+] class, regardless of the amount of Agility he possessed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Clearly, the longbowman had not expected the sudden increase in movement speed from Chen Xiaolian. Caught off guard by Chen Xiaolian’s move, the longbowman frantically raised his longbow to take on the incoming spear tip. Although it was an awkward looking move, he had still managed to use the longbow to stop Chen Xiaolian’s spear attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The spear tip accurately lodged itself into the hollow point at the end of the longbow. With a furious yank, Chen Xiaolian sent both the spear and the longbow flying to the side even as his hand moved to grab the Sword in the Stone. He then sent a decapitating swing at the longbowman’s neck.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, the longbowman’s reaction was in no way inferior to Chen Xiaolian’s. He slapped his waist, causing a dagger to shoot out. He then grabbed it with a backhanded move before using it to block the sword swing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The dagger looked ordinary and plain, a dark black dagger. However, it was clearly a high-grade weapon. Even after clashing against the Sword in the Stone 10 plus times, it remained unbroken.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At the same time, his skill with the dagger was insidious to the extreme. Going all out, he attempted to attack Chen Xiaolian’s chest. Every one of his attacks came from impossible angles. Faced with those attacks, Chen Xiaolian was momentarily forced to retreat.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, an inch longer was an inch stronger. His Sword in the Stone had a longer reach compared to the dagger. In but moments, Chen Xiaolian had managed to stabilize his position. Then, he began his counter attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Suddenly, another electromagnetic blast tore yet another hole on the mountain wall. The Sentinel mech pounced through the hole to land behind Chen Xiaolian as it sent a serrated warblade hacking down on him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Sentinel mech was none other than the one that Chen Xiaolian had seen when he first entered Zero City. A Mark MK1 mech, the most basic version. It did not have any flight equipment installed. There was only a minigun on its left arm, two miniature flame throwers on both its shoulder, an electromagnetic blaster, and an alloy-made serrated warblade on its right arm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This time, Chen Xiaolian was the one caught off guard. He frantically dodged to the right while swinging the Sword in the Stone to meet the incoming serrated warblade.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The serrated warblade was broken from the clash. However, the Sentinel mech had already turned the miniature flame throwers to aim downward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The moment the Sentinel mech charged through the mountain wall, the longbowman had jumped backward, leaving the Sentinel mech to deal with Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing that the Sentinel mech had the flamethrower directed at the ground beneath it, Chen Xiaolian screamed to himself: <em>Not good!</em> However, he was given no opportunities to move away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Hot greenish blue flames sprayed onto the ground, engulfing the whole area around it, Chen Xiaolian and the mech along with it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>That was, a suicidal attack!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
