 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 412 WTF?!</strong></p>
 <p>The dragon’s roar was one filled with excitement.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian on the other hand, curiously inspected the lizard like creature that was on Jacob’s palm.</p>
 <p>Jacob licked his lips and looked at Chen Xiaolian. Then, he suddenly took a step back as he gently placed the dragon on the ground.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian regarded Jacob’s actions inquisitively. Then, he suddenly asked in a loud voice, “Hey! Is that dragon your pet?”</p>
 <p>Jacob looked at Chen Xiaolian, a frown on his face. “You don’t know who I am?”</p>
 <p>“Should I know you?” Chen Xiaolian smiled.</p>
 <p>Jacob’s face turned extremely cold.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian considered his words and spoke out once more. “What I mean is… does this decisive battle allow the use of pets? There are no restrictions?”</p>
 <p>Jacob was enraged. “Pet? This is no ordinary pet! Brat! You actually do not know of me, the great Jacob?! What a farce, to think that there are still people in Zero City who do now know my name!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian stared at Jacob before letting out a smile. “Bro, you know those words are a standard FLAG, right?”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Jacob then ignored Chen Xiaolian. He abruptly spread out both arms and his body swiftly transformed into a sphere of black coloured smoke! The black smoke sphere then flowed into the dragon’s body.</p>
 <p>What followed was a dragon’s roar, which brought pain to Chen Xiaolian’s ears.</p>
 <p>The lizard that was only as big as a hand promptly expanded in size!</p>
 <p>Excited cheers and clamour erupted from the grandstands, especially that of the Knights of Darkness Guild area. Quite a number of them cast eager looks at the swiftly expanding dragon!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s eyes widened as he rapidly retreated.</p>
 <p>He had a very grim look on his face!</p>
 <p>He had witnessed Jacob’s might before!</p>
 <p>It was back in the little town inside the punishment instance dungeon!</p>
 <p>This fellow had used this power to force an entire guild into a desperate situation!</p>
 <p>Jacob had fought Phoenix’s yellow-robed warrior and swept the floor with it. It had also badly mauled Roddy’s [A+] class Mech! Naturally, there was a time limit to Roddy’s usage of his Mech that placed Roddy in a disadvantageous position.</p>
 <p>However, that was still enough to prove Jacob’s might!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian rapidly retreated!</p>
 <p>The dragon’s body was colossal in size. When its true form was finally revealed, Chen Xiaolian appeared ridiculously small in comparison.</p>
 <p>There was a distance of over 20 metres between them.</p>
 <p>The colossal dragon whose body was covered in red scales raised his head to the sky and roared. Searing dragon flames shot out from his mouth and soared to the sky. The force field around the arena quickly blocked its ascent, stopping it from reaching the grandstands!</p>
 <p>The dragon roared again and the members of the other guilds on the grandstands entered a state of frenzy as they howled, “Kill him! Kill that brat from Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild! Jacob, kill him!”</p>
 <p>The colossal dragon released a maniacal laugh. Then, he lowered his head to look at Chen Xiaolian, who appeared like an ant in comparison. Next, it spoke in the human language, “Brat! Show me your powers! That power capable of killing an [A] class Awakened!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian flicked Skyblade that he was wielding and raised his head to shout, “Jacob! Tell me one thing!”</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>“In the punishment instance dungeon, you faced the young woman known as Phoenix and the old Japanese man. What happened to them?”</p>
 <p>Jacob appeared stunned. His dragon eyes stared at Chen Xiaolian for a long time before he finally let out a laugh.</p>
 <p>“I recognize you, brat! In the punishment instance dungeon… you were there!”</p>
 <p>It would be more accurate to say that Jacob had not recognized Chen Xiaolian just now.</p>
 <p>It was not a mistake on his part, but rather… … he was too prideful!</p>
 <p>The fights occurring back in the punishment instance dungeon were chaotic. Back then, the main powerhouses fighting against Jacob was Phoenix’s yellow-robed warrior…</p>
 <p>And Roddy’s Mech.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian who was already in a weakened state was simply unable to contribute much – defeating that Feral Tiger Angel had consumed the last of Chen Xiaolian’s skills.</p>
 <p>Thus, to Jacob, Chen Xiaolian had appeared as nothing more than a negligible fellow.</p>
 <p>Jacob’s attention was on the Mech that had given him so much problems and the young woman who could control the yellow-robed warrior.</p>
 <p>As for Chen Xiaolian? Jacob had long since forgotten how he looked like.</p>
 <p>Now, hearing those words from Chen Xiaolian made Jacob recall him – a passer-by that was in the ruins of the little town.</p>
 <p>A passer-by who could only fetch the soya sauce back then had now become an expert capable of killing off an [A] class expert. This was shocking to Jacob!</p>
 <p>“Brat! If you had such powers, why didn’t you use it back then?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian did not answer him. He continued asking, “What happened to the woman and the old man?”</p>
 <p>“You want to know? Ha ha!” Jacob laughed loudly. “Before killing you, I will make sure to tell you!”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Jacob unleashed a flaming dragon breath at Chen Xiaolian!</p>
 <p>For the miniscule Chen Xiaolian, the flaming dragon breath coming his way appeared more like a towering wall of flames!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian propelled his body back. At the same time, he hacked down with Skyblade!</p>
 <p>A ringing sound rang out and a golden beam of light shot out, striking the flaming breath head on and blocking its advance!</p>
 <p>The flames spread everywhere, but Chen Xiaolian was able to retreat safely under the protection of the golden light.</p>
 <p>“Hold on for half a minute, kid!”</p>
 <p>Skyblade’s voice entered his ear.</p>
 <p>“What? What do you mean half a minute?” Chen Xiaolian retorted furiously.</p>
 <p>Skyblade replied, his voice filled with ridicule. “Nonsense! Do you think my Skyblade skill can be casually used? Do you think there would be no cool down for this ultimate move?”</p>
 <p>If not for fear of being discovered, Chen Xiaolian would had cursed out!</p>
 <p><em>Cool down time?</em></p>
 <p><em>Why didn’t you bloody tell me earlier oyy?</em></p>
 <p>He quickly backed away. However, his disadvantage quickly revealed itself.</p>
 <p>Although the competition arena was very large, as large as two stadiums combined…</p>
 <p>The colossal dragon's body was too big!</p>
 <p>Despite the vastness of the competition arena, the appearance of this gargantuan monster had limited Chen Xiaolian’s ability to move around!</p>
 <p>He quickly retreated. However, Jacob’s mouth continued firing out one flaming dragon breath after another.</p>
 <p>He was extremely cunning! Although his flaming dragon breaths were all been blocked off by Skyblade, Jacob did not reveal any signs of panic. His dragon breaths swept up and down, little by little, they reduced the space available for Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>After dodging several more times, Chen Xiaolian finally found himself in a corner!</p>
 <p>“How much longer?!”</p>
 <p>“10 more seconds! Just hold on a little longer!” Skyblade replied coolly.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian held back the desire to puke blood.</p>
 <p>The golden light that Skyblade was emitting was capable of blocking off the flaming dragon breath. However, the colossal dragon itself had descended upon him!</p>
 <p>Swish!</p>
 <p>The dragon’s tail swiped forward, smashing Chen Xiaolian who was in the middle of the air.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian used Skyblade to block the tail swipe. In the final moment, golden light shone out to form a defensive power around Chen Xiaolian. If not for that, Chen Xiaolian would had suffered from a direct hit.</p>
 <p>Despite that, Chen Xiaolian’s body was still sent flying. His flying body was stopped by an invisible force field and was sent flying back the other way. His body then slammed down heavily against the ground. Thrusting the blade down the ground, he was barely able to prop himself up.</p>
 <p>The cool down time for Skyblade’s ultimate skill had yet to end!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian watched as Jacob turned around and his mind raced in search for a method.</p>
 <p>He decided against sending his Four-eyed War Cats out almost immediately.</p>
 <p>Summoning Four-eyed War Cats when facing this gargantuan monster was practically him begging for a beating.</p>
 <p>The Goddess of Dawn?</p>
 <p>No… Chen Xiaolian was clear about his own attributes… even if they were all combusted… kill off an [A+] class expert? The chances of that was too low.</p>
 <p>If so…</p>
 <p>A determined look flashed across Chen Xiaolian’s face!</p>
 <p>“Come out! Bai Qi!”</p>
 <p>A flash of white light!</p>
 <p>Bai Qi’s figure appeared before Chen Xiaolian, his hair black and his clothes white. In his hand was the translucent short sword.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian regarded Bai Qi from the back. For some unknown reason, he suddenly felt that this fellow, whom he had not summoned in a while, had seemingly… … become somewhat different compared to before?</p>
 <p>After a more careful assessment… Chen Xiaolian determined one thing.</p>
 <p>He was different!</p>
 <p>Bai Qi’s height!</p>
 <p>He appeared higher than before!</p>
 <p>Seeing a white clothed man appear before Chen Xiaolian, Jacob paused for a moment before laughing. “What is this? A human-shaped pet? Brat! You sure have some tricks up your sleeve!”</p>
 <p>After saying that, the colossal dragon raised his claw and swiped down toward Bai Qi!</p>
 <p>With a swooshing sound, Bai Qi’s figure disappeared. In the next instant, he reappeared in the middle of the air!</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“So fast!”</p>
 <p>Nicole who was seated in the grandstands was unable to stop herself from giving a low whistle.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Bai Qi had appeared in the middle of the air all of a sudden. However, Jacob’s response was not slow either! His dragon tail swiped over!</p>
 <p>Bai Qi disappeared once more! This time, he reappeared at the tip of the dragon’s tail. His feet gave a gentle tap and his body vaulted through the air before touching down on the other side of the competition arena.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian looked at Bai Qi and shouted, “Finish it!”</p>
 <p>Bai Qi’s seemingly expressionless face turned and he looked at the mountain like colossal dragon. Then, a fiery light suddenly shone out from those pair of eyes.</p>
 <p>“… so powerful, so vast… … what a powerful life force!!!”</p>
 <p>Jacob chose to ignore this ‘human-shaped pet’. After two of his attacks had missed, he lost interest in fighting Bai Qi. Ignoring Bai Qi, he rushed toward Chen Xiaolian!</p>
 <p>In his opinion, Bai Qi was merely a pet. The objective should be to kill Chen Xiaolian!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian used both hands to hold Skyblade, his feet furiously backing away. The colossal dragon roared loudly and rushed forward…</p>
 <p>It was at that moment…</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian, with both hands wielding Skyblade, was about to hack down with all his might…</p>
 <p>The colossal dragon’s body suddenly stumbled!</p>
 <p>Despite the vast momentum behind his charge, Jacob’s massive body had stumbled!</p>
 <p>He furiously turned around to check only to find out that the white clothed ‘human-shaped pet’, had at some unknown point in time, grabbed hold of his tail with a hug!</p>
 <p>Bai Qi forcefully tugged the dragon tail, causing Jacob’s colossal body to be pulled backward!</p>
 <p>The grandstands did not even have the opportunity to let out shouts of surprise before Bai Qi took his next set of actions; one that caused everyone present to become dumbfounded!</p>
 <p>Bai Qi held the dragon tail by force. Next, he abruptly opened his mouth and heavily…</p>
 <p>CHOMP!</p>
 <p>“W! T! F!” Jacob promptly issued out a wretched howl and his colossal dragon body twitched violently!</p>
