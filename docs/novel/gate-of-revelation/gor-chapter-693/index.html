 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 693 The Ultimate Path </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The battle between Shen and Chris raged on.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although Shen was clearly far stronger than Chris, he was unable to utterly defeat Chris within such a short span of time.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chris possessed the Flash Bow of Ketu-Rahu, Moonless Fivefold Light Armour, Tearlight Crystal on his person. Although those items were insufficient to close up the difference in strength between him and Shen, it did allow him to continue holding his own against Shen, albeit barely.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen had noticed it as well. From the very beginning, Chris had never intended to kill him at all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chris had been constantly avoiding any real confrontation with Shen, attempting to create a distance between himself and Shen before using the Flash Bow of Ketu-Rahu to pin him down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Whenever Shen closed the distance between the them, Chris would do his best to find an opportunity to create some distance between them once again, even if it meant paying a certain amount of price.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Since their fight began, Chris had taken eight of Shen’s punches and three of his golden-coloured beams. Even though the Moonless Fivefold Light Armour was a Godlike armour, it had taken a considerable amount of damage.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Furthermore, it was clear that the wounds on Chris’ body was worse compared to the damage taken by the Moonless Fivefold Light Armour.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>And yet, he continued to struggle with everything he had to continue the fight. It was as though he was…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Waiting for something.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Chris! What is your master’s order?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen flicked his right hand out and a golden-coloured beam was condensed out before transforming into the illusory silhouette of a sword. Next, it shot toward a piece of the palace fragment within the void.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chris had jumped upon that piece of palace fragment and was about to pull the bowstring when he saw the golden-coloured sword shooting his way. Both his legs kicked out and he jumped toward another piece of palace fragment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As for the palace fragment that he was on, it was destroyed by the sword beam.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, after having escaped the sword beam, Chris found himself facing Shen’s incoming fist. Gritting his teeth, he brought his bow forward, positioning the bowstring before Shen as he pushed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Fist and bowstring collided. Then, both Chris and the bow were sent flying from the resulting impact. Only after smashing through several palace fragments within the void did Chris’ figure come to a halt.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The pair of silver wings on his back flapped furiously, granting him the ability to hover within the void. He gasped for a bit and his face turned red. Finally, he was no longer capable of holding it back and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen stood upon another palace fragment. He was no longer pursuing Chris. Instead, he said coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“He is coming, isn’t he?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chris wiped the edges of his lips with the back of his hand. Then, he extended out his tongue to slowly lick the back of his hand before revealing a smile. However, he did not respond to Shen’s question.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His left hand continued gripping the Flash Bow of Ketu-Rahu. However, seeing that Shen was not making any moves, he too, did not attempt to pull the bowstring to fire at Shen. All he did was to stare intently at Shen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Forget it. I do not need you to answer it. I can guess the answer myself,” said Shen with a faint smile on his face. “He should already know. Even by giving you those three items, there is no way for you to stop me. What he wishes from you is to slow me down for a bit so that he can rush here.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chris pulled out a small medicinal pill from his chest and stuffed it into his mouth. Slowly, he chewed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“All these years, I thought you had kicked the bucket. As for your master, he never mentioned you at all,” continued Shen with a smile. “How unexpected, he had left you in Thirty-three Heavens to guard his stage. To be capable of enduring such a lengthy period of solitude, I feel admiration toward you. I believe… … he must have left you in there for a very long time, no?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing that Chris had no intentions of responding, Shen waved his hand lightly as he continued, “No need to be anxious. The way I see it, even if he sets off immediately, he could not appear here so quickly. We still have plenty of time for a good chat. I am not even worried about losing time, why should you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What do you want to talk about?” Chris hesitated for a moment before speaking, his voice sounding out of breath.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen sat down cross-legged on the ground of the palace fragment. “Firstly, I want to know when did he change the guardian of the stage to you? Don’t refuse my question, Chris. You know as well, having time to recover strength is more beneficial for you. You answer my question and I will give you time to recover. This is a very fair deal.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chris considered it before slowly nodding his head. “… … 32 years ago.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Thirty-two years ago, mm…” Hearing Chris’ answer, Shen closed his eyes. Only after some time had passed did he slowly open them. “I understand. If so, when he let you return to Thirty-three Heavens, did he tell you anything important?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“For me, everything the master tells me is important. Sir Shen, this question of yours is very idiotic.” Chris gave a snort.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“For example… … matters regarding things like ‘angels’ or ‘wings’?” Shen’s eyes stared intently at Chris through the vast expanse of the void.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No.” This time, Chris had answered him frankly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen was silent for a moment before nodding his head. “Makes sense. Even if he finds out something so important, he will never inform you. My next question, when he left you in the stage, besides holding me up, did he order you to do anything else?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chris shook his head. “That was all. Other than you, all other highest authority holders may freely pass.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What about them then?” Shen knitted his brows and pointed at Tian Lie and Nicole, who were far within the hall of the Longevity Palace. “Those two do not possess the highest authority. Given your level of strength, there is no way they could make it past you. Why did you allow them to pass?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Because the most important thing is to not let you make contact with the core of Longevity Palace. Zero had informed me of your return to Thirty-three Heaven.” Chris’ complexion was looking slightly better. It would appear that the pill he took earlier was taking effect. “Originally, I had thought that they could do something. Unfortunately, that girl is too weak while the bald guy has no intention of going against you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“In other words, your master simply does not want me and me alone to get the Oddity? That is discrimination.” Shen smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Do you have any other questions?” Chris took a deep breath and his right hand gripped the bowstring once more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Questions… there are no more. However, I do have one thing to tell you,” said Shen with a smile as he shook his head. “When your master left you here, he must have told you that although you cannot defeat me with those three items, you should be able to hold me up until he arrives, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That is what I am doing,” said Chris grimly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You have been holding me up for so long earlier. Right now, you must be having the delusional thought that you can hold me up until he arrives, right?” Shen stretched a finger out and wiggled it left and right. “Regretfully, I will have to inform you that both of you are wrong.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chris’ face sank and his right hand abruptly pulled the bowstring. However, he had just finished pulling the bowstring when he saw a finger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was the same finger that Shen had stretched out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At that moment, there were hundreds of metres between the two palace fragments that the two of them were standing on. Shen’s finger had not grown longer, neither did the place he was standing on. However, just by pressing that finger forward, the tip of his finger seemingly pierced through space itself to arrive before Chris.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His fingertip lightly tapped the bow.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When Shen tapped it, the bow that had been pulled into the shape of a full moon, suddenly broke apart.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was as though thunder itself had suddenly erupted. Chris, who had been exerting his hands to pull the bow, lost his grip. At the same time, white light suddenly burst out from the cracks appearing on the bow before enveloping Chris.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The white light was so dazzling that the darkness of the void was immediately illuminated into an expanse of whiteness.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Damn it!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie’s face grew contorted and he kicked himself toward Nicole, who remained immobile on the floor. Positioning himself before her, he spread open both his hands to protect her.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At the same time, his body lost its colour as it transformed into a clump of ceaselessly flowing metallic stream of data.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After the white light faded away, a burst of energy wave suddenly broke out with Chris at its centre, spreading out in every direction.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Under the might of the expanding wave of energy, the palace fragment that Chris had been standing on was reduced to ashes. The palace fragments that were farther away were also affected and countless smaller fragments were torn off the surface of the surrounding palace fragments before drifting off into the void.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>By the time, the energy wave spread to the Longevity Palace, it had grown much weaker. Even then, the pillars and eaves of the Longevity Palace were shaken as a result.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing the Longevity Palace shake, Zero sighed and shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie gnashed his teeth and expanded his body as much as he could to protect Nicole. The metallic streams of data on the surface of his body began to disintegrate, seemingly under the assault of countless sharp blades.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The energy wave swept over them in an instant and continued to spread farther away even as it continued to weaken.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The surface of the white jade tiles of the palace had been devastated. A whole layer had been practically stripped out from the floor. Only the place that Tian Lie had been standing on had a small number of undamaged tiles.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nicole, who was lying within the shadow casted by Tian Lie’s body stared in disbelief with widened eyes at Tian Lie.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At present, Tian Lie’s body had become several times smaller compared to before. With a flow of light, the lustre of metal disappeared from his body and he regained his normal colour.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He turned around to look at Nicole.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nicole, who was incapable of speaking, could only look at Tian Lie quietly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie crouched down, still looking at Nicole. He suddenly broke into a grin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Are you feeling moved? Seeing me dash in to protect you, did you feel moved? Mm… … like the hero saving the damsel in the movies?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Don’t think too much about it, little Angel. The reason I saved you is because Shen had already promised not to kill you. As for me, I don’t want my friend to break his promise.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After saying that, Tian Lie stood up and turned his attention back toward Shen and Chris, who were far away. Next, he whispered with a voice that was so low, he himself was almost incapable of hearing it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I hope so.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“This… this… … impossible!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although the palace fragment that Chris was standing on had disappeared in the explosion, his figure remained hovering within the void. Utilizing the wings on his back, he was able to stop himself from falling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even the armour on his body was broken all over. Cracks could be seen on every part of the armour; even the light that had been flowing continuously on the surface of the armour had taken on a spasmodic quality.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>On his left hand was the half-broken bow. As for the other half of the bow and the bowstring, it had flown off to who knows where.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Flash Bow of Ketu-Rahu, destroyed?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Flash Bow of Ketu-Rahu, destroyed!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Flash Bow of Ketu-Rahu, destroyed…</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Those words kept running through Chris’ mind, the only words left within his mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Like I said, thinking that you can stop me… … is simply delusional.” Shen was standing within the void, just 10 steps before Chris. He smiled and said, “I used so much time earlier because I simply did not want to destroy the things he left you. I also did not want to kill you. However…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chris abruptly raised his head. A look of fear flashed through his eyes as he looked at Shen.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Since the reason he left you here is to hold me up, I have no other option.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Flash Bow of Ketu-Rahu, Moonless Fivefold Light Armour, Tearlight Crystal… … those items can be considered pseudo-divine artefacts to the present Players and Awakened ones. The past me would likely be unwilling to destroy them as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“But now…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen suddenly reached out with his hand. With a ghost-like manoeuvre, his hand pressed down on Chris’ chest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chris had instantly executed seven dodging attempts. However, no matter what he did, Shen’s hand remained there, resting on his chest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The shockwave emanating from Shen’s palm sent Chris flying. His flying figure caused several lines to appear within the void, seemingly having slammed into several invisible obstructions as he flew away. Finally, like a meteor, his figure smashed into the section between the jade white passageway and the Longevity Palace.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Due to the impact from Chris’ fall, a large crater erupted into existence upon the wide jade white passageway.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This time, Chris no longer possessed the strength to get up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Earlier, Shen’s palm had only just pressed down on his chest. At present, the Moonless Fivefold Light Armour that he was wearing was practically no more. Only fragments of the armour remained on his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was a terrifying-looking concave on Chris’ chest. It seemed as though his front chest had been pushed all the way down to his back. Clearly, every one of his ribs had been crushed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen stood at the edge of the crater. He lowered his head to look at Chris and sighed softly before slowly stepping forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His steps were steady, as though there was an invisible staircase in the void for him to step on.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen came to stand before Chris. Then, he lowered his gaze until they rested upon Chris’ eye.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The left eye.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You would even give up one eye for your master.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen sighed softly. Then, an amused smile appeared on his face. “You personally dug out your left eye and replaced it with the Tearlight Crystal. That is how you were able to lock down on me when I am in the Longevity Palace while you were in your stage. Then, using the Flash Bow of Ketu-Rahu, you broke space to attack me from a distance. As for the Moonless Fivefold Light Armour, that is for any unexpected outcomes. It could also provide you with a certain defensive power, allowing you to hold on until he arrives. This level of preparation is truly unmatched. A pity, my strength in his simulations for you is still that of the past me.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chris’ lips moved a few times. However, no voice came from him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Since the Flash Bow of Ketu-Rahu and the Moonless Fivefold Light Armour have been destroyed… … letting this one stay alone in this world is too cruel.” Shen sighed softly. Then, he crouched down, stretched out a finger to press down on Chris’ left eye spot.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A soft cracking sound rang out and some blood slowly spilled out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen then stood up, his right hand tightly gripping something. When he opened his palm, fine ashes slowly flowed out from the gaps between his fingers down onto Chris’ body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“This level of injury is not enough to kill you. However, it is enough to stop you from doing anything else. Don’t worry, I will not kill you.” Shen looked back at Chris’ weakened face. A gentle-looking smile appeared on his face as he reached out with a hand to pull Chris up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen brought Chris with him as he slowly walked to the edge of the crater. He then placed Chris down in a position which allowed him to look at the Longevity Palace. “Your master no longer have the chance to see me again. So, you should be obedient and sit here. Use your one remaining eye to properly observe all that will happen next. Then, when he arrives, tell him of what you have borne witness to, of me finally stepping upon…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The ultimate path!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
