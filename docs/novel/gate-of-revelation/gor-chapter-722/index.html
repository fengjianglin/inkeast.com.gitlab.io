 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 722 Myriad Beast King </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Damn it! There are surveillance cameras throughout the road. We won’t be able to use this car anymore in the future.” Chen Xiaolian gnashed his teeth and shouted, “You didn’t use your real identity when staying there, did you?!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I am not that stupid.” Qiao Yifeng was thrown into the backseat by Qiao Qiao. He was barely able to straighten himself amid the bumpy ride before sullenly responding.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Hopefully, they won’t be able to track down our identities!” Chen Xiaolian, who was gradually growing nervous, was unable to stop himself from slamming the steering wheel.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The glass window that was broken from the bullet fires and the broken door in the hotel was one thing, the bullet holes on the hotel wall and the firearms left on the floor was another matter entirely. That was a big issue.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Thankfully, after their deaths, Awakened ones would be refreshed back into ordinary humans without leaving their corpses behind. If their corpses were still there, this matter would further escalate.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian looked behind through the rear-view mirror. Qiao Yifeng had already straightened himself. There was a grim expression on his face as he looked out the window.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As for Yu Jiajia, her whole body was huddled into a ball as she trembled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>According to Qiao Yifeng, this should not be Yu Jiajia’s first experience with surprise attacks since following him. Yet, as she was still a young girl, there was no way for her to act as though nothing had happened.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Are those guys all at this level of strength?” asked Chen Xiaolian as he turned the car into a trail and continued driving eastward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“There are stronger ones.” Qiao Yifeng gave a simple reply.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Their numbers? Level?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“In total, there are three guilds working together. I have never seen those fellows from the hotel. However, the Guild Leaders of two of the guilds are very strong. “One of them is of the Magic type while the other can transform into animals, specializing in melee battles. As for their levels… … I am uncertain.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The current you probably can’t figure it out.” Chen Xiaolian snorted before turning to Qiao Qiao, who was in the front passenger seat. He said, “Let’s not leave any traces. We’ll finish them off outside. You choose the place.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I am thinking the same thing.” Qiao Qiao revealed a cold smile as she pulled out her mobile phone. After a brief inspection of the map, she said, “Five kilometres southeast, Tuping Mountain.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“All right.” Chen Xiaolian nodded as he drove toward the location that Qiao Qiao had given him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tuping Mountain was a small hill in the eastern suburbs area. It was a barren place with very little plant life. As it could not be considered a scenic spot, it was unsuited for real estate development. During the development of the city, this place had been passed several times.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although there were some farmers there, they lived far from each other. It was something of a sparsely populated area. Thus, it was the closest and the most suitable place for a battlefield.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>On their way to Tuping Mountain, Chen Xiaolian noticed that there were two large MPVs tailing behind them. However, the two MPVs had chosen not to make any actions at all. It would appear that the other party was feeling hesitant and unwilling to cause too big of a ruckus.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Having realized that, Chen Xiaolian slowed down the speed at which the car was going and leisurely drove toward their destination. He was worried that the other party might end up losing sight of their car.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Since he had resolved to finish them off all at once, he should do a clean job of it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After the car reached the foot of Tuping Mountain, Chen Xiaolian turned around to look at the two MPVs that were following them. Next, he stepped on the throttle and drove forward, leaving the scattered patches of bushes behind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Pieces of gravel and bushes grazed the bottom part of the car, but Chen Xiaolian ignored it. Switching to the first gear, he stepped on the throttle and drove up the mountain, merely observing as the tachometer needle kept jumping toward the red zone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At any rate, he had no plans of keeping the car after this.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Not to mention, it was not his car.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>One of the two MPVs behind had already stopped. Several figures alighted from the MPV to rush up the mountain on foot as they pursued the car. The other MPV, however, did not stop. The driver followed Chen Xiaolian, stepping on the throttle to pursue the car.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing as they were already halfway up the mountain, Chen Xiaolian estimated that they were at a remote enough location and stopped the car. Next, he casually stepped down from the car.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Stay behind and take care of them.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Qiao Qiao nodded her head and stayed inside the car as she vigilantly inspected their surroundings. Yu Jiajia’s face was buried into Qiao Yifeng’s chest as she shivered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Qiao Qiao turned her attention to the back seat with a frown and gave a harrumph.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The pursuing MPV had also stopped. Four men stepped down from the MPV while the other four from the other MPV had also caught up. They spread out to form a circle and slowly approached the car.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian observed the few men who were positioned before him. Amongst the four who had stepped down from the MPV, one of them was wearing a tank top. His exposed body parts were all filled with tattoos. Even his face was filled with tattoos. As for the other three, each of them wore a pair of glasses and simple clothing. They formed an arc beside the tank top man.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>On the other hand, the four men who had gotten out of their MPV beforehand all looked average. There was no way to tell who their leader was.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Only eight?” Chen Xiaolian’s gaze swept past all eight of them and said, “Isn’t this a little lacking?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Eight is not enough?” The tattooed man sneered. “Tell me where the remnants of Zero City are. If you don’t… … I will bring upon you a miserable death.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I really don’t get it… … what are you fellows thinking?” Chen Xiaolian cast a pained look at the tattooed man. “Even if I do know where they are, even if I do tell you where they are, with your meagre abilities, do you think that you can grab anything from them?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That is up to us.” The tattooed man rubbed his fists as he stepped forward. Suddenly, his body expanded, just like a water balloon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As his body was expanding, a tattoo of a giant wolf that was on his left arm suddenly expanded as well to cover his whole body. In but moments, the tattooed man had transformed into giant, black-coloured wolf with luxuriant fur.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sharp claws rapidly extended out from his five fingers while fangs slid down from his mouth, saliva dripping down onto the ground. However, he remained standing on his two feet.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“So, you can become a werewolf. Is that really anything amazing?” Chen Xiaolian gave a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Etch my name into your memory! It will be of use when you beg for mercy! I am… … the Myriad Beast King!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The giant werewolf roared out and charged at Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At the same time, the three men behind him quickly spread out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The first man held a dagger in each hand. Moving in a crouching posture, he attempted to rush Chen Xiaolian from the side.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The second man did not step forward and remained standing on the same spot. However, his right hand smashed down on the ground, causing a two-metre tall earth golem to rise up from the ground. With a roar, the earth golem charged toward Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The third man did not appear too strong. Or perhaps his skill was unsuited for this type of battle. He simply held onto an assault rifle and opened fire at Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As for the other four Awakened ones from the other MPV, they did not choose to cooperate with the four attacking Awakened ones. Instead, they simply stood there to observe the battle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When the giant werewolf arrived before Chen Xiaolian, his seemingly large and cumbersome body abruptly vaulted up. He had not attacked Chen Xiaolian and was instead jumping past him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At the same time, the dagger-wielding man who was charging Chen Xiaolian accelerated his charge, which suddenly turned into an arcing flank aimed at Chen Xiaolian’s right side.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The earth golem strode forward as well, arriving before Chen Xiaolian. It raised up both its hands and smashed them down on him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>On Chen Xiaolian’s side, he was already wielding a sword in hand. However, he remained standing on the same spot, ignoring the shots from the assault rifle completely.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He was wearing an [A] class protective suit. If the weapon in the Awakened’s hand was an energy-tier weapon, Chen Xiaolian would have had some scruples. However, common firearms cannot hope to break through his defence.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When the bullets struck Chen Xiaolian’s body, it merely caused a series of muffled sounds to ring out before falling on the ground. Seeing that brought shock upon the enemies on the other side.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At the same time, Chen Xiaolian’s sword slashed out, gleaming with a chilling light.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He had lost Skyblade’s power and could no longer unleash sword beams out. However, in terms of swordsmanship skills, Chen Xiaolian’s swordsmanship was already strong enough to be ranked amongst the first-rate masters.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Like a dragon, his alloy sword flew into the sky, cutting the earth golem into two from the bottom up. At the same time, Chen Xiaolian’s upward jump allowed him to avoid the dagger stab coming from below.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The werewolf, despite its large body, was faster than the dagger-wielding man. After leaping past Chen Xiaolian, he had yet to land on the ground when he saw Chen Xiaolian jump into the sky. His right leg shot out to furiously kick the ground, sending his body up toward the airborne Chen Xiaolian. His sharp claws swung out in an intersecting move. It seemed as though Chen Xiaolian’s body would be torn apart in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian, who was in the middle of the air, truly no room to manoeuvre about, making it impossible for him to dodge the attack. And yet, he maintained the lackadaisical smile on his face while his sword swung out to meet the werewolf’s claws.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A wretched cry rang out and bloody flesh spilled out while metal fragments scattered about. The werewolf plummeted down the ground, slamming heavily upon the ground. The tendons on his two front paws were ruptured, a bloody sight to behold.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Damn it!” Right after falling, the werewolf flipped back up and howled into the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The dagger-wielding man was stunned. His fast-moving legs came to a halt only for him to see a partially broken sword shooting toward his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The broken sword had lost its sharp tip. However, with the momentum afforded by its velocity, it was still able to pierce its way into the man’s face. The dagger-wielding man fell on his back and his legs twitched a few times before finally growing still.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>By then, Chen Xiaolian had already retrieved another alloy sword from his Storage Watch.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Your claws are pretty hard.” After landing on the ground, Chen Xiaolian sneered as he tested the sword in his hand. Then, he stepped toward the werewolf.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The alloy sword was just a standard weapon from the system. It had nothing else other than sharpness and toughness; no attributes or supplementary skill. Its only advantage was its cheap price, 50 points apiece.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Since losing the Sword in the Stone, Chen Xiaolian had Xia Xiaolei purchase 10 of these swords for him. With the discount skill, he spent only 400 points on them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, the werewolf had relied on its claws alone to destroy an alloy sword. This proved that he was quite strong.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After getting destroyed, the golem collapsed into a pile of yellow soil. Seeing that, the golem summoner who was some distance away revealed a look of hatred. Raising his hand, he bit down on his finger, letting his blood drip down on the ground. His blood quickly seeped down into the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Once again, he raised his fist to smash down on the ground. However, just as he was about to do so, three large Four-eyed War Cats suddenly appeared before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A sharp paw swatted forward and the summoner jumped backward, avoiding the fate of being split apart by a hair’s breadth. By doing so, however, he also lost the chance to summon another golem.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The summoner was not too good at melee battles. Thus, under the encirclement of the three Four-eyed War Cats, he fell into a precarious state. He attempted several times to summon another golem out, but was incapable of finding the opportunity.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing Chen Xiaolian moving toward him, the werewolf did not continue to charge forward and attack. Instead, his body began shrinking. In a flash, he had reverted to his human shape.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Both his arms had reverted to their wholesome state as well, not a trace of injury on them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Eh?” Out of curiosity, Chen Xiaolian halted his steps and watched as the giant wolf tattoo on the man’s left arm quickly disappeared. Meanwhile, a brown bear tattoo on the man’s right arm began expanding to cover his whole body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“This is quite the interesting skill.” Chen Xiaolian nodded with a look of interest. He stood there, waiting for the transformation to finish. “No wonder you are called the Myriad Beast King.”</span></p>
