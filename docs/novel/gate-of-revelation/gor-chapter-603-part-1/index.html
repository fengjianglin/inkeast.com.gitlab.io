 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 603 Part 1 Phoenix’s Revenge </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix stood coolly in the colosseum arena and stared at the warblade in Wang Sheng’s hand. She was silently calculating the time.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Once she set her opponent on fire with her True Samadhi Fire, it will become the equivalent of an attack that ignored all dewalls. The problem was, it had a very long cool down time of 50 minutes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Moreover, her earlier battle with Chen Xiaolian had exhausted her stamina and magic force.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This world that the two old monsters had controlled… … or rather, ‘modified’, time had slowed down by 3,600 times. Thus, all time measuring devices on her, be it her normal watch or the timer on her personal system, all of them cannot be used. Even so, she could still gauge the passage of time by herself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Earlier, Chen Xiaolian had engaged in a fight with the Avenging Angel and also chatted with the two old monsters for quite some time. Additionally, there was also the time taken for them to be sent into this colosseum and the introductions… … although Phoenix had no way of properly gauging the time, she was able to generally estimate that around 40 minutes had passed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Thus… … as long as she can hold on for 10 more minutes…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix shot her hand out and retrieved a dagger from her storage equipment. She crouched slightly and displayed a combat-ready stance.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Melee-type as well?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing the weapon in Phoenix’s hand, a smile swiftly appeared on Wang Sheng’s face. He turned to face the stands and raised the warblade in his hand up high. “Boss! Although I do not know where you are, I know you must be on the stands!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You can… rest easy and watch as I bring you victory!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Damn it! You idiot!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The stance that Wang Sheng took to shout out had exposed a great deal of his body to Phoenix, who stood just opposite of him. Even so, there was only a negligent look on his face as he smiled with pride and self-confidence. Han Bi, who was watching Wang Sheng, clenched his fists and heavily slammed the energy wall. “This is a duel to the death! A duel to the death against a veteran! Do you think you are playing house here?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Unfortunately, due to the energy wall, his words could not make its way to Wang Sheng, who was in the arena.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>All he could do was to grit his teeth. Slowly, he turned to look at Chen Xiaolian. He opened his mouth. In the end, however, he simply closed it without saying anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although Wang Sheng’s actions had left him highly exposed, Phoenix maintained a vigilant and defensive stance. She did not take the initiative to attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>She would never take the risk of attacking first when the opponent’s abilities remained a mystery. Not to mention, the longer she dragged this out, the more advantageous the situation would be for her.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wang Sheng lowered the warblade in his hand and turned around in a circle before finally looking at Phoenix. He smiled, “Then… … let us start!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Kicking the ground, Wang Sheng dashed out toward Phoenix and slashed out with his warblade.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix had long since prepared herself for Wang Sheng’s attack. Her left leg kicked out and she jumped to the right, dodging Wang Sheng’s attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>But she was not done.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>She had clearly dodged to her right. After evading Wang Sheng’s attack, however, she used some unknown means to, like a ghost, circle around to appear behind Wang Sheng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The sharp tip of her dagger viciously shot toward Wang Sheng’s back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In the stands, Chen Xiaolian’s heart thumped furiously. He recalled the time when he had confronted Phoenix some time ago. Back then, Phoenix had displayed the same thing, moving with ghost like speed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although she was a magus whose main method of attacking was through a wand, her speed and skills in melee combat qualified her to be an assassin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wang Sheng’s attack had left him open. However, Phoenix’s dagger failed to reach his back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Ding!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The dagger, that was about to strike Wang Sheng’s back, was blocked off by the warblade in Wang Sheng’s hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The tips of both the warblade and the dagger struck each other perfectly. Any deviations and they would have slid past one another.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, Wang Sheng had not turned his head to look back. He did not even swing his warblade.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He maintained the same stance he had earlier, with his back against Phoenix while his hand held onto his warblade, having swung against empty air.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Despite that, the warblade appeared possessing of self-awareness. In just an instant, it had twisted to circle its way to Wang Sheng’ back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Appearance wise, it looked like a noodle. Yet, when it had collided against Phoenix’s incoming dagger, it had caused sparks to fly out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing her strike fail to connect, Phoenix rapidly put some distance between them. She cautiously regarded the warblade in Wang Sheng’s hand. “Liquid metal?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Only then did Wang Sheng languidly turn around. Like a snake, the warblade in his hand twisted back to its original shape. Wang Sheng smiled proudly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His attack had failed to connect, but Wang Sheng did not appear disheartened in the slightest. He simply smiled and charged forward once more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix continuously dodged Wang Sheng’s attacks. Whenever Wang Sheng’s attacks missed her, Phoenix would retaliate with her dagger, stabbing toward Wang Sheng’s fatal points. However, the warblade would always block off the dagger strikes just as it was about to hit home.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The weapon was similar to… … the T-1000 from the Terminator movies.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As the battle continued, Wang Sheng gradually forced Phoenix into a disadvantageous position.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wang Sheng’s movements were not fast. Although he was stronger, it was not to the point where it would be difficult for Phoenix to parry his attacks. And yet, as the two of them continued exchanging blows, Phoenix was shocked to discover that the weapon in Wang Sheng’s hand was seemingly… … learning.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was learning her movements, her techniques, her rhythm, and the angle of her attacks.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The warblade itself was no longer a warblade. With the exception of the hilt that Wang Sheng was still holding onto, the other part of the weapon had been continuously transforming. Great axe, spear, and even… … a shield.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It would not be an exaggeration to say – the one who was actually fighting this battle was not Wang Sheng. Rather, it was the weapon he was holding. From the beginning until now, all Wang Sheng did was to do his best to close the distance between the two of them and also attempting to avoid Phoenix’s attacks. The attacks he could not avoid were blocked off by the weapon he was holding.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Unknowingly, Wang Sheng had managed to push Phoenix back to the edge of the circular arena. The energy barrier blocked off her back while left shoulder and right leg were already suffering from shallow cuts.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Do you know?” As Wang Sheng brandished the weapon in his hand, he grinned and smiled triumphantly. “I… have never lost to a melee-type opponent. Never!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
