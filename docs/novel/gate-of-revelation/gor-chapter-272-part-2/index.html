 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 272 Part 2: Come Take A Bite</strong></p>
 <p>The female terrorist was standing beside the captain when he uttered those words. However, she did not move to stop him. She simply sneered and waited for him to finish before pulling him to the side.</p>
 <p>“Now, cut off all communications!”</p>
 <p>The captain was thrown to the cabin area beside the flight attendants.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian threw a glance at Sawakita Mitsuo.</p>
 <p>“If you want to do something, do it now. Our time is running out. These 15 minutes would likely be our last chance to do anything.</p>
 <p>“I believe that if the US government do not agree with this request, they will take military action after this 15 minutes is over.</p>
 <p>“The negotiations have reached a tipping point.”</p>
 <p>Sawakita Mitsuo whispered to Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian responded by nodding his head.</p>
 <p>“Can you deal with the one in the cockpit?” Chen Xiaolian traced the words on his palm again.</p>
 <p>“No problem.”</p>
 <p>“All right, make your move when I give the signal.”</p>
 <p>After ending his conversation with Sawakita Mitsuo, Chen Xiaolian then used his guild channel to contact Roddy.</p>
 <p>"Roddy?"</p>
 <p>“Well, what should we do?”</p>
 <p>Roddy sounded anxious. He smiled wryly and continued, “This senior’s been holding back for too long now! If you don’t make your move, I’m going to have to wet my pants.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian rolled his eyes.</p>
 <p>“I have something to ask you. Does your Mechanical Heart skill allow you to control an airplane? What I mean to ask is, if the one controlling this plane dies, do you have the means to pilot it?”</p>
 <p>“Nonsense! This senior can control even The Mech! How the Hell does an airplane even compare?” Roddy answered confidently.</p>
 <p>“That’s good.” Chen Xiaolian took a deep breath and continued, “We now have a method to deal with the terrorists in front. The only problem is the two at the back side of the cabin.”</p>
 <p>The two terrorists situated at the back of the cabin were the only problems in Chen Xiaolian’s plan.</p>
 <p>Roddy was silent for a moment before responding, “I’m confident that I can handle the one beside me. But those fellows at the back… I can’t do anything about it.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian considered it and responded, “Since we don’t have a better method, we’ll have to risk it.”</p>
 <p>Pausing, he took a deep breath and continued, “In two minutes time, I am going to stand up and do something. Right now, I need you to help with something… be careful when you’re doing this but secretly have the passengers fasten their seat belts.”</p>
 <p>“Eh?” Roddy was surprised by Chen Xiaolian’s plan. However, he nodded. “All right, I’ll do my best.”</p>
 <p>“All right, now I am going to tell you what to do…”</p>
 <p>After Chen Xiaolian had said his next few words…</p>
 <p>There was a look of shock on Roddy’s face.</p>
 <p>He hesitated for a moment and cried out through the channel, “Damn it! You little bugger! This is a crazy ass move you’re pulling here!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian smiled wryly and responded, “We’ll have to take this risk. Can you do it?”</p>
 <p>“There won’t be a problem on my end,” Roddy replied after thinking it through.</p>
 <p>“You only have two minutes. Make sure to be careful when you act.”</p>
 <p>After finishing up his conversation with Roddy, Chen Xiaolian turned to Sawakita Mitsuo before making a gesture with his head at the cock pit.</p>
 <p>Sawakita Mitsuo signalled back that he was ready.</p>
 <p>The old man showed a faint smile and suddenly unfolded his fan. Next, he pinched with two fingers and a very fine item protruded out from his fan without making a sound.</p>
 <p>Appearance wise, it was hard to determine if it was made of ivory or jade. It was thin, sharp, white and shiny.</p>
 <p>Sawakita Mitsuo then took a deep breath and his fingers moved to form several strange seals and the thin item suddenly transformed and moved down his fingers. It proceeded to flows down his body and onto the floor.</p>
 <p>A faint silvery trace could be seen on the floor. However, without inspecting it carefully, one would never be able to see it. It was like a small camouflaged snake or worm as it slithered forward at a rapid pace toward the cockpit.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was surprised… <em>this old man’s skill is quite something.</em></p>
 <p>“I am ready to make my move at any moment. Just give the signal, young friend,” said Sawakita Mitsuo with a smile.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian quietly calculated the time. When two minutes were roughly up, he suddenly stood up and shouted out toward the female terrorist, “Excuse me, lady! I have something to say.”</p>
 <p>He deliberately spoke using inarticulate English. Additionally, he also put on the façade of being fearful.</p>
 <p>The terrorist in the middle position of the cabin noticed Chen Xiaolian standing up and was quick to shout out. He quickly walked toward him.</p>
 <p>At the same time, one of the two terrorists positioned at the back of the cabin quickly moved to the centre position – clearly, they trained for this plan meticulously. They would ensure that they were always in control of each part.</p>
 <p>Once one side was left unguarded, someone will step in to fill in for that person.</p>
 <p>This move on their part however, made Chen Xiaolian feel relaxed. He felt more confident in his plan.</p>
 <p>The female terrorist watched as Chen Xiaolian stood up. She appeared somewhat surprised and there was a peculiar smile on her face. She curiously regarded this ‘Japanese Imperial Prince’ and waved the terrorist back.</p>
 <p>She slowly walked over with a gun in her hand. There was also a sharp dagger in her other hand – God only knows how they managed to slip those into the airplane.</p>
 <p>“What is the matter, esteemed Imperial Prince?”</p>
 <p>There were traces of mockery within the female terrorist’s voice.</p>
 <p>It was probably because Chen Xiaolian had the face of a student and did not appear threatening that the female terrorist appeared so relaxed.</p>
 <p>“I…” Chen Xiaolian purposely exhibited nervousness and took a deep breath. Then, with a rather timid expression, he said, “I… I demand a treatment befitting of my status!”</p>
 <p>“Oh? Your Imperial Highness, what kind of treatment do you want? You are now in the First-class seat. I did not let you sit with those commoners; isn’t that already a good treatment?” The female terrorist narrowed her eyes as a cold glint appeared within her eyes.</p>
 <p>“I…” Chen Xiaolian deliberately revealed traces of fear and he put on an act of not daring to look at the woman in the eye. He kept diverting his gaze away from the sharp dagger in the female terrorist’s hand and whispered, “I demand to go to the restroom! I am a member of the Imperial family! I demand a befitting treatment! I… I… I demand to go to the restroom!”</p>
 <p>The female terrorist burst into laughter.</p>
 <p>She cast her gaze at Chen Xiaolian and saw that he was deliberately clamping his thighs together. His body also appeared to be quivering somewhat.</p>
 <p>Traces of contempt and disdain could be seen within her eyes.</p>
 <p>Sawakita Mitsuo who was seated beside stood up and said seriously, “A disgraceful behaviour is not allowed for our noble Imperial Prince!”</p>
 <p>“… ha ha ha ha ha!”</p>
 <p>The female terrorist laughed out gleefully several times.</p>
 <p>She regarded Chen Xiaolian with a complicated looking smile and said, “Ah right… for a noble Imperial Prince to wet his pants… that is indeed very disgraceful.”</p>
 <p>Pausing for a moment, she then tilted her head and shouted, “Kallahn!”</p>
 <p>The terrorist who was at the centre position moved forward – one of the terrorist at the back came forward again to take his place.</p>
 <p>Kallahn moved until he was beside Chen Xiaolian and turned to look at the female terrorist.</p>
 <p>“Escort His Imperial Highness to the restroom. It would be disgraceful for our Imperial Prince to wet his pants. We must give him a high level treatment, ha ha ha ha…” after saying that, she deliberately laughed out.</p>
 <p>Kallahn grinned and licked his lips before pointing his gun at Chen Xiaolian. Waving the muzzle of his gun, he said, “Move it then.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian pretended to tremble as he made his way to the restroom.</p>
 <p>This restroom was not far away from the cabin entrance. The cockpit was located before the restroom.</p>
 <p>As Chen Xiaolian was walking toward the restroom, he deliberately trembled while sandwiching his thighs.</p>
 <p>He pulled open the restroom door even as he trembled and was about to close it when Kallahn extended his hand to grab the door. He said, “You are not allowed to close the door!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian turned with an aggrieved expression on his face. He said, “What?!”</p>
 <p>“You are not allowed to close the door.” Kallahn waved the muzzle of his gun once more. “You are not a little girl. Are you afraid that someone will see it? If you want to pee, then pee with the door opened! If you want to take a dump… then take a dump with the door opened! I’m not afraid of the stench, what do you have to be embarrassed about?”</p>
 <p>The sound of laughter coming from the female terrorist who was standing behind them grew louder.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaoian inhaled deeply. His face was a mask of red – it was done on purpose. Yet, he also put on a furious and aggrieved face.</p>
 <p>“What are you hesitating for? If you don’t want to, then roll back to your seat, oh noble Imperial Highness, ha ha ha!”</p>
 <p>It would appear that Kallahn have a terrible nature. This act of teasing a member of the noble Imperial family seemed to be giving him a special sense of satisfaction.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian pretended to hesitate. Then, seemingly making up his mind, he turned to enter the restroom.</p>
 <p>With his back facing the terrorist, he secretly mumbled to himself: <em>This senior is making this sacrifice for the sake of the quest… for the sake of the quest…</em></p>
 <p>He pulled his zipper…</p>
 <p>Truth be told, this was Chen Xiaolian’s most agonizing peeing experience.</p>
 <p>To pee while a bearded beefy man was pointing a gun at him while monitoring his actions…</p>
 <p>This experience was just too weird.</p>
 <p>After Chen Xiaolian was done forcing himself to pee, he took a deep breath and turned around.</p>
 <p>He carefully walked out of the restroom.</p>
 <p>Kallahn followed him closely with a sneer on his face. The muzzle of his gun was pointed at Chen Xiaolian’s head all the way.</p>
 <p>After taking two steps…</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian secretly estimated his position before abruptly stopping.</p>
 <p>“Hey! What are you doing? Your Imperial Highness? Could it be that you weren’t too satisfied with the earlier experience and want another round? Ha ha ha ha!”</p>
 <p>Kallahn laughed savagely.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian deliberately revealed an indignant expression and shouted, “Impudence! I have never been insulted as such before!”</p>
 <p>After saying that, he turned his body to face Kallahn. There was a false expression of rage on his face and his stance was incredible clumsy. He extended his arm and furiously charged toward Kallahn!</p>
 <p>All his performance was done right on the money. It accurately reflected the furious and clumsy yet not threatening image shown by youngsters with no experience of the world.</p>
