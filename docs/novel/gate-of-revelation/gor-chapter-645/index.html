 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 645 Sword Snatching? I’ve Done It Before</strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Every monster to emerge from the rift were created from blood and were utterly dark red in colour. Although each of the monsters’ strength could not be considered highly powerful, they continued to spawn out non-stop.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As for Sister Yun, she waited patiently. Every time she swung her spear, at least one of the monsters would be cut down. However, she did not charge out of the encirclement of monsters.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian gritted his teeth and raised the Gauss rifle in his hand to aim at Sebast. Pulling the trigger, he sent the bullets flying up toward Sebast. However, when there were only several metres between the bullets and Sebast, a transparent shield blocked them off.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast had placed his palms together and was mumbling something. The two hexagram patterns he drew on his palms were now blocked from view but had begun shining. The dark red light from the patterns grew increasingly intense until it could be seen through the back of Sebast’s palms.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The dark red light grew so intense, it soon became hard to even see Sebast’s face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Help me up…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian lowered his head to see Bluesea struggling to lift up his arm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mr Bluesea… …” Chen Xiaolian knitted his brows and propped Bluesea up. “With your present condition… … it would be best for you to not move about.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Although I do now know what he is preparing to unleash, we must definitely not allow him to complete it.” Despite the weak tone in Bluesea’s voice, he shook his head slowly and continued, “The woman is indeed very strong, but we cannot simply put the fate of our lives into her hands. To just watch… … she is being overconfident.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Are you sure you can still… …” As Chen Xiaolian was in the middle of saying something, Bluesea interrupted him. “Enough, help me up.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian sighed before nodding his head. Exerting his strength, he pulled Bluesea up and allowed Bluesea to lean on his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea then raised his right hand and struggled to aim at Sebast, who continued to hover up in the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Most of the tentacles on his arm had grown withered, leaving only a small number of them there. After he raised up his right arm, the few tentacles quickly hardened to form several sharp spikes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Hopefully, this will be able to… … break through his defence!” Bluesea inhaled deeply before blasting the spikes out from his arm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The back area for each spike had a uniform set of propulsion outlets and an intense flow of air sprayed out from the outlets. Like missiles, the spikes flew in a curve through the sky, splitting into two waves of attacks even as they shot toward Sebast.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Up in the sky, Sebast was completely focused on Sister Yun before him. He had failed to notice that the organic missiles were shooting up at him. The dark red light coming off his palms continued to increase in intensity to the point where it became like a sphere of light, enveloping his entire body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As the intensity of the dark red light reached its limit, the first wave of the missiles arrived. A violent explosion erupted and a gap was created upon the near-tangible red light.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast snarled and immediately responded. The red light rapidly moved toward the opening but by then, the second wave of organic missiles had made its way through the opening.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As the organic missiles’ explosion were confined within the sphere, its destructive power was increased by over 10 times. A large fireball erupted within the sky for a good five seconds before slowly dissipating away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When the flames finally dissipated away, however, Sebast was still hovering up in the sky, undamaged.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His entire body was now covered in scales. Even the pair of wings growing from his back were completely covered by the scales.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His originally handsome face was now that of a savage monster. There were no words to describe it. It was as though the faces of the ugliest of monsters had been minced apart and put together in a random manner.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian noticed it. The rim area around Sebast’s eyes were the same as Wu Ya’s Jormungandr form.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This fellow, he must have stored up all the blood he had sucked within his body and made their strength his own.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Damned trash!” Sebast looked down at Chen Xiaolian and Bluesea with a furious expression. With a flap of his wings, he summoned a sphere of light upon the palm of his hand. As he was about to hurl it down, however, he hesitated for a moment. Then, he retracted the sphere of light.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At present, Chen Xiaolian had the one thing he wanted. He must not kill Chen Xiaolian by accident.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After Sebast finished his transformation, the rift closed up. Since he had successfully transformed his body and switched into a melee-type form, there was no longer any need to maintain the rift, which was consuming his strength.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Finished transforming? Is that it?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After finishing off the last remaining monsters with her spear, Sister Yun looked at the transformed Sebast. With a scoff, she urged her horse and charged toward Sebast.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When the distance between them dropped to only slightly more than 10 metres, Sister Yun brandished her spear. Tens of silvery blades of light shot out from the spear toward Sebast.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Suddenly, when the silvery blades of light were about to reach Sebast, they were all shattered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The thing that shattered them all was the sword that had suddenly appeared within Sebast’s hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A sword that… … Chen Xiaolian was most familiar with.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Damn it! How did it end up with him?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian gritted his teeth and tightened his fists as he stared at the Sword in the Stone that Sebast was brandishing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya had told him before: &nbsp;All system related equipment will be sent into this Recycle Bin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Despite having known that, Chen Xiaolian had not expected to see the Sword in the Stone here.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun arrived before Sebast and her spear stabbed toward his chest only to be deflected by his sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Silver-coloured sparks erupted around them. The white horse reared up as its charge was halted. As for Sebast, he too, was unable to stand the ferocious momentum of the charge and was slammed several metres away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A wound had appeared on Sebast’s shoulder. The bones beneath the wound became exposed for all to see. However, he had managed to deflect off a good portion of the might behind the spear attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Did you think I am purely a magus?” Sebast flapped his wings mightily to steady his position. Wielding the Sword in the Stone, he laughed at Sister Yun. It was as though he had not suffered the wound to his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, due to this monstrously patched face, his originally dashing smile now appeared inexplicably odd. “Magic and martial, Dual-type. Feast your eyes on this!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun tilted her head slightly to regard Sebast but said nothing in response. Sneering, she urged her white horse into a charge once more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As she arrived before Sebast, Sister Yun slanted her body backward while twisting it while both her hands held onto the spear handle. Utilizing the force of her waist, she swung her spear forward to cut down Sebast.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This spear attack was faster and stronger than the one before. It was not just a thrust. Instead, this attack utilized the handle of the spear like one would a sword to hack down at Sebast.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After the earlier confrontation, Sister Yun had decided that this enemy before her was no match for her, be it in terms of strength or speed. The only things he could leverage on were his powerful regenerative abilities and his strange magic.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even if Sebast were to block this attack of hers, Sister Yun was confident that she would be able to cleave both him and his sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The two weapons made contact. Silver-coloured energies and blood-coloured light shone out at the same time.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The sound of metals clashing rang out and the sharp point of one of the weapons was cut off. The cut off part was sent flying far away and a flower of blood blossomed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, the weapon that was cut was not the sword in Sebast’s hand, but Sister Yun’s spear.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The instant that the Sword in the Stone cut the spear, it stabbed toward Sister Yun’s abdomen area and left a long slash wound on her.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The two of them shot past each other. Then, Sister Yun brought her horse to a halt before looking down. She felt the wound on her abdomen.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When she raised her head, a hint of rage emerged from within her eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Not only was her spear cut by the sword, even her armour had failed to stop it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That thing in your hand, what is it?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After raising her head, Sister Yun looked at the sword in Sebast’s hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I don’t know either.” Sebast shrugged his shoulders with a smile. “There is no personal system in World’s End and there is no way to inspect the skills or attributes of equipment. You should know that. However, you should have sensed the power hidden inside it.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That is a good sword you have there,” Sister Yun said coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Jealous?” Sebast laughed loudly and said, “If you want it, come and snatch it!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Sword snatching, eh?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun the raised her head up further to look at the sky, seemingly recalling something. “I have done that before.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Next, both her legs kicked the belly of the horse and it charged Sebast once again. Waving her hand, she summoned another spear that looked exactly the same as the previous one.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Damn it! Don’t face him head on!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian shouted loudly from below.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In the earlier attack, the sword had clearly activated one of its passive skills, Edge Breaker.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Weapons with that passive skill could, within a certain level of probability, directly break their enemy’s weapon. When facing enemy weapons on the same level as it, the Sword in the Stone had a 10 per cent chance of breaking the enemy weapon. As for enemy weapons that were of a lower level, the Sword in the Stone had a 50 per cent chance of breaking them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As the level of the enemy weapon decreases, the chances of the Sword in the Stone breaking the weapon will grow higher.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sword in the Stone was an [S] class weapon while the spear that Sister Yun was using was something she summoned using her own skill. No matter how powerful they may be, they could not be as strong as an [S] class weapon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A simple calculation was enough to tell that two clashes would be enough to allow the Sword in the Stone to cut the spear.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Unfortunately, Chen Xiaolian’s shout came too late.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even before his voice could reach her, the Sword in the Stone had struck the spear that Sister Yun was wielding.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This time, however, the Sword in the Stone’s Edge Breaker skill did not activate.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was not due to activation failure. Rather, it was because the edges of both weapons had not made contact with each other.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As the spear was about to make contact with the Sword in the Stone, it suddenly made a subtle change in angle. The handle of the spear then struck the surface of the sword, knocking it away. Doing so, it also deflected the power that Sebast had put into the sword slash.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Sword in the Stone slashed at Sister Yun’s neck, missing only by a hair’s breadth. On the other hand, the spear drew a perfect arc to stab into Sebast’s right shoulder.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Next, the spearhead flew up, cutting off Sebast’s right arm. The right arm, which was holding the Sword in the Stone, flew up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Suffering from such a heavy blow, Sebast roared out wretchedly. However, he had no time to even clutch his wound. Instead, he flapped his wings to charge upward as his left hand reached out in an attempt to grab his right arm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Unfortunately for him, Sister Yun was one step ahead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>She did not join Sebast in the attempt to grab the arm that was flying upward. Instead, she sneered and flicked the spear. Five more spears appeared to encircle Sebast.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Blood burst out like a popped water balloon. Sebast, who had yet to even retrieve his right arm, was repeatedly stabbed by the spears.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His legs and torso were badly damaged, but that was not all. Even one of his wings were cut off by one of the spears.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast lost the ability to steady himself in the sky. Despite his attempts to flap his remaining wing, he was unable to stop his abrupt fall and his figure spiralled down the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He slammed onto the ground with a resounding crash. Muddied soil flew as Sebast instantly jumped to his feet. His left hand punched the air before him once again and he slowly opened up the rift. A large amount of blood then flowed out from the rift and poured into his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The blood swirled around his body and rapidly took solid form. The blood quickly reformed Sebast’s right arm. Even the wounds he suffered to his body were healed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast’s mouth opened as he laughed out spitefully. “I told you… … the Bloodclan’s regenerative powers is… …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Before he could finish his words, a bolt of light shot down from the sky to nail him to the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun had hurled the spear in her right hand down from the sky. Her left hand held onto the Sword in the Stone and she urged her horse to charge down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Damn it!” Sebast turned his hand to grab hold of the spear. He had just pulled it out from his body when Sister Yun descended upon him, the Sword in the Stone lifted high up as she hacked down on his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast screamed sharply. Utilizing both his hands, he raised the spear he just pulled out to protect himself. However, a spectacular flash of light erupted and the spear handle was cut into two.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The instant the two weapons clashed, however, Sebast had quickly jerked his head backward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Following his dodging move, the blade of the sword swept across his neck but failed to decapitate him. It only managed to cut half his neck.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Just as quickly however, the second sword strike came.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast had to use his left hand to prop up his partially fallen head while his right hand quickly traced a circle in the air before him. A thick shield of light appeared before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The shield of light managed to hinder the Sword in the Stone for only half a second before it was cut in half. Even so, it was enough for Sebast to avoid this next strike.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His body twisted in the opposite direction at a peculiar angle. Next, his feet kicked the ground and his figure darted beneath the white horse.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing that, Sister Yun sneered. Placing her left foot on the horse, her entire body moved to dangle in the air as she sent the Sword in the Stone slashing down beneath the horse to receive the two clawing attacks that Sebast had sent upward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Sword in the Stone cut his left claw and left a deep wound on his right palm. Then, with a cleaving move, she sent Sebast flying. The move left a deep gully on the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“This is a good sword, thank you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun lifted the Sword in the Stone and inspected it before glancing back at Sebast, who was struggling to climb back up. There was a smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You… … how can you be stronger than me?!” Sebast roared out. A large amount of blood once again surged out from the rift to restore his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Enough, little bat.” Sister Yun sneered. Raising the Sword in the Stone up high, she then hacked down at the rift.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Her horse had not moved forward. Yet, despite a distance of tens of metres between her and the rift, her attack had seemingly folded space itself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The hilt of the sword was in her grasp and the blade had not lengthened. Yet, somehow, the tip of the sword fell upon the rift.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No!!!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast screamed wretchedly and could only watch as the sword struck the rift. The rift then grew distorted before slowly collapsing away into nothingness.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Like I told you, sword snatching… … I have done it before.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
