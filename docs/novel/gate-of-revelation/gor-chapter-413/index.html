 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 413 I Want To Eat It!</strong></p>
 <p>Jacob released a wretched and furious howl!</p>
 <p>His massive dragon tail rapidly swung around and Bai Qi’s diminutive figure was sent careening through the air.</p>
 <p>However, he did not let go!</p>
 <p>Both his hands continued to embrace the dragon tail – not only did he not release his hand, he did not even release his mouth! His mouth continued biting the tip of the dragon’s tail!</p>
 <p>The dragon’s tail was protected by a layer of dragon scales, but those were incapable of stopping Bai Qi’s teeth. He bit deep!</p>
 <p>Jacob’s enraged roar reverberated throughout the arena and the spectators on the grandstands uttered cries of shock.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian stood there, a look of stupor on his face.</p>
 <p>He had never imagined that Bai Qi would actually resort to such a ‘peculiar’ method of attack.</p>
 <p>This fellow… … he had actually forgone his sword but used his teeth instead?</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was also able to notice something from Bai Qi’s usually unemotional eyes. There was a rare look of persistence and excitement there!</p>
 <p>Indeed, it was excitement!</p>
 <p>It was as though a fellow who had been starving for three whole days suddenly caught sight of a grilled lamb leg. It was that kind of expression!</p>
 <p>That expression caused even Chen Xiaolian to shudder.</p>
 <p>The massive dragon’s tail lashed out several more times. In the end, it heavily struck the ground and Bai Qi finally let go.</p>
 <p>The instant when the dragon’s tail was about to strike the ground, Bai Qi suddenly released both hands and his white figure somersaulted a few times through the air before landing far to the side.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian noticed something that caused his heart to shudder… … he could clearly notice the residual blood at the corners of Bai Qi’s mouth. Additionally, his cheeks were moving… … it seemed he was forcefully munching something!</p>
 <p>Munch!</p>
 <p>Munch!</p>
 <p>And munch again!</p>
 <p>The pair of eyes appeared to be shining with green light as they stared at Jacob.</p>
 <p>“Bastard!!!”</p>
 <p>Jacob roared in rage.</p>
 <p>Bai Qi’s actions had successfully attracted Jacob’s undivided attention. A majestic [A+] class expert was viewed as ‘food’ by his opponent? How could Jacob tolerate such a disgrace? Additionally, it was before the eyes of everyone here!</p>
 <p>Jacob ignored Chen Xiaolian, turned around and charged toward Bai Qi. Opening his jaws, he unleashed another dragon breath!</p>
 <p>Bai Qi extended his right hand. Next, his personal sword that had been thrust into the ground by him earlier immediately flew into his grasp.</p>
 <p>With the sword in hand, Bai Qi then appeared completely different!</p>
 <p>A sharp killing intent soared all the way to the sky!</p>
 <p>He faced the incoming dragon breath and raised his sword vertically. Next, he slashed down!</p>
 <p>A chilling white coloured flash of light shone out before him vertically!</p>
 <p>The flaming dragon breath that came in contact with it appeared to have encountered a freezing wave of frost and the flames broke apart and were extinguished. In the process, smoke soared up to the sky!</p>
 <p>Bai Qi’s figure that was covered by the smoke leapt upward and shot toward Jacob like a sharp sword!</p>
 <p>With a swooshing sound, he pierced through the flaming dragon breath. His white clothes emitted a sphere of white coloured light amid the flames, allowing him to pass through the flames unharmed.</p>
 <p>In but a blink of an eye, Bai Qi was before Jacob!</p>
 <p>Both his feet gently tapped Jacob’s dragon jaw. A banging sound rang out and the dragon jaw was slammed shut, causing the pouring flames to be cut off. In fact, large amounts of flames could be seen leaking out through Jacob’s nostrils instead!</p>
 <p>Bai Qi leapt up once more. This time, he landed on the crown of Jacob’s head. He promptly raised the sword in his hand and viciously thrust down upon Jacob’s forehead…</p>
 <p>Although all these actions had occurred in merely an instant, those two moves by Bai Qi triggered an uproar form the audience!</p>
 <p>The ones seated in the grandstands were all members of resident guilds of Zero City. Not a single one of them were weaklings!</p>
 <p>This was the so-called non-professionals would watch for fun but experts would watch for insight! The two moves displayed by Bai Qi and his abilities had caused the others to enter a state of shock!</p>
 <p>Firstly, he had charged through Jacob’s flaming dragon breath without getting hurt!</p>
 <p>That was dragon’s breath! Not some ordinary flames! In terms of temperature, it was far superior compared to ordinary flames!</p>
 <p>Secondly, by tapping Jacob’s jaws with both his legs, Bai Qi was able to slam Jacob’s jaws shut! That was a testament to his strength! This was not some ordinary beast like a tiger or others of the like… … this was a dragon! A genuine colossal dragon!</p>
 <p>In the end, he leapt up to the colossal dragon’s head and stabbed it. This was a very brilliant move on his part! This was Jacob’s biggest weakpoint!</p>
 <p>There was pandemonium in the grandstands!</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>When Bai Qi’s short sword struck Jacob’s forehead, the tip of the sword struck one of the dragon scales…</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>The clear sound could be heard by Chen Xiaolian!</p>
 <p>Next however, Chen Xiaolian observed that Bai Qi’s body had flinched!</p>
 <p>After that…</p>
 <p>He fell from the colossal dragon’s head!</p>
 <p>Seeing Bai Qi’s falling figure, Jacob raised a claw and swung forward!</p>
 <p>Bai Qi who was in the middle of the air abruptly twisted his body. As the dragon claw was about to strike him, he positioned his sword vertically before his body to block the incoming attack…</p>
 <p>With a banging sound, Bai Qi’s body plummeted to the side like a bullet and his body fell to the side of the competition arena. The impact of his fall caused a crater to form on the ground. The momentum caused his body to bounce up and down again a few times until he was tens of metres away from the first crater…</p>
 <p>It continued for five to six times! Every point that Bai Qi’s body had made contact with became a deep crater with cracks spreading out…</p>
 <p>Finally, after the last fall, Bai Qi thrust his sword heavily into the ground to maintain a standing posture.</p>
 <p>“Ptui!”</p>
 <p>Bai Qi tilted his head and spat out a mouthful of blood. Then, he raised his head and cast a warlike gaze at the colossal dragon!</p>
 <p>Jacob raised his head and roared furiously…</p>
 <p>At that moment however, Chen Xiaolian and everyone in the arena was able to see Jacob’s head…</p>
 <p>One of the dragon scales on his forehead had been cracked and minute amounts of blood could be seen trickling down!</p>
 <p>Jacob’s forehead had been successfully stabbed!</p>
 <p>Although the injury did not appear severe, he was still hurt!</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“This pet of yours… … … where did you get it?”</p>
 <p>There was curiosity in Skyblade’s voice.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian simply gave a harrumph and did not reply.</p>
 <p>Skyblade sighed. “What a powerful pet. Not only that, he is also a human-shaped pet! That is something that is extremely rare in the system. The comprehensive assessment for this pet of yours should be at [A] class, right? To think that he would be able to harm Jacob. Dragon scales are the toughest material available. Not only that, Jacob also possesses the magical Dragontongue Armour, something that gives him a high amount of immunity toward physical attacks. What a pity. To think that such a rare and powerful pet, something that I had never seen before, would fall into the hands of a kid like you! If it was me, then with just a few years of nurturing, he might be able to defeat Jacob himself. I won’t even need to lift a finger.”</p>
 <p>Hearing that, Chen Xiaolian replied coldly, “Stop talking nonsense. Is the cool down time for your skill over?”</p>
 <p>“… it’s done! All right, let’s finish off Jacob!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian grunted and he proceeded to summon Bai Qi back to the system.</p>
 <p>However…</p>
 <p>“Mm?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian could clearly sense the thoughts that Bai Qi was sending back to him.</p>
 <p>Those were powerful sentiments of… … resistance!</p>
 <p>Indeed, resistance!</p>
 <p>Bai Qi was showing a great deal of resistance toward Chen Xiaolian’s summon!</p>
 <p>Additionally, Chen Xiaolian could also clearly sense the thought that Bai Qi was transmitting over to him.</p>
 <p>That thought caused Chen Xiaolian to fall into a state of stupor.</p>
 <p>Bai Qi’s desire was very simple:</p>
 <p>I! WANT! TO! EAT! IT!</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Bai Qi resisting his summon had happened before. Back in London, Chen Xiaolian had lost control of Bai Qi before.</p>
 <p>Back then, Bai Qi had completely lost all sense of thought.</p>
 <p>However, this situation was different! Bai Qi was clearly not out of control. He could even transmit his thought to Chen Xiaolian concisely.</p>
 <p>That thought was: He wants to eat the dragon!</p>
 <p>Now that Bai Qi had resisted his summon, there was nothing Chen Xiaolian could do about it… under this circumstance, Bai Qi’s willingness was needed. Otherwise, Chen Xiaolian would have no way to control him.</p>
 <p>However, Chen Xiaolian did not hesitate.</p>
 <p>He attacked!</p>
 <p>Finishing off Jacob was his objective!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian raised Skyblade!</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“You will all die!”</p>
 <p>Jacob was infuriated. Most importantly, he had suffered an injury in the hands of a pet that had regarded him as food. For him, this was a huge disgrace.</p>
 <p>Thus, Jacob had unleashed his ultimate attack.</p>
 <p>When his jaws uttered the word “you”, countless shockwaves appeared in the air!</p>
 <p>Several circular cracks appeared on the ground, spreading out from Jacob’s position.</p>
 <p>Following the words “will all”…</p>
 <p>A tempest suddenly descended upon Chen Xiaolian and Bai Qi’s location!</p>
 <p>When Jacob finally uttered the word “die”…</p>
 <p>BOOM!</p>
 <p>A loud noise, akin to that of ten thousand gunshots resonated outward!</p>
 <p>The grounds throughout the arena shattered!</p>
 <p>The ground was transformed into crushed rocks and they all flew into the sky!</p>
 <p>A pervasive magical power inundated the air within the arena. It was only thanks to the force field surrounding the arena that this magical power was not able to extend further.</p>
 <p>However, the area within the arena that was enveloped by this power…</p>
 <p>Oppressed! Pulverized! Shocked!</p>
 <p>Countless forces of varying types materialized in the air before proceeding to inundate the space spanning several hundred metres…</p>
 <p>The various types of forces intersected with one another like a dense network and…</p>
 <p>Created a pressurizing power, which pulverized the grounds of the entire arena!</p>
 <p>Bai Qi moved!</p>
 <p>He was… … sword dancing!</p>
 <p>Dense images of Bai Qi’s short sword surrounded his figure as he displayed his sword dance, not letting anything through. Innumerable energy flows surrounded his figure again and again but not a single one could break through his defence!</p>
 <p>Explosions burst out in the air around his figure.</p>
 <p>The resulting booming sounds were just like that of a series of exploding firecrackers.</p>
 <p>Bai Qi had utilized such a powerful sword technique to face Jacob’s ‘Dragontongue magic’ head on, blocking off all incoming attacks with his sword!</p>
 <p>His swordsmanship was shocking to behold!</p>
 <p>As for Chen Xiaolian…</p>
 <p>His was simpler.</p>
 <p>He raised Skyblade.</p>
