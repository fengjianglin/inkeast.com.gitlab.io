 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 672 One-Man Battle </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Success!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian cheered inwardly despite the look of indifference on his face. Not a trace of sweat could be seen on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu’s character was as he had expected.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In the end, he was unwilling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was an opportunity to return to the outside world before him. Lei Hu would never be the one to personally destroy that opportunity.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>If this opportunity was something that had suddenly appeared before Lei Hu, Chen Xiaolian would be uncertain as to how Lei Hu would respond.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, as of now, Chen Xiaolian had seen the scope of Lei Hu’s plans and the amount of effort he poured into them since Qiao Qiao’s arrival in World’s End.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He was such a far-sighted and calculating person. This was an opportunity that he had been waiting for after hundreds and thousands of years. He had laid out such a perfect plan for it and now it was right before him. How could he simply give it up?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu stared at Chen Xiaolian without taking a single step forward. Instead, he carefully took a few steps backward. “You weren’t lying. You are indeed determined to kill yourself and not just bluffing. If I had taken a step forward earlier, you would already be dead now.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian responded with a faint smile. He did not reply and instead kept his hands tightly pressed upon the detonation lever on the plasma mine.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“However, I do not believe you can flawlessly keep this up.” Lei Hu shook his head and sat down cross-legged. “Since the Foresight skill had once shown me a scene where I get to leave World’s End, it means that such a future is possible. Until the moment you detonate the plasma mine, I will not give up.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Fine, let’s drag this on.” Chen Xiaolian shrugged.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although they had left the snowfield and were far away from the designated rendezvous point, for some unknown reason, a thought remained within Chen Xiaolian’s mind – Sister Yun will certainly come looking for them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He did not know how long that would take. However, Chen Xiaolian was certain that should Sister Yun arrive, she would be capable of killing off Lei Hu.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>She was, after all… … one of the ancient monsters like Mr San.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The atmosphere around them fell into a peculiar state of silence.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu sat cross-legged on the sand dune as his two eyes stared at Chen Xiaolian’s body. Not once did his eyelids blink.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Despite not saying a single word, his eyes were clearly conveying his intent out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Don’t be careless, or I will snatch the plasma mine in your hands…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Don’t be careless, I will snatch the plasma mine…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Careless, snatch plasma mine…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Snatch plasma mine…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mine…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian had already displayed his determination to rather die than surrender.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In the infinite possible futures that Lei Hu saw earlier through his Foresight skill, none of them ended with him successfully snatching away the plasma mine in Chen Xiaolian’s hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian was not lying. He had indeed taken out the safety for the plasma mine and was now pressing on the lever. Only Chen Xiaolian himself can put the safety back; otherwise, the mine would explode the moment his hands loosen their grip on the mine.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Since I cannot snatch the mine away – I will just have you give un on your own through superior pressure.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Under Lei Hu’s stare, Chen Xiaolian felt as though the skin on his body was being pierced by countless needles.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In but a moment’s time, Chen Xiaolian’s back was covered in sweat.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Qiao Qiao’s face sank and she moved to rush forward only to be pulled back by Bluesea.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Don’t move! Do you like becoming a hostage?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea turned to give Qiao Qiao a glance. Despite the softness and calmness of his voice, he radiated a tranquil air of authority.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“But, Xiaolian…” Qiao Qiao gritted her teeth as she looked at Chen Xiaolian, who was right beside her. His legs were beginning to sway.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You will not be able to help him. At this moment, he can only depend on himself.” Bluesea shook his head. “This is a mental contest to see whose heart is the stronger one. As long as Chen Xiaolian could maintain his heart, he will be able to maintain control over his fingers. However, the moment his heart falls will be the moment Lei Hu snatches away the plasma mine.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Then… … what should we do?” Qiao Qiao nodded her head and forced herself to calm down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Wait.” Bluesea gave her another glance and said coolly, “Wait patiently.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian slowly sat down on the sand dune as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, since the beginning, he had both his eyes staring at Lei Hu, not lowering his guard in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He had enhanced his physical body before. Thus, even if he had to stand for three days and three nights, he will not feel exhausted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At that moment, however, what was important was not the ability to stand, but the ability to be on guard against Lei Hu.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Only a with strong mental state and willpower could one put forth a sufficient amount of mental pressure on the other party.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In this situation, it mattered not how strong they were on a personal level. Rather, it depended on how determined they were.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“As long as Lei Hu makes a move, let go!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“As long as Lei Hu makes a move, let go!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“As long as Lei Hu makes a move, let go!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian kept repeating that same sentence to himself, seemingly determining to engrave them into his very bones.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At that moment, Lei Hu was the only thing within Chen Xiaolian’s vision.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His other limbs had also seemingly disappeared and all his senses had seemingly gathered onto both his palms.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>That thought was the only thing left in his mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As for Lei Hu, his gaze seemed to contain knives and guns. A thick killing intent swept its way toward Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sweat had begun forming on Chen Xiaolian’s forehead and they trickled down along the corner of his forehead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A drop of sweat trickled its way into his eye, bringing with it a stinging sensation. However, Chen Xiaolian dared not move his eyelids at all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After who knew how long, another scene gradually appeared before Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In one scene, he could clearly see himself still sitting on the sand with Qiao Qiao and Bluesea beside him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In the other, he was suspended in the void.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There were no sun, moon or stars there. His eyes could see only endless darkness.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The only ones left within the scene were him, and Lei Hu, who was there before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This was an illusion that Lei Hu had created with his powerful mental ability.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Give it up. That way, only one person will die.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu had not opened his mouth. The only things open were his eyes. Yet, in this illusionary realm, Chen Xiaolian could clearly hear him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Dream on.” Chen Xiaolian sneered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You cannot hold on much longer.” Lei Hu, who was seated on the sand dune remained motionless. However, the Lei Hu within the illusionary realm had stood up. He walked toward Chen Xiaolian. “Did you think your mental powers could be stronger than mine?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Why not?” Chen Xiaolian responded with a disdainful smile. He had also wanted to stand up, only to find that he was unable to move at all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Do not forget how long I have lived within World’s End.” Despite them floating within the endless void, Lei Hu was still able to step toward him. Every step he took make it look as though he was treading upon solid ground. “You are just a prepubescent kid. What do you have that can fight against me?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Willpower. What is the relationship between willpower and age?” Chen Xiaolian sneered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If there is no relationship between the two, you may try to stand up, or even move a finger.” Lei Hu continued to step forward until he was standing before Chen Xiaolian. Then, he looked down condescendingly at him. “In this mental realm, you cannot make even the most minor of movements. Does that not tell you what the problem is?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“At least my fingers on the plasma mine can still move. Do you want to put it to the test?” Chen Xiaolian raised his head to reveal a fearless expression.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Soon, even they would not be able to move.” Lei Hu shook his head. Next, he extended a finger and pressed it on Chen Xiaolian’s head. “After I am done destroying your willpower, that is.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After those words left Lei Hu’s mouth, his finger swiped down and Chen Xiaolian’s head was instantly cut into two.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A massive heart-piercing pain reverberated throughout Chen Xiaolian’s central nervous system.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Something is not right.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Qiao Qiao’s keen senses noticed something and she lowered her gaze to look at Chen Xiaolian.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The four of them had spent all this time silently confronting each other. Following Bluesea’s instructions, Qiao Qiao had suppressed the concern within her heart and stood quietly beside Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, Chen Xiaolian’s situation… something was amiss.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian’s eyes continued confronting Lei Hu’s and his body remained seated on the sand dune. His fingers were still pressed down on the detonation lever of the plasma mine.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Yet, his body had begun to tremble visibly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Qiao Qiao dared not move to stand before Chen Xiaolian. Even so, just by looking at him from the side, she could see that his whole face was sweaty while his face remained impassive.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Uncle Bluesea… … Xiaolian…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Qiao Qiao whispered to Bluesea.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“This Lei Hu… … could even his willpower be this terrifying? Or perhaps…” Bluesea had also noticed that something was not right. He hesitated for a moment before saying, “Could he be using some kind of mental attack?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Qiao Qiao whispered, “What should we do? If he is currently occupied with this mental attack, maybe we can…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I have seen two [S] class experts now. This Lei Hu is even stronger than them. Even if his attention is now on Chen Xiaolian, he is still not someone that we can ambush successfully.” Bluesea considered it before slowly shaking his head. “This is now… … a one-man battle for Chen Xiaolian!”</span></p>
