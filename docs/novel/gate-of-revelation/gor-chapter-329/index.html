 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 329 Error</strong></p>
 <p>They were still in the living room. Chen Xiaolian pulled out a metal sphere and placed it on his outstretched palm. “Look at this.”</p>
 <p>Roddy was quick to recognize what it was.</p>
 <p>“This metal sphere… it had probably belonged to Kaiser. I found it beside his armour.” Chen Xiaolian sighed.</p>
 <p>Roddy thought about it and said, “By using this, we can… create Irregularities like us, right?”</p>
 <p>“Truth be told, I have this concern regarding Lun Tai and Bei Tai.” Chen Xiaolian knitted his brows and continued, “We cannot keep on hiding our secret from them. There is also Xia Xiaolei.”</p>
 <p>“You mean…”</p>
 <p>“We’ll need to explain matters to them,” said Chen Xiaolian with a sigh. “I have this strange feeling. I believe that the path ahead of us will only get harder – much harder than that of ordinary Awakened ones.”</p>
 <p>“It can’t be, we already have a base…”</p>
 <p>“Don’t forget how Kaiser and his guild met their end.” Chen Xiaolian frowned.</p>
 <p>Roddy’s heart throbbed!</p>
 <p>“The system must have found out the existence of the base, then… it figured out a method to have Kaiser and his guild wiped out. What I do not understand about this matter is… Kaiser and the rest are clearly Players…”</p>
 <p>Roddy shook his head and said, “I don’t get it either.”</p>
 <p>“The battles we face in the future might be more difficult and dangerous… those who walk the same path as us, Lun Tai, Bei Tai and Xia Xiaolei, they have a right to know. They have a right to make a choice.”</p>
 <p>“… you want to tell them the truth?” Roddy looked at Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>“Yes!” Chen Xiaolian said solemnly. “If they are unable to accept this, then… they have the right to leave. After all, the perils they will face on this road are likely more dangerous!”</p>
 <p>Roddy took the metal sphere that was in Chen Xiaolian’s hand and gripped it a little. “I have always been curious about one thing… for ordinary people, this metal sphere would make them Irregularities… just like me and Qiao Qiao.</p>
 <p>“Then, what if… what if this metal sphere is used on Awakened ones like Lun Tai and Bei Tai? Will they also become Irregularities?”</p>
 <p>“It’s better if we don’t do that.” Chen Xiaolian shook his head and continued, “After becoming an Irregularity, one will only have one life left. After all, Awakened ones have a chance to be resurrected to become an ordinary person.”</p>
 <p>Roddy held the metal sphere in his hand and thought about it. “Actually, on a theoretical perspective, we can create an endless number of Irregularities – as long as we have enough of these spheres that is.”</p>
 <p>He raised the metal sphere in his hand.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian smiled wryly and said, “Don’t forget, one metal sphere means one life!”</p>
 <p>Roddy smiled and placed the metal sphere on the table.</p>
 <p>It was at that moment that the doorbell suddenly rang.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian exchanged glances with Roddy.</p>
 <p>“Who is it?”</p>
 <p>“Room service, please open the door.” The hotel attendant’s voice came from beyond the door.</p>
 <p>Roddy and Chen Xiaolian fell silent as strange expressions befell their faces.</p>
 <p>They had both enhanced their bodies before and possessed astonishing level of senses. Based on what they could sense of the breathing and movements outside, the two of them could discern that a hotel attendant was not the only one beyond the door!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian signalled to Roddy with his hand and walked until he was standing before the door. Roddy who was standing behind had a military blade and a gun in his hands.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian grunted and he quickly opened the door. His hand shot out and he pulled over the hotel attendant who was standing outside. He immediately had his hand snake around to grip the fellow’s throat!</p>
 <p>At the same time, several gun muzzles were pointed at Chen Xiaolian!</p>
 <p>“NYPD! Put your hands in the air!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Looking at the uniformed police officers that were standing before him and the black holes of the guns aimed at him, Chen Xiaolian was unable to stop himself from feeling shocked.</p>
 <p>Despite having several guns pointed at him, Chen Xiaolian did not feel fearful – this level of danger could be dealt with easily enough. Considering how close they were to him, these few police officers were of no threat to him.</p>
 <p>However…</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian considered the situation and let the hotel attendant go.</p>
 <p>The hotel attendant was quite the unlucky fellow. He did not have the opportunity to run away and was immediately pulled in right after the door was opened. After Chen Xiaolian let him go, he quickly ran to the side.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian retreated backward and into the room. He raised both arms to indicate that he would not resist. Roddy who was behind him noticed Chen Xiaolian’s sign and he took advantage of the fact that the police had yet to enter the room to quickly keep the military blade and gun into the Storage Watch.</p>
 <p>Two police officers rushed in and they quickly pressed Chen Xiaolian and Roddy down on the ground. Next, they handcuffed their wrists.</p>
 <p>Two minutes later, Chen Xiaolian and Roddy found out what the problem was.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>The hotel was the one who had called up the police.</p>
 <p>It was simply bad luck. As Chen Xiaolian and Roddy were checking into the hotel, they had brought Selina in with them. Selina however, was unconscious.</p>
 <p>After having experienced a series of terror attacks, the American people had become rather sensitive. When they saw two Oriental fellows bringing in an unconscious and beautiful young woman into the hotel…</p>
 <p>The hotel staff members became alarmed and they chose to report to the police.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian did not blame the hotel for doing so… after all, they were correct.</p>
 <p>Two young men bringing in an unconscious and beautiful young woman who had no strength to resist into a hotel… it was only normal for them to get the wrong impression.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian had no desire to cause any issues. At any rate, they only needed to wait until Selina woke up and explain the matter to the police. It was not a problematic issue.</p>
 <p>They obediently followed the police officers demands and produced their identification documents for them to inspect.</p>
 <p>“You two need to take a trip with us.” One of the police officer who looked like the leader said, “Until the woman in the bed wakes up and testify that you are innocence, you will need to wait in police custody. Naturally, you have the right to make calls. If you have any friends in your native country that you want to call or if you want to hire a lawyer, you can do so.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian turned to look at Roddy who smiled indifferently.</p>
 <p>The police officers took the two of them away from the room and they quickly reached the elevator. They took the elevator downstairs.</p>
 <p>As for Selina, the police officers had called up the hospital to have her taken to the hospital.</p>
 <p>After Chen Xiaolian and Roddy had entered the elevator, the elevator beside theirs opened up.</p>
 <p>Nicole walked out from that elevator, missing Chen Xiaolian and Roddy.</p>
 <p>She looked at the corridor and saw that the door of the room before her was open. There was a police officer standing watch before the door.</p>
 <p>Nicole walked forward. Before the police officer could open his mouth, she took the initiative to show her badge. “Homeland Security, I’m here on official business.”</p>
 <p>The police checked Nicole’s badge and identification and frowned. “I am sorry, this is an incident involving public safety. I don’t understand how this would involve…”</p>
 <p>“I will explain it to your superior,” said Nicole coolly. “Where are the people staying here?”</p>
 <p>“They are suspected to be involved in this public security incident. For now, they have been sent to the police station.”</p>
 <p>Nicole hesitated for a moment before heading into the room.</p>
 <p>“Hey! This is our case! You cannot enter just like that! There is someone we suspect to be the victim inside. I am waiting for the ambulance to arrive.”</p>
 <p>“I will not disturb the place, don’t worry.” Nicole smiled.</p>
 <p>She walked into the living room and looked around.</p>
 <p>There was no mess within the living room since Chen Xiaolian and Roddy did not put up a fight.</p>
 <p>Nicole then turned her attention to Selina who was lying on the bed. She knitted her brows and pondered the situation before walking back into the living room.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, her gaze fell upon the metal sphere on the table.</p>
 <p>The metal item looked like a round shaped steel ball. There was seemingly nothing special about it and even the police officers had ignored it. They had likely assumed that it was some work of art meant to furnish the room and had not done anything to it.</p>
 <p>However, Nicole was able to observe that… there were fingerprints on the metal sphere!</p>
 <p>Someone had held and gripped it before!</p>
 <p>Nicole pretended to be looking outside the window. As she did so, she also secretly pocketed the metal sphere into her pocket.</p>
 <p>Then, she turned around and walked back to the door.</p>
 <p>“All right, then. You see? I will not be obstructing your duties. I will be heading to the police station and explaining this matter to your superior.”</p>
 <p>Nicole said before turning away with a smile.</p>
 <p>When she was inside the elevator, Nicole pulled out her mobile phone and called up the friend of Charles who was working in the New York Police Department.</p>
 <p>“Hello, it’s me, Nicole. Thanks for your help on the case. However, there has been a new development. The suspects were arrested in New York. In a hotel, it’s the same hotel you told me about. They were involved in a public safety incident and were taken to the police station by the police officers. I want to ask a favour from you… find out what this case is about… also, I want to go to the police station to see those two fellows…”</p>
 <p>As Nicole was talking through her mobile phone, the elevator suddenly stopped at a different floor. A woman and a little child moved in. The child was only about seven to eight years old and was very naughty.</p>
 <p>Nicole moved to lean against the side of the elevator. Then, she saw that the elevator doors were about to close while the child was still playing with the elevator. She instinctively reached out with her hand to block the doors.</p>
 <p>“Ah!”</p>
 <p>Nicole felt her fingers hurting!</p>
 <p>She rapidly pulled her hand back.</p>
 <p>“Ah! Are you all right?” The woman exclaimed and she quickly pulled the child to the side. “I am very sorry… thank you… this child of mine is too naughty. Mark, hurry up and say thank you to this lady, and apologize as well.”</p>
 <p>The sad puppy face on the child made it impossible for Nicole to get angry and she waved her hand. “It’s nothing. I was just grazed by the elevator door.”</p>
 <p>Her fingernails were lightly cracked and her finger was bleeding somewhat. However, for a special agent like Nicole, this was a negligible level of injury.</p>
 <p>When they walked out of the hotel door, the mother and child bid Nicole farewell politely.</p>
 <p>Nicole walked across the road and stepped into her own car. Sitting inside the car, she took out the metal sphere from her pocket and gripped it to take a closer look…</p>
 <p>A drop of blood from her broken nails made contact with the metal sphere and was soon sucked into the sphere.</p>
 <p>However, Nicole was not aware of it.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, she felt her sight going blurry and her body slumped down softly!</p>
 <p>She suddenly felt short of breath and her heartbeat quickened. The feeling caused Nicole’s heart to sink!</p>
 <p>Her body shuddered and she reached out for the mobile phone on the first passenger’s seat. However, her hand was barely halfway there when her vision darkened…</p>
 <p>Cars moved to and fro on the road. No one noticed the young woman who was unconscious inside a car beside the road. The metal sphere on her palm shone with a faint radiance…</p>
 <p>It quickly dissolved and disappeared.</p>
