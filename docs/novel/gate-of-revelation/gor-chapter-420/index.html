 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 420 Chen Xiaolian’s Special Training</strong></p>
 <p>After waking up, Qiao Qiao reached out with her hand to find that Chen Xiaolian was not beside her.</p>
 <p>She subconsciously sat up and looked around.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian sat on a chair not far from the bed, bare except for a pair of shorts. Before him was a Dell Alien notebook and his attention was on the screen as he pinched his chin. He then noticed Qiao Qiao suddenly sitting up from the bed.</p>
 <p>Mm… given what they were doing during the night, at that moment, there were no clothes on Qiao Qiao’s body.</p>
 <p>The two of them had many intimate contacts. However, at that moment, Qiao Qiao’s beautiful languorous body, hazy looking eyes, long hair flowing down her supple cheeks and her lean figure…</p>
 <p>Well, that was naturally secondary compared to the curvaceous valley… …</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian immediately put aside all thoughts of typing. He simply stared at Qiao Qiao.</p>
 <p>Noticing Chen Xiaolian’s stare, Qiao Qiao’s face flushed red and she quickly pulled up the blanket to cover her front.</p>
 <p>“You… … what are you looking at?”</p>
 <p>“Looking at my woman.” Chen Xiaolian said with a-matter-of-fact tone – naturally, there was shamelessness as well.</p>
 <p>However, his reply brought a smile to Qiao Qiao’s face.</p>
 <p>She jumped out of the bed while deliberately wrapping her body with the blanket in a way that was partially revealing. Her pair of feet was laid bare and one of her fair and slender legs was exposed. She then tiptoed her way until she was beside Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>She bent her body and gave Chen Xiaolian a light kiss on the cheek. Then, she raised her head and looked at him. “What are you doing? Why did you wake up so early?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian did not bother hiding the fact that he was looking at the gap between the blanket on Qiao Qiao’s chest area. He replied, “I’m typing…”</p>
 <p>“What?” Qiao Qiao stared.</p>
 <p>“Typing, writing novel.” Chen Xiaolian clutched his head and revealed a wry smile. “Err… … you probably would have forgotten about it if I didn’t mention it. I am actually a web novel writer.”</p>
 <p>Seeing the look of disdain from Qiao Qiao’s eyes, Chen Xiaolian sighed. “I was unable to sleep. So, I got up and visited the website where I would publish my novels to check… … I have not written any chapters for quite some time now. Since I have stopped updating for so long, the review section has basically turned into a battlefield in Afghanistan. Damn it… I’ve never seen so many curses in my entire life.”</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao widened her eyes in curiosity. “They’re all cursing you? What kind of cursing?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian swallowed his saliva before replying, “They are cursing me… … the one who stopped updating only has a 5-centimetre JJ.”</p>
 <p>Hearing that, Qiao Qiao abruptly burst into laughter. Then, she leaned over while gazing straight at Chen Xiaolian, her body rapidly moving closer while she moved to sit on Chen Xiaolian’s thigh. She took up the small gap between Chen Xiaolian and the table and both her hands moved around Chen Xiaolian’s neck as she whispered in a husky and arousing tone, “I can testify that you are definitely not just 5 centimetres… …”</p>
 <p><em>Damn it! How am I supposed to hold back?</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian suddenly exploded!</p>
 <p>He promptly reached his hand to move past Qiao Qiao to slam the notebook, closing it. Next, instead of retracting his hand, he sent them exploring a certain area.</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao narrowed her eyes and her cheeks turned red as her rate of breathing quickened. She whispered, “You… … don’t you have to do a new chapter?”</p>
 <p>“New chapter? What is that? Is there such a thing in this world?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian immediately lifted Qiao Qiao up, her legs still straddling his thigh. Chen Xiaolian used both hands to hold her buttocks and carried her toward the bed… … …</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>When morning came, both Chen Xiaolian and Qiao Qiao were holding hands as they emerged from his room. They then made their way to the central resting area of the base.</p>
 <p>With the exception of Roddy, everyone else was there.</p>
 <p>Lun Tai, Bei Tai, Xia Xiaolei and Qimu Xi cast gazes which said “We know you two were getting it on last night” at them.</p>
 <p>Xia Xiaolei the idiot made a passionate low-angle fist pump as he said, “Boss is awesome!”</p>
 <p>“Cut it out! Don’t follow Roddy and be an idiot like him.” Chen Xiaolian slapped Xiaolei’s head.</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao on the other hand, acted coolly as though nothing had happened. She walked over to the coffee machine to pour herself a cup of coffee.</p>
 <p>Next, with the cup of coffee in hand, she walked over. When she was walking past Chen Xiaolian, she gave him a light kiss on his cheek.</p>
 <p>“Enough!” Bei Tai rolled his eyes in frustration. “Are you going to torture us bachelor dogs?”</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao smiled before sitting down.</p>
 <p>Everyone in the resting area laughed. The only exception was Soo Soo who puffed up her round-shaped face and stared at Chen Xiaolian. Her eyes darted back and forth between Chen Xiaolian and Qiao Qiao before she then lowered her head and sighed sadly.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian swiftly ate two toasts and gulped down a cup of fruit juice. Then, he stood up.</p>
 <p>“Today, we’ll start preparing. Bei Tai, you are in charge of getting familiar with the military weapons that we have acquired. Lun Tai, you are in charge of the cold weapons. Xiaolei and Qimu Xi will be training together with you fellows. Qiao Qiao, you too.”</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao quietly looked at Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>After pondering it more, he continued, “Take Soo Soo with you. Also, get in contact with Roddy and make sure there is no problem with his progress.”</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao detected something wrong in Chen Xiaolian’s voice. “What about you?”</p>
 <p>“I… … might need some time alone.” Chen Xiaolian revealed a wry smile. “There are some loose ends from Zero City that needs to be dealt with… … let’s put it this way, in this Zero City trip, I had received some additional harvest. But, I will need some time to process it.”</p>
 <p>After pausing for a moment, he continued, “I will need to use the training room for now. After I enter, if there is nothing noteworthy, don’t disturb me. I might need to stay inside for a few days.”</p>
 <p>“A few days?” Lun Tai was somewhat surprised.</p>
 <p>“Mm, a few days. Lun Tai will be in charge for the next few days.”</p>
 <p>Pausing, Chen Xiaolian turned to glance at Qiao Qiao. “I still have some matters to attend to at home… there is a need for me to make a trip home. I will come back later.”</p>
 <p>There was indeed a need for Chen Xiaolian to return home.</p>
 <p>There were some people living there.</p>
 <p>When day came, Chen Xiaolian returned home. The first thing he did was to find his brother from the grasslands, Arslan.</p>
 <p>This fellow had been formally accepted into the university. Although the semester had yet to start, he had gone to the university several times and had been moved by that Coach Ding’s offer. Thus, he entered the university’s basketball team and began his special training.</p>
 <p>He had moved into the university dormitory in advance. With Coach Ding helping with the arrangements, this was not an issue.</p>
 <p>The thing that brought a headache to Chen Xiaolian was Yu Jiajia.</p>
 <p>Who knows what was going on with this girl… … Qiao Yifeng also did not send anyone to pick her up!</p>
 <p>During the few days when Chen Xiaolian was not at home, she had actually treated the place like her own, settling in without any hesitation. When Chen Xiaolian returned home, he found that there were many new decorations in his living room.</p>
 <p>The pillows on his sofa now had new pink pillowcases.</p>
 <p>There was also a bow on the pillow.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian sighed and did not bother saying anything.</p>
 <p>He simply told Yu Jiajia that he wanted to leave for a few days or perhaps even longer. In short, he had her do whatever she wanted in his home… or…</p>
 <p>“If you’ve got nothing to do, you can go home.” Chen Xiaolian thought about it. “You’ve been gone for so long now. Maybe… …. there are people who had gone anxious, besides…”</p>
 <p>Yu Jiajia sat in the living room before the TV. She held a controller in her hands as she played GTA5, using a car to charge unchallenged throughout the streets, causing flesh and blood to fly all over…</p>
 <p>Hearing Chen Xiaolian’s words, she waved her hand and mumbled. “I get it, I get it. Living here in your place is good. I will pay your rent on time!”</p>
 <p><em>Well, this is what you call indulging in pleasure to the point of forgetting home and duty.</em></p>
 <p>After contemplating it again, Chen Xiaolian decided to simply let her be.</p>
 <p>He had already resolved his issue with Qiao Yifeng. Since she wanted to stay here, might as well let her. At any rate, he would not be staying here for much longer.</p>
 <p>But if Qiao Yifeng did send his men to pick her up, Chen Xiaolian would not interfere with that as well.</p>
 <p>After saying his piece, Chen Xiaolian who had wanted to leave decided to go check the kitchen first… …</p>
 <p>The table and trashcan were filled with instant noodle packs and instant noodle cups…</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian sighed. “You’re a good girl, why did you end up becoming someone who stays inside all day long? Enough with the games and stop eating instant noodles every day. This thing is not nutritious. Not to mention, it could cause you to become fat…”</p>
 <p>Yu Jiajia simply grunted and glared at him. “This lady’s body is in good shape! No matter what I eat, it won’t go out of shape!”</p>
 <p>After saying that, she even stuck up her rather small breasts.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian simply shook his head. Then, he opened the door and left.</p>
 <p><em>Even now, I still don’t know what is her relationship with Qiao Yifeng… … sigh… who cares. It’s their own matter!</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian made his way down through the stairs. As he was just about to step out of the corridor, he suddenly heard Yu Jiajia’s voice coming from upstairs.</p>
 <p>She was leaning out from the windows and looking at Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>“Heyy!”</p>
 <p>“What is it?” Chen Xiaolian raised his head.</p>
 <p>“I forgot to tell you just now. Da Gang wanted me to inform you that he has some private matters to deal with back in Hangzhou. He’ll only be back in a few days.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian waved his hand. “Got it!”</p>
 <p>Yu Jiajia stared at Chen Xiaolian’s back as he left. It was only after he had left that a faraway look of frustration washed over her face. She then turned her attention away.</p>
 <p>She turned around and saw the TV screen and the game that had been paused. Suddenly a wave of boredom emerged from her heart and she switched off the TV. She then bounced her way into the kitchen and pulled out an instant noodle cup. Then, she suddenly recalled something that a certain someone had mentioned earlier and hesitated. She then placed the instant noodle back into the cupboard.</p>
 <p>She turned to the refrigerator and retrieved a carton of milk, which she drank.</p>
 <p>After that, she lowered her head to regard her chest area.</p>
 <p>“Could it be? I have eaten too many instant noodles to the point where my body shape had become affected? It can’t be…”</p>
 <p>Having thought of that, this girl suddenly panicked and screamed. She ran into her own room and brought out a yoga mat. Eagerly setting it up by the TV, she then utilized a player to turn on a yoga tutorial. Taking a deep breath, she then reached out both hands and slowly lifted her left foot…</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Walking out of the residential complex, Chen Xiaolian found that Da Gang was indeed not around.</p>
 <p>He went to the nearby supermarket to buy something.</p>
 <p>Several boxes of wax!</p>
 <p>He bought all the wax in the supermarket!</p>
 <p>Four boxes worth of wax were moved into the car. Then, he placed them into his Storage Watch.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian then reached the base at noon.</p>
 <p>There in the central resting area, Bei Tai was disassembling a PS9 handgun. After disassembling them into parts, he then reassembled them rapidly. Xia Xiaolei who was beside him watched enthusiastically.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian gave Bei Tai a glance…</p>
 <p>He seemed to be doing very well. The new nano-tech liquid metal arm that they acquired from Zero City did not appear like a prosthetic arm at all. Seeing the dexterity in the way Bei Tai was moving his fingers, Chen Xiaolian gave a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>On the other side, Lun Tai held a long sword in hand as he displayed some basic sword moves to Qiao Qiao, Soo Soo and Qimu Xi.</p>
 <p>After returning, Chen Xiaolian greeted them all. He gave his previous Storage Watch to Lun Tai. He was now using the Storage Watch that Fatty Fan had given him. After storing some items inside his Storage Watch, he went to inform them something.</p>
 <p>“I’m going to start my special training and use the training room. We’ll be meeting again in a few days’ time!”</p>
 <p>With a smile, Chen Xiaolian entered the training room. After the door closed, the smile on Chen Xiaolian’s face slowly faded.</p>
 <p>He turned, took a deep breath and moved to the metal orb on the control panel.</p>
 <p>“Simulating scenario… utilizing user memory, recalling scenario… generating simulation… rate of similarity: 95.58 %! Degree of training intensity: Highly realistic.</p>
 <p>“Entering in one minute.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian took a deep breath.</p>
 <p>One minute later, a line of text appeared on the surface of the metal orb.</p>
 <p>“Instance dungeon simulation begins! Created in accordance to the user’s memory: Deserted island underground palace!”</p>
