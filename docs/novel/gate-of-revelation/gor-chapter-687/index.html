 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 687 I Found It&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen looked at the red-haired figure standing on the other side of the door. Then, with a soft sigh, he stepped through the door.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You came, as expected.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The area beyond the door was a verdant stretch of grasses and various flowers grew in an orderly manner on the stretch of grasses. The flowers gave the place a riot of colours.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There in the middle of all the flowers was a path inlaid with cobblestones. The red-haired owner of the place held a long pair of scissors as she meticulously trimmed the leaves and branches.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Hearing the sound coming from the door, she raised her head and put down the pair of scissors before striding her way toward Shen.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes, I have come.” The door behind Shen disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I figured you would come here someday.” After coming to stand before Shen, the red-haired woman regarded Shen from top to bottom before continuing, “It has been a long time since our last encounter. You have not changed at all.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Isn’t it the same for you?” Shen turned his gaze away, no longer looking at the red-haired woman.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Are you certain?” The red-haired woman sighed and shook her head. “What you are seeing is me, not her. Who knows? Perhaps, that body of mine, wherever it may be, has now become old and unsightly. Even this red hair could have turned white.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Stop joking.” Shen shook his head gently. “How can you possibly grow old?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Everyone dies, let alone grow old.” The red-haired woman extended her hand to press the empty air before her. Suddenly, a small, wooden square table appeared together with two chairs placed on either side.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>On the square table was a full tea set, with tea, milk and sugar cubes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“We have not met for so long. We should sit down and have a cup of tea. Let’s have a good chat and reminisce about the past.” Without waiting for Shen’s reply, the red-haired woman moved to sit herself. Using a silver spoon, she scooped up the tea leaves and sprinkled them evenly into two cups.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Sorry, I have no time to be chatting about.” Shen did not sit down. Instead, he furrowed his brows as he regarded the red-haired woman from head to toe. “Besides… … Cheng Cheng, how did you end up like this?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Like what?” Cheng Cheng reached out with her hand to her side to twiddle with her red hair and gave Shen a glance. Countless emotions could be seen within her eyes. “Didn’t you say earlier that I have not changed?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen shook his head. “Your appearance has not changed, but you have. The past you possessed such a fiery temper. How could someone like you talk to me with such a kind of tone?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Oh? Could it be you prefer it when I am violent toward you?” Cheng Cheng poured only enough hot water to fill half the cup of tea. Next, she filled the cup with milk before placing in two sugar cubes into the cup. After that, she stirred the cup with a small teaspoon. “Your taste sure has changed.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I do not know what kind of personality she set for your program. However, one thing I can be certain, if I were to encounter the real Cheng Cheng, she would never display this attitude you are taking right now.” Shen remained standing. His eyes were constantly looking away from Cheng Cheng. “Hand over the key. I have no time to play with an echo.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Play?” Cheng Cheng picked the teacup and gave it a sip. “Why aren’t you looking at me? Do you hate me that much? Do you not like me anymore?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I don’t hate you, but I don’t like you either.” Shen’s tone maintained the same tone of indifference. “Is there a need for me to pour any emotions into an echo? I’ll say it once again, let me through. Otherwise…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Otherwise… you would do what?” Cheng Cheng pursed her lips to form a smile. “Kill me?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Do you think I won’t?” Shen turned his gaze over to look at Cheng Cheng. The only thing within his eyes was iciness. “You are just an echo. Killing you, how hard can it be?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You can try.” Cheng Cheng reached out with a finger to twirl one of her long locks of hair.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Fine.” Shen spat out with determination even as his figure disappeared. In a flash, he appeared before Cheng Cheng, his right index finger tapping the spot between Cheng Cheng’s brows.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Golden light flashed out and Cheng Cheng, who was still smiling, began to break apart. Starting from the spot between her brows, her figure disintegrated into dust.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, before Shen could retract his right arm, a flash of light erupted and the disintegrated Cheng Cheng re-formed herself. Cheng Cheng continued to sit on the chair.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Looks like… … it won’t be that easy, eh?” Cheng Cheng extended her index finger as well and used it to gently rub it against Shen’s index finger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Her finger lightly slid past Shen’s finger and her perfectly trimmed fingernail softly grazed past the back of Shen’s hand. Slowly, it moved toward his arm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen’s expression remained the same and he did not even retract his finger. However, a livid atmosphere emanated from him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Why do you look so unhappy?” Cheng Cheng sighed softly. “Do you really want to kill me?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Slowly, she opened her cherry lips and a pink tongue stretched out to gently lick Shen’s fingertip. Then, she put the finger into her mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A warm and wet feeling enveloped Shen’s finger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Then…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The golden light flashed out once more and Cheng Cheng’s body was disintegrated again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, in less than one second, Cheng Cheng had re-appeared on the chair.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It is useless, Shen,” said Cheng Cheng with a smile, shaking her head. “No matter how strong you are, in this space, you cannot kill me. You most certainly cannot obtain the key through force.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Then, what do I have to do?” Shen had a faint feeling that something was amiss.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Cheng Cheng seated him… … there was something amiss about her.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In the past, after the two of them broke up, Cheng Cheng would furiously want to kill him whenever they meet.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, this woman before him was clearly showing zero hostility toward him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Not even a trace of it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen was certain that the killing intent within Cheng Cheng’s eyes from back then, when they had encountered each other in the past, could not be hiddenly so perfectly to the point where not a single trace of it could be seen.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If you won’t drink, your tea will get cold.” Cheng Cheng leaned back on her chair while putting an elbow on the armrest. She then placed her chin on her hand as she raised her head to look at Shen.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After a moment of silence, Shen sat down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Back then, when they had set up the protective mechanisms to safeguard the core, they had not disclosed the contents of their respective stages. The only exception were Shen and Cheng Cheng. They had informed each other how to make it through their respective stages.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At present, however, this stage was no longer the same as the one that Cheng Cheng had informed Shen of. It was as Shen’s doppelganger had said, Cheng Cheng had come over and modified the settings for her stage.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Additionally, it would appear that it was modified specifically for him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Since it was impossible for him to obtain the key through force, he could only attempt to negotiate for it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Adam blinked, a look of curiosity flashing over his face. However, he did not speak up. Instead, he sat down cross-legged on the stretch of grasses and closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You are not just an echo, are you?” Shen picked up the cup of tea and took a sip.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes, unlike the one you set up.” Cheng Cheng nodded with a smile. Suddenly, a plate of cookies appeared on the table. “Do you want some?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen picked up a piece of cookie and pushed it onto his mouth before slowly chewing it. However, he was in no mood to discern the taste in his mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“More accurately, I am her other half.” Cheng Cheng, too, picked up a cookie and took a gentle bite. “A certain emotional self that was separated out from her personality.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen nodded silently.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You know which one, right?” Cheng Cheng gazed at Shen with a watery eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I am sorry.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“There is no need to say sorry to me.” Cheng Cheng gently shook her head. “The one who wants this apology is not me, it is her. The Cheng Cheng who only bears hatred toward you. What I want… … is not that.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What?” Shen suddenly raised his head to look at Cheng Cheng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“An explanation.” Cheng Cheng sighed. “I think, you don’t quite understand what happened to us, do you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen slowly nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“At that time, we… … were in great pain. No, more accurately speaking, back then, there was only ‘me’, not ‘we’,” said Cheng Cheng slowly. She diverted her gaze away from Shen to look up at the sky. “You did not give any explanation. You just left me, telling me that if we meet again in the future, it would be as strangers.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I cried, begged, raged. However, it changed nothing and you never told me the reason for it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Two notions raged ceaselessly within me. One believes than it is not because you do not love me. Rather, you left due to a certain reason, one that you are unable to reveal to me. The other believes that you are a fickle and unfaithful scum and everything you have said and done was just a farce.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The two thoughts continued to grow. Until one day, they could no longer exist within the same body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“So, I made a decision.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I returned here and split myself into two. No…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Cheng Cheng suddenly smiled and said, “It would be more accurate to say, she returned here and threw away every part of her that still loved you. Completely and utterly, to be sealed here, behind that door, never to see the light of day again for eternity. The only thing left in her is hatred toward you. I believe you should have encountered her before, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes.” Shen’s tone was very soft. “The present her only bears hatred toward me.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“A person who only has hatred within her will not care about explanations.” Cheng Cheng sighed. “But for me… … I have stayed in here for so long. And yet, I still could not understand. Why did you suddenly choose to leave me? I, I want you to explain it to me.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Is that the condition for handing over the key?” Shen cast his eyes at Cheng Cheng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes.” Cheng Cheng nodded. “That is the only option you have.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I am sorry.” Shen did not hesitate to shake his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Then… … you don’t plan on gong in? Since you have returned, I believe… … returning to the Longevity Palace should be very important for you.” Cheng Cheng looked at him with widened eyes, shock etched on her face. “You have seen it for yourself, using force will not allow you to obtain the key. The only option is to have me willingly give you the key.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It is due to a promise. I had promised never to tell you the truth about this matter,” said Shen with a wry smile. “If I could, I would not have waited until today.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If so, what do you plan on doing?” asked Cheng Cheng with a frown. “After she placed me here, she modified the rules of this place so that the use of force becomes useless. Having said that… … after splitting me out, she did not give me any power at all. However, I do not need to attack you. You cannot harm me in the slightest.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen maintained his state of silence.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Do you plan … … on continuing with this stalemate?” Cheng Cheng smiled. “For me, though, this is not a bad thing. At least, I can see you again. I can stay with you together like this even if we are no longer lovers.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Although this place was created by you and not me, we created Thirty-three Heavens together.” Shen shook his head slowly. “You and I both understand that the most basic rules cannot be changed by one individual. I am unconvinced that you could make the use of force completely irrelevant here.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You can keep trying. Until you give up.” Cheng Cheng stood up and walked forward to stand before Shen. Reaching out with her hand, she pressed it on Shen’s hand. “Just like earlier.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen shook his head. He did not make any other moves. Instead, he gestured with his head toward Adam. “Do you know… … who this child is?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Surely he is not your son?” Cheng Cheng looked at Adam.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Of course not.” Shen shook his head. “He is… … a mini-version administrator.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What do you mean?” Cheng Cheng was puzzled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I do not know how long you have been staying in here. However… … after we parted ways, many things happened here. As for you… … staying in this space, you likely know nothing about what happened outside.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The occupants staying in this place call it Zero City. They are very smart. They realized that they are merely temporary tenants with no ability to control Zero City. The main control system will release quests for them according to the pre-set program and provide them with some benefits, no more, no less.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“However, they want to control more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Thus, they cut out a small corner of the main control system’s screen and performed research on it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Although they were incapable of achieving their goal, they did, at the very least, accomplished something. They, using that small piece of the main control system’s screen, replicated a… … new administrator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I do not know the specifics of how they accomplished that myself. This replicated administrator is far lacking compared to the original one we created when we created Thirty-three Heavens. However, it did manage to obtain a little bit of authority.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Not much, but enough.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“For example, to guide me into the core zone and… … check out the information for the core zones.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Cheng Cheng’s face sank somewhat.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At that same instant, Adam opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Shen, I found it.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
