 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 322 Slay The Tiger!</strong></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was faced with a decisive moment!</p>
 <p>He considered his own strength… <em>I have already used the Overwhelming Sunlight Purification skill, combusting all my physical attributes. Thus, my current battle strength is at a measly zero! My biggest trump card, Bai Qi is still in the cool down period. It would be some time before Bai Qi could be summoned!</em></p>
 <p><em>Wait!</em></p>
 <p><em>Just now, GM had mentioned me killing the Fallen Avenger…</em></p>
 <p><em>Temporarily boost my battle strength?</em></p>
 <p><em>One chance?</em></p>
 <p>Back then, Chen Xiaolian had just regained his consciousness and was still feeling dazed. Thus, he had not dwelled upon it. Now that he had recalled GM’s words, he quickly opened up his personal system.</p>
 <p>There was a new unread prompt. Seeing that, Chen Xiaolian’s heart gave a pound!</p>
 <p>[System prompt: You have successfully killed this instance dungeon’s Fallen Avenger. Acquired ‘Dark Avenger’ Warsoul (1/5). You can use it to summon the Dark Avenger Warsoul. At present, this skill can only be used once. When used, the Dark Avenger will merge with your body for 30 seconds.</p>
 <p>[During that 30 seconds, the Dark Avenger will push the host’s body to optimal battle strength and further increase it by 200 %. The Dark Avenger will lock on and move to kill one designated target.</p>
 <p>[Prompt: Dark Avenger Warsoul is not in a complete state. New skills will be unlocked depending on the amount of Warsoul fragments acquired.]</p>
 <p><em>Holy shiet!</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was shocked!</p>
 <p><em>Merge body?</em></p>
 <p><em>What, merge body with that bastard Lancelot?</em></p>
 <p>However, if it means saving his own life, it was still an acceptable proposition.</p>
 <p>The key point here was… push the host’s body to optimal battle strength and further increase it by 200 %.</p>
 <p>Further increase it by 200 %! In other words, he would be able to unleash a battle strength equivalent to three times that of his optimal battle strength!</p>
 <p>This state would only last for 30 seconds. This was quite short.</p>
 <p>However, this meant that… in that 30 seconds, his battle strength would be restored to the peak and he would be able to unleash three times that battle strength!</p>
 <p>Also… could he use the Goddess of Dawn again?</p>
 <p>Triple the power of the Goddess of Dawn!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was suddenly excited!</p>
 <p>The GM’s monotonous voice rang out once more, “Although this skill is very powerful, don’t think that it is perfect. If you are planning to use your Goddess of Dawn during the time when you have three times the battle strength… that would be suicide.”</p>
 <p>“Why?”</p>
 <p>“It’s very simple. This skill that pushes you beyond your limit will have a backlash. Using the Goddess of Dawn, you obtain power by combusting all your attributes. However, that leaves you in a weakened state in the end. However, if you were triple the power of the Goddess of Dawn, your weakened state will also be increased by three times! There is no such thing as a free meal in this world. Given your present state, I estimate that three times that weakened state has a 90 % chance of putting you on the verge of death. It may be possible that you would face instant death as well.”</p>
 <p>“… … …” Chen Xiaolian was left speechless.</p>
 <p>“Having triple battle strength is enough for you to deal with the opponent. I personally do not recommend that you use the Goddess of Dawn. Besides… Dark Avenger is a force of darkness that could suppress technologically related skills. By my estimate, you do not need to use the Goddess of Dawn skill. With triple battle strength alone, you would be able to protect your own life. All you need to do is assist Roddy and get him away from the battlefield. Thus, you would have accomplished your objective.</p>
 <p>“And now, you must make your choice.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s heart pounded wildly.</p>
 <p>His first option, abandon his companion, his best friend, Roddy! This was something he could never do!</p>
 <p>His second option, hand over the control of the base to GM – more accurately, to GM’s doppelganger, let’s call it GM2. Putting his life and the life of those he cared about in the hands of others was something that Chen Xiaolian had always had a hard time accepting.</p>
 <p>However, at this moment…</p>
 <p>“Can the base’s defensive systems help me defeat the enemies outside?”</p>
 <p>“No, the base’s defensive systems are only for defence. In the absence of an invasion from the outside forces, this base’s defensive systems will never take the initiative to attack. In short, you cannot assume this base to be a war fortress. It is simply a refuge.</p>
 <p>“Making me its master will only ensure that after you have left this base, no outsiders can enter and occupy it.</p>
 <p>“You have 30 seconds of triple battle strength. That will be sufficient for you to go out and help Roddy get out of the battlefield and return to this base.</p>
 <p>“If you refuse my assistance, there is a high possibility that after you are done fighting outside, an enemy will be able to follow you into this base – since I am not controlling it, this base will be undefended.</p>
 <p>“But with me as its master, after you and Roddy have escaped the battlefield, you will be able to enter this base with my permission. This base’s defensive systems will not attack you while others cannot enter.</p>
 <p>“I must remind you, the two threats that I have mentioned before are already closing in on this little town. I estimate that they will reach the battlefield in two minutes. If you continue hesitating, this plan’s rate of success will only continue to drop.”</p>
 <p>“Fine!” Chen Xiaolian clenched his teeth and said, “I choose the second option! I will hand over the main controls to you! Now tell me, what should I do?”</p>
 <p>“Very simple, go to the Central Control room and access the main control panel. There, select transfer of highest clearance. That would be the equivalent of opening a door in the main control and I will be able to enter the heart of the main control. This process will take roughly one minute…”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was no longer hesitant. He forced his body up and staggered forward, using the wall to support himself as he made his way out of the Main Energy Control room and into the Central Control room outside.</p>
 <p>He looked at the metal orb that looked like liquid metal. Walking forward, he placed both hands upon its surface.</p>
 <p>He quickly browsed through the options until he finally found the ‘main control clearance’…</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian took a deep breath.</p>
 <p><em>Hopefully… I am making the right choice.</em></p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>A loud explosion rang out!</p>
 <p>After the light from the beam cannon had faded away, the Feral Tiger Angel stood up from within a pile of debris, both hands holding onto the shield. Part of the Feral Tiger Angel mech armour was charred. However, he howled out and his tiger head flashed. Next, a ball of light shot out toward the sky!</p>
 <p>Up in the sky, Roddy who was wearing the Floating Angel mech armour widened his eyes. He rapidly moved backward while the three Floater Cannons flying around him fired beam after beam at the incoming ball of light in an attempt to disperse the attack!</p>
 <p>However, it would appear that the ball of light possessed some form of targeting function. It flew forward at high speed, deflecting the incoming fire from the Floater Cannons and charged toward the Floating Angel!</p>
 <p>Roddy was left with no choice but to activate his defensive force field once more!</p>
 <p>This time, the resulting explosion rocked nearly every part of the little town!</p>
 <p>As the explosion spread out, Roddy who was up in the sky could sense his Floating Angel wings showing faint signs of cracking.</p>
 <p>“Too… powerful!”</p>
 <p>Roddy exhaled.</p>
 <p>How was this possible?</p>
 <p>Floating Angels should be invincible against all within and beneath [A] class!</p>
 <p>How was it that even though he had already recharged his energy reserves to max power once, he was still unable to finish off this Feral Tiger Angel?</p>
 <p>The only explanation he could come up with was: Since this Floater had belonged to Nicole, he was unable to fully utilize all of its abilities!</p>
 <p>Using this incomplete Floating Angel mech armour to go against the Feral Tiger Angel mech armour who was also an Angel mech placed Roddy in a disadvantageous position.</p>
 <p>“If so… should I summon the Mech?”</p>
 <p>Roddy considered the matter.</p>
 <p>The Mech’s summon time was only 18 seconds… after the 18 seconds was over, both the Floater and Mech would be drained of energy. If he was still incapable of finishing off the enemy, then he would be left without any battle strength!</p>
 <p>If there were any other enemies lingering around, then he would become a defenceless lamb!</p>
 <p><em>Son of a bitch! Forget it! I’ll go all out!</em></p>
 <p>As Roddy was preparing to summon the Mech…</p>
 <p>A loud noise reverberated out from deep underground!</p>
 <p>A sharp scream broke out from amid the debris of the clock tower and a girl ran out. Next, a black coloured beam shot into the sky!</p>
 <p>The black coloured beam of light had seemingly appeared from the very depths of the ground!</p>
 <p>It was a circular beam of light, roughly two meters in diameter. The beam shot out from beneath the ground and all the surrounding debris and dirt turned into ashes before disappearing in the wake of that beam of light!</p>
 <p>A terrifying corrosive power!</p>
 <p>Qimu Xi screamed wretchedly and fell. Thankfully for her, her hiding spot was not close to where the beam of light had appeared. However, the falling stones fell upon her head and the girl crouched on the ground while blood trickled down her forehead.</p>
 <p>Then…</p>
 <p>A terrifying figure emerged from within the beam of light!</p>
 <p>The moment Qimu Xi laid her eyes upon the figure, her body quaked uncontrollably!</p>
 <p>Its… the monster?!</p>
 <p>A body that was fully covered in terrifying black armour! A pair of ghastly and fiery eyes! A massive long sword in his hand!</p>
 <p>The reappearance of this nightmarish monster that had chased her all the way here caused Qimu Xi’s heart to fall into a bottomless abyss!</p>
 <p><em>Could it be… that fellow had died? This monster had killed him when he was underground?</em></p>
 <p>At that moment, the monster that had just emerged from underground was standing less than two metres away from Qimu Xi.</p>
 <p>Qimu Xi’s body turned limp and she gasped. She was no longer able to move her body and she gaped at the monster before her. After taking but one step, the monster was already beside her.</p>
 <p><em>I, I’m going to die… it’s going to kill me… in the end, I couldn’t escape… I’m so dead…</em></p>
 <p>Qimu Xi slowly closed her eyes.</p>
 <p>“I hear that you have been spending all these time digging, trying to save me… are you a marmot? Find a place to hide.”</p>
 <p>A gentle voice came from beneath the helmet of the monster.</p>
 <p>Hearing the voice, Qimu Xi suddenly became alive. She raised her head and looked at the black coloured armour…</p>
 <p>“You…”</p>
 <p>The black armoured monster stopped paying any attention to Qimu Xi. He abruptly leapt up!</p>
 <p>“Roddy! Attack together!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian sent this message to Roddy through the guild channel.</p>
 <p>Roddy who was up in the sky was in tears. He shouted, “You son of a bitch! Are you finally willing to show up, Xiaolian? Huh? Why are you wearing a black tin can?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian did not continue to speak.</p>
 <p>The amount of time he had was too precious – only 30 seconds!</p>
 <p>No, more accurately, considering the time he took to appear on the ground and reach this place, he was left with only 26 seconds!</p>
 <p>Denzel, the Feral Tiger Angel who was on the ground fell within Chen Xiaolian’s line of sight.</p>
 <p>[Target locked!].</p>
 <p>[Dark Fallen Avenger, skill activated!].</p>
 <p>This was probably the biggest weakness of this Dark Avenger skill.</p>
 <p>During combat, it could only lock onto one target!</p>
 <p>In other words, once the battle began, the Dark Avenger will face a huge drawback. No matter how many enemies there were, it will only attack the target it was locked onto!</p>
 <p>Once the target was locked onto, it was no longer possible to change the target until the battle ended.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian raised the massive black coloured long sword and black coloured flames burst out from his body. He shot forward with the sword, charging straight toward the Feral Tiger Angel!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian felt strange.</p>
 <p>Although he was the one wearing the armour… he was not the one doing battle!</p>
 <p>He was simply taking the role of a bystander.</p>
 <p>The battle techniques, manoeuvres and attacks… none of them were under his control!</p>
 <p>Instead… those were executed by the armour itself!</p>
 <p>The black coloured sword hacked down. It was not a skill that belonged to Chen Xiaolian. At present, he could only observe from within the armour.</p>
 <p>Sword of the Dark Avenger!</p>
 <p>Descend!</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Denzel saw the figure leaping through the air and hacking down at him. A veteran of countless battles, this Feral Tiger Angel did not hesitate at all and immediately responded to the incoming threat!</p>
 <p>He raised his extraordinary shield above his head, bent his knees into a crouching position and placed the Tigerfang Blade behind the shield.</p>
 <p>The black coloured massive long sword struck the shield only to be resisted by the layer of transparent qi on the surface of the shield. At the same time however, the black coloured flames on the long sword surged forth!</p>
 <p>Crackling sounds rang out as the sword and shield clashed! It was a sharp and piercing sound, one that resembled the wail of ghosts!</p>
 <p>The Feral Tiger Angel howled loudly. The ground beneath his feet released cracking sounds as the vast downward pressure inflicted by the sword caused deep cracks to appear upon the ground.</p>
 <p>As Denzel was howling, something shocking occurred!</p>
 <p>The highly durable shield was pierced through!</p>
 <p>Appearance wise, the shield was not broken. However, the black coloured flames were able to make its way past the shield!</p>
 <p>The black coloured flames then brutally slashed down on the Feral Tiger Angel’s body!</p>
 <p>Denzel bellowed in pain! He hastily unleashed the Tigerfang Blade with his right hand. The blade slid past the shield and stabbed toward the Dark Avenger!</p>
 <p>This attack was extremely vicious! It was the Feral Tiger Angel’s desperate counter attack!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian watched as the blade stabbed toward his body.</p>
 <p>The Tigerfang Blade that was made of light suddenly became dimmer as the black coloured flames on the Dark Avenger’s body devoured the light on the Tigerfang Blade.</p>
 <p>The blade then stabbed into Chen Xiaolian’s body, going all the way in until the hilt could barely be seen!</p>
 <p>However, Chen Xiaolian could sense that he had not been stabbed. The black coloured flames enveloping his body suddenly dimmed down as well.</p>
 <p>It would appear that the black coloured flames had dispelled the blade of light on the Tigerfang Blade!</p>
 <p>The Tigerfang Blade was not a physical object. Rather, it was something formed by condensing beam power. Thus, even though it had stabbed all the way into Chen Xiaolian’s body…</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian took action!</p>
 <p>At that moment, the black coloured long sword suddenly slipped to the side before slipping forward through the edge of the shield…</p>
 <p>A grating sound could be heard…</p>
 <p>The sword’s edge was swung and the Feral Tiger Angel shouted in pain as he was sent flying!</p>
 <p>Denzel’s body stumbled and flipped a distance of over 10 metres. Then, his body finally slammed into the debris of the buildings by the street!</p>
 <p>As for his shield, it dropped silently before Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p><em>He… lost his shield?</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was pleasantly surprised. This shield was a good item and he was about to reach down and pick up the shield when…</p>
 <p>He suddenly realized that he could not control his body at all!</p>
 <p>After all, it was actually the ‘Dark Avenger’ who was doing battle and not Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>“Damn it! Hurry up and pick up that good item!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian shouted out inwardly.</p>
 <p>However, the Dark Avenger simply turned around and dashed toward the Feral Tiger Angel!</p>
 <p>“Goddamnit!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian shouted in both indignation and sorrow.</p>
 <p>Feral Tiger Angel got up from within the pile of debris and Denzel looked at Chen Xiaolian with an expression of surprise.</p>
 <p>He coughed out twice and a spray of blood accompanied each cough.</p>
 <p>His Feral Tiger Angel mech armour… a cut that began from the side of his helmet went all the way down his shoulder and into his chest!</p>
 <p>His mech armour… broken!</p>
 <p>Roddy who was in the sky noted this opportune moment and he blasted Denzel with a beam cannon!</p>
 <p>Without his shield, the Feral Tiger Angel could only use his own body to take on the incoming blast!</p>
 <p>A loud sound erupted as the entire pile of debris exploded! Countless bricks and woods were torn to pieces and the Feral Tiger Angel’s figure was sent flying once more!</p>
 <p>More cracks appeared on the mech armour!</p>
 <p>It was then that Chen Xiaolian descended from the sky, hacking down with his sword, striking the back of the Feral Tiger Angel!</p>
 <p>Kacha!</p>
 <p>The back part of the Feral Tiger Angel mech armour was utterly broken! The black coloured flames covered Denzel’s eyes with darkness and his body was knocked into the air!</p>
 <p>As he was being sent flying through the air, the Floating Angel pounced down on him!</p>
 <p>The Beam Blade in Roddy’s hand stabbed into the Feral Tiger Angel’s body!</p>
 <p>The crackling sounds of electrical currents could be heard as the Beam Blade stabbed into Denzel’s abdomen area.</p>
 <p>Denzel howled out, “I am unwilling! I refuse to lose!”</p>
 <p>His eyes were bloodshot and he stared at Roddy before looking at the wound on his abdomen area.</p>
 <p>The Beam Blade had pierced through his mech armour and cut to the side…</p>
 <p>Ka!</p>
 <p>Denzel’s figure plummeted from the sky. A large wound was left on his abdomen after the Beam Blade cut its way out through the side of his body!</p>
 <p>After falling to the ground, Denzel rolled on the ground a few times. He used one hand to support himself; he cast a glance at the Dark Avenger that was not too far away from him, then he turned to look at Roddy who was in the sky.</p>
 <p>A savage expression overcame his face.</p>
 <p>“Bastard! Bastard! Bastard!”</p>
 <p>Denzel suddenly roared out and reached out with one hand. The shield that was on the ground some distance away suddenly flew up and automatically moved toward him. Then, it slid back into Denzel’s grasp.</p>
 <p>Next, Denzel made a peculiar move.</p>
 <p>He suddenly bent his body, wrapping himself into a ball like posture.</p>
 <p>The shield before him transformed, opening up and becoming a metal cover! It encased Denzel within it!</p>
 <p>The floating tiger head fell on his head and opened up its mouth!</p>
 <p>“Die, you bastards! Roaring Tiger – Electromagnetic Boom!”</p>
 <p>Weng!</p>
 <p>A strange ripple of light spread out from the tiger head’s mouth!</p>
 <p>It spread out in a manner that was seemingly both very fast and very slow.</p>
 <p>Just like a… nuclear explosion!</p>
 <p>An intense flash of light shone out, followed by a burst of radiance that enveloped all of the little town!</p>
 <p>At that very moment, it seemed as though… the sky itself had turned black!</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“What strength!”</p>
 <p>A lanky figure stood at the entrance to the little town. Watching the explosion of light spreading toward him, he sneered and lifted up one hand. A magic circle appeared before him!</p>
 <p>A humming sound echoed out as the explosion of light swept through the area!</p>
 <p>There was a solemn expression on the lanky man’s face as he continued standing within the magic circle.</p>
 <p>“Humph… I arrived right on time.”</p>
 <p>Something crawled out from the lanky man’s clothes and onto his shoulder.</p>
 <p>Surprisingly, it was a… red coloured… lizard!</p>
 <p>The lizard slid out its tongue and spoke the human tongue, “Jacob, do we have enough points?”</p>
 <p>“No… we still need to kill some more!”</p>
 <p>“Then what are you waiting for? Go, go kill them! I love the scent of blood!”</p>
 <p>Jacob laughed and stepped forward even as the explosion of light continued to spread out. He walked into the little town.</p>
 <p>…</p>
