 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Nicole is Miss Ye while Tian Lie is Da Gang.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Thinking about this, Chen Xiaolian felt his mind struggling to cope with this information.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie spread open his arms, seemingly wanting to hug him. Seeing that, Chen Xiaolian hesitated for only a moment before receiving the hug.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As the two of them hugged each other, Tian Lie snickered and spoke into Chen Xiaolian’s ear, “Hey, you are going to believe me so easily? If I were some villainous fellow, I could take advantage of this moment to stab you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Hearing that, Chen Xiaolian became completely assured. He gave a faint smile and said, “Since you said we are friends, we are friends.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… …” Tian Lie became speechless and he looked at Chen Xiaolian. Next, he frowned and said, “The more I get to know you, the harder it is to understand you. Sometimes, you are smart to the extreme, but sometimes, you are hopelessly naïve.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Cough, cough!” Sawakita Mitsuo cleared his throat loudly and waved the fan in his hand. “I am very sorry I had to interrupt this touching scene. Is your meeting of acquaintances over yet? We are still in an instance dungeon.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie tilted his head to look at the old man. Then, he walked forward and stretched his hand out. “Tian Lie.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… … the Inspector from Thorned Flower Guild?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You should say, former, the former Inspector from Thorned Flower Guild,” replied Tian Lie with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Sawakita Mitsuo.” The old man slipped the fan into the collar area behind his neck and extended his hand out toward Tian Lie.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie raised his brows and said, “The Shogunate Generalissimo, I have long since heard of your famous name – I have a list. It contains the names of famed and expert characters of this circle. They are all people I really want to kill. Your name is quite high in this list.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sawakita Mitsuo did not become infuriated. He smiled and replied, “I also have a list of people known to be very powerful. When I meet them, I must be very vigilant. They are the type that are best avoided – your name is also quite high in this list.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The two cunning fellows exchanged glances. It was the type of glance used when people of the same kind met each other. They were seemingly using their gazes to say: So, you are not some good fellow either, ha ha ha… …</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie turned around and regarded Nagase Komi for a moment. “It has been a while, little girl.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>An unshakeable feeling of terror toward Tian Lie welled up from within Nagase Komi. She subconsciously took half a step backward before forcing herself to stand upright. Biting her lip, she nodded her head, as though in greeting.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Next… … Guild Leader Phoenix. Likewise, I have long since heard of your famous name. You are also quite high in my list.” Tian Lie grinned as he waved at Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Sir Tian Lie, I have heard a lot about you.” Phoenix appeared very calm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Enough, let’s end this family reunion charade.” Nicole frowned as she walked forward to grab hold of Tian Lie’s collar. She pulled back Tian Lie, who had intended to go toward Soo Soo and say something – when Chen Xiaolian saw that, he was unable to stop himself from raising his brows.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Roddy… … could be in danger… …</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Chen Xiaolian, although there are many words that need to be said and exchanged… … let us finish this instance dungeon first. After we get out, let us find a suitable place and time to slowly discuss things through,” said Nicole as she looked at Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian nodded. “All right!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After concealing her identity for so long, it was only natural that Nicole had a lot to say to Chen Xiaolian. Likewise, could Chen Xiaolian have nothing to say to them? However, they all understood that this was not a suitable place for that it. It was even more so in terms of timing. They should complete this instance dungeon before proceeding with that.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Wait, wait a minute.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As those freaks were conversing, Lin Leyan finally, slowly made her way down the stairs.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The young woman’s shoulders were trembling somewhat, but her eyes remained fixed upon Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lin Leyan walked past the others and stood right before Chen Xiaolian. “I, want to ask you something… … we, have we met?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was a slight tremble to her voice. Although it was not very obvious, everyone there had keen senses and were able to discern that detail.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian took a deep breath and stared at Lin Leyan. There was a somewhat troubled look on his face. “Err… … you became an Awakened as well? I never imagined you would come all the way here.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When those words entered Lin Leyan’s ears, she felt as though a thunderclap was echoing within her mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>He, he really does know me!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Err, Xiaolian, your guess is wrong.” Tian Lie revealed a somewhat embarrassed look and scratched his head. “This girl did not become an Awakened. I was the one who brought her into this instance dungeon.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian was stunned. He frowned and looked at Tian Lie. “Ordinary humans can enter instance dungeons?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I used a special prop, a one-time consumable,” replied Tian Lie with a faint smile. He did not explain much, but Chen Xiaolian knew that this fellow possessed a shocking amount of abilities. It was only natural for him to possess some unknown means. He also possessed a deeper understanding of the items in the Exchange System. Since Tian Lie said he did this, it meant he had his ways.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>An ordinary human?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian inwardly gave an “Oh, no”. It would appear that those words he spoke earlier were spoken too soon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“We… really know each other? Where? Why do I not remember anything? We… … what is the relationship between us?” After saying that, Lin Leyan bit hard on her lip and stared intently at Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Hey, where did you incur this love debt?” Phoenix threw those words at Chen Xiaolian without showing any change in her expression.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Don’t bull.” Chen Xiaolian shook his head. “Due to a certain matter, I got to know her in Africa, mm… … her memories should have been erased later.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Africa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lin Leyan’s heart thumped. She immediately recalled how Tian Lie and Nicole had grown suspicious after seeing the photos she brought with her. The reason they grew suspicious was because they saw Chen Xiaolian in those photos.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Those photos were taken in Africa.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lin Leyan looked at Chen Xiaolian silently. Naturally, Chen Xiaolian could feel what was contained within her gaze.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Are you regretting it now?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“My intestines are already green from regret!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Could the heart remain unmoved?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Then, Soo Soo, who had been standing silently beside him, suddenly gave a sigh. The little girl, with an air of an aged adult, looked at Chen Xiaolian after her earnest sigh and shook her head. “Xiaolian oppa, you have to change this bad habit of leaving love debts everywhere.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Hearing those words, the people there were unable to stop themselves from breaking into smiles.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Soo Soo took the initiative to move over. She gently pulled Lin Leyan’s hand and said, “Sister.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mm, hello.” Lin Leyan felt somewhat awkward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“There is no need for you to feel so anxious or afraid. Actually, these people may seem like a complicated bunch, but their minds are all as childish as little kids. Xiaolian oppa is the most childish of them all. He is so absent-minded, it is easy to trick him – later, you do not need to worry about anything. Just stay by my side. When we leave this place, I will help you seek justice from him, all right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Hearing those words made Lin Leyan blush. She looked at Soo Soo’s little face, which was only as big as a palm and her blinking eyes, which stared at her. Lin Leyan did not know how to respond to that.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Chen Xiaolian, these two behind us are also our companions for this trip. Mm, Knight Ivan and his wife, Jenny.” Nicole had remained silent for a moment before breaking the state of silence by diverting their attention to something else. “Knight Ivan is an Awakened while his wife is an ordinary human. This time, we entered this instance dungeon together because, mm, there are some special circumstances involved. We will slowly discuss about this in detail when we get out.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Fine!” Chen Xiaolian nodded his head. “Hello, Knight Ivan.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No, call me Tom Huggins. If that is inconvenient, just call me Tom,” said Tom Huggins with a frown. “Although it was not my intention to come here, since we are already in this instance dungeon, we should just keep our thoughts to ourselves until we complete this instance dungeon. We can discuss the rest when we exit this place.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Ok, now that we have gotten to know each other, let us get our act together. It’s just an instance dungeon. None of us here are figures to be taken lightly. We will finish this together, then go out and find a place for a barbecue and beer. Those who want to reminisce can reminisce, those who want to demand repayment for love debt can go demand… …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie said those few words loudly, but Nicole gave him a furious stare, causing him to quickly shut his mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The corners of Nagase Komi’s eyes twitched. <em>It is over. No matter how you look at it, this fellow doesn’t look reliable at all. It feels, feels like there are two Teacher Sawakitas!</em></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lin Leyan’s heart roiled unsteadily. <em>Love debt… … me and that Chen Xiaolian, is there really a love debt? I… I… sigh, I cannot remember anything at all.</em></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Enough, let us talk about this instance dungeon,” said Tian Lie with a smile. “Since your two groups have joined up, I believe you must have exchanged some information. However, I have something to tell you, something that I believe you do not know of.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Hearing Tian Lie’s words, the expression on everyone’s faces grew serious.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… when this instance dungeon began, all of you must have seen what the system stated, that the participants for this instance dungeon are split into two factions, the Players and… … us.” When Tian Lie said the word “us”, he threw a strange look at Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Naturally, Chen Xiaolian understood the deeper meaning behind the word “us”.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Awakened ones and… … Irregularities. The “us” that Tian Lie spoke of implied the latter.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“However, despite the description the system had given, I have something to inform everyone. We may face some issues in this instance dungeon, but the existence known as Players is something none of us has to worry about. Because there is absolutely no way Players would appear in this instance dungeon.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Everyone grew silent.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“In other words, we are the only faction here. As long as we complete the quest given by the system, we will be able to complete this instance dungeon. Sounds simple, no?” said Tian Lie with a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian shook his head. “You are not finished, are you? Keep going.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mm, the information just now is the good news. Next, comes the bad news. This instance dungeon does not have Players, but… … there is an even more troublesome existence. This trouble… … I can only say, it may be a powerful existence that everyone here, me included, has never encountered before!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian knitted his brows. “Powerful? How powerful?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Very powerful.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“[S] class?” Chen Xiaolian smiled – truth be told, [S] class was no longer considered all that strong for him. When the word powerful was mentioned, a figure would naturally rise within his mind, the figure of Guild Leader Shen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“More powerful than [S] class.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… …” The serious look on Chen Xiaolian’s face increased by a notch. “If compared to you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Stronger than me, naturally.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If so… … if compared… … to him?” Chen Xiaolian chose his words carefully.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie did not immediately respond. He seemingly hesitated for a moment before saying, “If the ‘him’ you are talking about refers to my old boss, I can only say, congratulations, you hit the jackpot. The difficulty this time is roughly more powerful than my old boss… … twice as powerful.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian’s face finally sank.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>One Shen alone had managed to trample Chen Xiaolian, who had gone all out. Even his most powerful weapon, the Sword in the Stone was destroyed in the process.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>If so… … twice as powerful as Shen?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>How is that possible?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Did the system form its own avatar to participate?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What I mean is, in this instance dungeon are two hidden experts. Either one of them could rival my old boss. A monster of such calibre… there are two such existences in this instance dungeon.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian shut his eyes. “So difficult?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His brows were tightly furrowed together.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>If this was the level of difficulty here, there was no chance for his side to confront them at all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>An expert at Shen’s level could easily shrug off several [S] class experts.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although his side had quite a number of experts… … if he were to compare his line-up with the one that Zero City fielded when the few resident guilds had sent their leading figures up to the front, his line-up was nowhere near that – and yet, even a line-up of that level was soundly beaten by Shen alone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Here, there were two existences comparable to Shen?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“This game is too hard… …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
