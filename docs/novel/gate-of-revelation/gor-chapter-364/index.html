 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 364 Asking For Trouble</strong></p>
 <p>After embarking once more, Chen Xiaolian’s boat continued at the same pace and stayed somewhere in the middle position, neither going too fast nor too slow. His boat was neither too close to the front nor too close to the back. However, the other boats seemed to be subconsciously keeping a distance from his boat.</p>
 <p>In the afternoon, their fleet stopped to rest again. This time, the riverbank was very wide.</p>
 <p>Despite that, Hans had ordered for everyone not to disembark and instead to rest on the boats.</p>
 <p>Hans quickly sent Winston to call Chen Xiaolian over in order to discuss something.</p>
 <p>“Our progress is much slower than I had expected.”</p>
 <p>They were on Hans’ boat and there was a worried look on the German fellow’s face.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian shrugged his shoulders. This was a very normal thing.</p>
 <p>They were a group of refugees fleeing for their lives and they had to depend on their physical strength to paddle the boats most of the time. It was only natural that they would not be able to move quickly.</p>
 <p>Truth was, Hans had made the calculations and saw that there were two problems facing them: Firstly, their progress was slow. Secondly, the consumption of diesel was higher than what they had expected.</p>
 <p>“According to our calculations, our diesel would at most last us until tonight. But there is still one third of the distance to go.” Hans frowned. “Unfortunately, the terrain of the remaining one third is more complicated. Perhaps… that route might be more difficult compared to the route we had passed by in the beginning.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian expressed his understanding of the situation.</p>
 <p>Travelling through a waterway was different from travelling through a twisting river.</p>
 <p>Looking at the map, the distance between them and Congo was now only one third of the original distance. However, the river was not a straight line. Rather it was a twisting one. In fact, if they were to carefully calculate it, the remaining one third of the way might be far longer!</p>
 <p>“Maybe there is a way.” Hans looked at Chen Xiaolian. “Let’s think of something.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xialian calmly looked at the German fellow.</p>
 <p>“We’ll split up and collect the needed diesel for one boat. We’ll send some people on the boat and have it move forward at best speed to Congo’s borders. There, make contact with the people that are waiting for us… then, bring diesel back for us.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian remained silent. He simply turned around to glance at the others on the boat.</p>
 <p>Hans and the other volunteers on the boat were looking at him in anticipation.</p>
 <p>Additionally, Randall and two other mercenaries were also on the boat and there were gloomy expressions on their faces.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian sighed and said, “Who do you plan on taking responsibility for this forward team?”</p>
 <p>Hans looked at Chen Xiaolian. “I plan… to ask you for your help.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian smiled wryly.</p>
 <p>He looked at Hans and asked, “Do you trust me that much?”</p>
 <p>Randall who was standing beside interjected coldly, “Hans, there is a limit to how much trust you should put on an outsider. I will not put the lives of my own men in the hands of a brat that I do know.”</p>
 <p>“This forward team will consist of five people,” replied Hans coldly. “Randall, we’ve already agreed that both of us can send two people for this forward team. Thus, who I choose is none of your business.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian suddenly interrupted them. “Five people? Two mercenaries and two people of your choice? If so, who is the fifth?”</p>
 <p>“It’s Schneider.” Winston whose arm was still resting on the sling harrumphed.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian nodded.</p>
 <p>It would appear that this bureaucrat from UN was still fearful of death. Hearing that there was an opportunity to leave, he quickly had them sent him first.</p>
 <p>“I am not interested.” Chen Xiaolian shook his head.</p>
 <p>Hans’ face was somewhat ugly to behold and he stared intently at Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, this German fellow took a deep breath and said, “I need to talk to him in private.”</p>
 <p>There was an understanding look on Winston and the other volunteers’ faces as they left. Randall on the other hand, stared coldly at Hans until Hans faced turned hostile. Then, Randall purposely put on a smile and said, “Hurry up and make your decision! I am waiting to set off!”</p>
 <p>Then, this mercenary leader led his men away.</p>
 <p>Hans dragged Chen Xiaolian to the side of the boat and looked into Chen Xiaolian’s eyes. He said, “I need your help.”</p>
 <p>“Why me?” asked Chen Xiaolian with an amused smile.</p>
 <p>“Because I’m scared to trust Randall.” Hans exhaled. “Schneider wants in on the forward team so I have no choice but to concede. But Randall… he also wants to leave. That is why… I am very worried that once those fellows make it to Congo, they will make a run for it instead of coming back for us.</p>
 <p>“We have seriously provoked them. Even the smallest delay on their part would translate to a huge risk for us! I dare not take this risk.</p>
 <p>“I can only find the strongest person that I can trust to go with them.”</p>
 <p>Hans looked at Chen Xiaolian and said, “I think that you are the most suitable person. If they try anything… maybe you can help solve some of the issues.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian pondered it and replied, “I think that this idea of yours is very bad.”</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian turned his head to the back to indicate the fleet of boats and sneered. “These people are becoming increasingly dejected and anxious. To suddenly request diesel from them so that one boat can leave first for Congo…</p>
 <p>“Hans, try to imagine. When those people in the boats hear of this, what would they think?</p>
 <p>“They will not understand your idea of getting a forward team to get help. They will not see it that way! They will only think, the ones in the forward boat are the ones who can safely leave! And those who are left behind…</p>
 <p>“Do you understand? They will consider having a spot on that forward boat as hope for life!</p>
 <p>“The hearts of the people within this group were never united in the first place and their morale is low!</p>
 <p>“I’m willing to bet on it. Once…</p>
 <p>“Once you announced this plan of yours to them, this group will instantly break apart!</p>
 <p>“Hans, you should be well aware of just how selfish these people are.”</p>
 <p>Hans' face was ashen.</p>
 <p>“If someone throws a ruckus or if they don’t want to hand over their diesel, can you steel your heart and use force?” Chen Xiaolian sneered at the German fellow.</p>
 <p>Hans took a deep breath and said, “There is no other way… I can only steel myself. And if I can do it? Will you accept my request?”</p>
 <p>“Not enough.” Chen Xiaolian shook his head. “Even if you are willing to steel your heart and forcefully suppress those dissenting people… since this group had broken… considering how selfish they are, some might not even be thankful to you for helping them get out from Kabuka. Because of your request to have them hand over diesel for the forward team, they might end up hating you.</p>
 <p>“Trust me, what I have seen along the way made me lose all hope for these people.</p>
 <p>“The people that stay behind… for them, it will be the equivalent of taking a bunch of refugees who hate them.</p>
 <p>“I can go with the forward team, but what of those left behind? What about Lin Leyan? I am not at ease to have her stay in such a group.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian looked at Hans and said coolly, “Hans, you know full well that if not for Lin Leyan, I would have left your group. To have me go with the forward team and leave Lin Leyan behind; I am sorry, I cannot do it. Unless you agree to let me bring Lin Leyan with me.”</p>
 <p>Hans shook his head and said, “No, I need to send another person. That person will be responsible for making contact with the officials in Congo. Sending Lin Leyan would be pointless.”</p>
 <p>“Bu what about those mercenaries?” Chen Xiaolian frowned. “On what basis did Randall get two spots for his mercenary team on the forward boat?”</p>
 <p>“I had selected the smallest boat. It is the most economical in terms of diesel consumption but it can only accommodate five people.” Hans shook his head. “Randall insisted on having two spots. He also had a reason I cannot reject. He would be able to send someone to contact his colleagues from the mercenary company who are in Congo. That way, he would be able to gather reinforcements. In case some delay were to occur on the Congo government’s side, we can still hope for reinforcements from the mercenaries.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian nodded his head and said, “If so, I can only say sorry. I cannot go, I want to stay here to protect Lin Leyan. Among the people in this group, the one I want to protect most is Lin Leyan. Other than her… Hans, the lives of those refugees within this group… I don’t care one whit about them at all.”</p>
 <p>Hans said, “I’m begging you…”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian shook his head. “Sorry, it’s useless to beg. Hans, remember; from the moment we met each other, you people are the ones to owe me. I have saved you people and helped you people. You can’t possibly continue to owe me, right? I’m all right with not getting anything in return from you people. But if you ask something of me, I have the right to refuse.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Chen Xiaolian ended his conversation with Hans and headed back to his own boat.</p>
 <p>He was somewhat disappointed with Hans.</p>
 <p>The past few days, Chen Xiaolian had grown increasingly disgusted with some of the people within the group of refugees!</p>
 <p>In his opinion, Hans actions of helping them get out of Kabuka was enough.</p>
 <p>He had done enough!</p>
 <p>However, to continue taking these people with them after making it out of Kabuka was simply asking for trouble.</p>
 <p>A bunch of selfish people. Taking such a group of people with them as they try to escape, burdened with worries on how to save everyone, as though he was some God…</p>
 <p>At any rate, Chen Xiaolian had no interest in doing something as noble as that.</p>
 <p>He returned to his boat and chose not to tell Lin Leyan what Hans had requested from him.</p>
 <p>However, after resting for a few minutes, Chen Xiaolian suddenly heard the sound of the few boats in front coming together. Next, some noises erupted from some of the boats!</p>
 <p>It was as though there was an argument under way.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian sneered.</p>
 <p>He was standing at the side of the boat and was able to hear the angry howls from several refugees within a boat that was positioned not far away from him. They were howling angrily at the volunteers who were on their boat.</p>
 <p>The contents of their shouts could more or less be summarized as: The refugees refused to hand over the diesel on their boat.</p>
 <p>Some of them even accused the volunteers, “they just want to snatch our diesel and run away by themselves!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian chose not to participate in it. He simply sneered and listened quietly to the on-going arguments.</p>
 <p>In the middle of all that chaos, a gunshot sound suddenly rang out!</p>
 <p>Hans finally chose to be decisive this time.</p>
 <p>He stepped forward and fired a shot as warning to force those refugees that were surrounding them to retreat.</p>
 <p>The sound of gunfire scared off some of them. However, Chen Xiaolian was able to notice that quite a number of the refugees were revealing expressions of hatred and resentment toward Hans and the other volunteers.</p>
 <p>Hans fired his gun to suppress them and sent his men to each boat to collect the diesel. Finally, they acquired enough for the forward boat.</p>
 <p>Surprisingly, the group turned quiet. There was dead silence.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian looked at the refugees and felt that the way they looked at the volunteers resembled that of…</p>
 <p>Wolves.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian sighed.</p>
 <p><em>Humans, we truly are selfish beings.</em></p>
 <p><em>One litre of rice begets gratitude, ten litres of rice begets resentment <sup><a id="ref1" href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>.</em></p>
 <p><em>Humph!</em></p>

 <p></p>
 <p id="fn1">1 Being a little bit kind to someone in need will result in gratitude, being too kind however, will result in them resenting you.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Story:&nbsp; Once upon a time, there were two neighbouring families who were in the farming business. One of them was more capable and had more wealth but there was no hatred between them.</p>
 <p>One time however, there was a problem with the poorer one's harvest and they could only lie down and wait for death. At that time, the richer one had bought a lot of rice. Since they were neighbours, he decided to give them <u>one litre of rice</u> to help them through their disaster.</p>
 <p>The poorer one was extremely grateful to the richer one. After surviving through the disaster, he went to thank the richer one. As they were chatting, he talked about how he had yet to get the seeds for next year. The richer one said that he still have a lot with him and offered the poorer one <u>ten litres of rice</u>.</p>
 <p>The poorer one happily took the rice home. But his brother said, "What else can we do with it but eat it? Other than that, it is just seeds for next year. If he's so wealthy, he should give us more rice and some money. He's being too much."</p>
 <p>Those words found their way to the richer one's ears and he became enraged. Since then, those two families hated each other.<a title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text." href="#ref1">↩</a></p>
