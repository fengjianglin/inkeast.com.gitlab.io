 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 514 Irrevocable</strong></p>
 <p>Evacuate!</p>
 <p>The room was in utter silence. Angel Wu, Bluesea and the Guild Leaders from the other two resident guilds exchanged looks.</p>
 <p>For everyone present, the events of this night were like a roller coaster ride.</p>
 <p>First, Zero City’s system shut down on them and the control over all the programs of Zero City were wrested away from their hands. They were in danger of trapped within Zero City and dying within. Later on, Zero City inexplicably returned online and everything was restored to its normal state.</p>
 <p>However, before they had the chance to celebrate, they found that the ‘outer passageway program’ that had been protecting Zero City had disappeared.</p>
 <p>This place that everyone considered to be a safe home had now become a defenceless city.</p>
 <p>The ups and downs of life here was simply too much…</p>
 <p>“This is serious.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, I am of the opinion that we must gather every member of the Board of Patriarchs to make this decision.”</p>
 <p>“An evacuation would require drawing up a plan. There are many equipment and materials left in our workshops.”</p>
 <p>“If we are to evacuate, we would need to transfer the materials. That requires a great deal of transport capacity. The responsibility for that requires allocation.”</p>
 <p>“At present, no one could know if this decision is the right one or not. I believe this has to be a collective decision.”</p>
 <p>The lead members from the other two guilds began discussing the matter in whispers.</p>
 <p>As those leading members were exchanging glances…</p>
 <p>The Angel Corps staff member who had reported the situation was unable to stop himself and he shouted out, “What are you people waiting for?”</p>
 <p>“?” Everyone cast looks of surprise at this minor character.</p>
 <p>There was a livid expression on his face as he clenched his fist tightly. Next, he swept a furious gaze at Bluesea and the other two Guild Leaders of Zero City’s resident guilds.</p>
 <p>At that very moment, this minor character appeared fearless despite facing the Guild Leaders. He abruptly shouted with all his might, “It is bad enough that the Board of Patriarchs would normally drag things out, but this is now a matter of life and death! Even at this moment, you fellows still want to play your pointless and despicable games of balancing the board?”</p>
 <p>“Hey! What do you think you are talking about?” A bearded man standing beside the white-robed, magus Guild Leader retorted angrily, “Who do you think you are? You dare use such a tone against the members of the Board?”</p>
 <p>The bearded man wore leather vest and carried two pitchforks behind his back. He also had a large revolver hanging off his waist.</p>
 <p>The other members from the resident guilds also cast looks of dissatisfaction at this minor character from the Angel Corps.</p>
 <p>Seeing their stares however did not cow him. He suddenly moved to grab the Angel Corps cap that he was wearing on his head and threw it heavily on the table.</p>
 <p>Next, he shouted furiously.</p>
 <p>“Were my words false? In these past three years, you people have held the reigns over the Board of Patriarchs and the speed at which you handle things have gotten slower and slower! Even the matter of repairing the ecological system was delayed by you people for over half a year! Last year, we succeeded in calculating out that detail regarding Zero City’s power and came up with four proposals for the Board of Patriarchs. What was the result? Six months! Even after six months, you people are still arguing over how to allocate the matter! Last month, due to Blood Verdict, you people suspended all proposals from going in! Normally speaking, Zero City’s automatic defence system should have undergone maintenance once every six months! You people dragged the matter for a good 41 days without giving us any answer! The backup operating program for the reserve power system is already out of service for four months and yet you people are still arguing endlessly over how much each of you should be getting!</p>
 <p>“Enough! Enough! Seriously *** enough!</p>
 <p>“You people are not qualified to be members of the Board of Patriarchs! You people are just a bunch of selfish asses who couldn’t care less what happens to Zero City as long as your little guild gets its way! A bunch of disgraceful bureaucrats! Politicians!”</p>
 <p>Angel Wu suddenly shouted in a heavy tone, “Gibbs!”</p>
 <p>The Angel Corps staff member’s body flinched and he laboured to turn around to look at his leader.</p>
 <p>“Mr Gibbs, remember your position and pay attention to your words!”</p>
 <p>“Sir.” The one called Gibbs appeared spent. He raised his head to look at Angel Wu and said, “I know exactly what I am doing. It is just that, even at this point in time, they are still hesitating. They are still trying to shirk away from their responsibilities and trying to scheme on how to benefit their own little guild. They are a bunch of idiots who do not understand the meaning of death!”</p>
 <p>Gibbs sneered and pointed at the door. “You people are still concerned about transfer of supplies in your respective guild’s warehouses and factories, aren’t you?”</p>
 <p>“Let me tell you what the reality is!</p>
 <p>“The reality is, our ‘main gate’ is now open! Zero City is no longer protecting the location of its main gate. In the past, thanks to Zero City’s security system, the location of the main gate in the outside world would constantly shift about. Even if our enemies wanted to find the main gate, they would have a difficult time calculating out the exact location of the main gate!</p>
 <p>“But things are different now! Without Zero City’s security system to protect the main gate, its location is no longer shifting around. At this moment, the location of our main gate is fixed at a certain coordinate in the outside world. It is fixed there for good!</p>
 <p>“Our enemies will find it soon enough and breach inside!</p>
 <p>“There would be countless Electronic Guardians among them! The main system would mobilize all its resources to attack us!</p>
 <p>“And yet, you people are still thinking about fighting for your own guild’s interest?</p>
 <p>“Absurd!”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Gibbs gave a harrumph and turned around to look at Angel Wu. He straightened his body and made a bow. “Sir, I am done speaking out my mind. If you want to punish me, I will accept it.”</p>
 <p>Angel Wu gave Gibbs a long, hard look before saying, “Gibbs, as of now, you are suspended indefinitely. That is the punishment for your contemptuous words and disrespect toward the members of the Board of Patriarchs. You may leave now.”</p>
 <p>Hearing Angel Wu’s decision, the bearded man harrumphed in dissatisfaction. However, the white-robed magus, the Guild Leader, who was standing beside him, shook his head at him. Seeing that, the bearded man simply shut his mouth.</p>
 <p>“Yes, sir. I will be leaving now.”</p>
 <p>Gibbs nodded and strode toward the door. When he reached the door, he abruptly halted his steps. Next, he turned around to look at Angel Wu. “Sir, this is my final suggestion… … leave! Everyone should hurry and leave Zero City! The faster the better! The more the better!”</p>
 <p>After saying that, he looked at the members of the resident guilds and said coldly, “I don’t care what you want to do. I will be heading home to get my loved ones and leave this place as soon as possible.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Gibbs rushed out through the door without glancing back.</p>
 <p>Before leaving, he ripped out the Angel Corps badge on his chest and shoved it into the hands of another Angel Corps member who was standing by the doorway. Gibbs whispered, “If you can, leave immediately!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>There was an awkward atmosphere within the room. The members of the Angel Corps all looked toward their leader, Angel Wu.</p>
 <p>Angel Wu looked at Bluesea and the other Guild Leaders.</p>
 <p>“What do you think about this?”</p>
 <p>No one spoke.</p>
 <p>The light within Angel Wu’s eyes seemingly turned dim. He shook his head. There was a look of great disappointment in his eyes.</p>
 <p>It was then that Bluesea suddenly spoke up.</p>
 <p>“My decision is to evacuate.”</p>
 <p>“Bluesea, Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild has no authority to make this decision alone. Your Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild do not have the final say in Zero City.” One of the members from the resident guilds interjected coldly.</p>
 <p>Bluesea gave that person a glance and said, “I have no intention of ordering you people around. I am simply making the decision for Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild. If you people want to hold a meeting here and discuss things, that is up to you. The meaning behind my words is, Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild will immediately begin evacuation procedure. As its Guild Leader, I have the authority to make this decision for my guild.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Bluesea turned around, grabbed Chen Xiaolian’s arm and pulled him along as he walked out the door. Seeing that their leader had left, the members of Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild quickly followed suit.</p>
 <p>The number of people inside the room immediately grew less.</p>
 <p>“Bastard!”</p>
 <p>“Humph!”</p>
 <p>“He is not giving the Board of Patriarchs any respect!”</p>
 <p>Angel Wu looked at them and suddenly let out a sigh. He turned to the assistant standing beside him and whispered, “All combat personnel from Angel Corps are to enter a state of emergency, be ready for combat at any moment. Open up the armoury. Everyone must be ready for combat!”</p>
 <p>After a pause, Angel Wu quickly said, “Send a team to every part of the city and have the outsiders evacuate. Tell them to leave immediately through the main passageway in the Central District! The faster the better! If any of them questions the team or refuses, I authorize the use of force… … no, forget it. No need to resort to force. If they want to leave, they can leave. If they don’t, there is no need to waste any time on them. Now… … move out!”</p>
 <p>“Affirmative!”</p>
 <p>His assistant straightened his body before hastily making his way out of the room.</p>
 <p>“Gentlemen.” Angel Wu looked at the members from the other resident guilds. “You people have the right to continue your discussion. However, the Angel Corps will be taking action to evacuate on its own. It is up to you whether you want to leave or not.”</p>
 <p>“Angel Wu! According to Zero City’s rules, only the Board of Patriarchs has the authority to make such a decision! Evacuating the entire city… …&nbsp; is the Angel Corps trying to override the Board of Patriarchs?”</p>
 <p>“That is right! Even if there is an enemy invasion, should we just give up on Zero City, our home? We have a great deal of power. How many generations have held onto Zero City? Our resident guilds and the Angel Corps, could we not have enough strength to protect our own home?”</p>
 <p>Angel Wu was in no mood to argue with them.</p>
 <p>He had already made it to the side of the table. His hand suddenly moved and grabbed the cap left by Gibbs. After feeling it for a moment, he said coolly, “You people have the right to refuse. However, do not forget something! The Angel Corps was never subordinate to the Board of Patriarchs! Due to my order to evacuate, you people may hold a meeting to impeach me. Thus… … have a good and long meeting!”</p>
 <p>Having said that, Angel Wu turned to his men and shouted, “Let us go. This place has no need of us! Now that most of the systems have returned to normal, everyone is to evacuate! Everyone is to enter a combat-ready state. The same goes for civilian personnel!”</p>
 <p>Angel Wu led his Angel Corps members out of the room, leaving only tens of people from the two resident guilds inside.</p>
 <p>There were expressions of fury on their faces. The only exception were the Guild Leaders and Deputy Guild Leaders.</p>
 <p>They exchanged glances and shook their heads before sighing.</p>
 <p>“Was that necessary?”</p>
 <p>“Angel Wu is being rash as well.”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>After walking out from the Board of Patriarchs main control room, Bluesea abruptly stopped in the lobby outside. Behind him, Guan Shan and the other members from Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild stopped in their tracks. Everyone looked nervously at their leader, but chose not to say anything. All of them appeared to be waiting for Bluesea’s command.</p>
 <p>Bluesea, on the other hand, was staring at Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>“Xiaolian, if you can do something, do it now! The situation does not permit me to slowly discuss things with you.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian looked at Bluesea.</p>
 <p>“I know that something must have happened to you, right? Right now, I do not want to ask too much. I just want to know if you have any solution for this matter we are facing.”</p>
 <p>“… … I can try.”</p>
 <p>“Good!” Bluesea then turned around to face the others. “This is my order, all members are to return to our hive headquarters and enter the highest combat-ready state! Guan Shan, take my badge and bring some men to our warehouse and factory to move the supplies… … mm, just bring those of the [A] class. As for the rest, just abandon them.”</p>
 <p>“Guild Leader?” Guan Shan was stunned.</p>
 <p>“Just carry it out.” Bluesea’s face was devoid of emotion.</p>
 <p>Guan Shan dared not say anything else. He simply led several other members with him as he quickly left.</p>
 <p>“I… need to go to the place you all call the ‘main gate’.” Chen Xiaolian looked at Bluesea.</p>
 <p>“I will accompany you.”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>A few minutes later, Chen Xiaolian and Bluesea stood within the central square in the public area within Zero City’s Central District,</p>
 <p>As for the other members of Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild, Bluesea had sent them back to the hive like headquarters to proceed with evacuation and the moving of the supplies.</p>
 <p>For Awakened ones, moving of supplies and materials would certainly be easier compared to the average person thanks to the existence of storage equipment.</p>
 <p>However, their guild was one of Zero City’s resident guilds. Moving the supplies and materials of such a guild would prove to be a humongous project.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian had personally entered Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild’s warehouse before. There, he had seen the mountain like pile of materials stored inside the warehouse.</p>
 <p>Additionally, every resident guild also had their own factory, which they would use to produce many special equipment and resources.</p>
 <p>Moving all those was not something that could be accomplished in just three or five days.</p>
 <p>Now however, Bluesea had given the command to only take those of the [A] class and abandon the rest.</p>
 <p>Thankfully, Bluesea had the reputation and might for this. Additionally, he was presently the only leading figure left in Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild. Thus, no one dared to defy his orders. If not for that, the other members would find it hard to obey such an order.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian now stood in the central public area and observed the so-called ‘main gate’.</p>
 <p>It was a large teleportation matrix on the ground of the central square.</p>
 <p>“The main gate really is open.” Bluesea observed the flashing green light on the teleportation matrix. Clearly, the gate was not closed and was instead in an opened state.</p>
 <p>Bluesea looked at Chen Xiaolian. “Do you have any way to close it off?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian did not say anything. He stepped into the teleportation matrix and closed his eyes. He could sense the flow of energy here.</p>
 <p>“Now… … close.” Chen Xiaolian mumbled inwardly.</p>
 <p>At that very moment, a reply came to him from his personal system.</p>
 <p>[????: Command could not be executed. This command goes against your earlier command, one given with an even higher level of authority.]</p>
 <p><em>Eh?</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was stunned.</p>
 <p><em>This means…</em></p>
 <p><em>I had given a command earlier? One that goes against the command to close the ‘main gate’? But why can’t I remember that?</em></p>
 <p><em>Could I have been the one who requested the opening of the main gate</em>? A tangled notion bubbled out from Chen Xiaolian’s mind.</p>
 <p>“It doesn’t matter! Close the main gate! Cancel the previous command – regardless of what it is!”</p>
 <p>[????: Invalid command! The previous command is irrevocable!]</p>
 <p>“F**K!!!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was unable to stop himself from raising his head to shout, “Zero City! What is going on here?”</p>
 <p>Bluesea, who was standing beside, witnessed this move from Chen Xiaolian. However, he simply bit his lips and said nothing.</p>
 <p>Finally, the voice that Chen Xiaolian both hated and liked resounded within his ears.</p>
 <p>It was Zero City’s cold and emotionless voice. It intoned within Chen Xiaolian’s mind.</p>
 <p>“Back in Room Zero, you issued a command and marked it as irrevocable – in other words, the moment you gave that command, you predicted that you yourself would attempt to cancel it later on… … thus, you made an extra note beside the command. I am presently just following your previous command.”</p>
 <p>“What is that command!” Chen Xiaolian asked in rage.</p>
 <p>“I am sorry, I do not know.”</p>
 <p>Despite saying the word “sorry”, Zero City’s voice remained emotionless, devoid of any hint of a sorry feeling.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was stunned. “You do not know? What is that supposed to mean?”</p>
 <p>“It means that you, the one holding the highest authority, had deleted that memory away … … that includes my memories of that command. Additionally, the present you have acquired the highest authority over Zero City, allowing you to exert control over everything within Zero City. However… … a portion of this authority… … you yourself had chosen to seal that authority away. This includes the authority over the outer passageway program. At present, neither you nor I could interfere with this matter.”</p>
 <p>“In other words, the irrevocable command that I issued previously is connected to the opening of the ‘main gate’? Can’t you help me analyse what the command is? Aren’t you a super-intelligent being?” Chen Xiaolian took a deep breath and quickly continued, “Which portion of my authority did I seal away? List down those parts of the authority that I had sealed away and we will be able to speculate what the irrevocable command is! Hurry!”</p>
 <p>“I cannot comply.” A trace of emotion finally appeared within Zero City’s voice – however, it was not a likeable emotion. It was a hint of mockery.</p>
 <p>Zero City continued, “The you back in Room Zero was very brilliant and cunning… it would appear that you had decided to temporarily hide this matter from even yourself. Thus, the you from back then issued this command to me: I am not allowed to make any attempts to speculate anything related to this matter. I am also not allowed to reveal which parts of your authority are sealed. I am a program. Thus, I must follow your commands. Thus… … I am sorry to say that I cannot comply with your current commands. Because…”</p>
 <p>“Because, back when I was in Room Zero, I gave you an irrevocable command, right?” Chen Xiaolian was so furious his teeth itched.</p>
 <p><em>What could I do? Beat myself up?</em></p>
 <p><em>The problem here is… … what happened in Room Zero?</em></p>
 <p><em>What could make me do something so strange?</em></p>
 <p><em>Room Zero. Just what had happened back then?</em></p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>On a certain peak of the Alps mountain range…</p>
 <p>There on the mountains covered by white snow all year round, a small figure could be seen making his way through the col.</p>
 <p>He wore white coloured leather clothes and his entire being appeared one with the white snowy background.</p>
 <p>However, he was not holding onto an ice axe commonly used by mountaineers. Instead, he held onto… … an… …</p>
 <p>Umbrella!</p>
 <p>Mr San raised his head and looked at the sky. The two differing curtains of light collided against one another. In the end, the wondrous scene gradually faded away…</p>
 <p>He gave a sigh and pulled off his goggles. He observed the sky that had been restored to its normal colour of blue.</p>
 <p>A complicated expression appeared on Mr San’s face.</p>
 <p>“So… … is it finally starting?”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“No, all combat personnel are to stay in position. Assemble at the designated location. Without my command, no one is allowed to enter the war zone.”</p>
 <p>Shen already had his clothes on. He stood before the mirror and put some finishing touches on his collar.</p>
 <p>Beside him stood his muscular driver.</p>
 <p>“Everyone be on standby? Esteemed Guild Leader, the quest given by the system this time is very strange… … are we not going to do this quest? If we are too late, we may get left behind… … Zero City holds many enticing materials and supplies… … by destroying Zero City, the system would certainly reward us abundantly!”</p>
 <p>Shen turned around and looked at his new assistant. Then, he suddenly broke into a laughter.</p>
 <p>“Who said we are going to destroy Zero City?”</p>
 <p>“Eh?” The muscular man was stunned. “Are we not destroying Zero City? If not, then…”</p>
 <p>“We… are… going… to… capture it!”</p>
 <p>There was a wicked and glorious smile on Shen’s face.</p>
 <p>…</p>
