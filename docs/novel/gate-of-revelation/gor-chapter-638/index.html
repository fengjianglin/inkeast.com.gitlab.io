 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 638 King! </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“For real?” Jaina’s eyes immediately lit up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At present, nearly all the Irregularities within World’s End had come together to establish the Coalition to clear up the Awakened ones. Even so, no one could be certain about their chances of success.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At any rate, new instance dungeons and Awakened ones would constantly be sent in. In comparison, the number of Irregularities will not increase. When they could actually clear all the Awakened ones was a faraway question. They also did not know when the Upper Plane might find out about the irregular situation here.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It could be within 10 days, it could be in 100 days, it could be that they would never find out, or… … the next second.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, if an Irregularity had acquired a way to avoid the manual clearing of the Development Team…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“But…” Jaina pointed at Yang Lin and the others with a puzzled look. “What does that have to do with these fellows?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast did not reply Jaina’s question. Instead, he turned to face Yang Lin. “You fellows know about our clearing operation and the existence of Irregularities. Who told you fellows about us?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Yang Lin sneered, not answering.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Not going to answer?” Sebast crouched down to pick up the M1903 from the ground. With a smile, he said, “Using a crappy weapon like this to fight us, you are too naïve. Only a small number of Irregularities here could be killed off by something as crappy as this. However, you fellows…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Holding the rifle with one hand, he aimed it at Yang Lin’s head and revealed his teeth-exposing grin. “You fellows are probably not bulletproof, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Yang Lin looked at Sebast calmly, revealing no sign of opening up despite the rifle muzzle pointing at his forehead.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Not afraid of death, very gutsy.” Sebast nodded, and slowly moved the rifle muzzle away from Yang Lin’s forehead to the nearby Grace. “If so, you probably won’t mind seeing your companion dying before you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing that Sebast’s index finger was on the trigger, Grace struggled frantically. However, the thick layer of blood-coloured adhesive had wrapped her up tightly. No matter how hard she tried, she was unable to break her way out. All she could do was whine in a low tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“She is not my companions. However, it matters not.” Looking at where Sebast was aiming with the rifle, Yang Lin said with a cold gaze, “Open fire all you want. Regardless if you do or not, we, the Awakened ones, will die anyway.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>By then, Sebast had turned away from Yang Lin. He looked at Grace, who was frantically struggling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The desire to survive reflecting off the woman’s eyes was the strongest one that Sebast had ever seen.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Do you… … wish to say something?” The moment Sebast uttered those words, Grace began to nod her head furiously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast smiled. Without making any moves on his part, the blood-coloured layer of adhesive on Grace’s body receded slightly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The moment the layer of blood-coloured adhesive receded from her mouth, Grace did not even bother gasping for breath. The first thing she did was to shout, “I… … I know who that person is!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You shut…” Yang Lin snapped out. However, he only managed to utter those two words before the blood-coloured adhesive on his body moved up to seal his mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It seems, not everyone is as gutsy as you.” Sebast gave Yang Lin a ridiculing look before turning to face Grace. “Out with it, then. That Irregularity traitor… … who is it?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I… … if I tell you… … can you spare me?” asked Grace gingerly as she looked at Sebast, her body quaking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Of course, I <em>can</em>.” Sebast smiled. “Clearing operation is only for the sake of restoring World’s End to normalcy and avoid the Development Team’s manual clearing of everything here. If the information you give us can help us deal with this situation, naturally, there will be no need for us to kill you fellows.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“All right!” Grace collected herself somewhat and calmed her rate of breathing. “That person… … is called Chen Xiaolian.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Hearing that name, Sebast was instantly stunned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He had not expected to hear that name again here.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing the look of shock on Sebast’s face, Grace became stumped. Not knowing if she had said the wrong thing, she shrunk back in fear.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It is nothing, keep talking.” With a smile on his face, Sebast waved at her. “This Chen Xiaolian, he is an Irregularity?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I am not sure… … what an Irregularity is… … at any rate, like you people, he has special powers.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast nodded. “Then, how did you fellows get to know him?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The foodstuffs in our town is growing scarce. So, Bluesea led some of us with him to find food…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Stammering, Grace then recounted how they were attacked by Deiha in the Manhattan instance dungeon, how they were saved by Chen Xiaolian, the fight between him and Wu Ya, and their trip back to the town.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Throughout the whole story, Sebast had not interrupted her at all. He simply listened to her with a faint smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“In other words…” After Grace was finished, Sebast reached out with his hand to rub his chin. He slowly spoke up, “Before he fought Wu Ya, he already knew the situation with World’s End?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Wu Ya… … is that snake-headed dragon?” Grace considered it before carefully responding, “They did talk for a long time. However, back then, we were too far away. We do not know what they were talking about.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Wu Ya would have informed him.” There was the same faint smile on Sebast’s face. “For the kid to seriously wound Wu Ya, he is quite powerful. Although Wu Ya is an arrogant fellow, he is not reckless. The Coalition is now lacking manpower for the clearing operation. After encountering someone strong, he will definitely try to recruit him.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mr Wu Ya… … was wounded by that person? That is impossible!” Jaina, who was behind Sebast exclaimed. “Mr Sebast, how did you know that!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When Jaina interrupted Sebast, his face flickered. However, no one noticed it. Ignoring Jaina’s question, Sebast continued asking Grace, “If so, why was Chen Xiaolian willing to go against Wu Ya and the Coalition to protect you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It seems… … it is due to Bluesea.” Grace paused for a moment. “I overheard some of their conversation. Though incomplete, I heard that he used to know Bluesea. However, Bluesea no longer recognize him.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That Bluesea fellow is also an Awakened. After having his memories erased, it is only natural that he would be unable to remember Chen Xiaolian. However, that… … is not enough.” Sebast slowly shook his head. “No matter how good their relationship may have been, it is still not as important as his own life. Unless, that Chen Xiaolian is certain that he will not be killed by the manual clearing of World’s End. However, there is a problem…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast turned to face Jaina. “The timing is not right. The first of those three corpses were found several days ago. &nbsp; Additionally, the instance dungeons they were in charge of are very far from Manhattan. It is unlikely to be this Chen Xiaolian’s doing.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You mean to say… … he is not the one you are looking for?” After considering it for a moment, Jaina asked. Then, she saw Duan Gang appear through the corner of a street.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His right hand held onto a spider silk rope, which was connected to tens of white-coloured cocoons. The cocoons writhed as Duan Gang pulled them across the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mr Sebast, your life signature detector.” Although he was dragging tens of those cocoons, Duan Gang appeared in no way strained. He strode forward until he was standing before Sebast. Pulling off the monocle on his face, he said, “When I was attempting to capture them, five ran into the spell array and died. Those that are still alive are all here. Additionally…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Duan Gang turned to look at the cocoon right behind him. There was a dark red mark on the surface of the cocoon. Pulling the spider silk rope, he dragged the cocoon forward until it was before him. “This fellow is different from the others.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It’s been hard on you.” Sebast smiled courteously at Duan Gang as he took back his life signature detector. Walking toward the marked cocoon, he asked, “What is different?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Among all these fellows, he is the only one who did not try to run away. On the contrary, after seeing me, he quickly got on his knees and begged for mercy, saying that he has a secret to tell me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What secret?” Sebast looked at Duan Gang.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I did not give him the chance to talk.” Duan Gang shook his head. “At present, this instance dungeon is under you. So, I just brought him over.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Very well done.” Sebast smiled. Extending his index finger, he then placed it on the surface of the marked cocoon. His finger became like a sharp blade; with a gentle tracing movement, he made a smooth cut on the cocoon to reveal a pale and fearful face within it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast’s finger moved deftly so that only the head portion of the cocoon was split open. The other parts of the person’s body remained wrapped up by the cocoon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Out with it, then.” Sebast smiled at the man in the cocoon. “If I find your answer satisfactory, I will let you live.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes… yes…” The man, despite his tied-up state, did his best to nod his head. “My name… is Lu Leiya.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I am not interested in your name.” Sebast impatiently interrupted Lu Leiya. “Out with it. What is the secret?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lu Leiya was seemingly stabbed by those words. He shrunk his body slightly before saying, “I… … I know of one person who has figured out how to go back!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Go back?” Sebast’s eyes immediately narrowed. “What do you mean by the words ‘go back?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Go back… … means to go back! Go back to our original world! Go back… … to the world of the living!” Lu Leiya shouted out anxiously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The smile on Sebast’s face immediately vanished while his gaze became as sharp as a knife.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Jaina and Duan Gang, who were standing behind him, released cries of shock.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mr Sebast, this… … how is this possible?” Jaina was the first to ask.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As for Duan Gang, he lowered his head, hiding the look of regret and greed in his eyes deep within himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>If… … if what this man said is true…</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He regretted not asking Lu Leiya in advance what the secret was.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Now, everything was in Sebast’s hands.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Speak up, then. What is the way to return?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast extended his hand, tracing it down the opened gap on the cocoon enveloping Lu Leiya. The cocoon was split open completely, freeing Lu Leiya’s whole body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lu Leiya quickly shook the cocoon off and humbly bowed toward Sebast. “Mister, I myself do not know how to return. However, I know… … the name of the person who knows the method and where that person is.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Chen Xiaolian?” By then, Sebast had recollected himself. He smiled at Lu Leiya again and said, “The person you are talking about, it is him, isn’t it?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes! Yes! That’s him!” Lu Leiya frantically nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“How did you find you about it? Did he mention it to you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No, he did not.” Lu Leiya quickly shook his head. “It is just my speculation. He had mentioned that he came here to find a girl called Qiao Qiao. He had committed suicide to come here. Back then… … Bluesea had asked him if there is any way to return. Although he said no… … at that moment, he had hesitated for an instant. Additionally, there was that look on his face.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lu Leiya smiled and said, “Back in the day… … I had watched a US TV series called Lie To Me. In the series, they talked about how a human’s microexpressions will betray their inner thoughts. The expression on Chen Xiaolian’s face back then was certainly the type that will only appear when someone is lying! He just didn’t want to tell me and Bluesea about it, that is why he lied!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mm…” Sebast knitted his brows and pondered the issue for a moment before raising his head up. “If so, where is this Chen Xiaolian now?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“He has already left with Bluesea.” Lu Leiya gritted his teeth. “In order to find that girl called Qiao Qiao! He must have… … intended to find that Qiao Qiao, then leave this World’s End together with her and Bluesea!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What do you two think?” Sebast turned to look at Duan Gang and Jaina.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“These two fellow’s statements support each other; so, they should not be lying.” Jaina thought about it. “However, there is an issue… … before their deaths, Irregularities should not know about the existence of World’s End, what more a way to return after death! If he had actually committed suicide to enter World’s End with the plan to take someone back with him, this plan… … who had informed him about this? Besides… … I have been in World’s End for a long time now. Yet, I have not heard about any Irregularity who made it out of this place!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You’ve never heard about it because you have not been here long enough.” Sebast’s face suddenly revealed a peculiar expression. “Who told you that no one had left World’s End before?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“There is… … such a case? Who is that person?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Jaina and Duan Gang’s eyes immediately blazed with fervour.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“One… … whose name you have absolutely never heard of. That name has become a taboo within World’s End. Almost all who once knew of his existence are dead. Even among those few who remain, not a single one dares utter his name again.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast raised his head to look at the sky. After a long time, he said with a soft voice, “Back then, all the Irregularities within World’s End were his subjects. As for him…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“He was this place’s… King!”</span></p>
