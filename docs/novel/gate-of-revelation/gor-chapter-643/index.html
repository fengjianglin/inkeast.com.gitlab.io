 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 643 Forbidden Name! Bai Qi! </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Hearing Bai Qi’s name, Sebast’s whole body flinched.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Damn it! What did you just say?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Dread contorted the muscles on his face and his fists tightened as he glared at Sister Yun. “You… … are you mad? That name… … how did you know that name? That name is a taboo in World’s End! No one, no one may utter that name ever again!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Bai Qi’s name is a taboo? I didn’t know that.” Sister Yun appeared unaffected by the agitated look on Sebast’s face. Instead, she shook her head in indifference. “He is just someone who had long since left this place. You fear him to such an extreme? Looks like the [S] class you mentioned is nothing great after all.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Damned woman! I will rip your mouth! I will make it so you can never utter that accursed name again!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was a near-crazed look on Sebast’s face as his right hand formed a fist and he lashed out with it. However, the fist did not shoot toward Sister Yun. Instead, he punched the ground beneath him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Right after, blood gushed out like a fountain from the air and spread out. With Sebast in the centre, the blood began expanding rapidly until it formed a pool of blood. It was so vast that their eyes could not see its edge.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Rather, it was a… … sea of blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Countless shrieks began to fill the air within the sea of blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian knitted his brows and looked down at the sea of blood that had gone all the way up to his thighs. Despite the absence of winds, the surface of the sea of blood roiled to form a face contorted in pain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I have to thank you, Chen Xiaolian! Do you know how long I have been keeping an eye on Wu Ya? If you had not seriously wounded him, I would likely have no chance to suck his blood even after another ten thousand cycles! And now – with the blood of the magic dragon, I can complete this ultimate Bloodsoul Lake!” Although Sebast was talking to Chen Xiaolian, he continued to stare at Sister Yun. Grinning ferociously, he said, “Now, what other damned words do you have to say?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His body, which maintained a straight posture, suddenly sank down at a noticeable rate. The surface level of the sea of blood rose up to his thighs, then his waist, his shoulders. Finally, all of him had submerged into the sea of blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Only Sebast’s voice remained, echoing through the sky above the sea of blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Now, I am the Bloodsoul Lake, and the Bloodsoul Lake… … is me!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A gigantic, blood-coloured arm, formed by the sea of blood, rose up abruptly. The arm tightened its fist and slammed down on the figures below.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Blood trickled down from the fingertips of the giant arm. When the trickling blood finally reached the bottom part of the arm, they disappeared only to reappear on the fingertips.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Aaa-“</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Toto screamed out and immediately crouched down, covering his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He had been following Sister Yun and had seen his fair share of killings. And yet, despite knowing that those things cannot harm him, he was still a little boy in the end. In face of such a terrifying image, he could not help but feel fearful.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea kicked the ground. Even with the sea of blood’s obstruction, he was still able to jump up to a height of over 10 metres. Then, he swung his right hand and the hardened blade on his right hand slashed out in the direction of the falling fist of blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The blade swing created a crescent wind blade, which struck the fist. However, all it did was create a minor ripple on the surface of the fist.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea took a deep breath and brandished his blade again. Just as he was about to finish his swing…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Move it!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A harsh grunt sounded out. Next, through the corner of his eyes, Bluesea watched as a silver glow shot up to the sky like a soaring dragon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Shatter!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The wind blade that Bluesea had unleashed earlier had only managed to create ripples on the surface of the fist. When the silver glow struck the fist, however, the fist of blood collapsed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The bloody fist, made of thick, viscous blood, far bigger compared to the silver glow, came crashing down. It was as though Heaven and Earth had collapsed. As it fell, it broke into fine droplets of blood and rained down heavily from the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Both Chen Xiaolian and Bluesea were drenched by the rain of blood; even their faces were stained by the blood. However, when the rain of blood came near Sister Yun, they were evaporated by a layer of raging heat.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The same was true of the sea of blood. The area within a radius of half a metre around her remained untouched by the sea of blood. All around her, the sea of blood roiled but was unable to invade her domain, however small it may be.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing that, Chen Xiaolian was stunned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This woman… … is incredibly strong!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You fellows, be careful. Don’t stray too far away from my position. Bring Toto along and slowly make your way forward. We’ll move out of the sea of blood.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun turned around to look back at Chen Xiaolian and Bluesea. The glow shining off her spear grew brighter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A look of seriousness slowly appeared on her face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian and Bluesea exchanged glances before nodding their heads. Then, they brought Toto with them as they moved forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The viscous sea of blood wrapped around their feet and every step forward required a great deal of strength.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Additionally, Chen Xiaolian could faintly sense something else. The blood wrapping around his body was slowly sucking his strength away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Slow, but ever so continuous.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Toto, however, was an exception. Although his entire body was submerged within the sea of blood, he was still able to move forward as easily as one traversing through dry land.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After the gigantic hand made of blood collapsed, another two gigantic hands rose up from the sea of blood. The fingers on the two hands clasped each other and came crashing down on them again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The momentum of this attack was stronger compared to the previous one.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Another silver glow shot upward and the two gigantic hands collapsed. Just as rapidly, however, four gigantic hands rose up from the sea of blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Every time Sister Yun destroyed the gigantic, bloody hands, the number of hands to rise up from the sea of blood would double. Additionally, they would be larger than before.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Stop wasting your strength! Unless this Bloodsoul Lake dries up, my blood hands will be infinite! I don’t believe you can continue this for long!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A thunderous voice rang out through the sky as Sebast laughed out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Amid the many gigantic, bloody hands, Chen Xiaolian’s group watched from within the sea of blood as one silver glow after another shot out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Each of the gigantic hands could only rise up halfway before the silvery glows of light pierced them, shattering them and turning them into countless raindrops, returning into the sea of blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian and Bluesea struggled to make their way through the sea of blood. They could only watch as Sister Yun continuously shot out the silvery glows of light skyward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At that moment, there was still no sign of exhaustion on Sister Yun’s face. However, there was a look of impatience in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Ahh!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Toto suddenly cried out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Startled by the cry, Sister Yun turned back to look at Toto. During that brief moment, the attack rate of her silver spear stagnated, creating a small opening.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>One of the silvery glows of light missed a gigantic hand, which moved down, smashing down heavily upon Chen Xiaolian, Bluesea, and Toto.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Damn it!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Gritting his teeth, Chen Xiaolian raised the Gauss rifle in his hands and opened fire desperately at the gigantic hand above them. However, the weapon he was using was just a normal weapon, albeit a highly-technological weapon. It did not contain spirit-force bullets. The gigantic, blood-coloured hands that Sebast had summoned out were clearly a form of magic skill of the Bloodclan. The small bullets from the Gauss rifle struck the gigantic hand but failed to even cause ripples to appear on the surface of the gigantic hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing that the gigantic hand was about to slam down on all three of them, Bluesea gnashed his teeth and slammed both his hands together, fingers interlaced. Next, he raised them up to face the gigantic hand descending from the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The surface of his two fists suddenly split up as countless tentacles spread out like a blooming flower. Amid the petals of the blooming flower, a crystal, akin to an eye, appeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In a flash, the crystal shot out a powerful beam of light, which struck the wrist area of the gigantic hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The beam of light pierced the wrist, evaporating all the blood within its path, leaving them no chance to turn back into blood. As for the rest, having lost their support, they came crashing down hundreds of metres around the three of them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Toto! What happened to you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Turning around, Sister Yun had first noticed that the Guiding Link Fire was still on Toto’s head and his body remain untouched by the sea of blood. Seeing that, she relaxed somewhat. However, she was unable to stop herself from asking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I… … I cannot move anymore…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Toto lifted up his head to face Sister Yun, a slight look of fear on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun’s face flickered. However, she had no time to go check things out. After confirming that Toto was unharmed, she quickly turned her head back. Brandishing her spear, she shattered several more gigantic, blood-coloured hands in succession.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Don’t get distracted. I will take care of him.” Shouted Chen Xiaolian as he waded with all his might through the sea of blood until he stood before Toto.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At present, he was the weakest among the three of them. There was nothing he could do to help against what was happening up in the sky. Rather than just watch from the side, he might as well help Sister Yun take care of Toto.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The surface level of the sea of blood was still up to Chen Xiaolian’s thigh. As Toto was smaller, only his head and shoulders could be seen. Still, there was no trace of blood on his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Unlike Sister Yun, the sea of blood on the ground was not pushed away from him. Rather, they merely moved past his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Toto, you cannot stop now. No matter how tired you feel, you must continue forward.” Chen Xiaolian crouched down and looked at Toto with a solemn expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Toto shook his head frantically. “No… … I am not tired. I cannot walk!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Not tired?” Chen Xiaolian failed to understand Toto’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Toto grew somewhat anxious and he continued, “I mean… … I have the strength to continue forward, but it feels like something is pulling me. I cannot walk forward anymore!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian frowned. He reached out with his hand in an attempt to grab Toto’s hand only to see his hand move past Toto’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After considering it, he said, “Try moving in a different direction!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mm…” Toto nodded. Next, he turned in every direction before looking at Chen Xiaolian with a tearful face. “Brother, I cannot move left or right either. I can only move back.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Where is the pulling force coming from? Your clothes? Or your hand?” Chen Xiaolian felt his heart sinking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It’s not that.” Toto shook his head. “It is just… … my entire body cannot move forward.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Previously, whenever the lamp is turned on, has such a thing occurred before?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Previously…” Toto considered the question. “Previously, Aunt Yun only told me to not move around. There was no need for me to move.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I understand.” Chen Xiaolian then turned to face Sister Yun. He shouted, “Sister Yun, Toto cannot leave!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What do you mean?” Sister Yun continued brandishing her spear.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian gritted his teeth. “He himself cannot be certain why! But right now, he can no longer move forward! We are stuck!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun looked back at Toto, Chen Xiaolian, and Bluesea. Her face flickered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After a moment’s hesitation, she stopped moving forward. Instead, she continued standing in the same position as she continued to brandish her spear, unleashing the silvery glows of light to shatter the bloody hands coming down from the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“This won’t do.” Bluesea looked at the sea of blood around them. “That fellow was not lying. As long as this sea of blood remains, his strength will be infinite. You will not be able to wear him out!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun’s face was highly contorted. Swinging her spear around, she said, “What else can be done? It is simple for me to rush out while Toto is protected by the Guiding Link Fire. However, am I to leave you two here to die?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I know. That move earlier, can you do it again?” Bluesea sighed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I can. However, this sea of blood is too big. I need some time. Can you hold on for me?” Sister Yun gave Bluesea a glance.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“How long?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Ten seconds.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I’ll… … do my best.” Bluesea gave a wry smile. “However, try to hurry it up. After all, my present body, is just that of an ordinary human.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even as he spoke, both of Bluesea’s arm began transforming.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tentacles extended out from the surface of both arms. The number of tentacles to appear this time exceeded that from earlier and they slowly wrapped around his two arms, giving them the appearance of pillars.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Even I feel disgusted when I see this…” Bluesea said deprecatingly. Putting both arms together, he aimed them skyward and said, “I am preparing to take over. Get ready!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Understood.” Sister Yun swung her spear and tens of silvery glows of light shot out from the tip of the spear, flew through the sky, and shattered all the bloody hands up in the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>For a brief moment, there was nothing up in the sky above the four of them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Next, Sister Yun raised her spear up high before thrusting it down the ground with a thunderous might.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>More bloody, gigantic hands rose up from the sea of blood. As they were about to descend, both of Bluesea’s arms began firing out beams of light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This time, he did not clasp both hands together. A transparent resin-like item appeared on the palm of each of his expanded hands. The item was like an eyeball and it locked down onto the surrounding blood hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although the beams of light did not contain spirit-force attributes, all of them had extremely high temperatures. The bloody hands that Sebast had summoned out may be of magical origin, but those hands were using blood as their body. When the beams of light shot out, the blood within the hands were instantly evaporated and the magical energies that had lost its body could only disperse into the air.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, every time a beam of light was shot out, Bluesea’s face would grow increasingly contorted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As for Sister Yun, when she thrust her spear into the ground, the expression on her face was comparatively grimmer compared to earlier. Killing intent surged out around her and her hair, which was originally tied up into a ponytail, broke free to blow upward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Dragon! Fire! Flare!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
