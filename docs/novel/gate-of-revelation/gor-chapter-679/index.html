 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 679 Return</strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian gave a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun’s words were truly arrogant.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, she did possess the capital to be arrogant.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Back then, when she was up against Sebast, she had to protect him and Bluesea, leading to the battle getting dragged on for a long time.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Once there was nothing to hold her back, once she got serious, even an [S] class expert like Sebast was left with no power to fight back against her.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Earlier, Chen Xiaolian did not even know what Sister Yun had done. Yet, she had already finished off Lei Hu…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Maybe… … Bai Qi’s intention, was not to suppress your power.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After considering it, Chen Xiaolian said slowly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Why do you say that?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I do not know. It is just an intuition.” Chen Xiaolian turned to Sister Yun. “He had already left World’s End. Regardless if he did suppress your power or not, no one in World’s End could stop you. Regardless of what happens within World’s End, it will have nothing more to do with him. If he is really concerned that your existence could affect his plans, he should have killed you before leaving. I think… … he should be able to do that, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… yes.” Sister Yun was silent for a moment before nodding her head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Thus… … for me, Bai Qi’s actions seems more like… … preserving? Due to certain reasons, he had to place a portion of his power on you. However, not only could you not use the power, it instead suppressed your power. I think that is just a side effect.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That sounds… … reasonable. However, what exactly it was that he wanted to do… I fear I will only be able to ask him after meeting him once more,” said Sister Yun slowly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Is that the reason you changed your mind?” Chen Xiaolian looked at her.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If Bluesea had not died, I would not have bothered. Originally, I felt that, it doesn’t matter even if World’s End is to be utterly cleared.” Sister Yun revealed an indifferent smile. “However, since I had re-encountered Bai Qi, I think… … I might as well go back to that world.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Eh… … Sister Yun…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian held Qiao Qiao with his left hand and looked on awkwardly at Sister Yun, who stood before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although all three knew that it was merely to leave together, holding hands with Sister Yun gave Chen Xiaolian an awkward feeling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Especially since… … since girlfriend was right beside him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, there was no awkwardness on Sister Yun’s face. She frankly extended her hand to grab Chen Xiaolian’s right hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian gave Qiao Qiao a guilty glance and saw Qiao Qiao sending a brief glare at him. Then, she pursed her lips and lowered her head before breaking into a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Five more minutes until they returned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Wait!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian suddenly raised his head and said, “I… … forgot about something!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He quickly looked down at the Sword in the Stone hanging on his waist. “Inside the sword… … there might be someone inside it!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Someone inside?” Sister Yun frowned. “What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“As my War Soul, Bai Qi had once gone berserk and killed a woman. Her body is the Exclusive Account of a high-ranking Player. However, back then, we were within an instance dungeon. Thus, after the instance dungeon ended, everything was refreshed. However, her soul was attached into this sword by Mr San.” Chen Xiaolian quickly explained.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Matters had been popping up one after another, bogging him down so badly that he had forgotten that the sword contained Xian Yin’s soul <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup>.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Back in Zero City, Shen had destroyed the Sword in the Stone, utterly destroying it. Thus, it had appeared intact within World’s End. Coincidentally, Sebast had obtained it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, Chen Xiaolian was uncertain if Xian Yin’s soul was still within the Sword in the Stone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At that moment, his hands were holding Qiao Qiao and Sister Yun respectively. He dared not let go to grab the sword. He feared that his calculation of the timing was wrong and the time to be sent out from World’s End might arrive at any moment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun swept a gaze across Chen Xiaolian’s face briefly. Then, stretching out her other hand, she grabbed the Sword in the Stone over. Shutting her eyes momentarily, she shook her head. “If you are talking about Xian Yin, she is no longer in here.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You… … how did you know her name?” Chen Xiaolian was surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Umbrella’s words may have been left for you. However, did you think I will not be able to access them?” Sister Yun gave Chen Xiaolian a glance and said, “The woman called Xian Yin, is she very beautiful?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian turned awkwardly at Qiao Qiao. Then, gritting his teeth, he said, “Something… … something like that.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Hmm.” Sister Yun did not question him further and simply let Chen Xiaolian continue on with his awkward state. Qiao Qiao, on the other hand, looked at Chen Xiaolian with an expression that appeared to be a smile and yet not. She also did not open her mouth to say anything.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“So, is she still inside World’s End?” asked Chen Xiaolian with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“She is just an ordinary human. Although her body is the Exclusive Account of a high-ranking Player, she will not enter World’s End.” Sister Yun shook her head. “As this sword is now in your hand, it means that the moment it was destroyed in the outside world, the soul placed inside it had left it.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Left?” Chen Xiaolian hesitated for a moment. “You mean, disappear?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That should be the case.” Sister Yun nodded. “Unless…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Unless what?” Chen Xiaolian quickly asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Unless there was a suitable container nearby the moment the Sword in the Stone was destroyed, one that would allow her to shift her place of attachment.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“A suitable container? For example?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“For example, another Sword in the Stone,” said Sister Yun calmly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… … don’t joke around.” Chen Xiaolian gave Sister Yun a glare.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The world is a big place, after all. There are many strange and miraculous equipment. How am I to list them all for you? However, I will say that the chances of that happening is too small. It would be best for you to not hope for it.” Sister Yun turned to look at Qiao Qiao. “Besides, isn’t your girlfriend quite beautiful as well?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I am not doing it for…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Enough, no need to explain. This sword, do you still want it?” Sister Yun waved the sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You mean…” Chen Xiaolian looked uncertainly at Sister Yun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It is just a sword. It will not be difficult for me to bring it with me. If you want it, come find me.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The moment Sister Yun finished speaking, Chen Xiaoian’s vision abruptly flashed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His hands, which were originally holding onto them, gripped onto thin air.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Inside one of the suite rooms of the resort, everyone within Meteor Rock Guild were standing side by side. Their hearts were beating uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Soo Soo was the only exception. Alone, she curled herself up on a sofa, headphones on her head and a mobile phone in her hand. She was focused on playing a game on the phone. Occasionally, her eyes would quickly glance forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Is it time yet?” Lun Tai turned to look at Roddy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Roddy, who was holding the Lifehymn Music Score, looked at the countdown displayed in his personal system.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Time remaining: 00:00:10…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Time remaining: 00:00:09…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It’s coming. Hopefully… … Xiaolian has already found Qiao Qiao!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Roddy took a deep breath. When there were only two seconds left on the countdown, an options tab appeared in his personal system. He chose [YES].</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Initiate now!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>With a flash of light, Chen Xiaolian appeared before them all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Xiao… … Xiaolian! You have actually returned!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian was abruptly greeted with a shout of extreme shock. Then, he saw an overjoyed Roddy rushing forward to hug him before shaking him violently a few times. “Son of a bitch! I was worried that you would die in there!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian gave Roddy a gentle pat on his shoulder and turned his gaze to the area behind Roddy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lun Tai, Bei Tai, Xia Xiaolei, Qimu Xi, all of them stood side by side behind Roddy. Their faces were all filled with excitement.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Soo Soo did not stand up. However, she quickly raised her head to look at Chen Xiaolian. Seeing no one beside him, her taut little figure grew slack. However, there was a slightly lost look on her face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Qiao Qiao unnie… … in the end, she did not come back?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Xiaolian…” After the joy of seeing Chen Xiaolian faded, the others noticed as well that Chen Xiaolian was alone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Roddy hesitated for a moment and tugged Chen Xiaolian’s hand. “Not bringing Qiao Qiao back… … its ok. It is good enough that you could return…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The others had fallen into a state of silence as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, after saying that, Roddy saw that there was neither dejection nor sadness on Chen Xiaolian’s face. Instead, he patted Roddy’s shoulder. With a smile, he said, “Hand me the Lifehymn Music Score.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Roddy quickly handed over the Lifehymn Music Score. After accepting it, Chen Xiaolian quickly opened it up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Earlier, Roddy had been too occupied with the countdown timer in his personal system and had not been looking at the Lifehymn Music Score. Only then did he realize that, at the bottom area of the music score, Chen Xiaolian’s name had disappeared, only to be replaced with a few lines of words.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Roddy watched as Chen Xiaolian raised his head back up. He smiled at Roddy and said, “Come, let’s go find Qiao Qiao!”</span></p>
