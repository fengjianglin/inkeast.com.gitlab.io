 <p><strong><u>GOR Chapter 88: Chen Xiaolian’s Invitation</u></strong></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian and Soo Soo walked out from the green light to find themselves within the foot of the mountain of the Mausoleum Area of Qin Shi Huang.</p>
 <p>Observing their surroundings, they found that it was still in the middle of the dark night.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s personal items and the backpack that he brought in with him into the instance dungeon had been left behind outside the magnet gates of Epang Palace due to the restriction against bringing in metal objects.</p>
 <p>There was thus no mobile phone for him to track his position. Thankfully, he had explored the area before entering the instance dungeon. After taking a few moments to examine the surroundings in the night, he judged that they were currently very close to the Mausoleum Area’s south gate.</p>
 <p>He quickly brought Soo Soo towards the Mausoleum Area’s south gate – according to their arrangements, Qiao Qiao and Roddy will be waiting at the south and north gates respectively.</p>
 <p>Under the cover of darkness, Chen Xiaolian carried Soo Soo and ran quickly. After reaching the Mausoleum Area’s south gate, Chen Xiaolian caught sight of Qiao Qiao.</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao was wearing a sweatshirt as she stood beside a black coloured SUV. The girl with long, black hair stared anxiously at the gate of the Mausoleum Area. Seeing Chen Xiaolian running out while carrying Soo Soo, Qiao Qiao cried out in surprise and quickly ran over.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian put down Soo Soo and watched as the little loli flew into Qiao Qiao’s arms. He stood there and smiled.</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao kissed Soo Soo’s face several times before checking at her from up to bottom. After determining that Soo Soo did not receive any injuries, she let out a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>Straightening herself, Qiao Qiao looked at Chen Xiaolian with a complicated expression and hesitated.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian let out a bitter smile. “Thankfully I did not fail and could bring your little sister out unscathed, I…”</p>
 <p>Just as he said those words, Qiao Qiao bit her lips and took a deep breath. She quickly walked before Chen Xiaolian, her body leapt into his arms as her own two arms flew pass Chen Xiaolian’s neck, grabbing onto him.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian felt a fragrance wafting into his nose before a pair of gentle and warm lips pressed down on his.</p>
 <p>He subconsciously held his breath, his mind blanking out momentarily – before he could relish the feeling, Qiao Qiao had already let go. Her slender eyes looked into Chen Xiaolian’s eyes. “Thank you, Xiaolian! Thank you!”</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao’s eyes turned red.</p>
 <p>“Eh… actually, I do not mind you kissing me longer…”</p>
 <p>His subconscious reply caused Qiao Qiao to roll up her eyes.</p>
 <p>“Unnie!”</p>
 <p>Seeing Qiao Qiao kiss Chen Xiaolian, Soo Soo’s small face puffed up to become bun like. She stared with discontent.</p>
 <p>“If you kiss Xiaolian oppa again, I will be very angry, unnie!”</p>
 <p>Soo Soo squinted her eyes. “Even if it is unnie, I still won’t share Xiaolian oppa with you!”</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao was shocked and she turned to look at Chen Xiaolian. “Soo Soo, she…”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian forced out a smile and said. “I forgot to mention, the current Soo Soo is the second personality.”</p>
 <p>“The second personality?” Qiao Qiao was stunned. Then, she followed up. “What I mean to ask is, what does she mean by share?”</p>
 <p>“… little kids like to spout nonsense,” Chen Xiaolian dared not mention what Soo Soo had said regarding the “wait 10 years for me”. He quickly changed the subject. “How long have you been waiting here?”</p>
 <p>“Not long,” Qiao Qiao frowned. “It has only been 10 minutes since the instance dungeon started. How did you get out so quickly?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian sighed:</p>
 <p>Indeed, the passage of time within an instance dungeon and that of the outside is different. Even though I had been inside the instance dungeon for hours, only several minutes have passed outside…</p>
 <p>“Where is Roddy?”</p>
 <p>“Roddy have prepared a car at the north gate. Do you want to contact him? There are walkie-talkies in the car.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian slowly said. “There is still Han Bi and the rest who have yet to come out… the instance dungeon have already concluded and the order of transfer out of the instance dungeon will follow the degree of contribution. So, Han Bi and the rest of them should be somewhere behind. Quick, contact Roddy and tell him that we have already come out. Ask him to keep an eye out for Han Bi and the others. If they appear in the north gate, then inform us immediately.”</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao quickly turned to the car to pick up the walkie-talkie and contact Roddy.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian stood beside the car and looked at the Mausoleum Area…</p>
 <p>Soon, he saw 3 figures quickly walking towards the outer area of the Mausoleum Area.</p>
 <p>The ones in front were the two brothers, Lun Tai and Bei Tai.</p>
 <p>Lun Tai’s movement showed some amount of unsteadiness. However, it was clear that he had already taken some healing substance. The injuries on his body no longer looked so terrible. As for Bei Tai, he propped Lun Tai and they ran together towards the outer area.</p>
 <p>Not far behind them was the Black Knights Guild Leader, Alice.</p>
 <p>Alice seemed to be in a much better state. However, she maintained a certain distance from the two brothers, Lun Tai and Bei Tai.</p>
 <p>The three of them caught sight of Chen Xiaolian and were shocked. They stopped in their tracks.</p>
 <p>Bei Tai grinned and shouted loudly. “It is you! I knew you won’t die so easily! The one who completed the instance dungeon must be you, right?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian did not say anything and gave a faint smile as he looked at the three of them.</p>
 <p>Alice’s eyes showed traces of wariness and subconsciously took a few steps back. She coldly asked. “Chen Xiaolian? What do you want to do?”</p>
 <p>“Could it be that you cannot even say thank you?” Chen Xiaolian softly asked.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, this is a cruel game. There have been too many instances of instance dungeon survivors starting a fight outside to snatch equipment,” Alice shook her head. “Who knows what you could be thinking of.”</p>
 <p>“I hold no malicious intent. I just happened to be out before you and was preparing to meet up with my companions. Did any of you see Han Bi? He is the youngster with brush like eyebrows that was with me. And that Xia Xiaolei. He is the youngster we met in Epang Palace.”</p>
 <p>“… They did not come along with us.”</p>
 <p>The one who gave the reply was Bei Tai who quickly continued. “We got separated with the little girl you left with us. After that, Han Bi went back to look for her. As for the other little fellow, he too went back to find her. That is why they are not with us.”</p>
 <p>Lun Tai suddenly spoke out in a heavy voice. “Do you really mean no harm?”</p>
 <p>“None,” Chen Xiaolian smiled gently and moved to the side. “After all, we have fought together on the same field. I am not that despicable as to turn hostile right after we exit the instance dungeon.”</p>
 <p>Alice exhaled and stared at Chen Xiaolian. She then spoke in a serious tone. “Thank you! You are a good person. However, it is difficult for good people to last long in this game.”</p>
 <p>She quickly moved past Chen Xiaolian. After walking a few steps, she turned around and added. “But, I hope that you can live longer.”</p>
 <p>“I will remember this blessing of yours,” Chen Xiaolian smiled and watched as Alice moved away.</p>
 <p>Lun Tai and Bei Tai looked at each other and was about to leave when Chen Xiaolian suddenly turned to them and called out. “Can you two… please wait?”</p>
 <p>“What is it?” Bei Tai turned around.</p>
 <p>“I have no ill intent,” Chen Xiaolian was silent for a moment. Suddenly, a thought flashed through his mind. “I feel very sorry regarding Guild Leader Nangong’s death in Epang Palace. But I was wondering, are you two planning to head back to the Nangong Guild?”</p>
 <p>Lun Tai hesitated for a moment. Bei Tai on the other hand had already given out a sigh and he turned to Lun Tai. “Old bro, now that the Guild Leader is dead, I fear that our Guild will also… besides, the Deputy Guild Leader, that woman has never been agreeable towards us two brothers. Do we have to go back to look at that woman’s face?”</p>
 <p>Lun Tai looked straight at Chen Xiaolian. “You are a member of Meteor Rock Guild while Qiu Yun too, have died within the instance dungeon. Could it be you have some other thoughts about it?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian smiled sincerely. “Believe it or not, in this instance dungeon, I am only a temporary member of Meteor Rock Guild. I know almost nothing about this Guild. Only… in the beginning, I thought that Qiu Yun is a good person and believed that it would be good to follow him. However, what happened in the instance dungeon… you already know what happened.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian spread both hands outward and moved two steps closer. “Everything I said is the truth. I just want ask the both of you some stuff. If you are not willing, then I will not stop you. If you are, then how about we move together and continue our discussion while we are on the road?”</p>
 <p>Lun Tai exhaled. “You are a good person. When I was injured in the instance dungeon, you took the initiative to wrap up my wounds. In the end, you were also willing to be the decoy… I trust you!”</p>
 <p>“I trust you too!” Bei Tai smiled.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Qiao Qiao poked her head out from the car. “Xiaolian, I have talked to Roddy. Han Bi has already come out from the north gate. Together with him is that Xia Xiaolei. The both of them are fine.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian breathed a sigh of relief and smiled. “Then what are we waiting for? Let us board the car and move out!”</p>
