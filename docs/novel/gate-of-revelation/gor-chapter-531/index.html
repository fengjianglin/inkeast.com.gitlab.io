 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 531 Staying Behind And Leaving</strong></p>
 <p>3 VS 1!</p>
 <p>The three leading figures from Zero City had fought only to suffer from one death and the two remaining figures ended up with heavy wounds.</p>
 <p>As for their one opponent, Shen, he had casually left the battlefield.</p>
 <p>This result had undoubtedly subverted Angel Wu and Aderick’s beliefs. This was a heavy blow to their mental state.</p>
 <p>Three [S] class experts had besieged one opponent. However, not only were they unable to kill that opponent of theirs, they were also unable to heavily wound that opponent. Instead, their opponent had effortlessly killed off one of them and heavily wound the other two before leaving.</p>
 <p>Additionally, both Angel Wu and Aderick agreed on one thing: Shen had not gone all-out.</p>
 <p>That could not even be considered a fight. Their strengths were on two completely different levels.</p>
 <p>That Shen… … how could he be so powerful?</p>
 <p>As far as they knew, the three [S] class experts on their side were at the highest level for this game.</p>
 <p>If so, what level was Shen at?</p>
 <p>[SS] class?</p>
 <p><em>What kind of joke is that supposed to be!</em></p>
 <p>At that moment, both Angel Wu and Aderick stood still, not knowing what they should do.</p>
 <p>Keep staying here? Act as a shield for the retreating units?</p>
 <p>That was an absurd notion.</p>
 <p>Just now, if Shen had wanted to make his way past their line of defence, he could have done so easily. The three of them were simply no match for him.</p>
 <p>Since this opponent was someone they could not stop, why bother staying here?</p>
 <p>Less than three minutes had gone by since the fight began.</p>
 <p>“Let us go back.”</p>
 <p>Angel Wu jumped down from his mech. There was a grim expression on his face as he kept his mech back. It transformed into a small metal ball, which then hovered around him just like the Floater.</p>
 <p>However, it would appear that Aderick was having trouble standing. The fight earlier had inflicted serious damage on his power of darkness. Even his soul had been hurt.</p>
 <p>Angel Wu moved over to help prop Aderick and the two of them turned to look at the ground, at Ronan’s body.</p>
 <p>This leader of Prestige Guild had had his head brutally blown up, denied of a whole corpse.</p>
 <p>Angel Wu and Aderick felt their minds reeling.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Up in the sky, more than 20 Alpha carriers had made it through.</p>
 <p>Bluesea anxiously calculated the time remaining.</p>
 <p>He did not use any monitoring devices to monitor the aftermath of the three [S] class experts fight – to the best of Bluesea’s knowledge, once three [S] class experts join hands, not many could break through them.</p>
 <p>Unless the Player faction chose to send the same number of [S] class experts or… … if the Development Team came.</p>
 <p>With the exception of the above scenarios, there was no need for him to worry about the safety of Angel Wu and the others.</p>
 <p>The issue that was worrying Bluesea the most right now was the speed of their evacuation. It was slower than what he had expected.</p>
 <p>The temporary passageway would only remain for half an hour. However, one sixth of the time had gone.</p>
 <p>Yet, only one eighth of their aircrafts had made it through.</p>
 <p>Just now, when they were flying into the teleportation portal, a minor unexpected accident had occurred. Due to how tightly packed the aircrafts were, a certain group accidentally bumped into others, triggering a chain reaction where four of the aircrafts kept knocking into each other. Due to the resulting chaos, a little time was lost.</p>
 <p>Thankfully, Bluesea had arrived in time. He ordered the group at the back to give way so as to get the situation under control.</p>
 <p>This was also the reason why he missed out on observing the battle going on at the frontline.</p>
 <p>At present, the aircrafts that had returned to their line continued disappearing into the temporary teleportation portal.</p>
 <p>It was then that Bluesea suddenly heard an uproar coming from the defensive perimeter.</p>
 <p>Warriors from the Angel Corps cried out in shock while others roared out in fury and grief.</p>
 <p>Bluesea’s heart sank as a sense of foreboding rose within him. The moment he turned his head, he saw Angel Wu supporting Aderick as they moved in through the gap between the War Bastions. The two of them appeared miserable as they walked back in.</p>
 <p>“… …” Not seeing Ronan, Bluesea flinched.</p>
 <p>“What happened?”</p>
 <p>Just as Bluesea was forwarding the question, he saw several men from Prestige Guild running forward.</p>
 <p>Behind Angel Wu was his Angel equipment. Like a Floater, the mech had transformed into a small tow-truck. There on top of the tow truck’s flatbed was… … a corpse.</p>
 <p>When Bluesea saw Ronan’s corpse, his body shuddered.</p>
 <p><em>This… … how is this possible?</em></p>
 <p>Angel Wu had already joined Aderick on the ground. Their subordinates were handing them substances for them to recover their strength.</p>
 <p>Angel Wu gulped down a healing treatment and looked at Bluesea.</p>
 <p>“If you are thinking about asking us… … it is very simple. We encountered an expert and engaged in a 3 VS 1. He defeated us and killed Ronan.”</p>
 <p>The words coming from the pale Angel Wu left Bluesea in disbelief. “An expert? One? Who? Killing Ronan? That is impossible!”</p>
 <p>Angel Wu was still somewhat at a loss – naturally, he was not feeling afraid. As a veteran of over a hundred battles, he feared nothing.</p>
 <p>At that moment however, the large difference in power he saw had completely overturned everything he knew about levels of power.</p>
 <p>How should he describe this? It was like a tiger that was living inside a forest.</p>
 <p>The tiger originally thought that it was at the top of the food chain. It was one of the few powerful existences there.</p>
 <p>Inside the forest, the only ones that could threaten it would be the other tigers or some other large carnivores.</p>
 <p>However, they were all basically of the same classification.</p>
 <p>Then one day… … this tiger found another existence inside the forest… …</p>
 <p>A T-Rex.</p>
 <p>The shock of this discovery was simply too much.</p>
 <p>Bluesea moved forward to pull Angel Wu up as he tried to ask more.</p>
 <p>At that moment however, chaos broke out from the defensive perimeter again.</p>
 <p>A group of men from Prestige Guild roared in rage. Two of them, [A] class experts, were furious to the point where their eyes had turned bloodshot.</p>
 <p>Clearly, Ronan was a highly respected person who had won a deep sense of loyalty from his subordinates. Ronan’s death thus ignited the fury of Prestige Guild.</p>
 <p>Several high-ranking figures from the guild led a group of members with them as they attempted to rush out to exact vengeance for their Guild Leader.</p>
 <p>It was chaos and no one was able to stop them.</p>
 <p>Truth be told, neither the members from the Angel Corps nor the Knights of Darkness Guild knew how to stop them – more accurately, it would be insensitive of them to do so.</p>
 <p>They were going to exact vengeance for their Guild Leader. As members on the same faction, could they stop them from performing this righteous deed?</p>
 <p>Bluesea, Angel Wu and Aderick were the three who could quell the situation. However, their minds were still reeling from what just happened that they were unable to step forward in time.</p>
 <p>And so, the members from Prestige Guild rushed out of the defensive perimeter with a roar and moved toward the south street.</p>
 <p>The instant they stepped out of the defensive perimeter, the people from Zero City could no longer stop them.</p>
 <p>Bluesea quickly moved forward and shouted out a few words. However, his efforts were futile. He turned around to look at Angel Wu.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Angel Wu was still in a dazed state, Bluesea angrily walked over and delivered a slap at Angel Wu.</p>
 <p>“Wake up! Bastard!” Bluesea’s face was twisted as he said, “Now is not the time for you to fall into such a state! Encountering a powerful opponent is a terrible event. However, there is an even greater matter that we focus on! Our men are evacuating! Right now, we have to maintain order, Sir Angel Wu!”</p>
 <p>Bluesea grabbed Angel Wu by his collar. “I need you to perform your duties! You are Zero City’s guardian protector!”</p>
 <p>Angel Wu then recollected himself, somewhat. At the same time, a few of his assistants also called out to him.</p>
 <p>This leader of the Angel Corps finally regained the look of focus in his eyes. He looked at Bluesea, who was right before him, and took a deep breath. Then, he forced himself up.</p>
 <p>“Sir, we have no way of stopping the men from Prestige Guild. They have already charged out…”</p>
 <p>“Should we chase after them and get them to return?”</p>
 <p>“… you cannot get them to return anymore.” Angel Wu clenched his teeth. “Continue the evacuation! Maintain the defensive perimeter! Team 2 and Team 3, organize some men to move out from our defensive line to meet up with the men from Prestige Guild… … if they are willing to retreat, think of a way for them to retreat properly. However, do not engage the enemy. Understand?”</p>
 <p>“Eh…” The assistant appeared somewhat confused.</p>
 <p>“What I mean is to maintain our distance from the enemy! Do not get too close!” Angel Wu clutched his head.</p>
 <p>“Are we really going to ignore them?”</p>
 <p>“We can’t stop them!” Bluesea spoke up, his eyes bloodshot.</p>
 <p>Bluesea’s words invited gazes of dissatisfaction from the others, especially from the Angel Corps members.</p>
 <p>Bluesea ignored them and said coldly, “Our main objective now is to ensure the success of the evacuation operation! I am not afraid of death and I know the same applies to all of you! However, weakening our defences for the sake of the few… … would endanger the lives of the many who are evacuating! We have to continue defending this place!”</p>
 <p>“That is how it is! Team 2 and Team 3, move out of our defensive perimeter through a distance of 500 metres into the south street… … if those fellows return, cover their return. If they are not returning… …” Angel Wu struggled to make the decision. “Then forget it.”</p>
 <p>There was no question about it. At present, the morale among Zero City’s forces had fallen all the way into the gutter.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, another uproar erupted from the crowd consisting of the members from the Knights of Darkness Guild.</p>
 <p>“Guild Leader!”</p>
 <p>Hearing the cry, Angel Wu’s heart contracted with shock. He quickly made his way over to see a terribly anxious expression on Oswald’s (Knights of Darkness Guild) face.</p>
 <p>“What happened?”</p>
 <p>“Guild Leader, our Guild Leader fainted.”</p>
 <p>Angel Wu released his grip on Oswald and burst through the crowd to see Aderick lying on the ground.</p>
 <p>“We had already given him healing substances…” Oswald was panicking.</p>
 <p>Beside him was Theodore, a livid expression on his face. If not for the fact that his Guild Leader was still alive, this fellow would probably have marched out together with the members of Prestige Guild for the sake of vengeance.</p>
 <p>Before Angel Wu could say anything, Bluesea moved forward.</p>
 <p>“Knights of Darkness Guild will evacuate first… … Theodore, Oswald, you two protect your Guild Leader and evacuate first. I had left a team of carriers behind for this operation. They will be taking off in three minutes’ time and will be given priority in entering the temporary teleportation portal.”</p>
 <p>There was hoarseness in Bluesea’s voice. However, his tone remained stable. He took a deep breath and looked at the members of Knights of Darkness Guild. “Your Guild Leader has done everything in his power to fulfil his duty as one of the leaders of Zero City. Now, he should be given the chance to retreat.”</p>
 <p>After a pause, Bluesea then said in a solemn tone, “Preserving an [S] class expert would be of great value for Zero City.”</p>
 <p>“We don’t need to send so many men to escort our Guild Leader,” Oswald suddenly spoke up. He glanced at Theodore and said, “Theodore, you protect the Guild Leader for his evacuation. I will lead our brothers to… … defend our position! There are no cowards in Knights of Darkness Guild! Since everyone will be defending here, we, the combat personnel have the responsibility to fight to our last breath! This involves the honour of our guild!”</p>
 <p>Theodore had wanted to rebuke those words. However, when he heard the words “honour of our guild”, he nodded. “Fine, I agree. However, let’s change. You escort the Guild Leader while I stay.”</p>
 <p>Oswald grew furious and he said, “You are going to argue with me at a time like this?”</p>
 <p>“I am stronger than you. In a fight, I am of more worth compared to you.”</p>
 <p>“Bastard!” Oswald retorted in rage, “You leave! I will stay! If you think you are stronger than me, then we will just have to put that to a test some other day!”</p>
 <p>Seeing the two experts from Knights of Darkness Guild arguing, Angel Wu shouted, “Stop arguing!”</p>
 <p>Next, he turned to face Bluesea.</p>
 <p>Bluesea nodded his head and said solemnly, “Before this, your Guild Leader had said that I now hold the highest authority! Thus, you can stop arguing! I will make the decision.”</p>
 <p>Taking a deep breath, he said, “Theodore, you will escort Aderick out! Oswald, if you are willing to fight, then you can go check who among your guild are willing to stay and fight. Those who stay will be under your command. That is all!”</p>
 <p>Theodore was seemingly about to argue against this decision when Bluesea glared at him and said, “Now is not the time to be a hero, Theodore! Your Guild Leader’s life is just as important! Your mission is not an easy one!”</p>
 <p>Theodore hung his head in frustration.</p>
 <p>“Hurry! We do not have much time left! Get Aderick to the carrier!”</p>
 <p>Bluesea quickly arranged the aircrafts using his earpiece. A small aircraft quickly rose up from the square behind their position.</p>
 <p>After Theodore and Oswald sent Aderick up the aircraft…</p>
 <p>Theodore suddenly grabbed Oswald’s hand.</p>
 <p>“What is it?” Oswald looked at Theodore, his team member who had risen through the ranks with him in the same guild.</p>
 <p>“… get out of here alive!” Theodore’s eyes were red. “I will be waiting for our match!”</p>
 <p>Oswald was startled and he responded with a laugh. He said, “Fine! Just wait to get your ass kicked by me!”</p>
 <p>After a pause, Oswald then gritted his teeth and looked at Theodore. “Protect the Guild Leader!”</p>
 <p>“With my life!” Theodore vowed.</p>
 <p>The aircraft took off and was quickly brought into the evacuating formation of carriers. Oswald stood on the ground and watched as the aircraft was given priority to enter the teleportation portal.</p>
 <p>At that moment, a cry of shock came from the defensive perimeter.</p>
 <p>“Alert!”</p>
 <p>“Enemy attack!”</p>
 <p>Before those words could finish, a loud sound rang out.</p>
 <p>Outside their defensive perimeter, somewhere hundreds of metres away, a ball of fire rose up to the sky.</p>
 <p>The huge explosion brought with it orange flames, which engulfed nearly half the street. Pieces of concrete and building debris flew and smoke covered the place.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Bluesea’s voice could be heard. “All aircrafts maintain evacuation formation! Maintain order!”</p>
 <p>Angel Wu roared loudly, “All firing type units, fire indiscriminately at anything 500 metres outside the defensive perimeter! Fire! Fire!”</p>
 <p>“Observers!”</p>
 <p>“Coordinates received!”</p>
 <p>“Energy readings report!”</p>
 <p>The defensive perimeter bustled with activity.</p>
 <p>Then, someone suddenly shouted.</p>
 <p>His words fell upon everyone’s ear, including Oswald’s.</p>
 <p>“Electronic Guardians! Those are the system’s Electronic Guardians!”</p>
