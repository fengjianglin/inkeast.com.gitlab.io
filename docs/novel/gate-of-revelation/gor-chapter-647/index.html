 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 647 Taiyi </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Guild… … Guild Leader! How could you be there?” Xia Xiaolei jumped in shock, as though he had just encountered a ghost.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Toto repeated Chen Xialian’s words. “By chance, I acquired a prop that would allow me to find Qiao Qiao. This matter is very complicated and I am unable to explain it all to you given the limited amount of time we have. At any rate, I never thought I would be able to contact you all through Toto after coming to World’s End. This is… … weird.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Then… … what should I do?” Xia Xiaolei looked at Toto anxiously. “Should I call Brother Lun Tai and the others here?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“For now… … no. We don’t have much time. Later, you can tell them about this. Right, help me measure the room and see how much Toto can move around. All right. Toto, try to move around. No… … no need to say these words… … no need to say…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The piece of mosaic, Toto, scratched his head and began moving around the room. Stretching his hand out before him, he then slowly and carefully walked around the room.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“How is it? Xiaolei, the area that Toto covered just now, is it the interior of the room?” After coming back to stand beside Xia Xiaolei, Toto spoke up for Chen Xiaolian once again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes.” Xia Xiaolei nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After a moment of silence, Toto spoke up once more, “Xiaolei, we need to leave now. For the next few days, I will have to ask you all to have someone stand guard in this room. Do a rotation shift. If there is a need, I will contact you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Guild Leader… … you… … when will you be able to return?” Xia Xiaolei quickly asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I still have a few more days’ time here. No more than three days. If, after three days, I am unable to return, or if I still haven’t contacted you all, that means… … I am dead. All right, let’s stop here for now.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Toto’s body then flickered before disappearing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Xia Xiaolei was momentarily stunned. When he recollected himself, he quickly turned on the guild channel and began shouting with all he had.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Now, we know. After activating the Guiding Link Fire, Toto cannot move beyond the area inside the room. However, during that time, he can serve as our means of communication between us and my companions who are in the outside world.” Chen Xiaolian raised his head, looking at Sister Yun. “This Guiding Link Fire had such a function. Did you not know about this?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun shook her head. “The origin of the lamp… … is rather complicated. I will slowly explain it to you later. In short, even at the time of my death, I had not been able to figure out all of its functions.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian gave Sister Yun a rueful smile. “You are so strong. Back then, who could have killed you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Aren’t you in a hurry?” Sister Yun looked at Chen Xiaolian but did not answer. Instead, she turned around and pulled Toto with her toward the distant mountain peak.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Xiaolei, you are not pulling my leg, are you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lun Tai stood before Xia Xiaolei, a strict expression on his face. Behind them was Qimu Xi, who looked at the lamp curiously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Of course not!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Xia Xiaolei shook his head with an indignant expression. “Brother Lun Tai, would I make a joke out of something so serious? If you don’t believe me, you can ask Brother Roddy!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After a moment of silence, Lun Tai then accessed the guild channel and said, “Roddy, where is our Guild Leader? “Are you fellows not done with your stuff in Bucharest?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“We had just finished it. We’ll tell you about it when we return. It’s just… … Xiaolian had gotten to know this Eastern European girl. They went out for a date. He told me not to bother him and had turned off his guild channel,” said Roddy with a relaxed-sounding tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Is that so? That’s good, then.” Lun Tai sneered and continued, “Looks like Xia Xiaolei lied to me after all. Or… … the one who claimed to be calling from World’s End just now is just a liar. I’m hanging up now. I need to deal with this kid.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… … hold up, Lun Tai!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Roddy took a deep breath. “You… … what was that you said just now?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I said, someone had used a certain method to pass a message to Xia Xiaolei, telling him that he is Chen Xiaolian and that he is currently in World’s End.” The sneer on Lun Tai’s face remained. “Since our Guild Leader is currently busy chasing after an Eastern European chick, that person is definitely not our Guild Leader. Call him up on my behalf and tell him to enjoy himself. As for Qiao Qiao, don’t bother with that issue anymore.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After a lengthy silence, Roddy spoke up again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I am sorry… Lun Tai, do not blame me. This is our Guild Leader’s decision.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Our Guild Leader’s decision? Of course it is his decision!” Lun Tai finally stopped sneering. Instead, his tone grew increasingly furious. “Letting him go alone is bad enough, you didn’t even bother telling us about this? What? Do you not have enough credit in your guild channel? Just tell me, then! I’ll top it up for you!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Lun Tai, I never knew you could be so sarcastic… …” Roddy smiled wryly and continued, “Hear me out, no one knows anything about World’s End. Xiaolian thought that letting you fellows know about this will just make you all worry.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Even so, you must let us know! Did Chen Xiaolian forget that he is our Guild Leader?” Lun Tai bellowed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Those words… … you should probably wait for him to come back before personally sending it to him.” Roddy sighed. “First things first, what is the situation on Xiaolian’s side?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I am uncertain about that either. He seems to be in a hurry and was unable to continue talking to us. He only told Xia Xiaolei to post someone in this room at all times to wait for him to make contact.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“So urgent? How is the situation there? Are there any dangers? Did he find Qiao Qiao?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“At present, it would seem there aren’t any. However… … its hard to say what will happen later on.” Lun Tai gradually calmed down. “All Xia Xiaolei knows is that, there are enemies there.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Then, how did he make contact with you? I am certain it is not through the guild channel.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Of course not.” Lun Tai informed Roddy about Xia Xiaolei’s meeting with Toto.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I… … understand.” Roddy grew silent for a moment. “Well, in that case, I will return first.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Earlier, the sea of blood had destroyed the Devourer fighter aircraft. Thus, the four of them now had to move toward the mountain on foot. Thankfully, it was no longer that far away. By Sister Yun’s estimate, they will be arriving at the foot of the mountain in roughly 10 plus hours.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea’s weakened body was still recovering. However, it would appear that the Bug Armour was capable of automatically providing strength to its host while mending any wounds received. After just a few short moments, the act of walking was no longer an issue for him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun had already removed her set of armour. She had one arm upraised as she placed Toto on her shoulder while she strode forward. That act did not, in the slightest, appear difficult for her.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“He… … who is he to you?” Turning his head back, Chen Xiaolian looked at Toto and continued, “I heard him calling you Aunt Yun. He is probably not your son, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I picked him up along the way,” said Sister Yun coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Picked up along the way?” A dumbfounded smile appeared on Chen Xiaolian’s face. “Then, why are you so good toward him?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It’s nothing. Just, it just so happens that he looks like a certain someone.” Sister Yun turned to the side to look at Toto. “I mean… … really similar.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Similar to a certain person?” Chen Xiaolian hesitated for a moment as he looked at Sister Yun. “That certain person, could he be somehow related to Bai Qi?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“He is not related to Bai Qi. It is… … something that happened a long time ago.” Halfway through, Sister Yun’s words came to a halt and she abruptly turned to look at Chen Xiaolian. “Wait, you know Bai Qi?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Something… … like that.” Chen Xiaolian sighed. “You didn’t appear this surprised when you heard that I knew Mr San. Why?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“How could you know Bai Qi? He… … he had most certainly left using the Lifehymn Music Score!” There was a pondering frown on Sister Yun’s face and a sceptical look appeared within her eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Leaving using the Lifehymn Music Score, is there a problem with that?” Chen Xiaolian’s heart immediately turned tense. Turning, Chen Xiaolian looked at the mountain and saw that there was still a considerable distance to cover. Then, he turned back and said, “Listen, we now share the same objective. So, I hope we can have an honest and open exchange of information. Additionally, I believe we need to make proper arrangements for our rescue plan.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“All right.” Sister Yun simply nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Then, I will go first.” Chen Xiaolian pondered for a moment before saying, “I first met Bai Qi in an instance dungeon. I had originally assumed Bai Qi to be an ordinary instance BOSS. However, after a strange series of events, he became a type of… … War Pet under me. However, he had already lost all his memories and consciousness. It took a very long time before I eventually found out that he used to be an Irregularity as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What about his strength?” Sister Yun stared at Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Very powerful. I mean, when compared to the me from back then.” Chen Xiaolian shook his head. “However, when compared to you, he is far inferior.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“As expected.” Judging by the expression on Sister Yun’s face, it would appear that she had expected this answer. She diverted her gaze before releasing a gentle sigh.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“This matter, is it related to… … the Lifehymn Music Score?” Chen Xiaolian voiced out his biggest concern.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun gave Chen Xialian a glance. “What else? Why did you think I refused to leave with you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Big sis, I never asked you to leave with me… …” Chen Xiaolian smiled wryly. “If so, does that mean that the people I want to take away will suffer the same fate as Bai Qi? Have their memories and consciousness taken away, sealed off in some instance dungeon as a BOSS, and can only wait to be killed off by someone else? Or… … if they are lucky, be adopted as a War Pet.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun did not answer. Instead, she asked, “Do you know what the nature of the Lifehymn Music Score is?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If we are to assume that the Guiding Link Fire is a bridge, then the Lifehymn Music Score is a boat. Although both possess the ability to send someone from one side of the river to the other, the way the two works differ.” Sister Yun slowly continued, “During my time, taking a boat requires a fee.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It is the same right now.” Chen Xiaolian shrugged.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That’s it. Those who write their names into the Lifehymn Music Score and end up here after dying have more or less paid the required fee to cross the river, like you. As for taking someone away from this place, it would be the equivalent to…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian finished her sentence for her. “Smuggling?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes, that is a very apt description.” Sister Yun considered for a moment before nodding her head. “Using the Lifehymn Music Score to enter World’s End is practically the act of drilling a loophole within the system. It is just that the system could not yet detect this action. However, using it to bring someone back? There is no way the system could fail to detect something of that magnitude.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Detected by the system… … do you mean GM?” asked Chen Xiaolian with a frown.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What is that?” Sister Yun shook her head. It would appear that she had never heard the name before.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You… … don’t know the GM? Naturally, the one you knew is not the one I know. Maybe, you addressed him with a different name. At the very least, however… … you must have met him before!” Chen Xiaolian’s eyes widened. “Ancient monsters like you all… … how can you not know him? Regardless if his name is GM, the operations program, system administrator… … in short, he is a manifestation of the system, possessing a certain level of authority. He has been searching for Irregularities like us. After which, he would grant us a certain amount of assistance, hoping that we could help free him. At the very least, Mr San knew him.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I understand now. The one you are talking about is… … Taiyi,” said Sister Yun with a nod of her head. However, the name she had mentioned was new to Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
