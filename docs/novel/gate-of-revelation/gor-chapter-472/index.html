 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 472 Resurrection?</strong></p>
 <p>Within the warehouse, the corpses belonging to the members from Thorned Flower Guild slowly disappeared as the system cleared them away. Some had yet to die and were lying in the corner; they were quickly booted out from the instance dungeon.</p>
 <p>The short man stood inside the warehouse, observing the bloodstains on the floor.</p>
 <p>“Now, Thorned Flower Guild has been dealt with.”</p>
 <p>He mumbled in a whisper to himself and slowly moved toward the warehouse door.</p>
 <p>Outside, he felt the sea breeze blowing at him as he looked up at the moon.</p>
 <p>Under the illumination of the moonlight, his shadow grew very long.</p>
 <p>“Thirteen, report the present situation.”</p>
 <p>The short man smiled coldly and continued mumbling alone.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>The white unicorn kicked around in trepidation. The moon shone brightly and the pier was seemingly filled with a militaristic atmosphere.</p>
 <p>Mene had pulled down the visor covering his face. His eyes were dark. Beside him, one of the knights was standing beside a unicorn, tightening the saddle.</p>
 <p>“Thorned Flower Guild… … quit?”</p>
 <p>Mene’s face turned ugly to behold. He lowered his head to look at the walkie-talkie in his palm.</p>
 <p>At present, this walkie-talkie was no longer capable of contacting anyone.</p>
 <p>“That fellow actually lost?” Mene’s expression grew increasingly peculiar.</p>
 <p>“What should we do?” whispered the companion beside him. “We have suffered from losses now. “Gattuso’s return will take one month. Since that Shen had already left, there is no reason for us to continue working for him.”</p>
 <p>Mene shot a glance at his companion. “Then… … what of the one who harmed Gattuso? He almost killed Gattuso!”</p>
 <p>His blade like eyes swept around and he said in a hushed tone, “I can feel it. That fellow is still inside this instance dungeon! When we get to the third phase, we will surely meet him! There is an aura of darkness coming off his body! Servants of Light have a duty to purify the darkness! Moreover, he nearly killed Gattuso!”</p>
 <p>The companion who was beside Mene spoke no more. He looked at Mene, awaiting his command.</p>
 <p>Mene coldly raised the sword in his hand. “Divine judgement! Extinguish those evil powers of darkness! This is the holy city!”</p>
 <p>“Divine judgement!” His companions who were on their unicorn mounts raised their weapons up in unison and shouted fervently.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>[System prompt: The assignment of factions is complete! After three minutes, you will be automatically teleported to the final quest area. Please make due preparations.]</p>
 <p>Inside the freight yard, Tian Lie and Nicole received the system prompt at the same time. They raised their heads and looked around. No doubt about it, Natasha had also received it. As for the four-man team, they remained far away from them. The last solo participant watched the sea in silence.</p>
 <p>“It is going to start soon.” Nicole deliberately spoke up and asked, “Now that the assignment of factions is complete, what do you think the strength of each faction would be like?”</p>
 <p>Tian Lie looked at Nicole. “You are asking me?”</p>
 <p>“I have suddenly realized it. Although you like to spout nonsense, you know quite a lot.” Nicole said coolly. “In the third phase, who do you think will be the strongest opponent from the Light Faction?”</p>
 <p>Tian Lie lowered his head and contemplated the question.</p>
 <p>“Could it be Thorned Flower Guild?” Nicole deliberately said.</p>
 <p>The corners of Tian Lie’s eyes gave a near imperceptible twitch. He replied, “What makes you say that?”</p>
 <p>“In the first phase, Thorned Flower Guild began killing everyone everywhere. Don’t you find it strange?” asked Nicole with a frown. “Maybe they were trying to establish an advantage early on.”</p>
 <p>Tian Lie looked at Nicole and abruptly broke into a smile. “I feel like there is some hostility between you and Thorned Flower Guild.”</p>
 <p>Nicole’s expression remained calm as she said, “There are many people who hate them. For example… … Natasha is one of them.”</p>
 <p>Tian Lie looked at Nicole. “Did someone you know die to someone from Thorned Flower Guild?”</p>
 <p>Nicole stared back at Tian Lie but said nothing.</p>
 <p>“Fine, I won’t ask further.” Tian Lie shook his head. “I can only say this. You are looking down on Thorned Flower Guild too much. They would disdain doing something like this. Clearing the other participants in the first phase was definitely not for the sake of getting an advantage… … if they needed to establish an advantageous situation in a [B] class instance dungeon using such a method, they would not deserve the name Thorned Flower Guild.”</p>
 <p>“Meaning?”</p>
 <p>“What I mean is, there is certainly another reason why they chose to start a slaughter in the first phase,” Tian Lie said coolly.</p>
 <p>Nicole’s eyes lit up and she said heavily, “You… … look like someone who understands Thorned Flower Guild a lot.”</p>
 <p>“… … …” Tian Lie cast a complicated look at Nicole.</p>
 <p>“Are you by chance someone from Thorned Flower Guild?” Nicole deliberately sneered.</p>
 <p>“Surely you know of the common knowledge that Thorned Flower Guild will never let a traitor walk free. No one can quit Thorned Flower Guild alive,” said Tian Lie with a faint smile.</p>
 <p>“You said that there is a special reason why Thorned Flower Guild would choose to slaughter the participants in the first phase. What is that reason?”</p>
 <p>“How am I supposed to know that? However, if I have to venture a guess, it must surely have something to do with the assignment of factions.” Tian Lie shook his head and continued, “The problem now is that we are in the Demon Faction. If… … if Thorned Flower Guild is of the Light Faction, I personally suggest fighting them only if possible. If not, we will scoot off. Thorned Flower Guild has too many experts. Heaven knows which one they sent out to take care of the situation.”</p>
 <p>“Mm, and if Thorned Flower Guild is in our Demon Faction?” Nicole asked.</p>
 <p>“Well… … we can just find a spot to sit and break out the popcorn. You have heard of the term winning without doing anything, right?”</p>
 <p>Nicole, who had wanted to say something, heard Natasha calling out from a distance. “Teleportation has begun!”</p>
 <p>A beam of light fell upon Natasha’s body and she quickly disappeared.</p>
 <p>Next, Nicole saw another beam of light coming from the sky, enveloping her body…</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>The island that hovered in the middle of the air caused everyone to utter out exclamations of shock.</p>
 <p>Natasha stood beside the cliff. Looking down at the billowing waves, she then raised her head to look at the mountain peak that was tens of thousands of metres high.</p>
 <p>Rain drizzled down from the sky and soaked her hair; Natasha’s hair became matted, sticking to her scalp. She raised her head and wiped the rainwater off her face. She then noticed the faint silhouette of a cave on the mountain.</p>
 <p>“There.”</p>
 <p>A voice came from beside Natasha, shocking her.</p>
 <p>She turned around and saw that Nicole had – without her knowledge – gotten behind her. Natasha’s heart grew tense and she subconsciously took a step away.</p>
 <p>Nicole did not care about this move from Natasha – in this world, trust between Awakened ones was rare and precious.</p>
 <p>“That should be the entrance,” said Nicole, who took a deep breath.</p>
 <p>She turned back and found Tian Lie standing several metres away, looking at the mountainside.</p>
 <p>“What are you looking at?” Nicole walked over. Tian Lie responded by shaking his head and pointing his finger at a certain location.</p>
 <p>Nicole turned and looked in the direction pointed by Tian Lie. She narrowed her eyes and looked for a while before her eyes finally made out something faint.</p>
 <p>Somewhere far away on another part of the mountainside was another rugged mountain path. She was able to faintly make out some figures there.</p>
 <p>“Who are those people?”</p>
 <p>“The opposing side,” answered Tian Lie with a frown on his face. “Troublesome fellows.”</p>
 <p>“Who? Thorned Flower Guild?”</p>
 <p>Tian Lie shook his head, the expression on his face growing stranger. “I did not see Thorned Flower Guild’s people, but those guys… … they are surely the mad men from Jerusalem.”</p>
 <p>Nicole was somewhat surprised. “You can see so far so clearly?”</p>
 <p>Tian Lie smiled. “Look… … they are lighting up their torches. That is holy flame, something that only those mad men would use.”</p>
 <p>In the distance, the storm swept over the illuminating flames but was unable to extinguish them.</p>
 <p>When Nicole stared at them, she suddenly noticed one of the silhouettes halting its steps. That silhouette turned around and looked over in her direction.</p>
 <p>“They noticed us.” Nicole smiled.</p>
 <p>“Who cares? We will certainly encounter them later.” Tian Lie shrugged.</p>
 <p>There on the mountain path behind them was the four-man team. The solo participant remained at the very back.</p>
 <p>Tian Lie stood beside the mountain path and looked down. After waiting for one whole minute, he raised his eyebrows and muttered, “No one else?”</p>
 <p>“That would appear to be the case.” Nicole smiled bitterly. “Could it be that we are the only ones in the Demon Faction? It seems Thorned Flower Guild is on the opposing side. The level of difficulty for this one is going to be very high.”</p>
 <p>There was a very odd look on Tian Lie’s face. “No… … Thorned Flower Guild did not come.”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“There is no way you can defeat him!”</p>
 <p>Thirteen’s face was twisted and ferocious as he howled furiously.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian furrowed his brows and said, “I am very curious. What is it that gives you so much courage? No matter how powerful that teammate of yours may be, there is no way he could save you. We can kill you.”</p>
 <p>Thirteen raised his head and spat out in a hot-blooded manner. A fanatic look appeared in his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Kill me? Ha ha ha! He can resurrect me!”</p>
 <p>“… … …”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was stunned.</p>
 <p>The others in Meteor Rock Guild’s team were also stunned.</p>
 <p>Resurrection?</p>
 <p>This was their first time hearing something like this in this game world.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>In this game world, resurrection did not exist.</p>
 <p>They do not have any information about the Players…</p>
 <p>However, for Awakened ones, once they were killed, they will be refreshed by the system to become ordinary humans. They will lose their memories as Awakened ones and be reintegrated as one of the several billion NPCs of this world.</p>
 <p>There were many Awakened ones who regarded this refresh process as… … not a real ‘resurrection’. That was just a backup that the system had brought back. Thus, the self that was refreshed was not the real self.</p>
 <p>Once the real self was killed, that real self was dead for good.</p>
 <p>This was also the cruel aspect of this game… … death meant the end.</p>
 <p>There was no second chance.</p>
 <p>But now… … the word ‘resurrection’ had come out from Thirteen’s mouth.</p>
 <p>There was an Awakened who could… … resurrect other Awakened ones?</p>
 <p>Thirteen cackled as he watched them all.</p>
 <p>“The third phase has begun… … he will soon be here… … you, you will all die! Ha ha ha ha! All of you will die!”</p>
