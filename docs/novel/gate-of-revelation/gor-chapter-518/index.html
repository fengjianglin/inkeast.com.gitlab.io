 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 518 Geeks Will Save The World</strong></p>
 <p>The spiral-shaped staircase moved down for a moment before coming to a steady halt. To Chen Xiaolian’s surprise, when the staircase was descending, they who were standing on it did not feel any sensations of shaking or vertigo.</p>
 <p>He was unable to refrain himself from casting a glance at Gibbs. Without waiting for Chen Xiaolian to ask, Gibbs took the initiative to answer, “Zero City’s technology, don’t ask me how. I have no way of explaining it all to you in a few sentences. In short, Zero City’s technology is far beyond what we could grasp. Using a certain type of technology, it eliminated the centrifugal force that arose from this rotation. At the same time, it also suppressed the gravitational effects on us, thus… … mm, you get it.”</p>
 <p>After they got off the staircase, it automatically moved back up and the opening in the ceiling slowly closed up.</p>
 <p>They were inside a circular, open room.</p>
 <p>In the centre position was a control platform.</p>
 <p>“This place is over 30 metres underground.” Gibbs walked to the control desk and tapped on them as he said, “Simply put, Rubik’s Cube serve as the place to keep the backup units. All of the mechanical related items in Zero City – naturally, I am referring to those that we have control over and not Zero City’s programs. Things like the ecological cycle system’s unit, power source units, electronic surveillance units, the lighting units and etc. have their backup units set aside here. All those machinery are stored beneath where we are standing right now… … don’t bother looking down. It is far beneath us. The closest one would be the lighting units. That one is 20 metres beneath us.”</p>
 <p>Gibbs’ was quick in his operation of the control desk. While he was fiddling with the controls, he said, “Truth be told, rather than a place for backup units, it would be more fitting to call this a research centre. We here are always attempting to break through the technological limitations we face. We would attempt to further our understanding of Zero City, understand the functions of its programs, unravel them and attempt to replicate them. If we fail in our attempts to replicate it, we would use the relatively lesser technology we have to come up with a counterfeit, one that possess as much function as the real deal. Of course, we have never been successful.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Gibbs’ voice took on a very subdued tone as he shook his head and smiled wryly. “I worked in this Rubik’s Cube building for a good 11 years. But the longer I worked here, the more depressed I became. Those who work here for a long time would end up in a terrible state.”</p>
 <p>“Why is that?” asked Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>“Because… … as an engineer, a scientific researcher, in face of Zero City’s majesty and technological superiority, we would find our self-esteem shattered.” The smile on Gibbs’ face remained bitter as he continued, “Can you imagine how it is like, for me and my colleagues to research here for 11 years, only to come up with zero results?”</p>
 <p>“But, you mentioned that you would replicate…”</p>
 <p>“That was just us passively accepting Zero City’s technology, understand?” Gibbs suddenly grew agitated. “Passively accepting! Not a result of research and development! Not a single one of those technological achievements was something that we came up with!</p>
 <p>“How should I describe it? I feel like our work is just to wait… … waiting for Zero City to release a new set of technology for us.</p>
 <p>“However, before it releases that set of technology for us, no matter how hard we try to research, we would be unable to grasp it. In fact, we would not even be able to understand it.</p>
 <p>“And here is the strangest part. Every time we reach a certain point, Zero City would, at certain points in time, release the knowledge over a certain technology that we have been unable to figure out.</p>
 <p>“All our hard work was useless. In the end, we may as well just wait obediently for Zero City to release the information for a new technological advancement for us.</p>
 <p>“11 years. During those years, I had failed to come up with a single accomplishment! All of them were passive ones. All of them were us waiting for Zero City to release it and then, follow the given instructions.</p>
 <p>“Sometimes, I feel like I am just in a game where I have to wait passively. Wait for a new technology to be unlocked before I can research a new technology in our tech tree. Until that time comes, no matter how hard we try, we would be unable to increase our tech tree – every progress made is in the palm of Zero City’s system. In fact, I suspect that everything is part of its plan. When to give us a certain technology, all of them are but part of its plan.”</p>
 <p>Hearing that, Chen Xiaolian raised his eyebrows.</p>
 <p><em>Everything is part of its plan</em>. For some unknown reason, hearing those words greatly moved a certain part of Chen Xiaolian’s heart.</p>
 <p>“Enough, there is no time for you to nag. Hurry up with your plan.” Guan Shan looked at the time anxiously.</p>
 <p>“Only if it works. If it doesn’t work, it would be pointless to be anxious.” Gibbs sighed. “I only have one plan. Additionally, there is no guarantee that it would work.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, he finally finished his work on the control desk. Finally, he slammed his palm heavily down upon a button.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>A 3D holographic projection suddenly flashed into existence in the middle of the circular room.</p>
 <p>It had the appearance of a naïve looking little boy. It had roundish face, light-brown hair and was only a few years old. After this holographic projection appeared, it revealed a look of joy as it looked at Gibbs.</p>
 <p>“Mr Gibbs, you're back!”</p>
 <p>The sweet, childlike voice fitted its appearance of a child.</p>
 <p>Guan Shan was unable to stop a frown from appearing on his face. “A virtual holographic projection? AI? What is so special about this? Our hive headquarters have one of our own. This AI is your final hope?”</p>
 <p>“With your level of IQ, it is hard for me to explain it to you.” Gibbs snorted and walked over. He crouched down before the virtual projection of the boy child. It seemed as though he was not looking at a virtually projected AI, but a real human child. Gibbs spoke in a pleasant tone, “Yes, I am back. How have you been, Adam?”</p>
 <p>Adam?</p>
 <p>Hearing that name, Chen Xiaolian’s mind thought of something.</p>
 <p>The virtual projection known as Adam suddenly shifted his gaze to look past Gibbs. It looked at Chen Xiaolian, Guan Shan and Tina.</p>
 <p>The child’s lively eyes flickered and used the curious voice unique to children to ask Gibbs, “Gibbs… … behind you, that beautiful woman, is that your wife?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, she is my wife. I promised you that I would bring my wife to see you if I get married, didn’t I? This is a promise we made.” Gibbs patiently conversed with Adam.</p>
 <p>After saying that, Gibbs turned around to look at Tina, who quickly stepped forward. She too, crouched down before Adam and whispered, “Hello, Adam. My name is Tina. Gibbs had mentioned about you to me before, you are a very smart and adorable child.”</p>
 <p>“You are very adorable too.” Adam smiled.</p>
 <p>Guan Shan looked at the time anxiously. Gibbs then took a deep breath and positioned himself so his eyes were on the same level as Adam. Next, he slowly said, “Adam, about that thing we talked about last time before I left, did you continue doing it?”</p>
 <p>Adam blinked its eyes – it had to be said, this virtual projection looked very real. Vivid and lifelike. Next, it smiled and spoke with a childlike tone, “Gibbs, after you left they called off your task… … however, you are my favourite person. It is only natural that I would help you. I have been secretly working on the calculations for the matter that you asked of me. Although I had to hide away a considerable portion of the computing power, I was careful and they never found out about it!”</p>
 <p>“… good, as expected, Adam is the smartest child,” replied Gibbs with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Gibbs!” Guan Shan was finally unable to take it anymore. He said in a grim voice, “Just what are you doing? Chatting it up with an AI? At a time like this?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t compare Adam to those AI that you’ve seen before.” Gibbs turned his head to glare to Guan Shan. “I know about the AI in your Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild’s hive headquarters. In fact, I know more about it than you! I had participated in the compiling of the AI of that generation! Humph… … but Adam is different! Adam is not an AI created through computer simulation. Adam is a real virtual life form!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Guan Shan had wanted to respond with something, Chen Xiaolian stepped forward and pressed his hand on Guan Shan’s shoulder. He shook his head and then turned to Gibbs and said, “All right, Gibbs. Now is not the time to quarrel among ourselves. Guan Shan is just being anxious. We are indeed short on time.”</p>
 <p>“… I understand.” Gibbs stood up and looked at Chen Xiaolian. “Adam is not an AI. You can’t just give him instructions and think that he will help you with it… … he is a life form with self-awareness. Thus, he possesses emotions. Do you understand? He is like a real child that can feel. In order to get him to do something, you must connect with him and coax him so as to develop a closer relationship with him.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Gibbs turned to Adam and said, “All right, Adam. Now, can you please give me the results of the calculations I asked your help for?”</p>
 <p>Adam thought about it with a frown on his face. There seemed to be a look of disappointment on the child’s face. “Gibbs, can’t you tell me a story first? Or sing a song?”</p>
 <p>Gibbs took a deep breath. “I am sorry, Adam. We are really short on time right now. This matter is very important to me. Things like telling stories or something else, next time, all right? I am begging you.”</p>
 <p>“… fine.” Although it was difficult to conceal the look of disappointment on his face, Adam finally nodded his head. “Since it is a request from Gibbs, I will definitely not say no – you are not some stranger, you are my favourite Gibbs.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, the little child suddenly moved to sit down cross-legged on the floor. Then, he began counting with his fingers like a little child. Instantly, even more holographic projections appeared.</p>
 <p>One by one, they appeared. However, those were of various formulas and calculations that were rapidly computing.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian noted that the room had seemingly transformed into a digital world. Every corner of the room was filled with the projected numbers. As the numbers kept changing, Chen Xiaolian suddenly came to the realization that the numbers within the room were arranged in a rather familiar way…</p>
 <p>By putting some distance between himself and the flowing numbers… … from a bird’s eye view…</p>
 <p>Zero City’s map!</p>
 <p>No, not a map. Rather, it was a 3D projection of the city.</p>
 <p>The flow of numbers was forming a 3D projection of Zero City.</p>
 <p>“He… … what is he calculating?” Chen Xiaolian asked Gibbs.</p>
 <p>“Calculating the locations of the exit points. No, it would be more accurate to say that he is calculating the location of the exit points, assuming that there are exit points,” replied Gibbs with a sigh.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian felt somewhat confused.</p>
 <p>“Adam, how long do you need?”</p>
 <p>“About the time it takes for half a song. Because ‘it’ is ever changing, trying to catch it is very hard.” There was an irritated look on Adam’s face as he continued calculating something with his fingers.</p>
 <p>“Good.” Gibbs nodded and turned to look at Chen Xiaolian and the others. “Good, now I can explain my plan to you.”</p>
 <p>“Just now you said, assuming there are exit points… … what does that mean?”</p>
 <p>“The idea here is, even though Zero City’s ‘outer passageway system’ has been closed or deleted, other than the main gate, there should still be other exit points – at least, theoretically speaking.”</p>
 <p>“More details please,” said Chen Xiaolian with a sigh.</p>
 <p>“Fine.” Gibbs scratched his head as he seemingly reverted to a tech geek. After a few seconds, Gibbs said, “Firstly, you need to understand what Zero City’s ‘outer passageway’ is.</p>
 <p>“You might think that it is the combination of many roads leading to the outside world. Or the combination of many doors connected to the outside world. Or the combination of many teleportation matrixes.</p>
 <p>“Those lines of thought could be said to be correct. But it is also wrong.</p>
 <p>“If we are to make a figurative analogy, Zero City’s ‘outer passageway’ is like the broadband.</p>
 <p>“Compare it with the broadband used in human homes in the outside world.</p>
 <p>“Let us assume that Zero City’s outer passageway is a broadband bandwidth of 100 Mbps.</p>
 <p>“That means it has a total capacity of 100 Mbps.</p>
 <p>“From that, let’s say the initial setting of the central square’s teleportation matrix, the main gate – let us say it takes up 90 Mbps.</p>
 <p>“However, there are still some allowances left. Those allowances are there for the sake of unexpected situations or emergencies.</p>
 <p>“So, where would the remaining 10 Mbps of bandwidth generally be?</p>
 <p>“The answer is very simple. The wicket gates and various other temporary passageways like the special passageways, reserve passageways, clearance passageways etc. created by our Angel Corps and the other resident guilds are essentially of the ‘temporary type’. They could give those passageways any names they want. However, the genuine main gate is the one in the central square.</p>
 <p>“As for the temporary type passageways, they were created using the unused 10 Mbps of bandwidth.</p>
 <p>“At present however, Zero City’s outer passageway system has disappeared.</p>
 <p>“In short, the outer passageway system is like a management program for the broadband. Now, the management program has disappeared, however… … the broadband package did not disappear!</p>
 <p>“The evidence? The 90 Mbps of bandwidth used by the main gate is still there! Thus, we can deduce that the remaining 10 Mbps should also still exist!</p>
 <p>“Otherwise, if we are to assume that the broadband package had completely disappeared, the main gate should not be working as well! There is no reason for a 100 Mbps bandwidth to mysteriously become a 90 Mbps bandwidth. Theoretically speaking, that should not be.</p>
 <p>“Thus…”</p>
 <p>Gibbs glanced at Adam, who was still calculating. Then, he said, “I had put forward this ‘broadband’ speculation when I was working here in Rubik’s Cube. There were some who agreed with my view on this. However, they all felt that, although my theory is reasonable, it was of no real value. They expressed dissatisfaction with me asking Adam to conduct research on this matter. As an AI life form, Adam already has a lot of computational work on his plate. This theory of mine would only waste a great deal of his computing power. Thus… … I could only ask Adam to secretly help me conduct research on this matter.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s eyes lit up. “If the 10 Mbps of bandwidth did not disappear… … where did it go? Why did it vanish?”</p>
 <p>“No, it did not vanish. It is just that we could not find it. This 10 Mbps of bandwidth has always been under the management of the outer passageway system. That is the way the rules work. Thus, we were able to make use of it. However, with the disappearance of the management program, there is nothing left to manage it… … thus, without anything to keep it in line, it stopped being an obedient piece of instrument that we could use at any moment. Instead… … it transformed into an active stream of data that flows about everywhere. We are unable to see it or feel it. However, it still exists!”</p>
 <p>“And where does it exist?”</p>
 <p>“Everywhere!” Gibbs replied. “This ‘broadband’ is a stream of data that is constantly on the move. It could appear anywhere, stay there for a moment before disappearing and shifting its position elsewhere… … the rate at which it moves alternates between quick and slow.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Gibbs pointed at the 3D model formed from the countless flow of numbers and said, “It has transformed its structure and now exists within Zero City. It could be in any corner of Zero City. Additionally, it is constantly on the move, never to stay at one spot for long.</p>
 <p>“Maybe, at this very second, it is in the competition arena. Maybe, in the next second, it would appear in the Board of Patriarchs’ building. Maybe, in a hundredth of a second, it would appear somewhere 20 metres up in the air at a certain coordinate inside Zero City.</p>
 <p>“Every time it appears, it might stay there for one hour, or a hundredth of a second. There is no way to know for sure.</p>
 <p>“Have you played the game ‘Whack-a-Mole’ before?</p>
 <p>“You can consider the 10 Mbps of bandwidth as the mole that will pop out from the various holes. It would pop out from every hole, constantly on the move. What we want to do here is to locate it! Locate it and catch it!”</p>
 <p>“And?”</p>
 <p>“We need to go through a massive amount of calculation to find where in Zero City is this 10 Mbps of bandwidth is hiding, track its movements, how long it stays, when it disappears… … and predict where and when it would reappear. Then, find a location and time of appearance that we can use!</p>
 <p>“This part is very important, but also very difficult.</p>
 <p>“Finding where it would flow and where it would appear alone is a difficult matter.</p>
 <p>“But now, we also have to find one with suitable timing and location!</p>
 <p>“If it were to appear at a certain spot up in the sky – then there would be no way for us to use it!</p>
