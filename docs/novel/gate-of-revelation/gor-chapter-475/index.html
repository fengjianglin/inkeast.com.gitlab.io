 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 475 Chrono Chasm</strong></p>
 <p>[System prompt: Magic array countdown timer: 16 minutes 41 seconds.]</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian looked at the time and turned his head to look at the figure standing in the distance.</p>
 <p>The cavern had transformed into something beyond recognition.</p>
 <p>The longer the magic array continued, the transformation affecting the cavern grew more complicated.</p>
 <p>The cavern had been a plain one in the beginning. However, it had become larger, now almost resembling a magnificent underground palace. The surrounding mountain walls were replaced with properly constructed black coloured bricks. Grand looking reliefs adorned the surface of the walls, subtle and exquisite despite its grandness.</p>
 <p>Every one of the relief appeared almost life like as a layer of black coloured mists floated above. The mists faded in and out and different scenes appeared on the reliefs.</p>
 <p>Two groups of men moved forward within a cavern.</p>
 <p>The two groups of men attacked each other when they encountered one another within a chasm.</p>
 <p>A knight rode a unicorn to gallop across the mountain wall as though it was flat land.</p>
 <p>Spear shot out like a lightning bolt and someone fell down the chasm.</p>
 <p>In the end, there was a rope bridge across another chasm and a round tray of candles…</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian watched calmly.</p>
 <p>In the middle of the now underground palace was a figure. At present, the figure had grown very blurry as thick amounts of black coloured mists swirled around the figure. The figure’s original appearance was no longer visible.</p>
 <p>Several faint lights were scattered through the surroundings of the underground palace. On the floor surface was a hexagram and its lines shone following a certain pattern.</p>
 <p>Each of the team members from Meteor Rock Guild were standing on one end of the hexagram and they waited silently.</p>
 <p>Beside Chen Xiaolian’s feet was Thirteen.</p>
 <p>Thirteen was sprawled on the floor, not making a single sound. It was only after Chen Xiaolian placed a foot on his back, exerting force down on him did he let out a groan.</p>
 <p>“Stop acting.” Chen Xiaolian pulled a face. “I believe you should have finished conveying all you needed to say.”</p>
 <p>Thirteen opened his eyes and his hands moved in an attempt to get up. However, Chen Xiaolian forced him down and he was forced to struggle. “You…”</p>
 <p>“Of course, I knew that you were pretending to be unconscious.” Chen Xiaolian lowered his voice and smiled. “If not, how could I borrow your mouth to send some information to your companion?”</p>
 <p>His leg forced Thirteen to continue lying on the ground. Even opening his mouth became a difficult matter for Thirteen.</p>
 <p>Even so, an intense killing intent emanated from Chen Xiaolian’s face as he whispered, “Do you find it difficult to talk? No need for you to try so hard. You have already accomplished what you needed to accomplish.”</p>
 <p>Thirteen spat out fiercely. Unfortunately, he was facing down and was unable to spit anything.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chen Xiaolian loosened his feet, allowing Thirteen to quickly spit out. Just as he was about to say something, he heard Chen Xiaolian saying, “Your companion is here.”</p>
 <p>The black coloured mists on the surface of the reliefs wiggled a bit and a figure slowly emerged from it.</p>
 <p>Short, lean, but strong.</p>
 <p>“We have been waiting for you, mystery man!” Chen Xiaolian raised his eyebrows as he looked at the newcomer, his hand gripping the Sword in the Stone’s hilt tightly. The tip of the sword drew a line across the floor, releasing scraping sounds.</p>
 <p>The short figure walked into the underground palace and examined his surroundings. His gaze fell upon the figure in the centre that was enveloped in black coloured mists. After observing the figure for a while, he turned to look at Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>He ignored Chen Xiaolian and strode toward the black silhouette in the centre. Chen Xiaolian did not move; he did not do anything to obstruct the short man.</p>
 <p>Even the surrounding team members from Meteor Rock Guild did not do anything to stop him.</p>
 <p>The short man walked until he was standing beside the black silhouette. He frowned as he observed the black mists swirling about. Then, he reached out with his hand to grab the figure.</p>
 <p>His hand caught thin air.</p>
 <p>It was as though the silhouette and the black mists were simply an illusion.</p>
 <p>Furrowing his brows, he slowly turned to face Chen Xiaolian, who was smiling at him.</p>
 <p>“It seems you fellows are prepared,” the short man spoke in a hoarse tone.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian continued smiling. “In order to receive guests, making due preparations is of course a necessity.”</p>
 <p>The short man faced Chen Xiaolian and sized him up before saying, “What kind of preparations are we talking about then?”</p>
 <p>“It is very simple.” Chen Xiaolian pointed at the central figure that was covered in black mists. Clearly, that was the Demon King. He said coolly, “This is a magic array and the Demon King is about to wake up. However, as the first members from the Demon Faction to arrive, we are given some benefits. These benefits are… … the Demon King can make some beneficial changes to the magic array.”</p>
 <p>“It seems destroying the magic array won’t be easy.” The short man rubbed his chin, an interested look on his face. Even so, there was not a trace of anxiousness on his face.</p>
 <p>“Of course not,” Chen Xiaolian replied calmly. “This magic array had created several separated planes of existences. You can see us all here. However, we have all been sent into different planes of existences. You need to fight your way through one, defeat every protector in every plane of existence before you can lay a hand on the Demon King.”</p>
 <p>“So… … I have to kill you all one by one?” The short man smiled. Then, a frown appeared on his face as he turned toward Thirteen, who was still on the floor. “You knew about these? Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>
 <p>“I… … I don’t know what happened to my guild channel but I suddenly cannot send anything.” Thirteen cast a furious gaze at Chen Xiaolian. “This fellow had seen through me long ago! He must have been the one behind this!”</p>
 <p>“Oh?” The short man turned his attention back to Chen Xiaolian, a curious look on his face. “How did you do that?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian checked the countdown in his system – another 14 minutes 55 seconds to go.</p>
 <p>“Before this, I had gotten into a fight with several weird looking knights. Chen Xiaolian deliberately said slowly, “I killed one of them and also harmed a unicorn.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, I get it.” The short man revealed a look of realization. Next, he gave Chen Xiaolian the thumbs up. “You killed one of Mene’s subordinate? You have got guts! So, you ended up being cursed by the holy curse of the unicorn? The holy curse can temporarily block off some system functions as punishment… … I have always felt that this type of setting is very pointless. Clearly, someone within the Development Team of this game world likes unicorns. That is why there is such a pointless feature. So… … what exactly did you do to Thirteen? Mm, let me guess…”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian shook his head. “No need to guess. The weapon I used to kill the knight and stab the unicorn is stained with their blood. I simply used the same thing; I secretly made a cut on Thirteen’s body with it.”</p>
 <p>As Chen Xiaolian spoke, he looked down at Thirteen. “I had simply tried it as a test. Unexpectedly, it actually worked. Truth be told, I did not care if he could tell you about this setting.”</p>
 <p>“I am curious. What are you plotting?” The look of puzzlement grew on the short man’s face. “You allowed Thirteen to live. Why?”</p>
 <p>“Firstly, the strength of your team is quite good. No, it would be more accurate to say you fellows are quite powerful.” Chen Xiaolian said coolly. “To be able to escape Thorned Flower Guild’s attempt to kill off everyone is proof of your strength. Additionally, there was One-eye’s attack on us. Although his team failed, the attack proved how strong they were.</p>
 <p>“Finally, when I found out that there was someone operating separately from the team, I came to a conclusion.”</p>
 <p>“What conclusion?”</p>
 <p>“You are most likely very strong.” Chen Xiaolian sighed. “You can convince Thirteen and the others to follow your orders willingly and act separately from the team. I believe… …&nbsp; no Team Leader would be willing to have such a kind of subordinate. However, you were able to do so. That means… … you are so strong that One-eye, who was the Team Leader, was unable to control you. No, perhaps it is the reverse. You are the one holding the true decision making authority in this team. You can act separately without moving together with your team members. That means your strength is equal to all four of them combined, or… … perhaps you are even stronger.”</p>
 <p>The short man smiled. “I know you are deliberately saying all that to buy time, but I can only blame my own curiosity. Go on then, we still have time.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s heart grew tense.</p>
 <p>He was indeed telling the truth. However, he was also buying time. This fellow had obviously seen through it, yet he remained indifferent. This meant that he was convinced that he was in no danger.</p>
 <p>“Very well. Now comes the next issue… … there is someone as strong as you out there. We already know for sure that you are a member of the Light Faction, which makes you our enemy. Thus, I needed to do something so as to not waste this discovery.” Chen Xiaolian smiled. “I thought to myself, how do I defeat a powerful expert?”</p>
 <p>“How?”</p>
 <p>“If an expert were to come here with a group of companions, we would undoubtedly be in a load of trouble.” Chen Xiaolian smiled. “However, you happen to like taking action separately. I concluded that you are a very prideful fellow, one who prefers to act alone. Additionally, you are very confident in yourself. In fact, you are so confident you are practically conceited. Considering those factors, there is something we can do.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Chen Xiaolian deliberately paused and looked at the timer again.</p>
 <p>Countdown timer: 13 minutes 5 seconds.</p>
 <p>“Would it be easier to deal with one man or would it be easier to deal with a group of people? Without question, the answer is the former.” Chen Xiaolian shook his head and continued, “However, what should we do to make you run over here by yourself? That was easy… … you are overconfident in yourself and you desire swallowing up the best rewards. What are the rewards? You can only find that out after this instance dungeon is over. However… … in the process of completing the quest, if you can kill off several members of the Demon Faction, you will be able to acquire some more points. That is also a good thing. All of us here are the bait to lure you over.</p>
 <p>“I had deliberately allowed Thirteen to give you information about my team – the strength and skills of everyone here.</p>
 <p>“Experts like you generally have a habit. The more skilled you are, the more reckless you become!</p>
 <p>“People who like to act alone always have a preference to be the only one to clear a level.</p>
 <p>“Moreover, in your case, you have an insider who can provide you information on the enemy. The enemies’ weaknesses and skills. You would be able to find out about it. You are hiding in the dark while your enemies are revealed to you. So…”</p>
 <p>“I understand. Your intention was to use Thirteen to flame the confidence in my heart so that I would come running by myself to kill you all? After giving me that idea, you plan to finish me off when I come alone?” The short man smiled. “This method sounds rather stupid. Still, considering how late it was by the time you realized Thirteen’s lie, your ability to come up with something to make use of that knowledge is quite commendable. You must be Guild Leader Chen Xiaolian, right? I have heard from Thirteen that you are a cunning fellow. I see now that you do indeed have a fairly good brain on you.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian nodded lightly. “Thank you for your praise.”</p>
 <p>“Well, here I am. Your plan is a success and I am alone here. As for the others, I believe it would take them at least another five minutes to get here. You should make good use of that time and fight me.”</p>
 <p>As the short man spoke, he looked around him. “Let me see, none of your teammates are talking at all. They are not moving either… … in other words, they are all not in this dimension. My enemy in this dimension is just you?”</p>
 <p>“That is correct.” Chen Xiaolian smiled and continued, “Kill me and you will be able to meet the next opponent. When playing a game, you will naturally have to go through one level at a time. That is what makes things interesting.”</p>
 <p>The short man looked at Chen Xiaolian. “From what Thirteen told me, among those in your team, your strength is the best. When you appeared, Thirteen’s team was wiped out. From the looks of it, killing you means winning, right?”</p>
 <p>“I cannot be certain how many people are in the Light Faction. I am also uncertain how many people are there in the Demon Faction. As insurance, I lured you, the expert, to come alone. That way, I might have an easier time fighting.” Chen Xiaolian sighed. “You are right. The hardest stage is in front while the later stages are easier. If you can kill me, you win.”</p>
 <p>“What an interesting fellow.” The short man looked at Chen Xiaolian. “I am beginning to feel some admiration for you. Before we start fighting, let us introduce ourselves.”</p>
 <p>Facing Chen Xiaolian, he raised his left hand to perform an odd saluting gesture. “My name is Lefty.”</p>
 <p>“Lefty? Is it because your left hand possesses some particularly powerful ability?” asked Chen Xiaolian with a frown.</p>
 <p>“You will find out soon enough.”</p>
 <p>Lefty laughed and he stepped toward Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>An icy look flashed across Chen Xiaolian’s face. After giving the countdown timer another glance, he promptly raised up his sword.</p>
 <p>The blade of his sword pierced Thirteen from the back, going straight through his heart and out into the floor. As the Sword in the Stone pierced through Thirteen’s heart, he let out a grunt. His head fell sideways as he died.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the countdown timer changed instantly from ‘11 minutes 55 seconds’ to ‘11 minutes 45 seconds’.</p>
 <p>“Killing someone from the opposing faction reduces the countdown timer by 10 seconds.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian pulled his sword out and looked at the unchanging and seemingly indifferent expression on Lefty’s face. Chen Xiaolian raised the Sword in the Stone and faced the incoming figure.</p>
 <p>His body flew!</p>
 <p>After taking two steps forward, Lefty suddenly leapt upward. Chen Xiaolian’s pupils contracted in anticipation only to find that Lefty had – in an instant – disappeared.</p>
 <p>Lefty’s voice spoke out beside his ear. “I am going to attack.”</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian felt a powerful force slam his back and he was instantly sent flying.</p>
 <p>After landing, he rolled away. As he was rolling, he saw that Lefty was behind him, flicking his palm. Chen Xiaolian gritted his teeth as he prepared to counter attack. However, Lefty disappeared once more.</p>
 <p>Speed-type skill?</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s heart sank. However, he quickly dispelled that notion.</p>
 <p><em>That is not a speed-type skill!</em></p>
 <p>When he fell to the floor, he had observed his surroundings. The tile on the floor was cracked and gravel flew.</p>
 <p>Using the gravel as a point of reference, Chen Xiaolian’s mind quickly understood.</p>
 <p><em>My opponent had not become faster.</em></p>
 <p><em>Rather… … I had become slow?</em></p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Once again, Chen Xiaolian felt an intense pain coming from his waist. His body staggered forward as he fell to the floor.</p>
 <p>In that instant, Chen Xiaolian deduced something.</p>
 <p>He… … was targeted by a certain skill.</p>
 <p>He suddenly loosened his grip on the Sword in the Stone, letting it fall down at the same time as him. However, as the Sword in the Stone was falling to the floor, he found that his falling motion was one notch slower in comparison.</p>
 <p>After falling down the floor, Chen Xiaolian quickly reached out to hold the Sword in the Stone once more. He turned around to look at Lefty.</p>
 <p>Lefty’s voice came from beside him instead. “Where are you looking?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian took a deep breath. “You can control my movement speed?”</p>
 <p>“Speed?” Lefty laughed, his voice coming from behind Chen Xiaolian. “What I control is not your speed. It is… … your time, little guy.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s back felt pain.</p>
 <p>It was as though something sharp was stabbing him from behind.</p>
 <p>“[A] class protective suit? Your equipment is pretty good.” Lefty sounded surprised.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian staggered and he turned around to see Lefty raising his left hand. His fingers moved toward his mouth, tapping it lightly. There was some blood on his fingertips.</p>
 <p>“To think I failed to tear through your protective suit. [A] class goods, not bad.”</p>
 <p><em>Control my time?</em> Chen Xiaolian looked at him.</p>
 <p>“There are still 11 minutes and 26 seconds.” Lefty smiled. “You are quite clever. However, you forgot something. Strategy is built upon strength. You successfully lure me here, but it appears you do not have any way of defeating me. Your strength… … in my opinion, you are not as strong as Thirteen described.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian gave a harrumph and he suddenly pulled out a gun from his waist. Aiming at Lefty, he pulled the trigger.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>Lefty quickly moved to dodge the bullets.</p>
 <p>A strange look lit up Chen Xiaolian’s eyes.</p>
 <p>When Lefty moved to dodge the bullets, Chen Xiaolian noticed a certain detail.</p>
 <p>Lefty’s action of dodging began before Chen Xiaolian pulled the trigger.</p>
 <p>What did that mean?</p>
 <p>It meant…</p>
 <p>Lefty’s skill could only affect Chen Xiaolian’s time alone.</p>
 <p>It could not affect foreign objects!</p>
 <p>For example… … bullets. Those were considered foreign objects.</p>
 <p>After understanding that, Chen Xiaolian watched as Lefty dodged the bullets and moved at astonishing speed toward him. He reached Chen Xiaolian’s side and shot out his fingers, which formed hooks as they went toward Chen Xiaolian’s throat.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian responded with a certain action.</p>
 <p>He suddenly sent the Sword in the Stone flying out.</p>
 <p>He used the large Sword in the Stone as one would use a flying dagger, sending it flying forward with the strength of his fingers alone.</p>
 <p>The Sword in the Stone was much larger and heavier than a flying dagger.</p>
 <p>However…</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s strength was enough for him to accomplish that feat.</p>
 <p>He did so head-on with a short and unexpected set of movements.</p>
 <p>From Lefty’s perspective, Chen Xiaolian had been targeted by his skill. To him, Chen Xiaolian’s movements were all in slow motion.</p>
 <p>Unexpectedly, the Sword in the Stone shot out from Chen Xiaolian’s hand, flying toward him.</p>
 <p>Once the Sword in the Stone left Chen Xiaolian’s hand, it also became unaffected by Lefty’s time skill. It moved at normal speed once more.</p>
 <p>Lefty, who was observing the slow moving Chen Xiaolian, was suddenly greeted by the sword, which moved at normal speed – he revealed shock and quickly moved to dodge it. However, the Sword in the Stone grazed him and the blade of the sword landed a cut on his shoulder.</p>
 <p>Thud!</p>
 <p>The Sword in the Stone flew out and fell some place over 10 metres away.</p>
 <p>Lefty clutched his shoulder and took several steps back. There was a frown on his face as he looked at Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>“It seems your skill is of controlling time. Besides that however, your aspects are all average.” Chen Xiaolian laughed. “That sword throw just now, even a normal Body Technique user would be able to dodge it with ease.”</p>
 <p>“Controlling time is enough for me to kill you.” The injured Lefty appeared furious. He narrowed his eyes and crouched down. Next, he dashed toward Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian watched as his enemy charged over at breakneck speed. Lefty’s speed seemed so astonishing it almost seemed as though he would slam into him.</p>
 <p>Lefty’s fingers formed hooks. His target was obviously Chen Xiaolian’s throat.</p>
 <p>“Garfield!”</p>
 <p>Three Four-eyed War Cats suddenly charged out from beside Chen Xiaolian and pounced forward.</p>
 <p>The corners of Lefty’s eyes twitched and he threw himself to the ground, rolling away. His movements appeared rather wretched as he dodged the paws of the three Garfield doppelgangers. Before getting up, he quickly opened his palm and flicked it in the direction of the three incoming Four-eyed War Cats.</p>
 <p>Instantly, the three Garfield doppelgangers’ movements grew slow. Lefty casually found a gap between the incoming attacks and made his way past them. At the same time, he sent a palm strike toward the abdomen area of one of the Garfield doppelgangers.</p>
 <p>A miserable roar rang out. When all three Garfield doppelgangers landed on the floor, one of them curled up and whimpered in pain.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian inhaled and looked at Lefty.</p>
 <p>Lefty sneered. “Your pet is actually the Four-eyed War Cat? And three of them? How laughable…”</p>
 <p>Although Lefty was smiling, Chen Xiaolian noticed that Lefty’s fingers were trembling lightly a few times.</p>
 <p>“It seems targeting four targets with his time skill is costing him more.” Chen Xiaolian thought to himself and shouted. “Again! Charge together!”</p>
 <p>He got into a readying position before throwing his body forward. He shot toward Lefty like an artillery and the three Garfield doppelgangers followed suit.</p>
 <p>Two of them charged from left and right. The third one launched a Tiger Rush, leaping above Chen Xialian toward Lefty.</p>
 <p>“Fool! The effect of Chrono Chasm is infinite.” Lefty laughed proudly.</p>
 <p>As the two Garfield doppelgangers were about to descend upon him, Lefty moved casually, slipping past their attacks before moving to face Chen Xiaolian’s attack. Similarly, he slipped past Chen Xiaolian from his side. At the same time, he kicked the airborne Garfield doppelganger’s waist.</p>
 <p>All of those actions happened in the span of less than two seconds. When Chen Xiaolian and the three Garfield doppelgangers landed, Chen Xiaolian rolled on the floor and felt intense pain coming from his body.</p>
 <p>There was blood on Lefty’s two outstretched fingers. “How do you like it?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian grunted and looked at him. “How many targets can you lock on to?”</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>“Come out, Bai Qi!”</p>
