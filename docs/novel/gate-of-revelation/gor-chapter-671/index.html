 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 671 I Have Seen It&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After landing, Lei Hu saw that Chen Xiaolian and the others had not run off. Instead, they stood side by side on a small dune. There were only less than 100 metres between them and the outermost woody vines.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>They… … did not run away?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>They probably knew they won’t be able to get away. So, they gave up.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was a very unsightly look on Lei Hu’s face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although there were more than ten Irregularity corpses to serve as nourishment for his skill earlier, the range that the vines needed to cover had still been too much.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Every blooming flower, every scattered seed, all of them would sap away the strength from his own body, bit by bit.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Thankfully, the rate at which Chen Xiaolian’s group ran did not go beyond his estimate. If the vines had needed another five more minutes to find them, he would have been unable to hold on.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You have greatly disappointed me, Chen Xiaolian.” Lei Hu’s gaze swept across Bluesea and Qiao Qiao. “I had said before, if I can gain benefits through negotiations, then I would do my best to not resort to violence. However, it would appear that you are not the type to negotiate. It seems I can only choose to kill your companions.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu had spoken with a gentle tone. However, killing intent had revealed themselves within his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You finally reveal your true body.” Chen Xiaolian regarded Lei Hu from top to bottom before letting out a snicker. “I say, why do you look like Yoda?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yoda?” Lei Hu knitted his brows. “What are you talking about?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Forget it.” Chen Xiaolian waved his hand and revealed an indifferent smile. “He is also a green-skinned shorty with sharp ears. However, an old guy like you, you must have been dead for over at least 800 years. You definitely won’t know about Star Wars. Just forget I said that.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu furrowed his brows slightly but chose not to respond.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This was unexpected. Lei Hu had come here personally but Chen Xiaolian appeared nonchalant.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Could he have… … another trump card in his hands?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Qiao Qiao, the one you encountered before, is it also this green-skinned shorty?” Chen Xiaolian extended his hand to point at Lei Hu, who was standing some distance away, and asked Qiao Qiao.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No.” Qiao Qiao shook her head. “He was taller than him, and his skin is not this green. I think… … that was also one of the puppet bodies in his control.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian laughed out. “I knew it. Looks like this fellow has a really low self-esteem. He knows that he is ugly so he doesn’t have the courage to reveal himself most of the time. Am I right, Master Yoda?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A murderous glint flashed across Lei Hu’s eyes. However, it was only a fleeting glint and he quickly suppressed it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He absolutely must not grow furious.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He had already forgotten how long it had been since the last Irregularity, who dared mock him, had died. Yet, Lei Hu dared not kill Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After so many years since his death, his wait for a chance to return had finally come. He must not end up losing it due to an impulsive desire.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Don’t worry, Chen Xiaolian.” Lei Hu took a deep breath as he struggled to maintain the final trace of a dignified expression on his face. He squeezed out a smile and said, “I assure you, you will live. As for your companions… … they will die miserable deaths.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Despite all his efforts to maintain a dignified look, gnashing sounds could be heard coming from Lei Hu’s teeth. Chen Xiaolian’s group were able to pick up the sounds.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I don’t know how effective your assurance is.” Chen Xiaolian shook his head and smiled. “Why don’t you look at this?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Both his hands, which had been placed behind his back, now moved to the front.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A dark black disc rested between his palms.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Do you recognize this item, Mr Lei Hu?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Are you sure this will work, Xiaolian?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Ten minutes prior…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Qiao Qiao’s eyes were wide open as she stared at Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea, on the other hand, had his eyes closed as he pondered the matter.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I cannot be certain.” Chen Xiaolian shook his head, a wry smile on his face as he looked at the black disc in his hand. “However, this is the only method we have. Assuming that the chance of success for this plan is one per cent, then the other methods, be it fighting him or running, the chance of success will be forever zero. Since that is the case, we can only try this.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He looked upward at the distant sky. He knew that Lei Hu was coming.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As an [S] class expert, once Lei Hu himself arrived, even if the three of them fought together, they would have no chance of winning.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although Chen Xiaolian himself was not an [S] class expert, he had, for a short period of time, held Skyblade’s [S] class powers as his own.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Back then, he had only borrowed Skyblade’s power temporarily. However, that was enough for Chen Xiaolian to understand the difference between him and [S] class experts.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At present, he could utilize the Sword in the Stone to temporarily restore all his physical attributes. Even so, Chen Xiaolian estimated that he may not even possess the comprehensive combat power of an [A+] class expert.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>No… … it would be more accurate to say that, here in World’s End, Chen Xiaolian would surely be incapable of reaching the combat power of an [A+] class expert.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>All his equipment, Bai Qi, the Four-eyed War Cat, all of them could no longer be used. The present Chen Xiaolian was practically naked. With the exception of the Sword in the Stone, he only possessed the seized items within the Storage Ring.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The silver bow appeared like a wondrous equipment. However, due to the loss of personal system, he was unable to immediately figure out its skills and attributes. Chen Xiaolian had already tested it before. However, be it the action of just pulling the bowstring or placing one of the remaining crystal arrows on it before letting loose, he was incapable of unleashing even one tenth of its original powers.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The tall, hawk-faced man surely had no personal system as well. For him to be able to unleash those powerful attacks with the bow, Chen Xiaolian believed that, given a sufficient amount of time, he would be able to figure out how to use it somehow.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, Chen Xiaolian did not have enough time.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Thanks to the high degree of genetic compatibility, the Bug Armour on Bluesea could be regarded as a top-grade equipment. Be it melee battles, ranged battles or reconnaissance work, it was capable in all aspects. The heat blasters formed by the tentacles were especially powerful.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>And yet, the current Bluesea was just an ordinary person who had not undergone any enhancement to his attributes. To go all-out with the Bug Armour with the body of an ordinary human, he could only last for around two or three minutes before collapsing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After undergoing an upgrade, Qiao Qiao’s Child of Darkness skill now possessed the Anti-materialization ability. It was a very powerful ability. With the exception of energy-based attacks or spirit-type attacks, she could ignore all other physical attacks. However, Chen Xiaolian, for one, would not believe that Lei Hu, who was an [S] class expert and the leader of the Coalition, could only attack using corpses.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>From as early as when they were fleeing from the snowfield instance dungeon, Chen Xiaolian’s mind had been repeatedly simulating their fight numerous times.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As he was in the dark about Lei Hu’s power, the enemy Chen Xiaolian simulated within his mind was himself – the one who possessed Skyblade’s power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>No matter how many times he went over it, the final result was that the three of them would be defeated.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Since that was the case, he could only make a gamble.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu’s pupils contracted rapidly as they stared intently at the disc in Chen Xiaolian’s hand. “… … Plasma mine?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Correct!” Chen Xiaolian snapped with his left hand as he raised his brows. His right hand continued to hold the plasma mine tightly. “It seems that even though you are an [S] class expert, you are not completely in the dark about explosives in the outside world. The power of this thing is indeed quite common. It is neither too big or small. For a master like you, it is certainly negligible. I, on the other hand…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian smiled at Lei Hu. “You see, I am just a small fish. This plasma mine has a blast radius of five metres. The moment it explodes, do you think… … you can still find an intact part of me?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Have you gone mad?” Lei Hu glared. He took a step forward, intending to rush out, but then saw Chen Xiaolian lifting his hand up slightly. Lei Hu retracted his foot. “You would rather have all three of you die here than bring me back? Why?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I like it that way.” Although Chen Xiaolian had been maintaining the smile on his face, his hand had been gripping the plasma mine tightly. He dared not let down his guard at all. “Can’t accept it? Come bite me! However, I must remind you, the safety for this mine has been pulled out. My hand is now pressing down on the detonation lever. The moment I loosen my hand, it will explode. I assure you, I am most certainly not wearing any protective suit.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu grew silent.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He was unable to stop his chest from heaving up and down. He glared at the plasma mine in Chen Xiaolian’s hand and seven to eight thoughts flew through his mind. However, none of them could let him successfully snatch away the plasma mine in Chen Xiaolian’s hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What is wrong, Mr Lei Hu? Where is your Foresight skill?” Seeing the expression on Lei Hu’s face, Chen Xiaolian was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief. “Why don’t you use it now and tell me the result? In the end, will I die in the explosion, or will I be taking you back to the outside world as planned?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu’s face was dark as he grunted, “Do you really think I dare not kill you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Dare? Of course, you dare.” Chen Xiaolian nodded his head, a smile on his face. “Truth be told, you don’t need to personally take action. As long as you take one step forward, I will loosen my grip and this plasma mine will immediately explode. How about it? Do you want to test it?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Slowly, Lei Hu closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Next, his eyelids twitched fiercely. It was as though the pupils underneath the eyelids were moving at a rate that was countless times above normal.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea and Qiao Qiao stood beside Chen Xiaolian, on his left and right respectively. Bluesea’s arms had transformed out the heat blasters while Qiao Qiao was prepared to enter Anti-materialization form at any moment. Both of them stared intently at Lei Hu, not daring to let down their guard.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After who knew how long had passed…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu finally opened both his eyes. He sighed softly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I’ve seen it.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
