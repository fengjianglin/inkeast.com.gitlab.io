 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 599 Clearing The Three Stages </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Appearance wise, Phoenix looked to be in a rather bad state.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Her beautiful eyes were bereft of colour, seemingly having lost her sense of self-awareness. Her eyelids remained open while her eyes stared forward absent-mindedly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Despite all that, Chen Xiaolian could still feel the killing intent swirling around Phoenix’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>An intense sensation of danger gripped Chen Xiaolian’s heart.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Additionally, Chen Xiaolian was also worried about something else. What about the others?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix’s strength was something Chen Xiaolian had seen with his own eyes. If someone as powerful as Phoenix could be captured and controlled by the masters of this place, what about the others?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Excluding the group where Tian Lie and Nicole was in and Phoenix herself, there were still the old man Sawakita and Nagase Komi.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At that point in time, however, Chen Xiaolian no longer had the time to hesitate.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix had taken a step forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The wand in her hand had begun glowing. At the same time, Phoenix’s left hand moved deftly to pull out a stack of talismans from her waist pocket and tossed them into the air.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As the talismans were scattering forward, golden light shone out and countless magic symbols appeared to descend upon their surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Instantly, Chen Xiaolian felt a sensation of pressure pressing down on him from every direction. Layer after layer of chains seemingly locked the very air around him. It felt as though there were countless sharp blades aimed at him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A killing intent rose to high heaven.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Despite knowing that his next action would likely be of no effect, still, Chen Xiaolian attempted to shout at Phoenix, “Phoenix! Do you really have to do this? Have you completely lost all sense of self?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix did not answer him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>She waved her wand and a sphere of light shone out from the surface of the wand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian’s heart was instantly assailed by a chill. He instinctively dodged by jumping to the left.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Next, however, when Chen Xiaolian’s body was still in the middle of charging to the left, he felt an invisible force gripping hold of his body. After that, his body was sent flying.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The golden coloured symbols that were scattered all over, every one of them, seemingly came to life. They had seemingly found their target as they all charged toward Chen Xiaolian’s figure.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Several of the golden coloured symbols struck Chen Xiaolian’s body. He did not feel any pain from them. However, his heart lurched.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He could feel his body falling rapidly to the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>No, it would be more accurate to say his body was slammed onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He attempted to get up, only to discover that his body was rapidly becoming heavier. The countless golden coloured symbols continued rushing him furiously, striking his body. As the situation developed, Chen Xiaolian could feel his body growing heavier. Even the action of bending his fingers required a great deal of effort.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even his eyelids were getting heavier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Under this extreme pressure, any action Chen Xiaolian attempted was difficult. His body sprawled on the ground, seemingly incapable of moving in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It became harder and harder to breathe. It felt as though the bones and muscles in his body were pressing down on him and it grew harder and harder for his lungs to expand and contract.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian laboured to breathe and forced his head up to look at Phoenix. He saw that Phoenix had her wand raised as she stepped toward him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Is this one of your decisive moves?” Chen Xiaolian gritted his teeth and continued, “Never seen you use it before… …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix remained silent. Neither did she reveal any other form of response. She simply continued stepping toward him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian attempted to struggle. However, the weight pressing down upon his body made him powerless. As even his breathing was being suppressed, the feelings of suffocation grew.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian dared not hesitate any longer. He quickly activated Skyblade’s power. A massive power abruptly welled out from within him and the force pressing down on his body was immediately blasted away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Instantly, Chen Xiaolian’s body bounced up from the ground like a fish jumping high into the air. At the same time, Phoenix, who was already close by, swung her wand down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Clang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The wand struck the very spot that Chen Xiaolian had been sprawled on and the ground there immediately turned into powder. At the same time, a golden coloured symbol appeared on the ground, causing a powerful suction force to come into play. The suction force sucked in everything around it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Your attacks are seriously vicious… …” Chen Xiaolian, who was still in the middle of the air, said with a scoff as he charged toward Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Fearing that he might end up harming Phoenix, Chen Xiaolian was not using any weapons at all. Thus, he sent his fist over as he punched Phoenix’s lower abdomen area.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The punch made contact and Phoenix immediately bent her body as a result. However, Phoenix seemingly felt no pain from that. She simply raised her head to look at Chen Xiaolian with a look of indifference. Her wand swung out and another golden coloured light sent Chen Xiaolian flying.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Following a loud booming noise, the two of them split. Chen Xiaolian fell to the ground. He took a deep breath and was about to climb up when his face suddenly sank.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The boundless pressure came once again from every direction, like a tidal wave. Layer by layer, they pressed down on him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian's heart sank!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>This spell is devious!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Just now, after using Skyblade’s power, he had seemingly broken through this spell. So, now, how did this happen?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Reaching that line of thought, he noticed Phoenix steadying herself. She swung her wand in a semi-circle before her. As she did so, tens of crystal clear swords appeared in the middle of the air. The swords hung in mid-air, their tips pointing right at Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Go!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix uttered in a soft voice and the tens of swords flew forward. It was as though she was utilizing a flying sword technique. With an air-piercing aura of sharpness, the swords shot toward Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian roared out, unleashing Skyblade’s power once more. The moment his body was freed, he vaulted into the air. At the same time, he finally pulled out a sword. He rapidly stabbed out with the sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Ringing sounds reverberated incessantly as the tens of crystal swords flying toward Chen Xiaolian were all smashed by Chen Xiaolian. In the end, however, even the sword that Chen Xiaolian was using broke into two.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At that moment, Chen Xiaolian missed the Sword in the Stone that he once had.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Ordinary weapons were incapable of handling the burden of him utilizing Skyblade’s [S] class power. Clearly, he will have to go look for some weapons that he could use in the future.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After crushing the flying swords, Chen Xiaolian swung, throwing the hilt of his broken sword at Phoenix. Phoenix dodged to the side only to find that Chen Xiaolian was already before her.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He reached out with his hand to grab Phoenix’s wand, intending to snatch it away. However, his fingers had just gripped the wand when he noticed a glimmer of coldness flash across Phoenix’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian’s heart gave a pound and he hastily released his grip. However, he was still too late.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A burning sensation seared his fingers.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The moment Chen Xiaolian released his grip, he saw that his right hand had become charred. The skin on his fingers had melted. Even the white of his bones could be seen.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Motes of flames continued licking his fingers. Chen Xiaolian swiftly retreated, rolling away on the ground while desperately rubbing his fingers against the ground. Despite all that, he was unable to get rid of the motes of flames on his fingers.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian clenched his teeth. His left hand abruptly pulled out a dagger and he swung down with it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>With a “ca”, the dagger descended.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Three of the fingers on Chen Xiaolian’s right hand were directly cut off.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The fingers fell to the ground and the flames continued burning. After just a few seconds, the cut fingers had been reduced to nothingness.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>What a powerful fire!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian sucked in a breath of cold air and he quickly took a few steps back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Holding back the intense pain coming from his right hand, Chen Xiaolian cast a serious gaze at Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix remained as she had. Although she was staring intently at Chen Xiaolian, her eyes remained empty.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Good skill,” said Chen Xiaolian with a strained smile. “Back then, I did not see you use this skill. I take it this must be a newly acquired decisive skill?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix pursed her lips. Suddenly, she responded with a very robotic and cold voice. “True Samadhi Fire, [A+] class skill.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>True Samadhi Fire?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian sucked in another breath of cold air. He had heard of this name before.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“New skill?” Chen Xiaolian grunted and looked at his injured right hand with a frown.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You are proficient with the sword. Now that your hand is injured, what can you use against me?” Phoenix said coldly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian could sense it. Phoenix was being controlled by someone. However, this controlling technique was very strange. It had made Phoenix lose her sense of self while leaving her combat instincts intact. Moreover, her intellect was also left intact.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Using the skill to burn his hands was a reflection of Phoenix’s intellect.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Is the present you a puppet or the real Phoenix?” asked Chen Xiaolian with a smile. “You appear just as intelligent as the real deal.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You originally had a chance. Unfortunately, you were unwilling to kill me,” Phoenix said coolly. “Just now, you had managed to close the distance between us. I am a magus. After you closed the distance between us, you did not use a weapon because you were unwilling to harm me. Instead, you just punched me… if not for that, I may not have had the chance to grievously wound you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Just as intelligent as the normal you.” Chen Xiaolian sighed and took a step backward.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You cannot win.” Phoenix stepped closer. “The rule for this stage is, you must kill me. However… … can you do it?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian was unable to answer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Strength wise, if he were to ignore the price of his actions… unleashing Skyblade’s power or using the Goddess of Dawn’s Overwhelming Sunlight Purification, which would combust all his attributes, he would be able to kill Phoenix… …&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although the price was heavy and he would most likely end up injured, it was still feasible.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The problem here was… … this was Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian had always considered his companions as people of great importance. This was his personal principle. He was the one who invited Phoenix to this place. He was also the one who led her here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Given Chen Xiaolian’s personality, how could he bring himself to strike down Phoenix?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… … …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Thus, it is your loss for certain, Chen Xiaolian. Because you are always too kind and soft-hearted.” Phoenix sneered and raised her wand against Chen Xiaolian once more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian felt his body lurching into a heavy state once more. All he could do was to unleash Skyblade’s power once more and quickly retreat.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>With a booming sound, the place he was standing was once again enveloped by golden light.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In a short span of time, Chen Xiaolian had been forced to utilize Skyblade’s power thrice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The golden symbols created from the talismans that Phoenix threw out in the beginning, which had struck him, appeared to be quite the nefarious spell.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>By utilizing Skyblade’s power, he could break through the state of suppression momentarily. However, Skyblade’s power was only a burst type skill for Chen Xiaolian. He could not maintain it for a long time because his present strength and body had yet to actually reach a real [S] class. Thus, he could only utilize the power in short bursts.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>And there was a limit to the number of times he could utilize it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>To be forced to utilize the power three times in this short span of time, Chen Xiaolian was speechless.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“This is also a newly acquired skill. It is called the ‘Suppression Symbols of Ten Heavens and Eight Desolations’,” said Phoenix coolly. “I know you are very familiar with my combat techniques. That is why I have been utilizing new skills that you have never seen before right from the get go – this skill, the True Samadhi Fire, is something that I had originally wanted to keep to be used against my great enemy.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I am curious, though. I have already felt this skill for myself, very powerful indeed… … yet, in the last instance dungeon, you did not have any fortuitous encounters. How did you get this new skill?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Purchased from the system,” replied Phoenix coolly. She shook her head. “Naturally, the price for it is very high.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Price? What is the price?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix raised four fingers on her left hand. “130 years of lifespan.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian was dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix continued calmly, “I had divined out my lifespan. Due to some of the System Exchange items I used to enhance my body, I have quite the decent attributes. According to the result from my divination, assuming I am free from diseases and disasters, this body of mine can live until 160. However… … I exchanged out 130 years from that for these two skills.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>160 minus 130… …</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>In other words, the present Phoenix can only live up to 30?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>The current her should already be in her early 20s.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>If so… … how many more years does she have left?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian sighed. “What made you choose this? Who is this enemy you have to face?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I did not tell you about it back then. Naturally, I won’t be telling you about it now.” Phoenix shook her head. “Enough, we have been chatting a lot. I know that you are trying to buy time, Chen Xiaolian… … however, I am also doing the same thing.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… … … ?!” Chen Xiaolian was shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix coldly struck the ground with her wand. “Do you know why I am willing to follow along and chat with you? You need time, so do I… … the Suppression Symbols of Ten Heavens and Eight Desolations have already merged with my True Samadhi Fire. After you were hit by my talisman symbols and fire, I needed time for them to seep deep into your body. After that… … the True Samadhi Fire that has merged with the symbols will become a one-hit kill, Chen Xiaolian!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian revealed a miserable smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“So, I have to kill you to complete this stage?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What if I wake you up?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It will also be your win.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Waking you up… … will certainly not be easy,” said Chen Xiaolian with the same miserable smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes.” Phoenix spoke calmly. “If you want to wake me up… unless you die. Only by seeing you dead before me will the Puppet Manipulation Technique on me unravel. That way, you will still be considered as having passed the stage.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Isn’t that contradictory?” Chen Xiaolian shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Indeed. Thus, for this stage… … Chen Xiaolian. You are dead for certain.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix suddenly and gently raised her wand from the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At the same time, golden light burst out from Chen Xiaolian’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His entire figure charged forward at lightning like speed and he arrived before Phoenix in an instant.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Die… …” Before Phoenix could finish the word “die”, Chen Xiaolian’s left palm had reached her chest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Naturally, there was no time for Chen Xiaolian to enjoy the softness of Phoenix’s chest. A fierce power gushed forward from behind his left palm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix’s entire body was sent flying. After landing on the ground, her face turned yellow and she coughed out blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>She forced herself to stand up even as she coughed out blood. She sneered and said, “Powerful! Even so, you had continued to hold back! You could have killed me! And yet, you did not… … thus, you deserve to die.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian simply stood there and looked down at his palm. He released a faint sigh. “Who said I was being soft-hearted? I never intended to kill you with that attack. I just wanted to wound you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Wound me? What use is there in wounding me? As long as I do not die, I will be able to trigger the True Samadhi Fire within your body at any moment to burn you to your death.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The wound is an insurance. If my plan fails… … I will first seriously wound you so that you no longer have any strength to do battle. That way, I can save myself some troubles.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… … you are not making any sense. You may die now.” Phoenix raised up her right hand and made a grasping motion.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Countless golden symbols burst out from within Chen Xiaolian’s body and transformed into the True Samadhi Fire.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian bellowed aloud as his entire figure was enveloped by the True Samadhi Fire. After letting out the howl of pain… …</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In just the blink of an eye, the True Samadhi Fire had reduced his whole body to ashes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lin Leyan, who had been holding both Jenny and Hossein, shouted out mournfully from afar.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Xiaolian!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lin Leyan ran forward. However, she had only taken a few steps before a certain force knocked her backward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing Chen Xiaolian turn to ashes, a glimmer of light flashed across Phoenix’s face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Suddenly, her body recoiled and she fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I… … I killed Chen Xiaolian?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix quickly recovered her sense of clarity and she stared blankly at the ashes drifting into the winds… …</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I… I, I really killed Chen Xiaolian?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>She sat cross-legged in the empty space and looked with a dazed expression at the crystal ball before her.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Soo Soo had been in that state since earlier. There were no images upon the surface of the crystal ball.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Suddenly, Soo Soo’s heart skipped a beat.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>An item within her Storage Watch had issued out a prompt, which was sent to her personal system.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mm? For it to be used to fast…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Soo Soo sighed. “Xiaolian oppa must have done something stupid again.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After saying that, she swiftly made her choice through her personal system.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Execute immediately.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix continued staring blankly at the ashes before her. Tears welled out from her pair of eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I… killed Chen Xiaolian? I had actually killed Chen Xiaolian… …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As Phoenix was just about to get up and cry out…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A sphere of green light suddenly shone from the air before her.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A human figure slowly formed within the sphere of light. After just a few seconds, a whole human figure appeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Hey, it seems you care quite a bit for this companion of yours. You actually cried due to me dying?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian looked at Phoenix with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix was stunned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After continuing to stare blankly for a few seconds, Phoenix hastily jumped up and rushed to stand before Chen Xiaolian. She reached out with both hands to grip Chen Xiaolian’s shoulders. “You… … you did not die? How did you do it?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Hey, don’t shake me. Shouldn’t you be happy that I am still alive?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That is impossible! Once my True Samadhi Fire and Suppression Symbols combo hits someone, there will be no way to negate it! Even an [S] class expert would have no way to endure the internal damage caused by the True Samadhi Fire bursting out from within his or her body! You, how could you, how… …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That is why… just now, you have actually killed me once,” said Chen Xiaolian with a smile. “However, thanks to that, you woke up. I have achieved my goal.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What exactly is going on?” asked Phoenix with widened eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian did not answer her. Instead, he raised his head to look at the empty sky around them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Hey! I passed, didn’t I?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was only after some time had passed did a voice rang out from the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You used ‘that’ prop?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian replied calmly, “I don’t know what you are talking about.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Humph, Body Substitution Doll? Or Lifehymn Music Score? Mm… … I am guessing it is the latter. In this game, props capable of bringing people back to life are rare. The system is extremely stingy in this regard. Thus, these props are extremely rare. Those two are the only ones I know of. The Body Substitution Doll is definitely not with you. If so, I would guess… … it is the Lifehymn Music Score, right? Chen Xiaolian?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The voice seemed to contain traces of mockery.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>And yet, Chen Xiaolian was able to notice the hint of surprise within the other party’s voice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Up to you what you want to make of it.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Humph, trying to keep it hidden before me… … useless. The Lifehymn Music Score can only store lives for resurrection beforehand once. Can you be certain that you will not die in the next battle within this instance dungeon?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Enough nonsense. I have completed the third stage! Now, come out and face me! I told you before, I want to kill you!” Chen Xiaolian grunted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Well then, come on in.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A door appeared before Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Come and face me. I am curious, how are you going to kill me?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Lifehymn Music Score? As I recall, you had destroyed that thing back then, right? You had personally destroyed it. How could this kid have it?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Maybe it is a fragment. That is an exclusive-type prop. The system will not create a second one.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Ha ha ha ha… … interesting! Truly interesting! This kid had actually utilized your exclusive prop from back then to break your game! Ha ha ha ha!!!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Look at you laughing so happily. But did you not end up helpless against the little girl as well? Are you done counting hairs?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Humph! If I say I will do something, then I will do it! It is just a gambling wager. It is my loss, that is all. Even when losing, I have nothing to be afraid of. You, on the other hand… … don’t you go pretend you did not lose and sneakily do something to these little toys. If you do, I will be looking down on you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
