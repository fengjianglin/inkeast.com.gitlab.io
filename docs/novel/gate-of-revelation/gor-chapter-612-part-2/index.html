 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 612 Part 2 The World’s End </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A beam of light flashed out and struck the ground somewhere half a metre before the sports car, leaving a half-metre diameter crater there.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian quickly lifted his foot from the brake and fully stepped down on the accelerator. Following the squealing sounds from the tires, the sports car turned around the crater as it moved in pursuit of the jetpack man and the jeep.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The thin man fired repeatedly at Chen Xiaolian. However, due to Chen Xiaolian’s unerring swerves, all the shots missed, leaving a series of craters on the ground. Some of the shots even struck the cars left on the street, causing them to blow up in flames.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Inwardly, Chen Xiaolian felt slightly puzzled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Unless they were of the lowest type of model, energy-tier weapons from the system would usually come with a lock-on function. The lock-on function could not guarantee that every shot will hit its target. However, unless the target possessed a very high level of speed and the ability to predict the trajectory of incoming attacks, the target would find it near impossible to avoid the attacks.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At present, not a single one of the shots fired had managed to land. Not on the sports car that Chen Xiaolian was driving nor the jeep in front.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>That meant the energy blaster that the thin man was wielding was something that needed manual aiming.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, judging by the power of its attacks, it should not be some low-end system product.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>And yet, despite its considerable power, it was just a defective equipment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In but moments, Chen Xiaolian had come to that conclusion regarding the energy blaster wielded by the thin man.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian’s sudden appearance disrupted the thin man’s rhythm of attack, allowing the jeep, which had been in grave danger, to seize some breathing room. It abruptly made a sharp turn at an intersection and sped into an underground parking garage beneath a high-rise building.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing that, the flying man fired two shots at the jeep, but they failed to hit the jeep. Instead, they hit the entrance of the parking garage, causing the entrance to collapse.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Realizing there was no way to continue his pursuit of the jeep, the thin man then turned around in mid-air and flew toward Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Earlier on, someone in the jeep had been constantly shooting at the thin man, hindering his attempts to move closer. Thus, the thin man could only open fire on the jeep from a distance. The sports car that Chen Xiaolian was driving, on the other hand, had not opened fire at him once. Observing from high up in the air, the thin man had also noticed that Chen Xiaolian was alone in the car. Thus, he flew down, lowering the distance between him and the ground as he charged toward Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A sharp whistling sound could be heard from the jetpack as the thin man swooped down at a rapid rate. Chen Xiaolian could clearly see the savage grin on the thin man’s face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When there were only 50 metres between the two, the thin man opened fire with the energy blaster in his right hand. At such a close distance, his attack finally hit home. The beam of light struck the sports car that Chen Xiaolian had been driving, causing it to explode.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, as the car was exploding, Chen Xiaolian was already in the air, having vaulted up just before then.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The sports car had no roof. With a jump, Chen Xiaolian vaulted to a height of tens of metres in the air, going straight toward the thin man.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing Chen Xiaolian’s ascent, the thin man abruptly let out a sharp cry. Frantically, he adjusted the jetpack and rose upward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His original plan was to fly in a diving motion and blast the sports car that Chen Xiaolian was driving. He had observed that there was only one unarmed person inside the sports car. Thinking that his prey would be unable to counter attack, he believed that one well-aimed hit was all he needed to take down this fat and delicious prey.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, when the thin man saw Chen Xiaolian jump out from the sports car to reach such an amazing height, he suddenly realized that this man before him was different compared to those in the jeep earlier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>He – is also an Irregularity!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The thin man pulled out a long blade from his back. However, before he could hack it toward Chen Xiaolian, a flash erupted before his eyes and he found that Chen Xiaolian had managed to grab his arm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He turned but found that, due to the angle, the energy blaster in his right arm could not be pointed at Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As he was adjusting the jetpack to pull him upward, Chen Xiaolian was already upon him. Chen Xiaolian moved to grab the thin man’s right arm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian’s left hand held on to the jetpack while his right hand held onto the energy blaster on the thin man’s right arm. Next, with a forceful tug, he ripped the energy blaster off the thin man’s arm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The thin man howled in rage and brandished his long blade in an attempt to hack Chen Xiaolian. Unfortunately, the limitations of his backhand attack and the length of the long blade stopped his attack from reaching Chen Xiaolian, who was behind him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Due to Chen Xiaolian’s move of jumping onto the thin man, the jetpack suddenly sputtered. It was incapable of handling the load of two men combined. Following the sputtering sounds, it circled around as it plummeted down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing how the distance between them and the ground was quickly closing up, the thin man was unable to stop himself from screaming out miserably.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian, on the other hand, sneered. His right hand tugged forcefully and the straps of the jetpack was snapped as a result. After taking the jetpack away from the thin man, he observed their descent. The instant they were about to hit the ground, Chen Xiaolian kicked the thin man’s back and vaulted into the air.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The thin man’s body was already falling down to begin with. With the added momentum from Chen Xiaolian’s kick, he became like an artillery blast slamming down the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Using his right hand, Chen Xiaolian quickly fiddled with the jetpack. He was able to quickly figure out how to control it somewhat and he slowly reduced the propulsion force to land beside the thin man.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Large cracks the shape of spiderwebs had appeared on the surface of the asphalt road. The thin man lay unconscious in the middle of the cracks, both eyes shut.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His long blade had fallen to the side, two to three metres away from his spot.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Looking at the thin man, Chen Xiaolian smiled. He turned and headed for the long blade.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The moment Chen Xiaolian turned around, the thin man’s eyes flew open. He quickly straightened his upper body as his right hand moved into his chest at lightning-like speed to pull out a handgun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, Chen Xiaolian was faster.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The instant he aimed the handgun at Chen Xiaolian, who was right before him, he saw a flash. Suddenly, he felt a cold sensation pressing on the surface of his neck.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian was crouched down behind him, the long blade in his hand positioned upon the thin man’s neck.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In just an instant, he had managed to pick up the long blade and made his way behind the thin man.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Cold sweat broke out from the corners of the thin man’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>This man… … so fast!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Next up, I will be asking the questions and you will answer,” said Chen Xiaolian with an incomparably cold tone. “If you answer slowly, you die. If you give vague answers, you die. If your answers cannot satisfy me, you die. Understand?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Understand.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The thin man was direct with his answer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Where is this place?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The World’s End.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I am not satisfied with this answer. Be more detailed.” The long blade in Chen Xiaolian’s hand lightly stroked the thin man’s neck, cutting into a layer of flesh, instantly causing blood to flow.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The World’s End… … is the World’s End! What else do you want me to say?” The thin man’s body grew tense. With a pale face, he brusquely said in a hushed tone, “After dying, every Irregularity will enter this place! After they are cleared, instance dungeons will enter this place! It is that simple!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian looked around. The questions in his heart had finally been resolved.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Since the moment he woke up, he was unable to figure out what this place was.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Why would there be cities, high-rises, and signs of battle here?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This Manhattan Island, where he and the thin man was at, was just an instance dungeon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>An instance dungeon that had been cleared and discarded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian had asked himself before: <em>What exactly is an instance dungeon?</em></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>First, ignore instance dungeons like the Mausoleum of Qin Shihuang instance dungeon and the William the Conqueror instance dungeon. Rather, look at the Tokyo instance dungeon. It uses a city from the present world as a foundation. After it is cleared, how could it be refreshed back to its original shape as though nothing had happened?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>A person killed within an instance dungeon will be resurrected without any memories of what happened within the instance dungeon. A building that was destroyed in an instance dungeon will re-appear, unblemished, after the instance dungeon is over.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>If so, would the process of the person getting ‘killed’ and the building getting ‘destroyed’ simply end like that?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At that moment, Chen Xiaolian finally found the answer to his question.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Those people who were killed, those destroyed cities, all of them had truly existed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The moment the system opened up an instance dungeon, it also replicated out the entire area.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Truth was, two instance dungeon areas would exist when an instance dungeon was in progress. A copy of the buildings and ordinary humans inside it would be created.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After the instance dungeon ended, the original area used for the instance dungeon would be brought back, overwriting the destroyed instance dungeon area.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was similar to a file inside a computer. After a file had been backed up, whatever modifications placed on the file no longer mattered. In the end, the modified file will be replaced by the backup file.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As for the destroyed instance dungeon areas, they did not simply disappear into thin air. Instead, they were sent to the Recycle Bin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Or, as this thin man called it, the World’s End.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Why do you want to kill me? And those people in the jeep that you were trying to kill, who are they?” Chen Xiaolian continued asking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Because the Recycle Bin… … is not refreshing…” The thin man gritted his teeth and was halfway through his answer when a series of violent tremors suddenly rocked the ground beneath them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The entire area quaked furiously, it was as though Heaven and Earth was collapsing. The high-rise building on their right was nearly 100-storeys tall and had been filled with cracks and holes; under the intense quakes, the centre part of the building suddenly fractured. As a result, large chunks of concrete and debris fell down, almost similar to a rainfall of stones.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At that moment, the thin man was seated on the ground while Chen Xiaolin was crouched down behind the thin man with a long blade in his hand, which he positioned before the thin man’s neck.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The sudden quake sent both their bodies tilting to the side.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Damn it! The monsters in this instance dungeon were not fully cleared!”</span></p>
