 <p><strong><u>GOR Chapter 179: I Want To Know</u></strong></p>
 <p>“It’s you?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian walked into the room and proceeded to walk by the long and gorgeous dining table.</p>
 <p>The figure seated at the end of the table had a slender and elegant body with long black hair tied into a bun in the style of a noble lady. Unexpectedly, a gold coloured pearl hairpin, which exuded an Eastern atmosphere, was inserted into her hair.</p>
 <p>She was dressed in a beautiful red coloured evening dress, strapless style, which exposed her bare white shoulders, and had a very low chest neckline. The resulting gully was one full of temptation and charm.</p>
 <p>Red lipstick had been applied upon her lips and her hand held onto a glass of red wine while she twirled it gently. Her other hand was holding onto a dining knife. The blade of the knife was resting on the surface of the table while her fingers lightly stroked the handle of the knife.</p>
 <p>Those tempting and entrancing eyes appeared to be staring at Chen Xiaolian. At the same time, they appeared to be shrouded within a faint layer of mist.</p>
 <p>Just by taking a glance at her was enough for Chen Xiaolian to make a deduction. Although they looked the same, this woman who was seated before him at this moment was certainly not the old-fashioned and sharp Countess that he had met yesterday!</p>
 <p>Instead, she was…</p>
 <p>Miao Yan!</p>
 <p>“You do not appear surprised at all.”</p>
 <p>Miao Yan pursed her lips to the side before sipping a particular mouthful of the red wine. “How boring. I thought that this would end up scaring you.”</p>
 <p>“In that case, let’s do this once again. Should I go out the door and re-enter? Then, pretend to be shocked?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian then smiled and walked over. Reaching a spot that was not too distant from Miao Yan; he pulled out a chair and sat himself down. Looking at the glasses and the decanter filled with red wine placed on the table, he helped himself by pouring a glass for himself. “This seems to be good.”</p>
 <p>“An ‘85 Latour. It is definitely worth tasting,” Miao Yan smiled softly.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian considered before replying. “For red wine, I have only heard about Lafite.”</p>
 <p>Miao Yan appeared to be smiling. She directed a peculiar gaze at Chen Xiaolian and said. “Using the words that you people from this world use… you really are a country bumpkin.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s eyebrows were raised and he gulped down the entire glass of red wine. After placing down the glass, he looked at Miao Yan silently, not uttering a single word.</p>
 <p>“I believe you must have figured out my true identity,” Miao Yan sighed.</p>
 <p>“Honestly, it was truly quite surprising,” Chen Xiaolian furrowed his eyebrows and rubbed his nose. “However, back when we were in the Mausoleum of Qin Shihuang instance dungeon, I did have my suspicions as well.”</p>
 <p>“Oh?”</p>
 <p>“En, considering your age, you are too ignorant toward the history of the Mausoleum of Qin Shihuang,” Chen Xiaolian smiled. “If you were a foreigner, then it would not be surprising. However, your appearance… you are clearly a Chinese.”</p>
 <p>“I did not expect such a coincidence to happen. To think that you would end up finding me in London,” Miao Yan shrugged her shoulders and drank another small mouthful of red wine. Both her cheeks turned red and she licked her rosy lips. Then, she turned back to Chen Xiaolian. “You know. I really like this identity.”</p>
 <p>“You mean, this Exclusive Account?”</p>
 <p>“… … …” Miao Yan sighed. “That title is just a term given to it. No matter what, I do quite like this identity. A Countess, born into nobility with an astounding amount of wealth and beauty, and able to enjoy all forms of enjoyment that this world has to provide. What reason is there not to?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian silently regarded Miao Yan. He hesitated for a moment before speaking up. “I have always been very curious… your world, just what does it look like?”</p>
 <p>“Oh?”</p>
 <p>“What I mean is… from your point of view, be it me or the Countess or this world, all of it are things that your world created… a game, a virtual world. As for you, you possess a High-class Player’s Exclusive Account. I guess that you must be a big spender in this game, a VIP user. The you in your world must be a very wealthy person, right?”</p>
 <p>“Ha ha ha ha…” Miao Yan laughed. Her smiling eyes were squinted as she looked at Chen Xiaolian. “Interesting, please continue.”</p>
 <p>“If that is the case, then the you in your world must be one with quite the status, then… all this…” He gestured toward the red wine before him, the exquisite dishes, the gorgeous dining table and the opulent room. “All of this should count for nothing.”</p>
 <p>“You want to know how our world looks like? Are you sure you want to know? Are you absolutely sure?” Miao Yan suddenly directed a stare at Chen Xiaolian. There was a very peculiar expression upon her face.</p>
 <p>The atmosphere immediately became tense!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian stared at Miao Yan, at her rosy lips and then into her eyes. He took a deep breath and said. “… I want to know!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Da Gang casually placed his hands into his pockets as he strolled through the streets of London. Standing by the north side of Russell Square, he observed the cathedral that stood before him. It was brimming with an atmosphere of ancientness.</p>
 <p>At present, Da Gang was sporting brown coloured hair and he wore a wool suit. Two little moustache grew out above his mouth. His one hand held onto a bottle of wine while the other held onto a cigarette.</p>
 <p>Not far away from Da Gang, a black coloured MPV came to a halt. A tall Frenchman with a standard bulbous nose emerged from the MPV.</p>
 <p>“Jean, get those cars as soon as possible. We will meet up again during the day.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, Lei Hu,” Jean eased a set of earphone onto his ears and he walked toward the side of the street.</p>
 <p>After the MPV moved away, Jean walked around and his eyes swept through the area. Spotting Da Gang who was not far away, he ignored him after a glance. He could smell the scent of alcohol on Da Gang from far away and he moved further away.</p>
 <p>His objective was a car parked not far away. It was a durable looking Land Rover.</p>
 <p>Jean walked forward slowly with a relaxed expression on his face.</p>
 <p>After reaching the side of the car, he walked in a circle around the car before stopping before the driver’s seat.</p>
 <p>“I hate cars from UK, driver on the right,” Jean grumbled. Tinkering with the door of the car for a moment, he then pulled open the door.</p>
 <p>As he was about to enter the car, he abruptly turned around, his expression turning tense!</p>
 <p>Da Gang was standing right before him!</p>
 <p>Looking at the inebriated looking drunkard before him – he appeared no different from those alcoholics strolling through London in the night. Jean frowned and raised his bulbous nose. “Is there a problem?”</p>
 <p>“Mr, may I borrow a lighter?”</p>
 <p>Da Gang pretended to get close as he raised up the cigarette butt in his hand.</p>
 <p>With an annoyed look on his face, Jean replied. “Don’t you already have one?”</p>
 <p>Da Gang smiled as he slowly took another two steps forward. Suddenly, he bent his waist forward!</p>
 <p>Jean’s eyes flickered and he quickly retreated. However, Da Gang’s next move was to slap one hand onto the surface of the car, bend his waist down while facing the wheel of the car and puked out mouthful after mouthful of vomit.</p>
 <p>“Damned bastard!” Jean furiously swore out. Observing the vomit, which reeked to the high Heavens, he decided to step back. However, he suddenly felt something cold on his neck!</p>
 <p>At an unknown moment, a fine metal blade had emerged from the car’s side mirror. It pierced through Jean’s neck!</p>
 <p>The sharp metal blade pierced right through Jean’s neck and he fearfully stared at Da Gang with widened eyes.</p>
 <p>By then, Da Gang had already straightened himself as he wiped his mouth – one of his hand remained in contact with the surface of the car.</p>
 <p>Metallic ripples were seemingly spreading through the surface of the car! At the end of the ripples was the metal blade.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, don’t worry, there is no need to be afraid,” Da Gang stepped forward and clung onto Jean with one hand and he whispered to Jean. “I won’t kill you – not now anyways. All I want is to find an interesting little pet for myself before the instance dungeon begins. Unfortunately for you, you happen to be the first person I laid my eyes upon after I had that idea.”</p>
 <p>Jean’s eyes bulged open and he attempted to shout out. However, his throat had been pierced through, leading to him being unable to utter anything loud.</p>
 <p>His eyes quickly turned red and his entire body began to swell. His muscles bulged and black coloured hair could be seen growing out at a rapid pace from his exposed neck area.</p>
 <p>“Oh, are you thinking about using your skill?” Da Gang smiled softly. “No no no, you need to quiet down.”</p>
 <p>The metal blade suddenly twisted and transformed into a flowing liquid metal. It then drilled its way into the neck…</p>
 <p>After that… Jean’s bulging muscles and growing hair shrunk back down…</p>
 <p>“Go to sleep, go to sleep, my little baby~”</p>
 <p>Da Gang sang softly and his fingers softly caressed Jean’s bulbous nose – this action of his was not only terrifying, it also appear perverted…</p>
 <p>Next, Da Gang grabbed Jean and tossed him into the car before getting onto the car as well.</p>
 <p>“Not a bad car, you have good taste,” Da Gang stroked the steering wheel and smiled. He then started up the car, causing the car engine to roar out before slowly driving the car away.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“… … …I want to know!”</p>
 <p>“… … …” Miao Yan looked at Chen Xiaolian for a full 5 seconds. Then, she covered her mouth and let out a burst of laughter. Her laughter was filled with so much glee that it almost appeared as though the one sitting before her was not Chen Xiaolian, but Mr. Bean.</p>
 <p>“Is it funny?” Chen Xiaolian had an annoyed look on his face.</p>
 <p>“Of course it is funny!” Miao Yan used her fingers to wipe the corners of her eyes. “This is the most amusing joke that I’ve heard of late.”</p>
 <p>The woman abruptly withdrew the smile on her face and directed a solemn gaze at Chen Xiaolian. “It’s useless. Even if I do tell you, you will end up forgetting everything I tell you.”</p>
 <p>“What if I still insist on wanting to know?” Chen Xiaolian narrowed his eyes. “Even though I know my memories will be erased, I want to know!”</p>
 <p>“Very well, in that case…” Miao Yan looked at Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>A few seconds later…</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian frowned. “Why aren’t you saying anything?”</p>
 <p>Miao Yan cast a peculiar look at Chen Xiaolian and answered. “… … if I were to tell you that I had already told you about it just now, and that you have already forgotten it all now… would you believe me?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was stunned.</p>
 <p>After saying that, Miao Yan smiled.</p>
 <p>“Are you messing with me?” Chen Xiaolian knitted his eyebrows.</p>
 <p>Miao Yan gave a light sigh. “No matter what I say, you will not believe me. Besides… you will never find out if I did say anything to you just now… because, even if you did hear what I said, the system will either block it or erase your memories!”</p>
 <p>She then extended her hand out to point toward the ceiling. “The rules! The rules of the system are immutable!”</p>
 <p>A look of fear appeared on Chen Xiaolian’s face.</p>
 <p>He quietly took a deep breath and poured himself another glass of wine, which he then gulped down.</p>
 <p>“About tonight, are you the one who asked for me, or… your Exclusive Account?”</p>
 <p>…</p>
