 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 354 System Quest?</strong></p>
 <p>“Damn it!” Chen Xiaolian swore as he quickly backed up while firing at the Sentinel mech.</p>
 <p>However, his rifle was merely a light firearm and sparks on the surface of the mech were the only effects created by the bullets he sent out.</p>
 <p>In just one breath, Chen Xiaolian emptied his clip on the mech. Even as he did so, he was hastily retreating out of the iron gate.</p>
 <p>Next, he tossed the rifle away and pulled out the RPG!</p>
 <p>Using the wall for cover, he quickly put in a warhead into the RPG. This was his last warhead!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian gasped for breath and heard the rapid approach of the mech through the wall!</p>
 <p>Despite its size, the three-metre Sentinel mech was hardly slow.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian took a deep breath and promptly dashed out. Putting his one knee on the ground, he got into position and aimed the RPG at the mech…</p>
 <p>Xiu!</p>
 <p>The final warhead shot out!</p>
 <p>The warhead struck the mech right on its front steel plate and the intense explosion enveloped the Sentinel mech’s body in flames, forcing it to stagger back a little…</p>
 <p>However, the mech immediately moved forward once more!</p>
 <p>The sound of engine turbines could be heard coming from the back side of the mech and it suddenly leapt up to quickly soar forward!</p>
 <p><em>Son of a bitch!</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian swore again!</p>
 <p><em>It really is a product from Zero City! That is not something that a normal RPG can deal with!</em></p>
 <p>Looking at the incoming mech, Chen Xiaolian felt hatred and rage swelling up within him. He found himself unable to care for anything else; he gestured with his palm and summoned the Sword in the Stone into his hand!</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The mech arrived before Chen Xiaolian! Its mechanical arm was raised and a one-metre metal blade slid out from a groove upon its wrist. Then, it viciously slashed down!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian raised the Sword in the Stone to block the attack. The resulting impact and sound caused his body to start!</p>
 <p>Even his enhanced body was unable to take on the mechanical might of the mech! The floor beneath Chen Xiaolian released cracking sounds.</p>
 <p>Even the Sword in the Stone that he was holding was affected by the recoil!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian staggered back and saw the Sentinel mech raising its left arm. There on its arm, a muzzle emerged.</p>
 <p>Seeing the flat-shaped muzzle, Chen Xiaolian felt his soul escaping his body!</p>
 <p>He recognized this weapon!</p>
 <p>That was an energy-tier weapon!</p>
 <p>As Chen Xiaolian was cursing his own bad luck, the mech suddenly lowered its left arm. Then, it raised its right arm, the one with the metal blade, and rushed forward once more.</p>
 <p><em>He… he’s not going to use the energy-tier weapon and go for a melee instead?</em></p>
 <p>Without waiting for Chen Xiaolian to respond, it sent forth a vertical slash. This strike sent both Chen Xiaolian and his sword flying!</p>
 <p>“Damn it!” The impact forced Chen Xiaolian to roll on the floor before getting up once more, blood trickling down his mouth.</p>
 <p>He coughed out a little and small amounts of blood accompanied each cough. Chen Xiaolian found that he was having a hard time breathing.</p>
 <p>The three-metre Sentinel mech engaged its turbines and charged forward once more! The momentum from the thrust and the power of the mech was not something that Chen Xiaolian could deal with.</p>
 <p>This thing… where did he get it?</p>
 <p><em>This is not a God damned instance dungeon! This is the real world!</em></p>
 <p><em>How could there be a mech in the real world?</em></p>
 <p><em>HOW?!</em></p>
 <p>Seeing the mech charging closer, Chen Xiaolian stopped hesitating and shouted, “Bai Qi! Come out!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>As the Sentinel mech was about to descend upon Chen Xiaolian, a white light shone! There was a faint silhouette within the white light. Suddenly, a cold sword beam shot out and the Sentinel mech was sent flying backward!</p>
 <p>Even while it was flying through the air, it was clear that the Sentinel mech’s head and neck area had been ruined!</p>
 <p>Bai Qi’s body moved like a shadow!</p>
 <p>The mech finally fell down, smashing down on one of the walls of the warehouse before falling into the pile of debris. As for Bai Qi, he quickly charged forward with ghost like ferocity!</p>
 <p>Sword up, sword down!</p>
 <p>Bai Qi landed with one foot on the chest part of the mech. His seemingly small body stood before the mech and his sword plunged into the neck area of the mech!</p>
 <p>In that instant, when the blade of the sword pierced through the steel plate of the mech, Bai Qi’s body suddenly shone with a silvery light!</p>
 <p>Piercing sword!</p>
 <p>Sounds of sparks rang out and the blade of the sword was pulled out; a metal head flew up into the air.</p>
 <p>Bai Qi harrumphed and leapt into the air. He then landed between Chen Xiaolian and the mech, standing in a very lofty posture.</p>
 <p>However, on his face, his eyebrows had suddenly creased together.</p>
 <p>“Inorganic object?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was surprised at his actions. Then, he recollected himself and realized that what Bai Qi meant was: Why did he not get any life force after killing off the mech?</p>
 <p>Of course, the mech was not a living being to begin with. It was just a mechanical object.</p>
 <p>The Sentinel mech that had lost its head flailed about as it lay upon the debris by the wall a few times. Sparks scattered out from the cut off neck area and crackling sounds could be heard.</p>
 <p>Its two hands moved to prop itself up and was barely able to get into a seating position. Bai Qi watched, his eyebrows raised. Then, he lifted up the short sword in his hand and aimed it at the mech.</p>
 <p>As the Sentinel mech quaked and staggered, a clump of silvery light condensed itself upon Bai Qi’s blade!</p>
 <p>At that moment, a sound suddenly came from within the mech.</p>
 <p>“Don, don’t kill me… I surrender!”</p>
 <p>Too late!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian attempted to stop Bai Qi, but he had already unleashed his attack!</p>
 <p>This time, the attack that came out was like a thread of white silk. It shot out and struck the mech’s chest with a booming sound – that was the location of the cockpit!</p>
 <p>The chest plate of the Sentinel mech was immediately torn apart and blood burst out from the cockpit!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian could see Zayad through the hole in the mech’s chest.</p>
 <p>Half his shoulder had been blasted off and he lay in the cockpit, blood flowing out from his mouth.</p>
 <p>“Bai Qi, stop!” Chen Xiaolian finally called out just as Bai Qi was getting ready to unleash his second attack. Then, he ran toward the mech.</p>
 <p>Reaching the mech, he forced open the broken cockpit cover and grabbed Zayad’s arm. Next, he mercilessly pulled him out.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian observed that blood was pouring out continuously from Zayad’s mouth and his rate of breathing was decreasing. He harrumphed and promptly retrieved a spicy bar (Beginner class Healing Substance) from the system. Without bothering to explain anything, he shoved it down Zayad’s mouth.</p>
 <p>However, the injuries Zayad was suffering from were too severe! Even though the mech’s steel plates had taken the brunt of the attack, leaving only 10 per cent of the damage to Zayad, a sword attack from a master like Bai Qi had still sent him into a critically hopeless state.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian placed Zayad on the floor and slapped him in the face with force. “Wake up! Wake up! Say something!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian shook Zayad’s neck and said, “Out with it! Where did you get this mech from? How can you have something like this? Hurry up and tell me!”</p>
 <p>Zayad opened his dazed eyes and feebly looked up at Chen Xiaolian. He struggled to move and his lips twitched. Seeing that, Chen Xiaolian quickly held him up.</p>
 <p>“Sa- save me… I… I don’t want to… die…”</p>
 <p>“Answer my question! I will save you!” Chen Xiaolian’s face turned grim.</p>
 <p>Zayad struggled to talk and blood kept flowing out from his mouth. He was not even capable of swallowing the spicy bar that Chen Xiaolian had shoved down his mouth.</p>
 <p>“The- they… they gave… gave me…”</p>
 <p>After saying that, a strange light flashed within Zayad’s eyes and he said, “Save… save me…”</p>
 <p>Those were his final words. After saying that, Zayad tilted his head to the side and died!</p>
 <p><em>They gave him?</em></p>
 <p><em>They… who are they?</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was frozen on the spot.</p>
 <p>From the moment Zayad operated the mech, Chen Xiaolian’s heart had been filled with questions!</p>
 <p>How could a dictator of a poor little country in Africa get such a high-end weapon?</p>
 <p>Even if the mech had appeared within NASA, that would still be shocking! Yet, it had appeared in a tiny ass African country that did not even have the most basic of industries?</p>
 <p>Besides… if he possessed this mech, why be afraid of those rebel soldiers?</p>
 <p>With this mech, he would be able to stampede through the rebel army several hundred times!</p>
 <p>There were simply too many questions swirling within Chen Xiaolian’s mind.</p>
 <p>At that moment, when his mind was in a state of chaos…</p>
 <p>[System prompt…]</p>
 <p><em>Wait a minute! System prompt?</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian subconsciously tapped open his personal system and saw…</p>
 <p>[System prompt: You have completed unknown random quest. Killed quest target, conditions to complete quest met.</p>
 <p>[Quest reward: Contact the quest giver to obtain it.]</p>
 <p>“… … …” Chen Xiaolian was dumbfounded.</p>
 <p><em>This… what kind of shenanigans is this?</em></p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p><em>This is the real world!</em></p>
 <p><em>Not an instance dungeon!</em></p>
 <p>He was presently in the real world, not in an instance dungeon!</p>
 <p>Even though Zayad was the President of a small country, he was at the end of the day, just an ordinary human of the real world!</p>
 <p>So why was it that by killing him, a system prompt would appear?</p>
 <p>Quest completed?</p>
 <p>What the Hell?!</p>
 <p>Wasn’t that something that should only happen inside an instance dungeon?</p>
 <p>When did the system even issue out this quest?</p>
 <p>How could something that should only happen in an instance dungeon appear in the real world?</p>
 <p>These questions popped up one after another within Chen Xiaolian’s head and he stood there in confusion.</p>
 <p>Zayad was dead. No matter how many questions Chen Xiaolian had, he was unable to get any more information from Zayad.</p>
 <p>He clenched his fists tightly!</p>
 <p>Things were gradually getting stranger.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian forced himself to breath and attempted to rearrange his thoughts.</p>
 <p><em>Put these questions facing me aside first… the key point here is…</em></p>
 <p><em>That’s right, the key point!</em></p>
 <p><em>The key point is: This task was given to me by Qiao Yifeng!</em></p>
 <p><em>Qiao Yifeng! Qiao Yifeng is the key!</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian did not hesitate to pick up his mobile phone and attempted to contact Qiao Yifeng.</p>
 <p>A few seconds later, Chen Xiaolian furiously kept his phone.</p>
 <p>The call could not go through! Did that old fellow turn off his phone?</p>
 <p>Bai Qi stood to the side and he coldly looked at Chen Xiaolian who was lashing out like a lunatic.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian gazed around and his gaze fell upon the Sentinel mech. He quickly stepped forward to check it.</p>
 <p>A few minutes later, Chen Xiaolian stood up.</p>
 <p>This mech… there was something odd about it!</p>
 <p>How should he put it…</p>
 <p>It was indeed a mech… shape wise, it was very similar to the ‘II-Model Sentinel mech’ that he had seen in Zero City.</p>
 <p>However, there were some aspects of it that were slightly different.</p>
 <p>Additionally, Chen Xiaolian found something else. This mech, the weapons outfitted on it were clearly…</p>
 <p>Watered down!</p>
 <p>…</p>
