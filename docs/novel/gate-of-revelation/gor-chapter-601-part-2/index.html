 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 601 Part 2 Messing With People’s Hearts </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Another voice suddenly spoke up from the sky. This voice sounded deeper. However, it sounded as though it was struggling to breathe due to excessive laughter.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“This kid is more interesting than I expected. He is also much smarter. After all this time, he is the first to see through your shenanigans. I say, old freak, this game of yours is already exposed. Don’t you feel awkward right now? Even if you feel angry due to embarrassment, there is no need to beat him up to vent your rage. Even if you beat him up, you cannot kill him. Causing him pain will only make others mock you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Shut up! You bastard! Get out of my domain!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Humph, we agreed that we can observe each other’s game. Must I scram just because you want me to?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Hearing the two voices in the sky bickering with one another, Chen Xiaolian felt somewhat shocked. Even so, he remained silent and said nothing. Instead, he retrieved a healing substance and shoved it into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Kid, there is no need to waste healing substances. Those wounds the Avenging Angel gave you are all illusions. When the illusion is over, the wounds will naturally go away. Of course, if you are a plutocrat with too much points to spare and you want to treat healing substances as snacks, that is up to you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian inhaled before speaking up, “You fellows, just who are you people?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Avenging Angel walked until he was standing before Chen Xiaolian. He gave Chen Xiaolian a cold stare.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian turned to stare back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Suddenly, the Avenging Angel lifted his sword up and slashed down with it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian revealed no fear and he simply watched as the sword descended.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Ca!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The blade of the sword stabbed into the wall beside Chen Xiaolian’s ear.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Next, the Avenging Angel turned away and vaulted up before disappearing into the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian, who remained standing there, was dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Kid, congratulations. You have cleared this instance dungeon – also, ever since we took over this instance dungeon, you are the first to clear it.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A voice spoke up from the sky. It was the second voice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Clear?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Correct. We have given this game the name ‘Discern life and death’. Mm, that is how it is. Ever since this game first began until now, you are the first to discern the secret of this place. Congratulations to you. The reward is very big.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian sneered. “Clearing the game? Reward? You fellows really consider yourselves as the system, huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What you actually want to say is: You fellows really consider yourselves as gods, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Something like that.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Enough, I am not the other fellow. My skin is much thicker compared to that fellow. Your stabbing words have no effect on me. Now… … let’s go to the ‘after clearing the game’ process.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After the words were spoken, Chen Xiaolian felt everything flash before him. The world before him disappeared. The airport, the terminal building, the runway… … all of them disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He found himself standing within an empty space. His surroundings, the space above him, all of them were empty. As for him, he sat on a metallic, disc-like object within the void.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Now, the first step. You can make a wish.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Ha ha ha ha!” Chen Xiaolian laughed in a ridiculing manner. “I take back what I said earlier. You fellows weren’t imagining yourselves as gods. You fellows imagine yourselves to be wish-granting genies – can you grant any wish?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Of course not. How could such a wonderful thing exist?” the voice was quick to respond. “This is also part of the test. You will need to guess what we are capable of. As long as it is within our powers, your wish will be ours to fulfil. We will certainly satisfy your wish. However… … if it is beyond our powers, you will have wasted one wish.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Guess what you fellows are capable of?” Chen Xiaolian sneered and said, “I understand. For example, if I ask you to destroy the system, that wish cannot be realized, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If we can do something like that, there will be no need for us to coop ourselves inside this instance dungeon.” The voice sighed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian grew silent.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He solemnly pondered the matter.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Truth be told, there were many issues in need of answers swirling within his mind. For example, the events in Zero City, what he had done within that special room, why did Zero City’s defensive protocols get lifted, etc.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, despite the various thoughts within his mind, there was no doubt which one was the biggest. There was only one!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If, I am saying, if…” Chen Xiaolian asked seriously, “If I want to resurrect a companion who had died and was not refreshed into an ordinary person… … is there any way you fellows can help?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… … …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The voice grew silent for a long time.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In the end, the voice finally sighed. “Not getting refreshed into an ordinary human after death… … so, that companion of yours is an Irregularity.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes. Also, there is no need for you to ask. I can answer you. I am also an Irregularity.” Chen Xiaolian shook his head before continuing, “That way, we can save time on nonsense. Let us continue.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You are quite clever.” The voice did not sound surprised to hear about Irregularities. Instead, it continued slowly, “Just now, if you had just asked us to help you resurrect your companion, we will be unable to do it. Then, you will have wasted this wish. However, what you said was: Is there any way we can help… thus, I will have to be truthful. A way… … there really is one.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Oh?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Don’t get too happy just yet. This method is a theoretical one. No one has succeeded before.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Enough nonsense. Out with it, what is the method?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The tone of the voice then turned serious.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Let us make an analogy. Theoretically speaking, this world is the equivalent of the interior of a computer. The one in control of this world is the main program within the computer. All of us are but existences within a game. Comparison wise, you, me, everyone within this game is a file within the game. Everyone of us is a file.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“For Awakened ones, after dying, their file type will be changed from ‘Awakened’ to ‘Ordinary human’. It is the equivalent of changing the extension of the file.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“However, Irregularities are different. Once an Irregularity dies, his or her file will be deleted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Now, a question. When you use a computer, after you delete a file, where will the file be sent to?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian considered the question and replied, “Recycle Bin? The dumpster?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Reality wise, that is not what happens. However… … comparatively speaking, it should be more or less the similar.” The voice continued slowly, “Thus, there should be a place similar to a ‘Data Recycling Centre’ within this system.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Wait, ‘should’?” asked Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Nonsense, of course this is just a theoretical guess. I have never died and gone to that place before.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Continue, then,” said Chen Xiaolian with a frown.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“So… think about it. Under normal circumstances, as a file within this game, what do you need to do in order to get to the Recycle Bin? It is not within any folder! It is not even within the computer’s drives. Do you understand? There has never been a case where a file can just jump into another folder. Unless… …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Unless I die!” said Chen Xiaolian gravely.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
