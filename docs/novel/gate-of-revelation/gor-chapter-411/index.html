 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 411 Kill, Kill!</strong></p>
 <p>Within the waiting passageway for the participants from the Knights of Darkness Guild.</p>
 <p>Jacob watched the large screen, looking at how the large Bone Devil was shattered apart with but one slash. Even Spiritshadow’s skeletons were turned to ashes.</p>
 <p>The passageway became deathly silent.</p>
 <p>Jacob’s face immediately became extremely ugly to behold.</p>
 <p>Beside him was Theodore, who had two blades hanging down from his waist. “A powerful blade slash!”</p>
 <p>Jacob gave Theodore a glance. “Did you come all the way here just to provoke me before my fight begins?”</p>
 <p>Theodore cast a conflicted look at Jacob before saying in a hushed tone, “Stinky lizard, listen to my advice and give up this match.”</p>
 <p>“Humph.”</p>
 <p>“I’m not here to bicker with you.” Theodore shook his head. “I am also a sword user. But, I am unable to unleash such a skill.”</p>
 <p>“And? Because you cannot unleash such a kind of attack, I will lose to him?” Jacob clenched his teeth so heavily that sounds could be heard coming from them.</p>
 <p>“At the very least, if I was the one facing Spiritshadow, I would not have the ability to turn him to ashes with my sword attacks,” said Theodore with a frown. “Although I detest you, I still don’t wish to see you die under someone else’s hand. So, give it up.”</p>
 <p>Jacob was silent. He turned to watch the screen and saw that Chen Xiaolian had already turned to face the controlling arbiter, Angel Wu and ask, “Isn’t it time to announce my victory?”</p>
 <p>Jacob then shook his head and said, “Our Guild Leader has not given me the command to surrender. So, I will continue to fight.”</p>
 <p>He then turned to face Theodore. “Oswald will be fighting after me. We are both [A+] class experts! Would the dignified [A+] class experts from the Knights of Darkness Guild be scared to the point of surrendering after watching a fight? Are you joking with me? I can’t afford to lose this much face! Our guild most certainly can’t!</p>
 <p>“Even if this brat is powerful, could he be an [S] class expert?</p>
 <p>“What a joke? An [S] class expert popping out of nowhere? What are the chances of that?</p>
 <p>“I believe he is only [A+] class at best. Although he did managed to defeat that disgusting Spiritshadow, it is possible that he possess a skill that is highly effective against Spiritshadow.</p>
 <p>“No matter what, we, the [A+] class experts of the Knights of Darkness Guild do not have a tradition of casually surrendering.</p>
 <p>“I will go and fight with him… … even if I am no match for him, I will still exhaust a good portion of his powers. Then, I’ll let Oswald finish him off.”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>The competition arena…</p>
 <p>Angel Wu had straightened himself. Although there was complexity in this Angel Corps veteran’s gaze toward Chen Xiaolian, he still announced loudly.</p>
 <p>“The first battle of the first Blood Verdict. The winner, Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild!”</p>
 <p>The uproar coming from the grandstands increased in magnitude.</p>
 <p>Cheers and whoops could be heard coming from Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild’s grandstands.</p>
 <p>Qiao Qiao had already straightened her body and she gripped Soo Soo’s hand tightly. “Did our eyes play tricks on us? Did our ears misheard? Xiaolian, he, he…”</p>
 <p>Soo Soo’s face was flushed red as she shouted loudly, “There’s nothing wrong, sister! Xiaolian oppa won! He had really won!”</p>
 <p>“This, is this… … a dream? Or a miracle? When did he become so strong?”</p>
 <p>Qiao Yifeng who was beside them had a very puzzled look on his face.</p>
 <p>He stared intently at Chen Xiaolian who was standing in the arena, not relaxing his gaze in the slightest. It was as though Chen Xiaolian would disappear from his sight the next instant.</p>
 <p><em>This kid… … how did he become so powerful?</em></p>
 <p><em>And, the blade in his hand!</em></p>
 <p><em>Where did it come from?</em></p>
 <p><em>Just now… … that attack… is clearly Skyblade’s!</em></p>
 <p>At that moment, the members seated around Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild’s grandstand area had begun clamouring.</p>
 <p>Qiao Yifeng turned his head to see Bluesea being escorted by several Sentinel mechs over. He then moved into the grandstand.</p>
 <p>“Bluesea!” Qiao Yifeng quickly stood up and went to greet him. “Just what is going on?”</p>
 <p>A flash of light flickered out of Bluesea’s eyes and he shook his head. “Wait first. We’ll talk about it once it’s over!”</p>
 <p>“Don’t do this to me!” Qiao Yifeng grew anxious and he said impatiently, “Just what is going on? How did that kid end up substituting you in the list of combatants? And, his blade…”</p>
 <p>Bluesea suddenly turned around and there was an extremely serious look on his face. “Brother Qiao! We’ll talk about it after it’s over! Now is not the time to be talking!”</p>
 <p>Seeing the fire in Bluesea’s eyes, Qiao Yifeng who was an old comrade of Bluesea knew that Bluesea was being incomparably serious! Once he got into such a state, no one could get him to change his mind!</p>
 <p>“… fine.”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Angel Wu stood there in the controlling arbiter’s position.</p>
 <p>This Angel Corps veteran cast a highly complicated gaze at Chen Xiaolian who was standing in the arena.</p>
 <p>In the end, he nodded and announced in a deep voice, “The result for the first match of the first Blood Verdict has been determined! Combatant from Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild, do you need any time to rest?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian who was standing in the arena appeared slightly pale to the surrounding spectators. But he raised the blade in his hand and said.</p>
 <p>“Continue.”</p>
 <p>Angel Wu took a deep breath. “Very well! Let’s continue! For the second match, the accepting side is the Knights of Darkness Guild’s Jacob!”</p>
 <p>The tumultuous grandstands immediately turned quiet.</p>
 <p>Jacob who was inside the passageway roughly kneaded his face a bit.</p>
 <p>He had received his Guild Leader’s command through the guild channel!</p>
 <p>“If you can win, then go for the win! If you cannot, then do your best to exhaust his combat strength to increase the odds of winning the third match!”</p>
 <p>Jacob took a deep breath. Seeing the rolling gate move up, he strode out!</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Nicole was within one of the grandstands. Her narrowed eyes did not leave Chen Xiaolian, especially not that blade!</p>
 <p>“This kid is giving me quite the surprise… …”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>When Chen Xiaolian saw Jacob slowly making his way out of the rolling gate, he instantly recognized his opponent.</p>
 <p>He had seen this fellow before back in the C11 mine.</p>
 <p>Jacob was wearing a leather vest. On his shoulder was a… miniature looking… …</p>
 <p>Dragon!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s attention was immediately locked upon that thing on Jacob’s shoulder.</p>
 <p>The moment Jacob stepped into the arena, an explosive wave of applause erupted from the Knights of Darkness Guild’s grandstand area. No small number of them cheered Jacob on.</p>
 <p>Jacob did not let his attention wander off for a single instant. Both his eyes were intently staring at Chen Xiaolian!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian looked at this fellow who had walked forward. He knitted his eyebrows and said, “You are my opponent for the second match?”</p>
 <p>Jacob ignored his question. He slowly picked up the dragon resting on his shoulder and placed it on his palm. He looked at the dragon and said coolly, “What is it?”</p>
 <p>The dragon raised its head. “Jacob, why are there so many people watching us?”</p>
 <p>“… … … because we are participating in a decisive battle.”</p>
 <p>“Decisive battle? Isn’t that something that we can’t afford to lose?”</p>
 <p>“Not really. But that would be really shameful.”</p>
 <p>Red flames sprayed out from the dragon and it opened its mouth. “No, no! We are the prideful dragon race! How can the dignified dragon race be shamed? Jacob, who is our opponent?”</p>
 <p>Jacob pointed at Chen Xiaolian. “That's him.”</p>
 <p>The dragon turned its head over and its pair of vertical-slit pupils gazed at Chen Xiaolian. “Is that him? He looks like a small fry.”</p>
 <p>“He should be quite powerful,” said Jacob coolly.</p>
 <p>The dragon thought about it for a moment before revealing a peculiar smile. “If that is the case… kill him! Kill! Kill!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
