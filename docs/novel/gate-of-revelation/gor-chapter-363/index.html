 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 363 No One Is God</strong></p>
 <p>The camp was suddenly in an uproar.</p>
 <p>A group of people scattered and ran. Soon, the sounds of gunfire could be heard.</p>
 <p>As the bursts of gunfire rang out, Chen Xiaolian pulled Lin Leyan to his back and shoved the golden Desert Eagle into her hand. He said, “Take it! If anything dangerous happens, open fire! Don’t hesitate!”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Chen Xiaolian ran toward the source of the chaos.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>There were indeed crocodiles. However, by the time Chen Xiaolian made his way there, the crocodiles had been shot to death.</p>
 <p>His eyes regarded the crocodiles that were around two metres in length. If not for the blood flowing out from beneath them, the crocodiles that were lying on the ground would have been mistaken for two old tree trunks.</p>
 <p>There were bullet holes all over the surface of the crocodiles’ body. Several mercenaries stood beside it and there was a very furious look on Randall’s face as he reprimanded one of the peace organization members.</p>
 <p>“Are you out of your mind? Why are you shooting like crazy? Don’t you know that we have yet to make it out of danger? The sound of gunfire can travel far away. If the rebel army hears it and comes looking, we’ll all be goners!”</p>
 <p>There was a gloomy expression on the peace organization member’s face and he said, “But, in order to save the….”</p>
 <p>Randall continued to reprimand him.</p>
 <p>Although the crocodiles had died, they killed three unfortunate fellows before croaking.</p>
 <p>A few minutes later, they were able to get a clear picture of what happened.</p>
 <p>Some fellow who was smoking was attacked by a crocodile… none of them knew where the crocodiles had come from. They could only speculate that it had come out from the waters.</p>
 <p>They must have crawled up the riverbank under the cover of the night.</p>
 <p>The smoking man was instantly bitten by one of the crocodiles and the immense power behind its bite instantly crushed one of the fellow’s thighs.</p>
 <p>The smoking man’s scream woke up the other two men who were sleeping beside him. Those two men just had enough time to get up when the other crocodile attacked one of them. The second man that was bitten struggled. However, his struggles caused the third man to fall down the ground. The crocodile had flailed the second man as it bit him to death and the second man’s leg…</p>
 <p>The third man was lying on the ground. His luck was pretty bad; his companion, the second man had accidentally kicked him in the chest when the crocodile flailed him around and the combined momentum was so powerful it caused him to spray out blood on the spot.</p>
 <p>Out of the two men who were bitten by the crocodiles, one had instantly died. As for the other one, his injuries appeared too severe. Blood continued to flow out of his wounds. Even if he was somehow sent into a hospital, there was likely not much hope for him. At that moment, everyone there knew that he was already a dead man.</p>
 <p>The fellow who was kicked sprawled on the ground and it was unknown just how much damage he had sustained. However, the force behind that kick was such that he had most likely sustained internal injuries; he might even be bleeding internally… especially since his ribs had been broken. Those broken ribs had likely pierced into his lungs…</p>
 <p>Hans quickly ran over. As someone who had served as an army doctor before, he did a quick check of the man’s injuries. Then, he stood up and shook his head.</p>
 <p>His situation was beyond hope.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian stood beside, not saying anything or interfering… although he possessed healing substances… considering how severe the man’s injuries were, low-grade healing substances would be insufficient. It was likely that high-grade healing substances would be needed for that man. Even then, it might still be insufficient.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian did not feel like using a high-grade healing substance to save these refugees… back in the day, what he saw from them made him apathetic to their plight. Besides, high-grade healing substances were things that must be purchased from the system with points, something that could only be earned by risking his life. Chen Xiaolian had no intentions of becoming a saint.</p>
 <p>Randall pulled out a dagger and was about to move forward when Hans stopped him. Hans asked, “What are you planning to do?”</p>
 <p>“Relieve those two of their pain,” Randall replied coldly. “There is no hope for them. Or could it be you want them to continue crying in pain like this? These wretched cries… what would the people in this camp think if it continues?”</p>
 <p>Hans’ face turned pale and he wanted to say something in reply. However, Chen Xiaolian had walked over. Without giving any explanation, Chen Xiaolian pulled Hans away.</p>
 <p>Hans was unable to fight against Chen Xiaolian’s strength and was forcefully pulled far away. When Chen Xiaolian let go, Hans furiously said, “What are you doing?”</p>
 <p>“Although that fellow is annoying, his words are logical,” said Chen Xiaolian coolly. “Those two men are already goners. Should we let them continue to endure the pain and let them cry out like that until death comes for them? That is inhumane.”</p>
 <p>“So we should kill them?” Hans furiously questioned.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian answered with a question, “Do you have a better way?”</p>
 <p>Hans was left speechless. It was at that moment that the miserable screams coming from far away came to a stop. Clearly, Randall’s actions were quick!</p>
 <p>Hans’ eyes were bloodshot and he said, “We came to Africa to save people… is there, is there really no way to save everyone? Is there really no way?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian looked at the German fellow and gave a light sigh. “You are not God… no one is God.”</p>
 <p>In order to avoid such a thing from happening once again, Hans sent some people to carefully check the nearby areas. The sandy riverbank, the waters, they checked it to ensure that there were no more crocodiles around.</p>
 <p>After that, Randall and his men got busy.</p>
 <p>The two big crocodiles became their target.</p>
 <p>Randall’s men pulled out their military blades and began dismembering the crocodiles.</p>
 <p>Soon, the other more courageous refugees joined in. Their eyes were practically glowing with hunger.</p>
 <p>Although the crocodile meat was tough and lean, it was still meat.</p>
 <p>Randall did not stop the others. At any rate, there were two crocodiles, enough for him and his men to enjoy their fill.</p>
 <p>The number of refugees joining in on the action increased but Chen Xiaolian and Lin Leyan simply stood far away, watching silently by the side.</p>
 <p>Many of them began raising up large pots. They boiled water from the river, put the cut pieces of crocodile meat into the pot, and cooked it.</p>
 <p>The African minister and financial backer in Chen Xiaolian’s team were clearly moved. Chen Xiaolian glanced at them and said coldly, “If you fellows want it, then go get it yourselves. No need to ask for my permission.”</p>
 <p>The African minister instantly laughed loudly. Both him and the financial backer ran forward and began negotiating with the crowd there. The African financial backer pulled out a gold ring from his finger to use for the exchange and they joined in on the action to split the meat.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian noted that the three corpses on the riverbank had been ignored by those refugees. Everyone was busy trying to get the meat.</p>
 <p>No one came to help move the corpses away.</p>
 <p>Only Hans and several other volunteers stepped forward with shovels in hand. They dug a hole and prepared to bury the corpses. There were also two women who were crying beside; they were likely the family members of the deceased. One of the women also held onto a small African child who was only five or six years old.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian and Lin Leyan sat far away and watched the refugees mill about splitting the meat. There was a slight hint of unconcealed disgust in his eyes.</p>
 <p>He suddenly glanced around him and noticed that Lin Leyan was not the only one there. The Caucasian woman was also sitting beside; she had not gone to take part in the splitting of the crocodile meat. Chen Xiaolian was somewhat shocked and he said, “Why didn’t you go?”</p>
 <p>The Caucasian woman shook her head and answered, “I don’t know.”</p>
 <p>Pausing a bit, she then said gingerly, “I think that your decision is probably the right one. You did not go take the crocodile meat. So, I think it is best if I don’t go for it.”</p>
 <p>This young woman was quite clever.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian revealed a faint smile but elected not to say anything.</p>
 <p>After a while, two mercenaries with guns approached Chen Xiaolian. One of them held onto a bloody piece of crocodile meat that was wrapped with leaves. That man walked until he was standing before Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>“Let’s make a deal,” said the mercenary who looked down at Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian raised his eyes to look at him.</p>
 <p>The mercenary pointed at the golden Desert Eagle in Lin Leyan’s hand and said, “That gun is quite good, sell it to me. I can give you American dollars! And also this piece of crocodile meat as extra! It weighs at least seven to eight jins (1 kg = 2 jins), enough to last all the way to Congo.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian faintly answered, “I am not lacking in American dollars.”</p>
 <p>Then, he turned to look at the crocodile meat in the mercenary’s hand. “I also don’t like crocodile meat.”</p>
 <p>There was a vexed look on the mercenaries’ faces. However, when they looked around, they noticed that Hans and his team members were coldly looking in their direction. The two mercenaries exchanged glances and one of them harrumphed coldly. “All right! However, if you encounter any danger along the way, don’t expect us to protect you! Brat!”</p>
 <p>Then, they left.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian sighed and turned to look at Lin Leyan. He smiled and said, “What is so good about that crocodile meat… eating the meat of wild African crocodiles, their stomachs will end up with parasites, idiots.”</p>
 <p>When morning came and their fleet was about to embark again, something happened.</p>
 <p>The three men who died last night belonged to a small team. They were the only three young and able-bodied men on that team.</p>
 <p>Now that they had died, the only ones left in their team were two women and one child.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian heard the sounds of quarrel and he walked over with a frown. He saw the two women who were crying last night. One of them held onto a child and they sat on the ground, looking on blankly at the fierce quarrel continued within the crowd.</p>
 <p>After a few minutes, Chen Xiaolian was able to figure out what was going on.</p>
 <p>Their team was originally one with a small number of people. That was because no one wanted to accept women and children during the team allocation period. The three deceased men were the family members of the two women and the child. They were unwilling to separate and abandon their own wives and daughter. Thus, they had decided to make their own team with six people.</p>
 <p>Now that the three able-bodied young men had died… the three remaining team members, the women and the child were naturally incapable of paddling the boats by themselves. Additionally, the others were of the opinion that it was too much of a waste for them to be taking a boat for themselves. Rather, it was too much of a waste of diesel!</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian understood.</p>
 <p>These fellows were being shameless.</p>
 <p>They all believed that they should share out the diesel that was left in the boat. However, no one was willing to take in the two women and child.</p>
 <p>The two sides that were arguing were two of the more capable teams. Both of them had around seven to eight able-bodied young men and they argued fiercely.</p>
 <p>Watching this sad turn of events caused Chen Xiaolian to feel very dissatisfied. He abruptly strode forward until he was standing before the two women and child. He asked, “Can you cook?”</p>
 <p>The two women raised their head and looked at Chen Xiaolian in surprise.</p>
 <p>Lin Leyan who appeared beside Chen Xiaolian crouched down and rubbed the child’s face. She smiled at the child who was still within her mother’s embrace and handed a small piece of chocolate into the little child’s mouth.</p>
 <p>This action from her eased some of the tension that the two women were feeling.</p>
 <p>“I can. I can cook and paddle the boat,” one of the younger woman who was also relatively more fit said.</p>
 <p>“All right, I’ll accept you into my boat, all three of you,” said Chen Xiaolian with a calm voice.</p>
 <p>The eyes on both women instantly lit up.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian then raised his head to observe the two sides that were in the process of arguing with one another.</p>
 <p>“I’ve accepted them. So now, everything on their boat is naturally mine as well.”</p>
 <p>Both sides were stunned and someone soon called out, “Not fair!”</p>
 <p>“Right! That’s not fair!”</p>
 <p>“Those extra diesel should be shared with everyone!”</p>
 <p>“That’s right! On what basis are you taking it? How can one boat use the diesel meant for two boats?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian cast a disgusted expression at their faces, those greedy, warped and furious faces.</p>
 <p>He took a deep breath and said, “Who disagrees? Come out and say it one by one. How am I supposed to make head or tails of what you are saying if you all talk at once? Who’s going to step forward and talk first? Come! Tell it to my face!”</p>
 <p>One of the tall and lumbering African men shouted loudly, “You…”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian did not wait for him to continue. He suddenly lashed out with a kick, striking the African man’s body!</p>
 <p>The African man was sent flying and he fell into the crowd. Although his companions managed to catch him, he was no longer capable of saying anything as he spat blood from his mouth!</p>
 <p>The crowd broke into an uproar!</p>
 <p>A few fellows had wanted to rush forward and beat Chen Xiaolian. However, he pulled out the golden Desert Eagle and sneered as he moved to intercept them. With a punch and a kick, he knocked down two of them who made it close to him before aiming the muzzle of his gun at the third man’s head!</p>
 <p>In an instant, they lost the courage to make any other movements!</p>
 <p>A few more men who had been wanting to rush forward immediately stiffened on the spot, like sculptures.</p>
 <p>“Who else disagrees?” Chen Xiaolian asked coldly. “I will count to three, those who disagree, speak up.”</p>
 <p>No one uttered a squeak.</p>
 <p>“Three!” Chen Xiaolian’s first word was three and he smiled as he said, “Very good, no one disagrees anymore. I am very satisfied.”</p>
 <p>The other party then backed away in rage.</p>
 <p>It was then that Hans and his men came running over. Winston was there beside him.</p>
 <p>“Chen!” Hans was furious as he regarded those men who were lying injured on the ground. He also saw the one who was coughing out blood. Hans frowned at Chen Xiaolian and said, “You… what are you doing?”</p>
 <p>“I did what I wanted to do,” replied Chen Xiaolian with a very cold expression.</p>
 <p>“… but… if there is a problem, I can help negotiate it. There is no need to quickly resort to violence; we are refugees after all…”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian looked at Hans and said, “Hans, you know that I respect you a lot. However, I believe that there are some things that I should make clear to you.”</p>
 <p>“What is it?”</p>
 <p>“I am not a volunteer from your peace organization,” Chen Xiaolian said coldly. “I also do not share your beliefs. While it’s true I respect those beliefs, I am sorry to say that I would not do such a thing. You have your beliefs and I have my way of doing things. You have your own sense of fairness and I too, have my own sense of fairness.”</p>
 <p>Hans was speechless.</p>
 <p>“I have no obligation toward anyone here,” said Chen Xiaolian with a wry smile. “I am not obligated to take care of them, to obey them and I am most certainly not obligated to protect them. Truth be told… before we set off, the fact that I did not do anything to snatch other people’s diesel was already my way of showing respect for you. Hans, I have told you this before last night! You are not God, no one is! Me? I am most certainly not God! Do you understand what I am saying?”</p>
