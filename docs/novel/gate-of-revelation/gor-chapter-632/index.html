 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 632 Venomous </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya stumbled through one of the streets within the Manhattan instance dungeon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Earlier, his battle against Chen Xiaolian had caused him to crash into the Twin Towers, destroying it in the process. The fallen concrete from the collapsed towers had turned the surrounding streets into a stretch of ruins.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Almost all of the vehicles parked beside the streets were now damaged. Looking around, he could not even find an undamaged vehicle. Additionally, pieces of broken concrete littered the surface of the street. Even if he did find a vehicle, he would be unable to use it to make his way out of the area.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bits of flesh continued growing out from the wounds on Wu Ya’s body. Appearance wise, he appeared to be in better shape compared to earlier. He no longer looked as horribly damaged but his movements remain weak. Occasionally, as he made his way forward, he would stop and extend his hand to use a nearby piece of concrete to stop himself from falling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Chen… Xiao… Lian… … Chen… Xiaolian… …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Unbridled rage filled Wu Ya as he gnashed his teeth and repeatedly spat out that name.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Not once since coming to World’s End did he ever received such a heavy level of injury, not even once.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even more so, the one who did this to him was simply a young kid.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At present, all he wanted was to find a safe place that had a sufficient amount of foodstuffs and water.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although Jormungandr’s blood gave him a certain level of regenerative powers, it was a slow process which required time. Additionally, he was not just suffering from external injuries. He had also used up too much of his powers.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>By Wu Ya’s own estimate, he would require at least one week’s time to return to his peak state.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However… … he was not worried about that.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In World’s End, every Irregularity possessed unlimited time. What was one week?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The only concern in Wu Ya’s mind was that Chen Xiaolian might die to someone else before he could personally find him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>As long as… … I leave this utterly damaged area… find food and water…</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya wheezed as he made his way around a large piece of concrete. Then, Wu Ya, who was so close to making his way out of the area, suddenly stopped.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A figure was seated somewhere in front of him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was a young man with blond hair.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Beneath the young man was an ATV (all-terrain vehicle). The young man had his hands placed behind his head as he leaned against the ATV’s seat while his legs rested on the handlebars. It looked as though he was on a beach, taking in the breeze and sunshine.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He wore a pair of sunglasses on his face and it was unclear whether his eyes were open or closed. Even his face was looking away from Wu Ya, a look of contentment on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As Wu Ya was seriously injured, his face had a pale and weak look. However, when he saw the young man, his face turned even more twisted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Sebast… … what are you doing here? You are not the one in charge of clearing this instance dungeon!” asked Wu Ya with a hoarse voice as he leaned against a piece of concrete.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Eh? Wu Ya?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The young man with blond hair known as Sebast took off his sunglasses and turned to look at Wu Ya with a look of utter shock on his face. “You… … why are you here? If I recall correctly, you are not in charge of clearing this instance dungeon, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… … …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya did not answer. Instead, he simply cast a cold look at Sebast.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Wow! You’re injured? Keke, how did you get so badly injured? Who could inflict such a terrible injury upon the mighty Wu Ya?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast performed a flip and jumped down from the ATV. Then, he grinned at Wu Ya, a grin which revealed his pair of white teeth. “Given our current unusual situation, no one would dare start an infighting. Sure, you didn’t… … end up like this due to some Awakened ones? The current them are only normal humans!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What do you care?” Wu Ya released a snort as Sebast slowly made his way toward Wu Ya.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Sigh… to utter such cold words toward someone who’s worried about you, don’t you know that you are being too much, Sir Wu Ya?” With both his hands in his pockets, Sebast walked forward with a leisurely manner.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Stand right there, Sebast!” Wu Ya, who had to lean against a piece of concrete for support earlier, suddenly straightened his body and an overwhelming atmosphere surged out from his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Black coloured energies faintly loomed around his body while a thin layer of scales appeared to cover his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I obey, Sir Wu Ya!” Sebast actually did obey, stopping his feet, no longer moving forward. However, a ridiculing expression remained on his face. “How unexpected, even though you are already so badly injured, you can still release such an atmosphere. [S] class… … as expected from an [S] class.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Since you already know I am [S] class, you still have the guts to provoke me?” Fangs slowly extended out from between Wu Ya’s lips.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“[S] class eh… … of course it is very powerful. However, an [S] class who is cripplingly injured is a different story. Besides… …” Sebast gave another chuckle. “You revealed your Magical Dragon Transformation to scare me the moment you saw me. Don’t you understand? Such a move only proves how weak you currently are.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You…!” Wu Ya clenched his teeth and gnashing sounds could be heard. “You know about Magical Dragon Transformation?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Of course, Sir Wu Ya, I have always been secretly keeping tabs on you.” Sebast laughed. “After transforming into Jormungandr, one will possess the world destroying powers of an earthy colossal python.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Sneaky little peeping tom.” Wu Ya let out a harrumph.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Naturally, I am still young. I don’t wish to die so early.” Sebast extended a finger out and shook it. “None who had seen this body could continue to live. Mm, except… … me. If so, Sir Wu Ya, are you planning to kill me now?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If that is what you wish for, I can satisfy you.” A chilling light flashed across Wu Ya’s eyes and the scales on his body swiftly fell back as the faint, black coloured energies around him gradually disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What is it? Can you no longer maintain even the beginner state of the Magical Dragon Transformation? It seems your injuries have exceeded my expectations, Sir Wu Ya.” Sebast shook his head and feigned a sigh. “With this body of yours, how do you plan on killing me?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Even without the Magical Dragon Transformation, I can still…” As Wu Ya was still speaking, Sebast interrupted him with a smile, “You can what? Surely, you don’t think… … that you can kill me using your Unity of Five Energies! If that is true, why would you wait this long to take action? Sir Wu Ya, as an [S] class expert, these words of yours are seriously…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya was silent. He continued to cast a cold gaze at Sebast as he slowly adjusted his rate of breathing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Enough, Sir Wu Ya. Given your current injuries, I fear that even three days will not be enough for you to temper the surrounding metal into flying swords. It is also pointless to buy time. Might as well let me put an end to this.” Sebast snapped his fingers. “Right. Who was the one who did this to you? You can tell me. Maybe… … after getting your powers, I can help you exact revenge.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Die!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya abruptly roared out and the surrounding pieces of concrete exploded as several flying swords flew out from them. The flying swords moved to surround and stab Sebast.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, the number of flying swords was small. Additionally, even the quality of the swords was inferior compared to the swords in his fight against Chen Xiaolian. They only had a rough sword shape; even the steel bar threads remain visible.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Almost all of the flying swords charged toward Sebast. One, however, turned toward Wu Ya. When the flying sword flew before Wu Ya, he jumped up and staggered slightly as both his feet landed on the surface of the flying sword. He soon steadied himself. Even so, the flying sword carrying him lurched up and down slightly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya bit his tongue and sprayed out a mouthful of blood onto the flying sword. After receiving Wu Ya’s lifeblood, the flying sword released a chilling flash of light and stabilized. Next, it turned around and sped away quickly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mr Wu Ya, you… … did you really think you can escape?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast, who was the target of the incoming flying swords, showed no distress. In fact, he remained unperturbed despite Wu Ya’s move to escape, not showing any inclination to give chase at all. Next, his hand reached out to make a grasping motion and a sword appeared in his hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>What exactly Sebast did was unknown. He could only be seen drawing a semi-circle in the air with his sword. Next, every one of the flying swords broke.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There were no sound of metals clashing. The sword cut into the flying swords that Wu Ya had made from the steel bars like cutting tofu. It had so casually cut each of them into two.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At the same time, the metal energies that Wu Ya embedded into the flying swords were broken as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After cutting down the flying swords, Sebast remained, not going after Wu Ya. Instead, he turned to look at Wu Ya, who was flying further and further away. There was a ridiculing smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya had flown a distance of 100 metres and the speed of his flying sword gradually increased. However, at that very moment, a purple coloured light suddenly flashed out from the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Through a bird’s eye view, it was possible to see that a gigantic hexagram symbol had been laid out upon the ground, covering several kilometres square, with both Sebast and Wu Ya within it. At that moment, the gigantic hexagram symbol had lit up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A curtain of light rose up from the edges of the hexagram symbol, piercing the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya and his flying sword slammed into the curtain of light and screamed out wretchedly. In an instant, purple coloured electricity inundated his body and he fell from a height of several hundred metres. A loud thud could be heard.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing that, Sebast sneered. With a calm demeanour, he then moved forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There on the ground, Wu Ya was struggling to get up. However, the electrical current from earlier had left his entire body charred. Of the bits of flesh that was slowly regenerating, only strands remained.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If I didn’t have a trump card set up, would I so foolishly challenge you, Sir Wu Ya?” Sebast came to stand before Wu Ya. He crouched down and raised his brows as he looked at Wu Ya. “If you are still in your peak state, my Magical Restrictive Array would naturally be unable to stop you. But now… … keke.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya made a few rasping sounds but was unable to say anything. Instead, black coloured blood flowed out, forming a pool of blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Enough, stop struggling. When facing death, an [S] class must at least maintain his dignity. At the very least… … I believe that in the future, when I am facing death, I will not look as unsightly as you.” Sebast shook his head gently as a sad look appeared on his face. “Come, trust me, I will finish this quickly.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After saying that, Sebast raised up the sword in his hand and aimed it at Wu Ya’s left arm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The incomparably sharp sword easily cut away Wu Ya’s left arm. Next, it was Wu Ya’s right arm, followed by both his legs. In just a flash, all four of Wu Ya’s limbs had been cut away, leaving only his torso and head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although he could no longer speak, Wu Ya continued to stare forward with widened eyes. He was glaring at Sebast with the most resentment-filled pair of eyes in human history.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Relax, Sir Wu Ya,” said Sebast as he leaned forward. “I am not some sicko who plans on torturing you. It is just… … as an [S] class expert, who knows what kind of trump card you might have? Only by doing this …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He brought his mouth close to Wu Ya’s neck and whispered, “Can I… … be at ease and drain away your power!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast’s upper and lower canine teeth rapidly slid out from his mouth. Next, he sent them puncturing into Wu Ya’s artery.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A rasping sound came from Wu Ya’s throat as his entire body, his torso, turned tense. A layer of scales appeared on the surface of his body but Sebast’s fangs easily pierced them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Blood flowed out from the wound and was immediately sucked into Sebast’s mouth. As for Wu Ya’s body, it withered at a noticeable rate.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The black scales on his body gradually disappeared and his skin turned pale. His eyes were wide open and his mouth resembled a fish that was on dry land. Even so, a vague sound could be heard coming from his throat.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When Wu Ya’s body was as withered as a mummy, Sebast released a lengthy and satisfied sigh. Lifting his head up, he laughed loudly, a look of ecstasy on his face. “Wonderful! Simply wonderful! Mr Wu Ya! Blood of the colossal earthly python… … is indeed the most delicious ever! With your blood, I can finally… … evolve again!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast stood up and the skin on his back slowly tore apart as a thin pair of wings abruptly spread out from his back. As the pair of wings flapped gently, Sebast looked down at Wu Ya.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>All that was left of Wu Ya was a layer of skin wrapped around his skeleton. It seemed as though even his muscles and flesh had been sucked out from him. His face was now skeletal; and yet, his lips continued to move weakly as he exerted his all to say something.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After staring at Wu Ya’s mouth for some time, Sebast nodded and smiled. “Chen Xiaolian… … is it? It has been a long time since someone so interesting came to World’s End.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya’s lips continued moving.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Enough, you don’t need to say anything else, Mr Wu Ya.” Sebast smiled, showing his white teeth as he did. “The reason you are telling me this is because you really want me to kill Chen Xiaolian, or maybe you really want Chen Xiaolian to kill me. Or perhaps… … the best case scenario for you will be for us to grievously injure each other and finally succumb to the wounds each of us inflicted upon the other, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The movements on Wu Ya’s lips stopped and he wheezed slightly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“All right. Although I know what you are planning, this fellow is indeed very interesting. He is clearly an Irregularity, yet he appears unconcerned with the destruction of this World’s End… … if he really has that kind of mindset, then I am very interested to get acquainted with him.” Sebast flapped his wings and his figure flew straight up into the sky. “Well then, goodbye, Mr Wu Ya. Thank you for your blood.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya watched as Sebast’s figure flew into the sky, gradually decreasing in size until it was only a small dot in the sky. Then, the skeletal face of his twitched a few times as a venomous grin slowly formed on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When the grin was fully formed, the final vestiges of life dissipated from his eyes. All that was left of Wu Ya was that venomous grin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
