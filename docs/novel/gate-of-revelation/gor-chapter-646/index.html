 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 646 A Stick Poking Me? </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun dismounted and sheathed the Sword in the Stone, letting it hang from her waist. Step by step, she approached Sebast, a look of disdain on her face. “I won’t be using the sword anymore. Let me see just how powerful your regenerative powers are right now.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Damn it!” Sebast gnashed his teeth as both his hands punched forward once more. As he was attempting to open up another rift, Sister Yun descended upon him. Her delicate looking hand shot out with lightning-like speed to choke his neck. Next, she slammed him down the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>With her left hand choking Sebast’s neck, Sister Yun pressed down on Sebast to ensure that he would not be able to move about. Next, her right hand rose up high to form a fist before falling down heavily upon Sebast’s face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As her fist was descending, a faint silver glow could be seen coming off her fist.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast took Sister Yun’s punch and retaliated with one of his own. His fist shot toward Sister Yun’s waist, only to be deflected by her elbow. Next, her right hand reached out to grab hold of Sebast’s left arm. Then, she twisted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A clear sound of bones breaking rang loudly as Sebast’s arm was twisted into something akin to a deformed looking dough.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast’s neck then abruptly elongated like a viper. The fangs on his upper and lower jaws shot toward Sister Yun’s neck only to be blocked by Sister Yun’s gauntlet protected arm. After that, another heavy punch landed on Sebast’s face. The impact sent his whole head down the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His face, which was a patchwork of various life forms, was already distorted enough as it was. After the silver glow-empowered fist slammed down on his face, it became like a fallen pizza.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Magic and martial, Dual-type?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Another punch landed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“[S] class?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Another punch.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Rip my mouth?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Boom!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Again, another punch.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“And… … you dare injure me?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Boom!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Another punch.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The corners of Sister Yun’s lips curled up slightly as she looked at Sebast. A hint of bloodthirstiness had suddenly appeared on her constantly indifferent face. Every time she punched Sebast, she would icily repeat the words that Sebast had uttered earlier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast struggled frantically, but to no avail. Sister Yun had completely immobilized him and all he could do was to receive her punches in the face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Blood flowed non-stop down from the wounds on his face. This time, however, there was no longer any more blood for him to regenerate himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A deep crater swiftly appeared on the ground while Sebast’s elongated neck arced down into the ground. His head had been practically buried down under.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Then, as Sebast was screaming out wretchedly, Sister Yun grabbed his neck with a chokehold, pulled him out from the ground, and raised him up high.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun was fairly tall when compared to other women, but she was still slightly less tall compared to Sebast. Even so, raising Sebast up that way did not seem exhausting for her.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast continued struggling with his legs in an attempt to lash out with it. A chilling light flashed across Sister Yun’s eyes and her right leg then kicked both of Sebast’s thighs. The force of her kicks went all the way into his thigh bones.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast’s eyes rolled up as he nearly fainted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Still holding Sebast in a chokehold, Sister Yun brought Sebast’s head close to her and a provocative smile appeared on her face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Little bat, did you think that in this World’s End… … the only one you should fear, is Bai Qi?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Spare… … spare me… …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast’s lips shivered as he stammered out those words from his throat.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I have not lost my temper for a long, long time now. The same is true about me getting hurt.” Sister Yun revealed a faint smile and she shook her head. “Do you know? The punishment for infuriating me is a very heavy one.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I… … was wrong… … spare me…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast’s face had been smashed into a pile of mess. If not for the fact that his head was above his neck, it would have been impossible to tell that the thing there was his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Rejected.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun shook her head and looked down at the wound on her body once more. “Only one person has ever managed to hurt me and not die by my hands. You… … are not that person.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Her left hand, which was grabbing Sebast’s neck, swung toward the sky. Sebast, who had been beaten to within an inch of his life, could do nothing but let himself be tossed tens of metres up into the sky before falling down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast had lost both his wings and was cut off from the blood rift he used to regenerate himself. The present him no longer had the strength to even fly away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Next, Sister Yun summoned out a spear once again and aimed it at the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>With a silver glow of light that was even more intense than the previous ones, the spear blasted into the sky, piercing Sebast’s chest, and creating a large hole in his body. The silver glow of light spread out through his body until his whole figure transformed into a silver firework.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>By the time Sebast fell to the ground, all that was left of him was a pile of silvery powder.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian gaped as he looked at Sister Yun, who was standing far away from him. His chin fell so low his jaws nearly became dislocated.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>With the exception of Shen, the Guild Leader of Thorned Flower Guild, who had singlehandedly defeated three of Zero City’s [S] class experts, Sister Yun was the strongest expert he had ever met.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Chen Xiaolian… … what is up with that face of yours?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea turned to look at Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian then sat down beside Bluesea and released a long sigh. “She had killed off… … an [S] class.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“[S] class? What is that?” Bluesea was puzzled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian regarded Bluesea for quite some time before suddenly revealing a smile on his face. “Mr Bluesea, back then, when I had gone to Zero City and encountered you for the first time, you are the one who informed me of many things. How unexpected. To think that I would be the one to explain things to you today.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The so-called [S] class is one of the levels of strength for both Awakened ones and Players. The strongest level … … is [S] class. Naturally, this includes Irregularities as well. That Wu Ya was [S] class too.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Naturally even among those within [S] class, there are also the strong and the weak. However, under normal circumstances, if someone’s strength is within [S] class, it is usually impossible for that person to die no matter who or what their enemies are. Even if they cannot win, they will still be able to successfully escape, if they really wanted to escape, that is.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What about you? According to you, Wu Ya is an [S] class. If so, how did you kill him back then? Are you also an [S] class?” asked Bluesea with a frown.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Firstly, I did not really kill Wu Ya.” Chen Xiaolian shook his head bitterly. “The one called Sebast had stated earlier, Wu Ya had died in his hands. I had originally thought that my attack had killed off Wu Ya. But now, it would seem that I only managed to seriously hurt him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Secondly, that final attack I unleashed is a type of skill equivalent to that of a bank overdraft. After utilizing that skill, I will enter a weakened state for a period of time. Although I can slowly recover, it requires time. This skill is almost the equivalent to that of self-destruct. It can only be used in times of desperation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Thirdly, I am not really an [S] class. Only, I have a power inside my body, bestowed upon me by a certain [S] class expert – he is someone you know as well, Skyblade – but once I have to face off against a real [S] class expert, this fact will become exposed. If Wu Ya had known that I possessed that final card, he would not have engaged me in a battle of life and death. At least, not that casually.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If so, what level is she at?” Bluesea turned to look at Sister Yun, who had begun walking toward them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I don’t know either.” Chen Xiaolian shook his head. “All I know is, she is an ancient monster…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What are you doing? Don't touch me!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun had just arrived before the three when she suddenly heard Toto shouting out. Her face grew tense. With a flash, she appeared in front of Toto. Crouching down, she said, “What is wrong, Toto?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“There is this little brother… … he is poking me with a stick!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Toto raised his head. There was a pouting expression on his face and he looked aggrieved.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian looked at the area beside Toto.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was… … no one there at all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Xia Xiaolei had spent all this time staring at the bowl placed before him. The way he was looking at the bowl, it was as though he wanted to use his eyes to devour the fire on the lamp.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In the beginning, he would blink once every few seconds. Still, he managed to keep his eyes open. Slowly, however, the rate at which he blinked grew slower, increasingly so.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At present, Xia Xiaolei had not blinked his eyes for over 10 minutes. However, he was unaware of that fact.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He had even forgotten how long he had been sitting before the lamp.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Or perhaps, instead on saying he had forgotten, it may be better to say the concept of time had been lost.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The surrounding walls of the room he was in had disappeared. The table had disappeared. Even the bowl containing the wick had disappeared. Only one thing remained within Xia Xiaolei’s vision, the flame pulsating above the wick.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The pulsating flame appeared to be following a certain rhythm and it danced continuously in Xia Xiaolei’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Xia Xiaolei’s rate of breathing gradually grew uniform and minute in quality. Eventually, it stopped.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Suddenly, the flame revealed an intense pulsation. Seeing that, Xia Xiaolei’s heart gave a thump and he finally woke up from the near-meditative state that he was in earlier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Just now, he had practically lost the ability to think properly. Only now did he manage to recover. Having recollected himself, he hastily got up from the floor and attempted to take a deep breath. However, he forgot that he had been sitting for too long and the area beneath his waist had long since turned stiff. As he used too much strength in his attempt to get up, his body ended up falling backward and onto the floor.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When he fell on his back, Xia Xiaolei’s eyes noticed a familiar silhouette in the corner of the room.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>The piece of mosaic!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Xia Xiaolei scrambled up, closed his eyes and shook his head vigorously before reopening them…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>No question about it! It has reappeared!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Xia Xiaolei endured the aching sensation in his legs and leaned on the table to steady himself. Staring at the piece of mosaic, he opened the guild channel to report the matter to Lun Tai. However, just as he was about to speak up, he stopped. He pondered for a moment before turning off the guild channel.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>If the piece of mosaic disappeared before Lun Tai arrived, he would be treated as a fool.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>At the very least… … I must conform this myself first.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Xia Xiaolei inspected his surroundings before pulling out a candle from the box that he was seated on earlier. Then, he cautiously made his way toward the piece of mosaic.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As the room was not too large, it did not take long for Xia Xiaolei to arrive beside the piece of mosaic. He then carefully extended the candle, pushing it toward the piece of mosaic.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The last time Xia Xiaolei tried, his fingers had easily moved through the piece of mosaic. It had been as though the piece of mosaic were air. This time, however, he could feel the candle making contact with a soft object.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing that, Xia Xiaolei became dubious. Fearing that he may have made a mistake, he exerted more strength to move the candle forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After that, the clear voice of a little boy rang out beside his ears.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What are you doing? Don’t touch me!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Hearing that shocked Xia Xiaolei, causing him to fall on his back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He lay on the floor for a few seconds and finally confirmed that the voice earlier was not a hallucination on his part. With a roll, he got up. Holding the candle with both hands, he gestured outward at the piece of mosaic; his stance resembled one holding a dagger. Doing his best to put on his most ferocious voice, he then shouted, “You… … who are you? Are you human, or ghost? Or Demon? I’ll tell you, our Guild Leader is very powerful! If you dare harm me, my Guild Leader will definitely avenge me!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, the piece of mosaic did not reply. Instead, it stood up and looked upward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Next, Xia Xiaolei watched as it turned to the side and said in a grievous voice, “There is this little brother… … he is poking me with a stick!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Xia Xiaolei looked down at the candle in his hands.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>It seems… … that mosaic is talking about me?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Then… who is talking to the mosaic?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, Xia Xiaolei had been able to confirm that the piece of mosaic had no hostile intentions. It also appeared to be non-aggressive.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Judging by the way it was talking, it sounded like a little child.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Hey! What the Hell are you? Answer me now!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The piece of mosaic turned and Xia Xiaolei was vaguely able to make out the face looking at him. “I am Toto, who are you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“My… … my name is Xia Xiaolei! Why did you appear in this room?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Calming himself down, Xia Xiaolei then straightened his bearing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Room? I cannot see the room. This place is all dark. Except you, there is nothing else here… … I also cannot see you clearly. You look like… … a shadow.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Other than me, there is nothing else? If so, who were you talking to just now?” Xia Xiaolei scratched his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No, no!” The piece of mosaic waved his hand and continued, “I mean your place is dark, with nothing in it. Naturally, everything is good on my end. I was talking to Aunt Yun earlier.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“My place… your end… … just what are you on about? Who is Aunt Yun?” Xia Xiaolei was lost. “Aren’t you currently in our base’s room?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No, I am with Aunt Yun right now. Aunt Yun… … she had just defeated a bad guy. That bad guy was very powerful. However, Aunt Yun had said that as long as I let the Guiding Link Fire light up on top of my head, I need not fear anything!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Guiding… Guiding Link Fire? On top of your head… …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Xia Xiaolei’s body made a subconscious shudder and he turned to look behind him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You mean… … the one behind me?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The one on top of my head. On top of my head, not behind you!” Toto sounded somewhat anxious. “You can see me, why can’t you see the lamp on top of my head?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Xia Xiaolei scratched his head again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was nothing on the head part of the piece of mosaic. What lamp?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Fine, forget that first… … I just want to know what are you doing here? Are you a Player, Awakened, or… … an instance dungeon’s monster?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Awakened?” Toto exclaimed. “I think I heard that before. Aunt Yun had told me before. I was once an Awakened, but not anymore. However, the Player and instance dungeons you mentioned… … are you referring to World of Warcraft? I had heard from Big Fatty in my class. According to him… … that is an old-fashioned game that only middle-aged uncles would play.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What nonsense! What the Hell is your class’ Big Fatty? How old are you?” Xia Xiaolei gnashed his back teeth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I am in Third Grade, elementary school. Big brother, why are you so fierce?” replied Toto with an aggrieved voice as he shrunk backward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Third Grade?” Xia Xiaolei did not know if he should laugh or cry.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Just now, an elementary school third grader, not even 10 years of age, had scared him to that extent?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Fine, fine, I’ll stop being fierce… … speak properly. Do you know why you appeared here?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I… … don’t know… …” The piece of mosaic, Toto, shook his head. “Previously, whenever there is danger, Aunt Yun would have me light up the lamp. That way, the bad guys cannot harm me. However, during that time… … I had never encountered anyone else. Only today, I met big brother…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Danger? Bad guys? Just where are you two?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Aunt Yun told me that this place is called World’s End. According to her, I am already dead. However, as long as I follow her, I will be fine… … later on, though, we met two people. Aunt Yun said that one of them could bring me back home.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“World’s End?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Xia Xiaolei was stunned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After returning from Zero City, Guild Leader Xiaolian had informed them that Qiao Qiao was likely inside World’s End. Once the opportunity arrived, Chen Xiaolian would go save Qiao Qiao.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>For some unknown reason, a peculiar thought rose from within Xia Xiaolei’s mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Before this, Guild Leader Xiaolian had said that he was going to Romania to find someone… … however, it has been so long and we haven’t had any contact with him through the guild channel.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Could he be…</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Then, in that World’s End of yours, have you ever heard of a fellow called Chen Xiaolian? He is our Guild Leader, a little older than me, very good-looking. However, when he is serious, he exudes a very domineering aura.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Chen Xiaolian?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Toto looked up to look beside him. Then, he extended his hand to point at an empty floor area. “This big brother than Aunt Yun said could send me back… … I think his name is Chen Xiaolian.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Xia Xiaolei was flabbergasted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A few seconds later, Toto hesitantly spoke up again. Although it was still his voice, the tone was that of a completely different person.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Xia Xiaolei? I am Chen Xiaolian. Is everyone all right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
