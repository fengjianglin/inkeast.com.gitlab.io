 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 262: Phoenix’s Intuition</strong></p>
 <p>After walking across two streets, Chen Xiaolian flagged down a cab and had it fetch him to the airport to meet up with the others.</p>
 <p>In the airport, Chen Xiaolian found Lun Tai and Bei Tai and also Roddy who came to meet up with them.</p>
 <p>Seeing Chen Xiaolian walking over unharmed, he gave a sigh of relief. Without saying anything, Roddy walked over and hugged Chen Xiaolian tightly. His palm reached out and slapped him on his back.</p>
 <p>“Do you want to slap me to my death?” Chen Xiaolian said with a wry smile.</p>
 <p>Roddy exhaled and said, “I saw how Bei Tai’s arm was cut off and became very worried. I feared that you might have suffered from some wound as well. Although Lun Tai and Bei Tai did say that you are fine, I am still worried. Until I see it with my own eyes, I cannot feel at ease.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian gritted his teeth and said furiously, “We were ambushed. Bei Tai’s arm… we’ll get our revenge!”</p>
 <p>“Mm!” Roddy nodded and said, “That’s right! Lun Tai told me about it. But, who is the enemy, do we know?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian furrowed his brows and said, “I only know that the fellow in question is likely connected to Qiu Yun. We’ll need to investigate this in detail.”</p>
 <p>There were not many people in the airport terminal and the three of them had their discussion as they sat down in a corner.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s eyes suddenly narrowed as he saw some figures walking toward them from the far end of the terminal.</p>
 <p>Phoenix was pushing a wheelchair. Seated on the wheelchair was none other than Monster who was still in a dazed state. As for the Titan brothers, they walked beside Phoenix, one on the left and one on the right.</p>
 <p>Their eyes made contact. When Phoenix caught sight of Chen Xiaolian, her eyes narrowed.</p>
 <p>Lun Tai and Bei Tai were quick to spring up from their seats. Roddy who did not know what was going on stood up as well. He looked at Phoenix and asked in a whisper, “What is it? Do you know them?”</p>
 <p>“We’ve met before,” Lun Tai said coolly.</p>
 <p>Lun Tai and Bei Tai moved up behind Chen Xiaolian, one on the left and one on the right. The both of them prepared themselves for a fight. After all, they were on opposing sides in the instance dungeon quest earlier and had even fought against each other.</p>
 <p>To think that they would encounter one another in the airport…</p>
 <p>“Truly, the road is narrow when it comes to enemies. <sup><a id="ref1" href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>”</p>
 <p>Phoenix suddenly smiled and sighed before saying that.</p>
 <p>While the words should not have contained any goodwill, Phoenix said them with a smile. The smile could even be seen within her eyes.</p>
 <p>Then, she waved her hand, indicating to the Titan brothers to not step forward. She had one of them take over her task of pushing the wheelchair and she walked toward Chen Xiaolian alone.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian gave a light frown. Then, he nodded toward Lun Tai and Bei Tai. Next, he walked forward alone as well.</p>
 <p>The two of them walked forward until they stood face to face.</p>
 <p>“We meet again, Guild Leader Chen Xiaolian.”</p>
 <p>“Indeed, Guild Leader Phoenix.”</p>
 <p>Phoenix grinned and said, “The weather today is quite good.”</p>
 <p>“Did you stay in England for a few days and contract a Briton illness or something?” Chen Xiaolian purposely gave a sigh and said, “There’s a heavy rain outside and you’re saying the weather is quite good?”</p>
 <p>Phoenix narrowed her eyes. Her gaze went past Chen Xiaolian and fell upon those who were standing not far away, Lun Tai, Bei Tai and also Roddy.</p>
 <p>When her gaze returned to regard Chen Xiaolian’s face, a peculiar light was seemingly flashing out of her eyes. With a seemingly unperturbed face, she said, “I see a new face.”</p>
 <p>“That’s our reserve team member. When participating in an instance dungeon, we’ll need someone in charge of extraction,” Chen Xiaolian said coolly. Then, he continued, “It’s for the sake of what ifs. If after the instance dungeon is over and we encounter enemies from the instance dungeon – if someone wants to finish off any grudge born within the instance dungeon, then at least we won’t suffer a huge loss.”</p>
 <p>Phoenix smiled. “You think too much.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian shook his head and replied, “Have not the desire to harm others, lack not the desire to protect oneself.”</p>
 <p>Phoenix was silent for a moment. Then, she took a deep breath and said, “In the instance dungeon, we did fight side by side. If not for your help, we might not have been able to smoothly complete Jack the Ripper’s quest. We might even end up failing.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian maintained an indifferent expression.</p>
 <p>Phoenix looked into Chen Xiaolian’s eyes and said, “As for the War for the Throne… although we were in opposing sides, I believe that Guild Leader Xiaolian understands. That was the decision made by the system. We had no choice but to be part of Harold’s camp. If we do not complete our quest, we will be punished. Thus…”</p>
 <p>“So, since the instance dungeon has been completed, even if we were to meet up outside of instance dungeons, there is no need for us to confront one another. Is that right?” Chen Xiaolian smiled in a carefree manner.</p>
 <p>Phoenix sighed and said, “Guild Leader Xiaolian is indeed someone with a deep sense of righteousness.”</p>
 <p>“You’re exaggerating. Guild Leader Phoenix is calm and intelligent,” said Chen Xiaolian as he blinked his eyes.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian noted that there was a wooden wand hidden behind Phoenix’s sleeve.</p>
 <p>It was the same for him. Chen Xiaolian had quietly opened up the Sword in the Stone tab in his system and he was ready to summon it out to start hacking away at any moment!</p>
 <p>The two Guild Leaders exchanged some seemingly courteous words.</p>
 <p>After that, Phoenix took a deep breath and said, “No matter what, to be able to get acquainted is also fate. Hopefully, we’ll get the chance to cooperate in future instance dungeons.”</p>
 <p>“I’m sure there’ll be such an opportunity,” said Chen Xiaolian as he gave an insincere laugh.</p>
 <p>“If so… I guess this is goodbye.” Phoenix turned around. However, she suddenly stopped and said, “Can I ask you something?”</p>
 <p>“… go ahead.”</p>
 <p>“Back on the hill,” said Phoenix as she turned to look Chen Xiaolian in the eye. “When the two of us were fighting – back then, you really did not want to kill me? Guild Leader Xiaolian, did you go easy back then?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian coolly replied, “What about you? Guild Leader Phoenix, you managed to trick me with your Body Substitution Spell. Yet you did not kill me. You only used the daoist talisman to trap me – did you not go easy on me then too?”</p>
 <p>The two of them smiled and their expression lightened up somewhat.</p>
 <p>“Well then, I look forward to our next meeting.”</p>
 <p>Phoenix extended her hand toward Chen Xiaolian. Chen Xiaolian noted that Phoenix had already let go off the wand.</p>
 <p>He then extended out his hand as well and the two of them shook hands.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian could feel Phoenix’s slender and cool fingers.</p>
 <p>Phoenix turned to leave and Chen Xiaolian breathed a sigh of relief. Unexpectedly, the young woman suddenly turned around and cast a look at Chen Xiaolian. She said, “It’s strange.”</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>Phoenix revealed a faint smile and said, “My companion, Monster is injured and had to sit in a wheelchair. Guild Leader Xiaolian, although you saw him in such a state, you don’t seem too surprised.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s heart became tense. However, his face betrayed no emotion as he quickly said, “I heard that during the battle on the hill, Monster fought against Lun Tai and suffered from some wounds. But, it shouldn’t be too serious.”</p>
 <p>Phoenix smiled in a charming manner and said, “The injuries aren’t that heavy. Look at brother Lun Tai, he seems quite all right.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian replied, “He did suffer from some wounds as well. However, after using some medicinal substances…”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Chen Xiaolian’s heart became tense!</p>
 <p>Phoenix squinted her eyes and she smiled as she observed Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian deliberately cast another gaze at Monster and said, “Did brother Monster not take a medicinal substance? If you temporarily do not have any, I can sponsor you one.”</p>
 <p>“No need,” Phoenix said coolly. “Although out guild is not very big, we can still afford a medicinal substance.”</p>
 <p>The young woman deliberately looked at Chen Xiaolian and said, “It’s raining heavily outside. I see that your clothes are still not dry. But… from what I can see, the clothes of the rest of your guild members are already dry.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian could sense some danger and he coolly replied, “It’s just that I did not bring any spare clothes with me.”</p>
 <p>Phoenix nodded her head. She stopped asking any more questions.</p>
 <p>“May we meet again, Guild Leader Xiaolian.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, the young woman turned around and left without looking back.</p>
 <p>She returned to Monster’s location. After taking back the handles of the wheelchair, she pushed it and led her two guild members away with her as they quickly left.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s face was solemn as he turned around and walked back.</p>
 <p>“How is it?” Bei Tai frowned and said, “I thought they were going to start a fight here.”</p>
 <p>Lun Tai who was standing beside him shook his head and said, “Probably not. This young woman is quite smart. This is a public area. If we start a fight here, we’ll be attracting trouble from the system. In the end, we’ll all suffer. Besides, when not in an instance dungeon, it is necessary to limit our strength. Nothing much will come out from engaging in a fight. If so, why bother – this young woman is very intelligent.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian nodded his head and said in a meaningful manner, “Mm, she is quite intelligent.”</p>
 <p>He could somewhat sense that Phoenix… was suspecting him. However, there was nothing conclusive.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“Are we just going to walk away like this?”</p>
 <p>One of the Titan brothers frowned and asked Phoenix.</p>
 <p>“What else should we do?” Phoenix asked coolly. “There is no grudge between us to begin with. Our fight inside the instance dungeon was because we were in different camps. If we were to engage in a fight after coming out, that would be the equivalent of creating trouble for ourselves.</p>
 <p>“If we fight when we are not inside an instance dungeon, we’ll need to limit our strength. What could come out of such a fight? Also, if we end up suffering from wounds after fighting, we’ll need to use our own points to purchase medicinal substances.</p>
 <p>“Do you have too much points to spare?”</p>
 <p>The Titan brother shut his mouth.</p>
 <p>Phoenix shook her head and frowned. She said, “I keep getting this feeling. That Chen Xiaolian’s actions are somewhat odd. Especially the way he reacted after seeing Monster’s state. Somehow, his expression and reaction seemed forced.”</p>
 <p>“Do you mean to say… Monster was ambushed by Chen Xiaolian and his team?” The other Titan brother asked.</p>
 <p>“It doesn’t seem like it,” said Phoenix who quickly shook her head. She continued, “Monster’s wounds had healed up. At present, it is his mental state that is in question. He appears to be in a daze. It doesn’t seem to be Chen Xiaolian’s handiwork… this is not the type of skill that he and his two subordinates have.&nbsp; We have already given Monster medicinal substances. Yet, he remained in such a state. I feel that… this is unlikely something that Chen Xiaolian did.</p>
 <p>“Yet… I get the feeling that he might know something.”</p>
 <p>“Eh?”</p>
 <p>“Did you fellows notice? His entire body was wet. Additionally… there were stone chips on his shoes.” Phoenix continued, “The place that we found Monster just happened to be somewhere filled with broken stones.”</p>
 <p>Phoenix then revealed a bitter smile and said, “A pity I have no evidence. Moreover, this speculation is rather outrageous. Forget it… even if we are to ask him, we won’t be able to get anything out of him. If we get any chances in the future, we’ll investigate it in detail. Thankfully, Monster did not suffer from any serious injuries. His mind will slowly recover.</p>
 <p>“The biggest problem before us now is… we failed the London instance dungeon.</p>
 <p>“We have a critical matter to deal with next: Punishment instance dungeon!”</p>
