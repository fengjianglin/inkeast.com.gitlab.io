 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Before the sky turned dark, Tom Huggins returned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He did not return empty-handed. On his shoulder was a prey.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The instant he noticed that, Chen Xiaolian’s eyes lit up. He got up and walked over. Looking through the snow, however, he noticed that there was a rather dark look on Tom Huggins’ face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What happened?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“We’ll talk about it after we go inside,” Tom Huggins gritted his teeth and said in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His prey was a snow sheep, weighing up to several tens of kilograms. It had long since become frozen and was as hard as iron.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After identifying the prey, a complicated look flashed across Chen Xiaolian’s face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You noticed something wrong as well, right?” Tom Huggins shook his head and tossed the snow sheep down beside the fire. Next, he pulled out a blade.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His sharp blade began moving as he cut the snow sheep apart. He was very skilled. Due to how cold it was, the snow sheep’s body was already as hard as iron. However, Tom Huggins casually peeled off its skin. Tossing a lamb leg into the pot placed above the fire, he then stood up and walked out of the cave. He gathered a pot’s worth of snow and put it into the pot, letting them stew slowly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I am not an expert on wild animals… … however, even I know that snow sheep resides below the snow line. There is no way it would appear on top of a snow-capped mountain.” Chen Xiaolian shook his head. “Unless, did you go down the mountain?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“With such a short amount of time, how could I go that far?” Tom Huggins shook his head. “It was already dead when I found it. It was frozen on the ground.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian shut his mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although snow sheep had the word ‘snow’ in its name, it was still a type of sheep. This type of sheep usually lived beneath snow-capped mountains, beneath the snow line. Although it was a very dextrous and agile beast with the ability to jump back and forth between rocks… … that would not be possible in snow-covered lands.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Because the land above the snow line was all covered by snow. There was no vegetation at all – that meant no food. Sheep would never reside at places above the snow line.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Their current position was obviously somewhere atop a snow-capped mountain. Given how their landscape was covered entirely in snow, there was no way for sheep to survive here.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Yet, a sheep had frozen to death somewhere on the ground for no apparent reason…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Thus…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“There are other people here.” Tom Huggins growled. “It would appear this thing had been deliberately tossed aside for us.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was an odd look on Chen Xiaolian’s face. “Are they worried that we would starve to death… …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Within a black forest…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A persistent layer of moisture covered the thick forest. After breathing within the forest for a long time, one would feel suffocated.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie took the lead. He held a torch in one hand and a machete in another. His tall and muscular body was like a mountain. He swung the machete to clear a path for them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Soo Soo was at the centre. Her pair of black pupils were constantly looking around. As for Nicole, she followed behind Soo Soo, a gloomy expression on her face. However, her eyes revealed that she had not let down her guard at all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>They had spent two hours moving through the forest. Despite that, Tian Lie’s robust body did not reveal any signs of fatigue. The machete in his hands, too, continued to gleam with a chilling light.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A little while later, Tian Lie suddenly halted his steps. He then turned around and grinned at Soo Soo, revealing a set of white teeth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Little girl, it seems we have made it out of the forest.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After that, the three of them moved forward. After crossing a distance of less than 50 metres, they saw an empty clearing before them. Finally, they walked out of the forest. Beyond the forest was a valley, not too big in size, and covered in green grass. Although there was still no one there, this scenery was not as suppressive as the forest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Beyond the valley was a vast expanse of trees. Black pines and firs dominated the trees in the forest. Occasionally though, they could see a spruce rising up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Soo Soo looked at one of the pine trees. A squirrel quickly made its way across the tree and its grey fur swiftly disappeared amid the treetops.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nicole jumped up the tree and her hand shot out to capture a plump squirrel. After that, she tossed the squirrel into Soo Soo’s arms.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Soo Soo blinked and smiled. She stroked the squirrel and hugged it. As for the little thing, it would appear that it had received a huge shock and it dared not move. Soo Soo raised her head and smiled at Nicole. “Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nicole maintained a passive face. Instead, she raised her head to look into the distance. Still standing upon the treetop, she was able to see farther ahead. She reached out with her hand to cover her eyes as she observed, a slight look of loss on her face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No need to look, I know this place.” Tian Lie suddenly sighed. He sat down on the ground and pulled out a bottle of water from his bag. In one breath’s time, he gulped down the entire contents of the bottle. Then, he looked up and said with a wry smile, “You two beauties, come on and sit. Let’s talk… … mm, more accurately, we may be in trouble.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Trouble?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nicole jumped down from the treetop and landed effortlessly beside Tian Lie.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Soo Soo, on the other hand, released the squirrel, allowing the small thing to flee, disappearing back into the treetops. After that, Soo Soo walked to Tian Lie’s side. “Brother Da Gang, what did you say?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“We are in trouble.” Tian Lie sighed. He wiped away the sweat on his forehead and pointed at the valley before them. “I recognize this place… … I have been here before.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Oh?” A flicker flashed across Nicole’s face and she said, “This place is?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The Black Forest. To be exact, it is the Teutoburg Forest.” Tian Lie smiled wryly and continued, “However, when I was here, this place did not look like this.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After saying that, he stuck his hand out and pointed. “There, there should be a statue there.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Statue?” Soo Soo widened her eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The Hermann Monument,” said Tian Lie with a wry smile. “It should be right there… … although this place is a forest, the landscape cannot change by much. The surrounding mountain slopes, valleys, the terrain, all of them remain the same. I am certain that this is where the Hermann Monument should be at.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Hearing that, Nicole’s face took on a dumbfounded expression.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>With a rather pale look, she whispered, “Hermann Monument, built in 1838… … to commemorate the Germanic national hero. That is why such a statue was built in the Teutoburg Forest. It took over 30 years to complete the statue … …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Soo Soo frowned and asked, “What does that mean?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It means we are no longer near Bran Castle. We are no longer in Romania.” Nicole sighed. “We are now, in Germany! The Teutoburg Forest in Germany… … moreover, a Germany prior to 1838.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… … what the hell, man.” Tian Lie sighed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Germany?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Just by taking a step out from Bran Castle, a place filled with legends of vampires, they ended up teleported into Germany?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A distance of several hundred kilometres!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“We will stay here until dawn.” Chen Xiaolian looked at the mutton stewing inside the boiling pot. He produced a spoon and gently stirred it. “After daybreak, we will think of some way to get down this mountain and reach the foot of the mountain. Soo Soo’s group is within a forest. I am guessing that must be a certain forest at the foot of this mountain. No matter what, we should regroup first.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I agree.” Tom Huggins nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Suddenly, Chen Xiaolian’s face froze.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He had received a message that Soo Soo sent to him through his personal system.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Xiaolian oppa, we have just confirmed this. Brother Da Gang and sister Nicole have both confirmed it. We are now in Germany. There is a distance of roughly 800 kilometres between here and Bran Castle.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Germany?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>800 kilometres away?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian was flabbergasted. He subconsciously turned to look at the pot of mutton before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Mutton pot, let’s do this!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
