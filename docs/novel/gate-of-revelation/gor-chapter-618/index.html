 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 618 Fight! </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea’s brows were knitted tightly as he focused wholeheartedly on controlling the sports car.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Earlier, in order to divert the tank away, he had deliberately made a huge turn around the city. At present, there was quite some distance between them and the convenience store. Additionally, the distance was still growing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As Bluesea continued driving the sports car forward, he saw that the number of obstacles on the street were increasing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There were the hastily abandoned vehicles, the debris from the surrounding buildings, and the craters on the surface of the street. Who knew what weapons were used to create those craters.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>One thing was clear, a battle had taken place in this area. Additionally, this battle was more intense than the others.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Given the situation, it was only natural that Bluesea would need to devote even more of his focus into driving.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Due to this predicament, the nerves in his whole body, from his fingers to the soles of his feet, were pulled taut. Whenever an obstacle appeared before him, he would hastily turn the steering wheel and adjust the acceleration so that the sports car could speed through the street through the simplest route at high velocity, sometimes grazing the surface of the vehicles and debris obstructing his path.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even so, he was unable to create a sufficient amount of distance between himself and the pursuing tank.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As the situation continued, Bluesea’s heart grew increasingly anxious.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Before him was a three-way junction. However, the street leading to the left had been utterly blocked off by a collapsed building. Only the street leading to the right could be used. Even then, there was only barely enough space for the sports car to make it through.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Oddly, Bluesea could hear a series of strange and sporadic sounds coming from before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It reminded him of the sound made by a pile driver; however, the sounds were more intense and faster and it continued echoing about.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Furthermore, it was getting closer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was no telling what was before him. However, Bluesea had no time to even consider that. Any carelessness on his part could likely result in him getting killed by a blast from the tank pursuing him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea took a deep breath as he regarded the path ahead. Next, he quickly took a peek at the wing mirror.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>With a loud roar, the tank charged out from the junction behind him, trampling the few vehicles that happened to be blocking its path. With a jerk, its turret turned to once again aim at the sports car he was in.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea released a heavy sigh. His right hand shot out to pull the gear shift. After having dodged the tank’s blasts several times, he had begun to figure out how to avoid the blasts by a hair’s breadth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This time, though, the turret only rested on the sports car for a moment before abruptly turning up high.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Up?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea was surprised. However, before he could turn his attention back to the front side of the sports car, a deafening roar reverberated through the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Next, a gigantic, black coloured silhouette appeared between the light coming from the sky above and the ground beneath.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Another… … monster.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Appearance wise, it was similar to the monsters that Bluesea had seen in the underground parking garage. However, this one was so much larger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Additionally, this monster was not standing on the ground. Rather, it hovered tens of metres above ground by utilizing its claws to grip the surface of the high-rise buildings. It rapidly turned around the corner and charged toward them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The monster had a height of at least 20 metres. A devilish light was reflected off the black scales on its body and its pair of eyes were staring intently at Bluesea.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Its sharp claws were at least three metres in length and were used to stab deep into the surrounding high-rise buildings. Every time the claws were pulled out, a large chunk of broken concrete would fall out from the crevices and onto the ground. Yet, despite its gigantic size, despite its action of crawling through the outer walls of the high-rise buildings, it was still able to move at a shockingly fast rate. It was as though the monster was an enlarged gecko making its way through the walls.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Right after making its appearance, the monster’s eyes were intently fixed upon the sports car that Bluesea was driving.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At that moment, there were less than 50 metres between Bluesea and the monster.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The monster took action, performing a forward pounce.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Forward!!!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The initial feelings of panic had only lasted for a brief second. Bluesea immediately recollected himself and made up his mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Stepping one foot down on the accelerator to the max, Bluesea pushed every part of his mind to its limit. As he did so, it felt as though every action occurring before him was proceeding in slow motion.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In that instant, Bluesea could feel the sports car becoming an extension of his body. Every piece of gravel, every fluctuation resulting from the surrounding air flow, every tremor going through the steering wheel, all of those feelings were transmitted to his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Likewise, the movements of the monster above had also turned slow. Within Bluesea’s perception, he could see the monster slowly pulling its claws out from the building, turn it, and then proceed to slowly pounce at him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Under Bluesea’s control, the sports car slowly made a perfect and precise arc through the street.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>If Schumacher were to witness this in the racing circuit, he too would have nothing but praise for the high-speed bend.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The monster’s two front feet slammed heavily upon the surface of the street, causing the ground to quake as a result. However, it had missed by half a metre. The sports car that Bluesea was in had perfectly avoided the monster’s pounce and it sped away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After successfully dodging the monster’s attack, the world, which had seemingly turned slow for Bluesea, turned normal. The feeling of the sports car becoming an extension of his body, too, disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Right after making it out of the dire situation, the sports car nearly slammed into a fire hydrant by the street. Bluesea hastily hit the brake twice to decrease the speed of the sports car slightly to regain control of the car.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At the same time, Bluesea heard the sound of artillery coming from behind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mr Wu…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The instant he saw the monster, Deiha shrieked out. Before he was done with his shriek, though, Wu Ya, who was beside him, swiftly straightened his body. Both his hands shot out to grab the controls. As he made adjustments on the controls, he slammed down on the fire button. However, he did not immediately release his hand from the button.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Within the tank, other than the space for the crew members, there were also two parallel battle stations. Each of them allowed for the independent control of movements and weaponry of the Thunderstorm Tank. The crew members on either side can operate the controls there separately.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As the tank turret was turning, the monster in front of them pounced toward the sports car that they were pursuing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Blue light shone from the muzzle of the Thunderstorm Tank’s turret. However, it did not immediately open fire. Instead, the light flickered and its intensity grew.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Deiha cautiously looked to the side at Wu Ya, who was beside him. There was a trace of anxiousness on Wu Ya’s face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Deiha was not familiar with Wu Ya. If not because he had joined the coalition, a minor character like him would not had had the chance to even speak to an expert like Wu Ya. The expression on Wu Ya’s face at that moment, however, was something that Deiha had never seen before.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>We are now inside a Thunderstorm Tank. A Thunderstorm Tank!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>That monster, is it… … that powerful?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As the thought struck Deiha’s mind, the monster’s pounce landed it on the ground. However, it missed the sports car by a hair’s breadth. Seeing that, even Deiha grew shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>So fast!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>How could it move so quickly with such a large body?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It turned out the dot of light on the display screen that he had seen earlier was not from some aircraft. Rather, it was because the monster was quickly climbing its way through the walls of the surrounding city buildings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Before Deiha was done being shocked, he heard a loud booming sound.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After Wu Ya released his hold on the fire button, the turret muzzle unleashed a beam of light that was several times thicker than the ones it had unleashed earlier. The beam of light shot toward the monster before them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Only after seeing that did Deiha realize that the Thunderstorm Tank’s energy turret could build up its energy before firing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, the instant the beam of light shot out, a bluish, translucent light suddenly appeared upon the surface of the monster’s body. The blast from the Thunderstorm Tank struck the surface of the bluish, translucent light, but was unable to penetrate it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The bluish light on the monster’s body was like a layer of water. After the Thunderstorm Tank’s blast struck it, ripples spread out across the layer of light. However, the layer of light had protected the monster, negating any form of damage from reaching it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>A protective shield!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>This monster could use a protective shield!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Deiha felt himself on the verge of wetting his pants. For it to stop a fully charged blast from a Thunderstorm Tank, just how strong was that protective shield?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>If not for the fact that he was sitting inside a Thunderstorm Tank, Deiha did not think he would be able to face such a monster and survive.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even with the protection afforded by the Thunderstorm Tank, Deiha could still feel a bone chilling sensation rise from his toes all the way up to his scalp.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Deiha sneaked a glance at Wu Ya and saw that he had lost his composed look. Instead, a warped expression could now be seen on Wu Ya’s face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Son of a bitch! A mature Karra beast! To leave a mature beast intact, how the Hell did those hapless fools clear this instance dungeon?!” There was a livid expression on Wu Ya’s face as he forcefully pulled the control shaft. The Thunderstorm Tank immediately moved in reverse as it retreated.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After the monster Wu Ya referred to as the Karra beast missed its attack on the sports car, it quickly raised its head. Turning left and right, it gave both the sports car and the Thunderstorm Tank a glance. Without hesitating, it chose to ignore the sports car and instead turned its attention toward the Thunderstorm Tank that had just opened fire at it and was now retreating. Straightening its body, it vaulted up into the air.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You drive! Move it backward! If this Thunderstorm Tank gets destroyed, I will kill you!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya watched as the Karra beast jumped tens of metres up into the air and used the sharp claws on all four of its feet to stick to the surface of a high-rise building. The expression on his face flickered and he quickly shouted out those words at Deiha before pushing open the hatch. Then, he climbed out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Deiha had not expected Wu Ya to charge out from the Thunderstorm Tank. He frantically scrambled to grab the control shaft and sent the Thunderstorm Tank backward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After climbing out of the hatch, Wu Ya gave the surface of the Thunderstorm Tank a light kick to send his body charging forward. At the same time, the Karra beast that was climbing along the surface of a high-rise building suddenly lifted its head up. A bulge appeared from its abdomen area and it began travelling toward its throat.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Ten Thousand Rocks, Quick!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The index finger and middle finger on his right hand sticking side by side, Wu Ya quickly used them to wave before him. Following the waving motion, a faint yellow coloured symbol emerged from his body to float around him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Numerous rocks abruptly pierced its way out from the ground, like a fountain spraying upward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At the same time, a bluish light shone out from the Karra beast’s abdomen and throat area. Next, it suddenly lowered its head to unleash a vast beam of light.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As the beam of light was shooting forward, a tall rock wall, upward of 10 metres in height, formed on the ground before Wu Ya. The rock wall rose up between the beam of light and the Thunderstorm Tank.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The beam of light struck the surface of the rock wall. Instantly, an intense explosion erupted. After getting struck by the beam of light, the extreme temperature of the beam caused the surface of the rock wall to expand all too quickly, causing it to explode. Rock fragments flew about as a result. In but a flash, the beam of light had left a deep gully across the rock wall.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Deiha’s vision was blocked off by the rock wall and he was unable to see what was going on beyond the wall. However, the tremors from the explosions had travelled through the ground all the way through the Thunderstorm Tank and into Deiha’s body. All he could do was to pull the control shaft tightly, pushing the retreating velocity of the Thunderstorm Tank to its max while hoping that Wu Ya’s rock wall could stop the monster. He hoped that the attacks would not hit the tank.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If this Thunderstorm Tank gets destroyed, I will kill you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>What a joke!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>If such a monster actually manages to land a hit on this Thunderstorm Tank, will there even be a need for you to kill me?</span></em></p>
