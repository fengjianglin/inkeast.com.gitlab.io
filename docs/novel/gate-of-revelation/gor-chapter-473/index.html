 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 473 Chasm</strong></p>
 <p>No matter how they pondered, Chen Xiaolian and the others were unable to figure out what he meant by ‘resurrection’ – however, that word had, without a doubt, aroused their interest.</p>
 <p>If it were possible to resurrect a dead team member in this cruel game, then that would become a huge matter.</p>
 <p>Who would not want a second chance at life?</p>
 <p>“All of you will be unable to escape. He will find you all and kill you all, one by one!” Thirteen grinned hideously. Despite the blood flowing out of his mouth, he appeared undeterred. Instead, he said coldly, “Even if you all kill me now, he will just resurrect me! Ha ha ha ha ha!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian released his grip on Thirteen before turning to look at his teammates.</p>
 <p>Next, he deliberately revealed a look of relief as he looked at Thirteen. “Is that it?”</p>
 <p>The façade on Chen Xiaolian’s face puzzled Thirteen. He became hesitant and looked at Chen Xiaolian. “Are you not surprised?”</p>
 <p>“Surprised at what?”</p>
 <p>“… … …” Thirteen snorted and chose to remain silent.</p>
 <p>“You think I would believe your lies?” Chen Xiaolian deliberately smiled. Next, he raised his hand and struck Thirteen, knocking him unconscious.</p>
 <p>Thirteen grunted and his body tilted before falling to the ground.</p>
 <p>“Now we are certain of one thing, this fellow has another teammate.” Chen Xiaolian turned to the others and said, “That other fellow’s strength must be quite good. There is a need for us to be extra careful.”</p>
 <p>After Chen Xiaolian said that, Roddy smiled. “It is just one person.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian shook his head. “We cannot be careless. Now, I am going to go over our plans to fight…”</p>
 <p>On the ground, Thirteen’s eyelids seemingly fluttered and his ears seemingly perked…</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“So, by going along the cave tunnel inside the mountain, I will find an underground cavern?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, just enter the cave and move forward and you will see a large cavern. That is where the magic array is situated. The magic array has been activated and its core is their quest target, the one known as little Will. That fellow is an incarnation of the Demon King. By killing him, the magic array will be broken. The people here are pretty strong. Their abilities are…”</p>
 <p>The short man silently listened to Thirteen through their guild channel. Then, he nodded satisfactorily. “Well done. You did good. If you die, at the end of this instance dungeon, I will resurrect you.”</p>
 <p>“If so… … what about One-eye and the others?”</p>
 <p>“Since those trash died, then so be it. Your performance made me very happy… how about this? After the new team is organized, are you willing to take up the responsibility as its leader?”</p>
 <p>“… … it would be my pleasure!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Clearly, there were different entrances for the Light Faction and the Demon Faction.</p>
 <p>They were both on the mountainside. However, they were separated by a cliff the distance of 100 metres.</p>
 <p>Tian Lie had already caught sight of Mene and the other knights. There was a peculiar expression on his face. As for Mene and the others, they stood by the cliff on their side and looked at Tian Lie and his group.</p>
 <p>Mene stood there silently, his icy eyes glaring through his visor and the storm.</p>
 <p>Slowly, he performed a throat slitting gesture.</p>
 <p>Tian Lie looked at Nicole. “He is doing that for you.”</p>
 <p>Nicole ignored Tian Lie’s nonsense. Instead, she cast an odd look at Tian Lie.</p>
 <p>“Why are you looking at me that way?”</p>
 <p>“I was wondering what your relationship with Thorned Flower Guild is.” Nicole lowered her voice and pointed at Natasha, who was walking up front. “Just now, I recall hearing her say that Odin died in the hands of Thorned Flower Guild. After that, you told me that you killed him. And now, you suddenly determined that Thorned Flower Guild did not enter the third phase… … I get the feeling that you are very familiar with Thorned Flower Guild.</p>
 <p>“Could it be… … you really are a traitor of Thorned Flower Guild who ran away?”</p>
 <p>“Thorned Flower Guild has never allowed the existence of traitors. Have you heard of any?”</p>
 <p>“There is always a first time for everything.” Nicole cast a complex look at Tian Lie.</p>
 <p>“And what about you?” Tian Lie narrowed his eyes. “You seem very interested in Thorned Flower Guild’s matters.”</p>
 <p>Nicole was silent. Tian Lie deliberately moved closer and whispered, “Also, you are definitely not a rookie. You are definitely a veteran… … the problem is, I get the feeling that you are not that familiar with those in the Awakened circle. For example, Odin and Natasha. Those are all famous figures in the Awakened circle. However, when I mentioned them, your reaction suggests that you have never heard of them before. What does that imply?”</p>
 <p>“… … …”</p>
 <p>Looking into Nicole’s eyes, Tian Lie deliberately spoke in a whisper once more, “After thinking about it, someone who possesses a vast amount of combat experience, yet knows nothing about the names of those in this circle… … after thinking about it, only those from that city would behave like this. Could it be you are someone from that city?”</p>
 <p>Nicole’s pupils contracted and she exchanged glances with Tian Lie. Then, they shifted their gazes away at the same time.</p>
 <p>“Fine. You have your secrets and I have mine. Let us stop probing each other.”</p>
 <p>“Deal!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>[System prompt: Magic array countdown timer: 24 minutes 38 seconds.]</p>
 <p>After walking into the cave, Natasha looked at the countdown in her personal system before carefully checking her surroundings.</p>
 <p>The four-man team were walking in front. The solo participant walked beside her. A few times now, he had seemingly wanted to engage in a conversation with her. However, he was still hesitant.</p>
 <p>Mm, even so, the one giving Natasha the strangest impression was the man and woman pair behind her. The two of them walked behind and were muttering with each other along the way.</p>
 <p><em>How strange… … if they are in the same guild, why talk like that? Just communicate using their guild channel.</em></p>
 <p>Suddenly, the four-man team up front let out an exclamation.</p>
 <p>Natasha’s attention was immediately drawn to the front.</p>
 <p>Inside the cave, their path had seemingly led them into the belly of the mountain.</p>
 <p>There in the middle was a large chasm.</p>
 <p>Their mountain path continued along the edge of the chasm beside the inner wall of the mountain. The path became very narrow, allowing only one person to move along it at a time. It was absolutely impossible for anyone to walk side by side.</p>
 <p>The reason why the four-man team exclaimed was what lay on the opposite side of the chasm.</p>
 <p>Looking down at the chasm revealed that it was bottomless. There on the opposite side of the chasm, about 100 metres away, was another path along the wall. Like theirs, the path was also narrow and steep.</p>
 <p>Just now, when the members from the Demon Faction reached the path along the chasm wall, several figures also emerged from the opposite path.</p>
 <p>It was none other than those people in medieval knight armours.</p>
 <p>A 100-metre chasm separated them. Even so, when they saw each other, a ruckus erupted.</p>
 <p>Several of the knights on the opposite side pulled out their bows. The four-man team reacted by pulling out their guns and aimed them at the opposing party.</p>
 <p>Both sides started shouting in an attempt to deter the other side. Who opened fire first was a mystery, but whizzing sounds rang out as several arrows flew toward them.</p>
 <p>The four-man team quickly retreated. They retreated in a wretched manner back into the cave. Then, the blade-wielding man raised his rifle and opened fire at the knights.</p>
 <p>Tat tat tat…</p>
 <p>The bullets struck the mountain wall on the opposing side, causing stones and gravel to fly out.</p>
 <p>When that happened, Mene and his team quickly retreated back into the cave on their side.</p>
 <p>The two sides quickly entered a stalemate.</p>
 <p>The two paths beside the chasm were so steep and narrow, it was impossible to move about when going through the path. Dodging was even more out of the question.</p>
 <p>At present, the distance separating the two sides were neither too long nor too short. It was possible for either side to attack the other party with long-range weapons. Thus, if this situation were to continue, they could forget about moving forward easily.</p>
 <p>Tian Lie and Nicole went up to the mouth of the cave and spent a few seconds to assess the situation.</p>
 <p>“Who shot first?” Tian Lie asked with a frown.</p>
 <p>The blade-wielding man looked at Tian Lie, but chose to remain silent. His subordinate, the one with the crossbow, spat out. “Those guys shot us first – with arrows.”</p>
 <p>Tian Lie then ignored him and turned to look up front. There was a frown on his face.</p>
 <p>The path along the chasm was around several hundred metres long. After that, the chasm came to an end and the path turned into another cave.</p>
 <p>In other words, while going through these several hundred metres toward their respective caves, both sides would be exposed to the other side’s long-range attacks.</p>
 <p>“What should we do?” the solo participant subconsciously asked.</p>
 <p>The blade-wielding man smiled and said, “What is there to be anxious about? The magic array is already active. Our quest is to just delay them for 30 minutes. If neither side can go forward, that is a good thing for us. Heh!”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, he shot a prideful look at Tian Lie.</p>
 <p>Tian Lie rolled his eyes and said, “Idiot.”</p>
 <p>“What did you say?!”</p>
 <p>Tian Lie sighed. “Are you fellows rookies? Do you not recognize those people on the opposing side? The infamous guild of mad knights from Jerusalem’s holy city. Could something like this trouble them? You fellows have no ability to charge forward, but they most certainly do. If they manage to arrive first at the cave entrance, they can simply leave one person behind to obstruct us through the use of long-range weapons. When that happens, we can forget about advancing.”</p>
 <p>Just as Tian Lie finished speaking, someone from the four-man team shouted in shock, “Ah! What is that?”</p>
 <p>A mounted rider rushed out from the opening of the cave on the opposite side. The snow-white unicorn galloped forward. However, it was not galloping across the narrow path…</p>
 <p>It was galloping across the surface of the mountain wall!</p>
 <p>The mountain wall was 90 degrees up, but the unicorn ran across it as though it was horizontal surface. It appeared to be soaring through the clouds themselves as it charged forward.</p>
 <p>That spectacle stunned the four-man team and it took a moment for them to recollect themselves. One of them pulled out his gun and fired at the rider and the unicorn. However, the unicorn was too fast and the bullets were unable to hit home.</p>
 <p>“We have to rush forward. If we allow them to reach the cave first, we will be trapped here for good,” Natasha promptly shouted. “I will go!”</p>
 <p>After saying that, the young woman took a deep breath and a thick layer of ice formed around her body. Her entire body seemed to be covered by frost. Then, she charged out.</p>
