 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 601 Part 3 Messing With People’s Hearts </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Correct. Unless an Irregularity dies! An Awakened dying likely will not do because they will not be sent to the Recycle Bin after their death. They will remain within the game folder while their extension is changed. So, in order to head to the Recycle Bin, the one to die must be an Irregularity such as you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“But if I die, how can I go save others?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That is why I said, we have a way to help you.” The voice laughed before continuing, “As it so happens, there is this type of item. Simply put, it is something to trick the system… … a prop for faking death.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“A prop for faking death? Where?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Simple. It is in your hands.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… … …” Chen Xiaolian was stunned for a moment. However, he quickly spoke up, “The Lifehymn Music Score?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Exactly, that prop.” The voice laughed out once more and said, “Since that item is with you… you should already know how to use it, right? Store your life inside it, then die. After that comes the crucial part – do not resurrect immediately! Instead, wait!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Wait?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes, wait.” The voice continued. “According to our judgement, after the death of any game participant, the system will initiate an undeclared resolution period for that participant… … how long will that resolution period last, we do not know. However, the purpose of that resolution period is likely for… … err, how should I put it, waiting for resurrection props. The system knows that some participants possess resurrection props. Thus, whenever someone dies, it will not immediately take action to deal with it. Otherwise… … just think about it, an Awakened dies and the system immediately refreshes the dead Awakened to an ordinary human only for the refreshed Awakened’s companions to use a resurrection prop on him or her. Wouldn’t there be chaos?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Thus, the system will initiate an undeclared resolution period. That undeclared resolution period is to await the grace period for resurrection that resurrection props have.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“After the undeclared resolution period is over, it would mean that the grace period for resurrection that resurrection props have is over as well. As no one had chosen to resurrect the dead participant, the system will deal with the situation. Awakened ones will be sent for refresh while Irregularities will be sent to the Recycle Bin… … something like that.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“So, what should I do?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Store your life in the Lifehymn Music Score. Then, go die. However, do not resurrect yourself within the time period specified by the Lifehymn Music Score! Remember, do not let your companions resurrect you. Wait until the time specified by the music score ends. That way, the system will conclude that you are dead and send you to the Recycle Bin.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… wait a minute, if I wait until the time period for resurrection is over, wouldn’t I die for real? No more resurrection?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Ha ha ha! Under normal circumstances, the ‘Lifehymn Music Score’ produced by the system cannot be used in such a manner. Because using it in such a manner would really kill you. What I mean is, the Lifehymn Music Score must be a ‘special version.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Special version?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian was left dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Do you know? The Lifehymn Music Score you have is a product of the system. It is an extremely rare resurrection prop. In terms of rarity, it is even higher up compared to other [S] class props. After all, no matter how rare powerful equipment may be, life remains priceless.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“As far as I can tell, the present number of resurrection-type props created by the system does not exceed three.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Naturally, even though it is extremely rare, you cannot utilize the Lifehymn Music Score to do what I just said earlier. Since it was created by the system, it cannot go against the rules of the system. Thus, the grace period for resurrection cannot exceed the system’s undeclared resolution period. Otherwise, there will be conflicts in executions.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Thankfully, you are quite lucky. You had encountered us.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Oh?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The special version I mentioned is one that can go against the original grace period for resurrection. It is an ‘overclocked’ type. By using unorthodox means, its grace period for resurrection has been prolonged to become much longer than the system’s undeclared resolution period! As long as you write your name on it and die, once you are dead for a period exceeding the system’s undeclared resolution period, you will be sent to the Recycle Bin. As long as you do not remain dead longer than the ‘overclocked grace period’, you can be resurrected! Even though you have been sent to the Recycle Bin, by using it to resurrect yourself, the system will determine that you are still alive. So, it is possible that it will automatically send you back to this game world!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Possible?” asked Chen Xiaolian with a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Of course. Like I said, I have never died before, I have never gone to that place. How could I know? All of these are but our speculations.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“How can I get the special version of this Lifehymn Music Score?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You are lucky, I can modify it.” The voice suddenly laughed out wickedly. Then, it continued, “A pity, if I am not mistaken, the Lifehymn Music Score in your hand is a fragment. Only if you have the whole thing, in other words, the original, can I modify it. Otherwise… …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Hearing that, Chen Xiaolian grew anxious. “How do I get the whole version?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Too simple.” The voice laughed. Its laughter grew increasingly wicked. “I will be honest with you. The Lifehymn Music Score originally belonged to me. Back then, due to special circumstances, that item was damaged and part of it became lost. I do not even know how part of it came into your possession. As it so happens… … the other part is in my hands. You want a whole version of the prop? Simple, just ask me for it.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… … …” Chen Xiaolian gritted his teeth. “I am guessing you are not going to just give it to me, are you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Of course not!” the voice snapped. “You are neither my friend, son, or disciple. I owe you nothing! Why should I just give it to you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… but I had made a wish.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Your wished for a way. We have given you a way. As long as you possess the original, a whole Lifehymn Music Score, I will help you modify it. However, you do not. Thus, I have no obligation to help you find it.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Enough nonsense. Spit it out. What will it take for you to give it to me?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It is very simple, a game. If you win, I will fuse the Lifehymn Music Score back to its wholesome state. Next, following the contents of your wish, I will modify it into the special version.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian sighed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>A game, another bloody game.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Tell me about it.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It is simple. A duel between two parties. You put a bet on one party. If the one you bet on wins, it is your victory.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I don’t mind. But if you just create an [S] class powerhouse, that is just cheating. I will not be able to win.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“This is a game!” The voice grew furious. It continued, “When playing games, the important thing is to have fun, not to win! Cheating to win, is there any meaning to such actions? If there is any meaning in cheating, we would have killed off every one of you long ago! What we seek is entertainment. Thus, for this duel, we will not create an opponent you cannot possibly defeat.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Fine, I will personally fight. Now, who do I have to fight?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No, no, no. You cannot fight.” The voice laughed and said, “You are the one putting the bet, you cannot participate! If you deliberately bet on you losing before throwing the game, that won’t do.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… … …” Chen Xiaolian was speechless – truth be told, he did consider that move.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It is very simple. So many of you have entered this instance dungeon. You choose one of them while I choose another. We will have those two duel each other! How about it?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… … …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As Chen Xiaolian was considering the proposal…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Four curtains of light suddenly appeared before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Group A, there is you, Chen Xiaolian, Hossein. Ah, the two ordinary humans don’t count.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Group B, Soo Soo – by the way, I quite like this cunning little girl. You may send her out. Who knows, due to me liking this little girl, I might send in a weaker opponent for her. Then, there are Nicole, and Tian Lie. I detest this bald guy the most. I would love to see him suffer.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Group C, Phoenix, Sawakita Mitsuo, and Nagase Komi.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After glancing at the three curtains of light, Chen Xiaolian became stunned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He saw that there was actually a Group D.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>A fourth group?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In this instance dungeon, besides those people he knew, there were other strangers as well?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Group D, War Tiger and Wang Sheng.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The voice said nonchalantly, “From what I can gather, the first three groups consist of people you know. You fellows did not even know there was a fourth group. That makes this simple. In order to avoid cheating, you can choose someone you know. As for me, I will choose someone from the fourth group. That way, you will have no way of knowing the other party’s strength. Now that is interesting.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>War Tiger? Wang Sheng?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Those two names were unfamiliar to him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian grew silent.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I… …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As Chen Xiaolian was about to speak up, the voice suddenly spoke out coldly, “Don’t try anything funny. If you are thinking about selecting the weakest one among those you know and bet on that fellow losing, I will have to warn you that this duel is a duel to the death!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian froze.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A duel to the death!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian looked at the four screens before him and took a deep breath.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>No matter who he chose… … someone must die.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He inhaled, a grim look on his face. “There is no way to around it. Since someone has to die, I cannot allow my companions or friends to die!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian pondered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He had first excluded Nicole and Tian Lie.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His reasoning was simple. Nicole was a Floating Angel from the Angel Corps while Tian Lie was stronger than her…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However… there will always be a higher mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As this was a duel to the death, Chen Xiaolian had excluded the two of them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was not that he did not have faith in their strength, rather…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>They were both Irregularities.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After dying, they will not be resurrected.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Resurrecting Qiao Qiao was already proving to be a herculean task. If either Tian Lie or Nicole were to die… … only Heaven knew how much more difficult it would be.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Naturally, he had also excluded Soo Soo.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Hossein… … he possessed a great deal of power…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>But...</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian had no understanding of his power. He was unable to determine if Hossein could win.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As for Nagase Komi, she possessed quite a decent amount of strength. However, she was still not good enough.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sawakita Mitsuo was also quite strong, but…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Then, Chen Xiaolian suddenly thought of something.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>During the third stage, why did the master of this place choose Phoenix to act as the gatekeeper?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The master here did now know that Chen Xiaolian would be the one to fight in the third stage.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Therefore, the master chose Phoenix not because he or she wanted to mess around with others by having him fight a battle of life and death against a friend.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Instead…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Instead…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The likely scenario was: The master of this place judged that, among the group of three, consisting of Phoenix, Sawakita Mitsuo, and Nagase Komi… … the strongest among them was Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The master of this place could not choose a weaker one because that would result in him or her losing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Choosing one that will win was a must.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Thus, it was necessary to choose the strongest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Having reached that line of thought, Chen Xiaolian decided. However, as he was about to speak up, his heart gave a thump.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>With a pale expression, he raised his head and said with a sigh. “I’m not choosing!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What did you say?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I said. I am not choosing!” Chen Xiaolian clenched his fists. “I am not choosing! I do not want your Lifehymn Music Score fragment! I don’t want it!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Why?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It is very simple. I really want to resurrect a companion of mine who had died because she is not only my companion, she is also my girlfriend. However… … me loving her, that is my personal business. Morality or conscience wise, I have no right to send another friend to their death for the sake of resurrecting my girlfriend! Something so unprincipled and despicable, I cannot do it.” Pausing, Chen Xiaolian then said, “Likewise, it is also the same for the two strangers. I have no grudge against them. To potentially kill an innocent person to save my girlfriend… … I cannot do it.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… … understood,” the voice replied coldly. “If that is the case, you may leave. I can send you out of this instance dungeon. At any rate, you completed this game. I suppose it is a clear.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“All right, when can we leave? My companions… …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I said: You may leave. Because you have cleared this game. Your companions, on the other hand… … they did not!” The voice laughed and continued, “Do you think we are doing charity work here? To be so kind-hearted? Just because you alone managed to clear the game, you think I would allow the others to leave? What kind of good dream are you having? Next, your companions and friends will have to continue going through the test. However, I will have to be honest with you… … it is likely that none of them will be able to leave this place alive.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… … …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Why is that? It is as we have said earlier. Since the day we occupied this instance dungeon, you are the first to clear it. You do not need to participate in the next test, but not them. In the colosseum, they will continue killing… … furthermore, that battle you had with Phoenix was very interesting. However, I believe there is no way you could write everyone’s name in the Lifehymn Music Score. For those who remain, I might just have them kill each other, just like you and Phoenix… in the end, at least half of them must die. Ah, right. There is an even more interesting test after that… …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… you bastard!” Chen Xiaolian snapped out furiously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Actions through the mouth is the weakest action.” The voice snickered and said, “However, I can… …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… … …” Chen Xiaolian’s chest heaved up and down. “You can what?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“We can add a game between us. If you win, not only will I grant you the version of Lifehymn Music Score you want, I will also give everyone the clear status! However, if you lose… …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The voice took on a different tone. “You stay! Stay in this instance dungeon forever and accompany us! Deal or no deal?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian was momentarily at a loss for words. “For you to force me to such a corner, why?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Because I am a bad person! Because I love messing with people’s hearts! Gyah ha ha ha ha ha!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Within another space, two voices were conversing with one another.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You really plan on giving him the special version of the music score?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Why?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Simple. Back then, that fellow took my music score to go save Bai Qi, but… … the two of them disappeared, never to return. Now, I am very curious to know if this kid could do it.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If that is the case, must you force him to this wager? Is there any meaning to messing around with him?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Naturally, when going for the main course, it is necessary to add seasoning to increase the flavour.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
