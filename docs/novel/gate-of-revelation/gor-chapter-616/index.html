 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 616 Bluesea &nbsp;</strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Take good care of them. Tell me what you know about me after I return.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After saying that, Bluesea left. He did not look back at all, leaving Chen Xiaolian alone beside the door to the convenience store. Chen Xiaolian stood there, watching Bluesea’s back as he slowly disappeared from sight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Mr Bluesea, someone like you, how could someone like you… … die?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The door to the convenience store behind him opened up and the three people began moving the loaded baskets outside. They were slightly surprised to see Chen Xiaolian standing alone outside.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian looked at them. Without waiting for them to ask any questions, he moved to the side and sat down. Lighting himself another piece of cigarette, he said, “Bluesea went to get a truck. I am here to protect you fellows. Load up the SUV first.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The three of them exchanged glances and nodded without saying anything. Yang Lin drove the SUV to the door and the three of them proceeded to adjust down the back seats and slid open the doors. Next, they began loading up the supplies into the SUV.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian simply smoked his cigarettes without helping out or conversing with the three of them. It did not take long for the back of the SUV to be fully loaded with food supplies. The two seats at the front were the only exception.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Their surroundings remained quiet, bereft of any other movements. However, Bluesea had yet to return.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Much of the supplies they brought out from the convenience store remained unloaded and they all waited for Bluesea to return with the truck. However, as time ticked, his three companions grew anxious.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Back in the underground parking garage, they had seen Chen Xiaolian use the blade to block the monsters’ flame attack. Although they did not bear witness to him slaying the monsters, they knew very well that this youngster was similar to the ones who had tried to kill them, men with extraordinary abilities. Thus, despite knowing that Chen Xiaolian was there to protect them, they felt a gulf between them and Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The four of them split to two parties as they waited at the convenience store’s entrance and none of them spoke at all. In the silence, the atmosphere gradually became increasingly awkward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Excellent.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After making his way past two blocks, Bluesea finally found a minivan by the road.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Using the butt of his rifle, he broke the window of the driver’s seat, causing the car alarm to ring out loudly. Bluesea quickly sat on the driver’s seat, pulled open the cover for the wiring and hot-wired the minivan.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As Bluesea was about to turn the minivan around, he gave his surroundings a glance. Then, his eyes abruptly lit up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Not too far away, somewhere within the next block, was a large NYPD sign.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>NYPD, the New York Police Department’s headquarters.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Almost all of the high-rise buildings in Manhattan were office buildings and there were only a few hotels and shops. At that moment, all navigation devices could no longer work. Thus, even if there were a few gun shops in Manhattan, they would not be able to find those stores easily.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Needless to say, gun control in New York was far stricter compared to the other states in America. Additionally, compared to the people in places like Texas, the people in New York were less interested in guns. Even if they did find a gun shop in Manhattan, the quality and quantity of guns and ammunition there may be inferior compared to the ones in their little town.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>With Chen Xiaolian guarding the convenience store, Bluesea could feel at ease regarding the safety of Yang Lin and the others. Although his location was not exactly very far away from the convenience store, transporting of supplies could take some time as well. Thus, rather than going back to meet up with them before coming here together, he felt it would be better for him to replenish his ammunition reserves. At the very least, he could explore the place first.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After having made up his mind, Bluesea turned the minivan toward the NYPD building.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There were more vehicles on the street there and they were more cluttered. The vehicles were practically obstructing half the street. However, at that moment, there was no need for Bluesea to observe any traffic laws. He simply sent the minivan forward, knocking away the vehicles in his path before stopping before the building.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The New York Police Department in Park Row should have been the most secure place in all of Manhattan Island. At present, though, it was empty, completely lacking of human existence. Bluesea gave a light push, easily opening the building’s large glass door.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It would appear that all of its security system would no longer work due to the power outage.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After entering, Bluesea came to the lobby area. One of the chairs at the front desk had been turned over. Likewise, there was a knocked over cup of coffee at the edge of the front desk.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea quickly walked around the lobby and finally found the signboard indicating the different police departments for the building beside the elevator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was strange. In this world, any spoken words, be it in English, French, or even the German language spoken by Grace, Bluesea could understand them and even converse with those people. However, once those words were written down on a piece of paper, he would be unable to understand them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Naturally, there was no way a police department in America would have Chinese characters on their signboard. Bluesea could only use his shallow understanding of English to slowly and laboriously figure out each word.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Patrol Services Department, first floor…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Collaborative Operations Department, second floor…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>An unknown department, third floor…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Traffic Management department, fourth floor…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Counter-terrorism department, fifth floor…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>That’s it!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea finally found what he was looking for.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>For any police station, their Counter-terrorism department must have the best and most powerful firearms.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing that the elevator was unusable, Bluesea did not waste time there. After looking around for a bit, he ran toward the building’s staircase.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although he no longer possessed an enhanced body, Bluesea was still an elite soldier. He made his way up the staircase in twos and threes, reaching the fifth floor in less than one minute.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The building was of the ‘</span><span>回</span><span>’ shape and the staircase that Bluesea took was located at the corner of the building. After pushing open the door before him, he saw a corridor laid out before him. There were rooms on either side of the corridor.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As Bluesea’s mastery of English was not good enough, he did not stop to slowly try to read the words on the signs. There was not enough time for that anyway. He simply pushed open the doors and peeked inside to check them one by one.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The first few rooms were ordinary offices. There were only the normal furnishing and documents in the rooms, no weapons. It was only after he pushed open the fifth door did Bluesea find what he was looking for.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was something similar to a dressing room. Two rows of changing lockers lined the sides of the room. At the end of the row of lockers was an explosion-proof door.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Despite Bluesea’s level of English, one glance was all he needed to make out the words ‘Weapons Storage Room’ on the door.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Clearly, this was the equipment room for the rapid reaction forces. The changing lockers on either side were there for the officers to get into their gears. As for the explosion-proof door, it must be filled with weapons.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea quickly stepped forward to pull open the explosion-proof door. Unfortunately, the door was locked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea sighed to himself. However, he had already expected that. Even in the case of a power outage, the door leading to the armoury must surely not be easy to access. It was that important of a place.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He then looked at the door. There was a safe dial, a card terminal, and a unique looking keyhole on its surface. There was no way for him to know what the combinations were for the safe dial. As for the card terminal, there was no power at the moment. Thus, the safe dial and card terminal were out of the question for him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>On the other hand, there was no way he could pick the lock for this type of explosion-proof door.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After giving the keyhole a glance, Bluesea hastily made his way out of the equipment room. After that, he turned and rushed toward the end of the corridor.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There lay the biggest office on the floor.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although he did not understand the words written on the door, there was no need for Bluesea to care. Be it in China or America, the office for the leaders must certainly be the largest one.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>No matter how few keys there may be, there will certainly be one with the leader.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was no need for Bluesea to exert much effort to search for the key. After bursting into the office, he saw it. There on the table, covered by glass, was a stand. A string of keys hung upon the stand. At the bottom of the glass cover was another keyhole. The glass cover was tightly affixed upon the surface of the table.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This time, there was no longer any need for Bluesea to go look for another key. Raising up his assault rifle, he opened fire, breaking the glass cover.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Taking the keys, he returned to the equipment room. On his fifth attempt, Bluesea finally managed to open up the explosion-proof door.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Beyond the door, rows after rows of guns could be seen on one side, all sorted out orderly from top to bottom. Everything was there, submachine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>On the other side of the room were several cabinets containing various bullet magazines. There were also unopened boxes of ammunition inside. Additionally, it also contained the devices used by SWAT: battering rams, plastic explosives, night-vision goggles, etc.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea also found two police use MM-1 40mm semi-automatic grenade launcher, equipped with ammunition for explosions and tear gas.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There were too many equipment in the room. There was no way for Bluesea to transport them all quickly. After a moment’s consideration, Bluesea found an empty box and filled it with two sniper rifles, a grenade launcher, and the necessary ammo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea carried the heavy box down to the first floor and loaded it up into the minivan before starting it up. He planned to return to the convenience store to meet up with the others first before coming here again to transport the rest. However, as he was just starting up the minivan, he heard a roaring engine sound coming from afar.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea’s heart immediately grew tense.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was unlikely for Chen Xiaolian and the others to come meet up with him. If so, who else could be driving around within the city?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The minivan had just begun to move forward when Bluesea abruptly slammed his foot down on the brake. Next, he turned off the engine and lowered down his seat. He laid his entire body down horizontally.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At almost the same time, a highly futuristic, tank-like vehicle swerved into the street from a junction behind Bluesea’s position. Bluesea was able to see it thanks to the minivan’s rear-view mirror. The tank barrelled its way toward him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
