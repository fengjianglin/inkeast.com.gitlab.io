 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Let’s go.” Gabriel stretched his hand out toward Cheng Cheng. “Let’s go see what our old friend has found.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What is this supposed to mean?” asked Cheng Cheng with a frosty tone. Her brows were knitted as she looked at Gabriel’s outstretched hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was a puzzled expression on Gabriel’s face and he said, “Go find Shen, of course. Surely, you aren’t planning on first exiting this instance dungeon, then fly to Moscow from Romania to enter through that room, do you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Cheng Cheng looked at Gabriel. “You did something to the dagger?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No, on the bald kiddo.” Gabriel shook his head pridefully. “Just a minor teleportation point. He didn’t even know about it. When we suddenly appear before him, he will surely get shocked.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Why did you do that? Did you already figure out that I will choose to leave this place with you and go to Thirty-three Heavens back then?” asked Cheng Cheng coldly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“There is that possibility. However, even if not used for that, there is no harm in being well-prepared, no?” Gabriel shrugged his shoulders. “Enough nonsense. Do you want to go or not? Right now, Shen… … may have already reached the Longevity Palace.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Hearing Shen’s name, Cheng Cheng’s pupils suddenly contracted. Then, with a harsh-sounding harrumph, she extended her hand to grab Gabriel’s hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Did you think I want to touch you…” Gabriel mumbled. Next, the two of them disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Shen.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie looked at Shen, who was about to step into the chaotic maelstrom, and suddenly spoke up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What is it?” Shen turned to look at Tian Lie openly. “Surely… … you are not planning on stopping me, are you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“My ass.” Tian Lie pursed his lips to the side. “Didn’t I tell you earlier? I am only here to check up on you. Since you are all right, what else is there for me to care about?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Good, then.” Shen nodded his head. “I… … am going. Do you have anything else you want to say to me?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“There is just one issue.” Tian Lie swept his hand over his bald head with a smile. “Do you plan on keeping this girl frozen like this?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I had actually forgotten.” Shen looked at Nicole, who was lying behind Tian Lie, before turning his gaze back to Tian Lie. Then, he smiled. “You sure know how to play the good guy. Fine, if you can guarantee that she will not obstruct me, I can release her first.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Given her level of strength, even if she wants to obstruct you, she would not be able to,” answered Tian Lie with a laugh.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen nodded. Without any movements on his part, Nicole felt the hold over her body loosen. Her muscles, which had gone stiff earlier, regained their ability to move.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nicole slowly got up. Before she could do anything, Tian Lie’s hand patted her shoulder to press heavily upon her. “Stupid girl, don’t forget what I told you earlier.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nicole turned to look at Tian Lie’s hand, which was pressing down on her shoulder. Slowly, she nodded her head. Then, after inhaling deeply, she said toward Shen, “You didn’t kill everyone in Zero City, did you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No. I did not choose the path of carnage,” said Shen coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If so, where are they now?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Have you ever seen a prey tell the hunter where it is running off to?” Shen shrugged lightly. “I am not the one who opened up the escape portal. How could I know where it leads to?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nicole grew silent. Shen’s answer sounded reasonable.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“In other words, you should know the answer to that, right?” Tian Lie suddenly turned to look at Zero. “Regardless of who had opened the escape portal, it will have to go through you, the administrator.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yes, I do know where the survivors of Zero City were sent to.” Zero nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Why didn’t you say anything before this?” Tian Lie rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Because you never asked. However… … even if you did, I am not obligated to answer.” Zero shook his head and continued, “Do not forget, you two do not possess the authority to give me commands.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nicole knitted her brows.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Enough. This is the little Angel’s matter. Just let her handle it herself.” Shen interrupted their conversation. “Well, then. I will be going.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Although I know you are in a hurry, I do want to ask you one more thing. When you said you will be ‘going’, what do you mean by that?” asked Tian Lie with a sigh. “You are a Player. You originally live in the Upper Plane. Where else can you go?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Don’t ask.” Shen shook his head gently and was about to step forward when his eyes suddenly glinted sharply.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That is right, Shen. Where are you going? Come tell us about it.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Two figures holding each other’s hands suddenly appeared behind Tian Lie.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Gabriel?” Shen turned around with a frown and regarded the youngster in punk outfit and the red-haired woman beside him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Do you only recognize Gabriel?” Cheng Cheng scoffed, her eyes glaring right at Shen. “Have you forgotten even my name? If I am not mistaken, you had just gone through my stage, hadn’t you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Cheng Cheng…” said Shen with a soft sigh. However, her name was all he said and he said nothing else.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Hey! Why are you gripping so hard!” Gabriel pushed Cheng Cheng’s hand away before dramatically holding his hand before him as he blew on it. “It hurts!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Cheng Cheng ignored Gabriel’s attempt at being funny. Instead, she stared at Shen, a sharp and icy stare. “You killed me just now.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That was not you. That was just your doppelganger.” Shen revealed a wry smile and shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Enough with your pointless play with words.” Cheng Cheng snorted. “Since you had seen her, you should know that she is not just my doppelganger. Additionally, you have a better method of getting through the stage. However, you chose not to do so.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“And?” Shen sighed. “Since I did not answer her question, have you come here to personally ask me once again?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Sorry, right now, I have no interest in finding out the answer.” Cheng Cheng sneered. “I have only one objective for coming here.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Light shone out and two phantom blades appeared within her hands.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Kill you!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Hey! Are you just going to start attacking just like this?” Gabriel was shocked and he quickly jumped backward. “At least let Shen say a few words.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Now that it has come to this, what else is there to say?” Cheng Cheng snapped icily, a sneer on her face. The two Dimensional Rip Blades swung forward, one following the other, as they slashed down at Shen.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Two blurry-looking silhouettes were left behind along the blade trails, looking much like the chaotic maelstrom surrounding the Oddity.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Shen dared not use his bare hands to confront the two Dimensional Rip Blades in Cheng Cheng’s hands. Thus, he could only choose to dodge.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, in Cheng Cheng’s hands, the Dimensional Rip Blades became like maggots sticking onto a skeleton and they were constantly moving in pursuit of Shen.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The moment Cheng Cheng swung out her blades, her figure suddenly became soft and springy. It did not look like she was the one swinging the Dimensional Rip Blades. Instead, it looked as though the Dimensional Rip Blades were flying about in the air while she was simply carried along by the flying blades.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Gabriel sighed and shook his head. Crossing his arms upon his chest, he simply watched as both Cheng Cheng and Shen got into a fight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing Gabriel stay out of the fight, Nicole became puzzled and she whispered out, “You… … are not going to help? Aren’t you two companions?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Companions my ass! That violent woman…” Gabriel turned to look at Nicole before rolling his eyes. “Do you know how long we have been staying in the instance dungeon together? I have long since gotten sick of her. The fact that I am not helping Shen beat her up is already an act of affection on my part! Besides…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Gabriel turned to look at Cheng Cheng, who kept brandishing her Dimensional Rip Blades at Shen and said, “The two of them are well matched anyways. Neither one can kill the other. Let them have at it first. It won’t be too late for me to go persuade them after they are tired.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Well matched?” Nicole hesitated for a moment before pointing toward the distant crater on the jade white passageway. “That fellow… … do you know him?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Gabriel turned and saw the exhausted Chris there. A slight look of shock appeared on his face. “Eh… … why is he here?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Gabriel’s feet kicked the ground and he instantly landed before Chris. Next, he crouched down and said, “Was Shen the one who beat you up to such a degree?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Sir Gabriel?” Chris wheezed, labouring to open his mouth and he whispered, “Sir Shen, he… … not the same.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Not the same?” Gabriel frowned. “What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chris jerked his right arm up to point at his waist.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There, an armour fragment could be seen, radiating a faint light.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Gabriel inspected it in detail for a moment before suddenly widening his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Moon… … Moonless Fivefold Light Armour?!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“… enough! Cheng Cheng, I have no time to continue messing around with you like this!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The two Dimensional Rip Blades slashed about around Shen’s figure. Every swing of the blades would leave a rip in space.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The expression on Shen’s face was more serious compared to when he was facing Chris. Not only did he not dare to use his hands to take on the Dimensional Rip Blades, he dared not even get close to the blade trails left by the two blades.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even so, he had only evaded her attacks without fighting back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As for Cheng Cheng, she did not stop at all. “Why aren’t you fighting back, Shen!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I don’t want to fight you.” Shen’s figure was like a leaf, fluttering in the wind. He would evade every one of Cheng Cheng’s attacks by only a hair’s breadth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Don’t want to? You just killed part of me! And now! You! Are! Telling! Me! You! Don’t! Want! To?!” Cheng Cheng gnashed her teeth, sending out a slash with her Dimensional Rip Blades every time she uttered out a word.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Like I said! That is not you!” said Shen with a frown.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That is me!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If you insist on that…” said Shen with a soft sigh.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Every time the Dimensional Rip Blades slashed out, they would leave behind a blade trail that would remain for a long time around the two of them. At that moment, Shen’s body seemingly became without a skeletal structure as he slipped past all the blade trails. Then, his right hand pressed down on Cheng Cheng’s chest area.</span></p>
