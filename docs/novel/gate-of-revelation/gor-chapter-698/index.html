 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After two hours, Chen Xiaolian finally finished informing the rest of the team about what happened back in World’s End.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“In other words… … the opponent we have to face is the equivalent of Bai Qi from the Mausoleum of Qin Shihuang instance dungeon?” After having heard Chen Xiaolian’s explanation, Roddy revealed a bitter smile. “A fellow at that level is going to be hard to deal with!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No.” Chen Xiaolian shook his head. Sweeping his gaze through the faces of his teammates, he said, “We will be siding with Zhao Yun.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Huh?” Roddy was the first to jump to his feet. “Xiaolian, are you joking?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I am not.” Chen Xiaolian shook his head. “Qiao Qiao was brought here by Zhao Yun from World’s End. It is very likely that she will be on the same side as Zhao Yun, transformed into NPCs of the same faction within the instance dungeon. Since our objective is to rescue Qiao Qiao, it is essentially the opposite of our quest objective. Not to mention, Sister Yun had fought by my side back in World’s End. If not for her, I would have died back then. There would have been no chance for me to bring Qiao Qiao back. Besides, when I left World’s End, I had promised her to go look for her. I cannot kill off a former comrade-in-arms of mine.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Principle wise, I support the Guild Leader’s decision.” Lun Tai was silent for a moment before slowly speaking up, “At present, however, we cannot be certain of what will happen within the instance dungeon. Thus, I have a few more questions to ask.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Firstly, while Zhao Yun, the final BOSS of the instance dungeon, must undoubtedly be very strong, the system has assembled all the Awakened ones within a radius of 1,000 km to participate in this instance dungeon. Given these numbers, I feel that the amount of strength on the participants’ side is higher. It is too risky for us to be going against every one of the participants.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Secondly, Guild Leader had lost Skyblade’s power back in World’s End. Although you remain as our guild’s strongest powerhouse, your strength is at most between [A] class to [A+] class right now. Back in Jerusalem, when Guild Leader’s strength was still at the quasi-[S] class, all of us were still nearly wiped out. Thus, our present situation is not looking good.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Thirdly, the information given in the system prompt earlier was too brief. We still do not have a clear grasp of what will happen in the instance dungeon. We also do not know what the rewards and punishments are. If we cannot complete the quest in the end, what type of punishment awaits all the participants? Getting thrown into a punishment-type instance dungeon is all right. However, what if the system chooses to select our guild members at random and exterminate them as punishment? Worse, what if it chooses to exterminate everyone as punishment? What should we do then?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After Lun Tai was finished talking, Chen Xiaolian nodded toward Lun Tai with a smile. “A detailed consideration. Lun Tai, you are looking more like a Deputy Guild Leader.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“So, what is your opinion on it, Guild Leader?” Lun Tai turned to face Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian considered the issues at hand for a moment before speaking up. “Firstly, I do not think that the participants have the higher amount of power. For the system to arrange so many participants for the instance dungeon, it means that the system is not too confident that Zhao Yun could be killed. Unlike Bai Qi’s case, the system is making an irregular response to Zhao Yun’s departure from World’s End. It is thus highly likely that Zhao Yun had been able to maintain much more of her power when she came over. Thus, the system had detected it. As for Zhao Yun’s power…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Having said that, Chen Xiaolian raised his head to reveal a wry smile. “Do you know how terrified I feel when I saw her instant killing an [S] class?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After a pause, Chen Xiaolian continued, “Besides, our objective is not to openly fight the other participants. Since the system has not notified the existence of a second faction, the other participants will likely not consider the possibility of someone siding with the quest target. We simply need to secretly disrupt the other participants’ plans, stopping them from completing their quest. For example, meeting up with Zhao Yun and Qiao Qiao in advance and figuring out a method of bringing them out from the instance dungeon. In the most ideal case, it may be possible for us to completely avoid fighting the participants.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What has me concerned most is: what kind of quest will the system arrange for us after we enter the instance dungeon? If we fail to complete the quest, there will likely be a punishment. However, I do not believe the system would kill off every single participant for failing to complete the quest. We are talking about every Awakened within a radius of 1,000 km here. The number of participants is likely more than a thousand!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Your analysis of the situation makes sense.” Lun Tai slowly nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“At the end of the day, though, this is simply a general speculation. For a more detailed plan, we will need to wait until after we have entered the instance dungeon. Next up is the preparation time. Firstly, Roddy, after this meeting is over, quickly go to the secret sites for Awakened ones and check up on any discussion regarding this issue. An area within a 1,000 km radius means a considerable portion of China itself. Not to mention, this is the most developed and densely populated area. For everyone within this area to receive the system prompt of participation, the internet must be blowing up right now.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Understood.” Roddy snapped his fingers.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Xia Xiaolei, Bei Tai, the two of you are responsible for making an inventory of our existing supply reserves. After that, sort out the supplies that we have in our possession and decide what else we need to purchase from the system and whatnot. I have a feeling that this instance dungeon might be a lengthy battle. We must have ample supply of healing substances.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Affirmative, Guild Leader!” Xia Xiaolei nodded his head vigorously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Once the preparations are complete, we will set off immediately to head to the instance dungeon area.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“So fast?” Roddy knitted his brows. “We still have three days before the instance dungeon opens. With the Tidal Fighter, we can reach the place in just a few hours’ time. Is there a need for us to head there with such urgency? Many participants will be arriving one after another before the instance dungeon opens. I know that the system had stated that all the participants will be on the same faction and conflicts over the quest will not erupt. Even so, with so many participants gathered together, there is no way to guarantee that nothing will happen.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You are wrong. It is the opposite.” Chen Xiaolian slowly shook his head. “It is precisely because there is no competition between participants that I feel we can make contact with some other participants before entering the instance dungeon. Considering the details given in the system prompt, anyone with half a brain will know that this will be a difficult battle. Even if there are any grudges between the participants there, they will have to put down their grudges for now.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“All right. Your words make sense.” Roddy considered it for a moment before nodding.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Enough. Everyone, go handle your respective tasks.” Chen Xiaolian stood up from the chair. “Soo Soo, come with me.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Soo Soo calmly stood up and followed Chen Xiaolian out of the room.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Walking through the corridor, Chen Xiaolian then pushed open a door leading into an empty room. Going inside, he then sat down on the sofa inside the room before pointing at the sofa placed before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Soo Soo sat down gently and placed both palms on her chin as she displayed a lovely smile. “Xiaolian oppa, you… … what do you want to talk to me about?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Why are you staying outside so long this time?” Chen Xiaolian, too, revealed a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What do you mean long, Xiaolian oppa?! You are the one who brought me to Romania!” Soo Soo pouted her lips to display an aggrieved expression. “After you went to World’s End, Roddy only let me stay there for a few days before quickly coming back! I am just a little girl who cannot even pilot the Tidal Fighter. Can I return by myself?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Stop pretending. You know I am not talking about that.” Chen Xiaolian’s brows were slightly furrowed. “Soo Soo’s main personality. Are you not planning to let her out?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Soo Soo lowered her head. Reaching out with her hand to twirl the hair on her forehead, she said, “You… … noticed, Xiaolian oppa?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You didn’t try particularly hard to hide it. I am not blind as well.” Chen Xiaolian smiled. “Is it irregular for me to notice it?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That is right. Because… … Xiaolian oppa, I am unwilling to deceive you.” Soo Soo’s black pupils stared at Chen Xiaolian. “So, you don’t want to see me?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian was taken aback. He then revealed a wry smile as he did not know how to answer the question.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although she was the second personality, this dark loli before him was also Soo Soo.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Unlike those with multiple personality disorders, the difference between Soo Soo’s second personality and her main personality was not too big.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The second personality possessed the same set of memories as the main personality. In fact, they even shared part of their emotions. Even though she would display a cold attitude most of the time, she would still address him as ‘Xiaolian oppa’.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Assuming Chen Xiaolian’s judgement was correct, since returning from Jerusalem, the one in control of Soo Soo’s body was always the second personality. However, since going to Romania and entering the vampire instance dungeon, the atmosphere Chen Xiaolian felt from her was no longer that of the cold dark loli of the past. Rather, he felt a slight change in her.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Xiaolian oppa, answer me oh.” Soo Soo smiled as she looked at Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I… … it is not that I do not want to see you.” Chen Xiaolian carefully considered his words before slowly saying, “The way I see it, be it you or the main personality, the both of you are Soo Soo, my guild member. And also, Qiao Qiao’s little sister. I am worried that something bad might happen if you keep this up.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He looked directly at Soo Soo, a concerned expression on his face. “After all, you are not the main personality. I am uncertain if any harm would come to her… … to you two if you continue to control the body.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“So, Xiaolian oppa is worried about Soo Soo?” Soo Soo pursed her lips to form a grin. “However… … there is no need for you to worry about this. Soo Soo is so smart. Why would I hurt myself? Besides… don’t you think that it will be somewhat more beneficial for Xiaolian oppa if I am the one controlling this body for now?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Beneficial?” Chen Xiaolian tilted his head slightly. “Why do you say that?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Because… … the cute little Soo Soo is truly unsuited for combat oh! Although we share the same body and skill, she… … is just too weak.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian smiled wryly, not saying anything in response.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The dark loli Soo Soo was right. Given her character, that loveable and naïve Soo Soo was indeed incapable of being a competent combatant.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Soo Soo possessed a very powerful skill. However, many times in the previous instance dungeons, she had not been able to properly display her full combat power. The few times that she had unleashed her power were only possible due to her reaching an aggravated state, resulting in the second personality taking over.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Soo Soo jumped down from the sofa and slowly walked to stand before Chen Xiaolian. She then crouched down partially, placing her head on Chen Xiaolian’s thigh as she looked up at him. “Xiaolian oppa, when I have done what I need to do, I will return control over this body back to her. However, right now… it is still not the time to do so. Next up, we need to go rescue Qiao Qiao unnie. Do you hope to have a Soo Soo that needs your protection beside you or a Soo Soo that can help you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian was silent for a moment before nodding his head. “I… understand. You are right. However, you need to promise that this will not harm the two of you at all.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Soo Soo stood up and tilted her head, a gentle smile on her face. “Don’t worry, Xiaolian oppa. Although I am a different personality, I… … am also Soo Soo.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
