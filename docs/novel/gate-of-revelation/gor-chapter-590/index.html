 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bloodclan?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Hearing the word coming out from Hossein’s mouth, Chen Xiaolian instantly knitted his brows.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Just now, in the basement of the castle, he had picked up the so-called nails of the Bloodclan Primogenitor, which had turned out to be a one-time consumable weapon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>And now, in this forest, he had encountered this Bloodclan once more?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“They are just some low-ranking members of the Bloodclan. They cannot be considered adults just yet. Just some small blood-sucking bats, humph.” Hossein moved to the side where there was a bucket of water. He cleaned his hands and said, “Still, they are very annoying. Although low-ranking Bloodclan members’ combat powers are only so-so, their bite is poisonous.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You seem to know a lot about these things.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That is because I was once a holy knight.” There was a tone of derision in Hossein’s voice and he continued, “It depends on the attribute of powers. I am a member of the Light Faction while the Bloodclan is a member of the Dark Faction. I had confronted the Bloodclan in some of the instance dungeons I participated in.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian frowned. “Attribute of powers can affect the instance dungeons?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Hossein turned to give Chen Xiaolian a glance and pondered his question for a moment before replying, “There are some. Generally speaking, the system will prioritize the attribute of the participants’ powers when tossing them into certain roles within the instance dungeon storyline. Take me for example. I was once a holy knight of the holy and light attribute. Thus, I would often be sent into instance dungeons where there are forces of darkness and matched up against them. The monsters I face inside those instance dungeons are also often of the darkness attribute. For example, the Bloodclan, demons, etc. I have also met werewolves before.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian processed the information for a moment and said, “So… … what happens if a guild has members with complex mix of attributes? For example, my guild; there are those of the light attribute and also those of the darkness attribute. What would happen then?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Hossein smiled wryly and replied, “I am uncertain. However, I believe they will bring about certain effects. As to how the system makes the categorizations, I am uncertain. This is something that everyone is exploring through personal experience.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian sighed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>No wonder.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Forces of darkness have always been prevalent in the instance dungeons he had gone through before.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>For example, the death-type creatures he faced in the Mausoleum of Qin Shihuang instance dungeon, the vengeful spirits (Jack the Ripper) that he faced in the London instance dungeons, the demon in the Jerusalem instance dungeon… …</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>All in all, it was likely due to the heavy influence of the holy and light attribute powers of his guild.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was no need to go into detail about Soo Soo. No matter how you look at it, her Blazing Phoenix was an existence of the light attribute.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As for his own skill, the name ‘Goddess of Dawn’ alone revealed that it is one from the orthodox path.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The only one with the darkness attribute was Qiao Qiao’s ‘Child of Darkness’. Generally speaking, however, there were more holy and light attributes in his guild. Thus, they would always have to confront creatures of darkness.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The two of them then checked the interior and exterior of the wooden cabin. After that, they comforted the two females and continued staying in the wooden cabin – it was still late at night after all. Given how dark it was outside, giving up a place with roof and walls to go out into the forest, where they will have to face the creatures of darkness, the Bloodclan, was not a wise move.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In this matter, Hossein had more authority. As for Chen Xiaolian, he was willing to accept Hossein’s proposal.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Due to the night attack, however, the two women were no longer able to fall asleep. Thus, the four of them simply sat before the fireplace as they waited for morning to come.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>No more night attacks came. From all appearances, it would seem that nothing would happen until dawn.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When dawn arrived, rays from the morning light pierced through the treetops, improving the visibility and illumination within the forest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian walked forward to open the door leading outside. He had just taken a glance outside when his face suddenly twisted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Hossein! Hurry, come here and look. There is something on the ground outside!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The great flames raged on as it rapidly devoured the forest – appearance wise, the flames were engulfing the forest at a rate that was far too fierce. It seemed as though the forest did not consist of trees, but paper. Otherwise, there was no way the flames could spread this quickly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even the young Soo Soo noted that the rate at which the flames was spreading was too outrageous.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In the end, as the flames were growing even bigger, as it appeared on the verge of spreading out even further, a growl of thunder reverberated out from up above. Next, winds blew and clouds converged. Great stretches of dark clouds converged up in the sky. They grew increasingly dense until, finally… a clap of thunder broke out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Next, rain poured down heavily.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Due to the heavy rain, the flames spreading through the forest were quickly extinguished. Tian Lie laughed. Pointing up at the sky, he said, “I knew it! You fellows don’t have the guts to let this senior’s fire keep burning, am I right? Ha ha ha ha!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix laboured to grab a handful of snow and stuffed them into her mouth. She closed her mouth to let the snow melt before swallowing the melted water down her throat, bit by bit.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Her entire body was concealed within the layer of snow on the ground and she remained still.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>All was white within the snow-covered plains. There was seemingly no end to the snow.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix was crouched within the snow and she strained her ears, carefully listening to something amid the whistling wind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Suddenly, a glint of light flashed across her eyes and she hastily ducked her head down. Doing so, her entire body became sprawled down within the thick layer of snow. Even her nose and mouth were covered by the snow.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A few seconds later, a heavy, but muffled noise came from behind Phoenix. There in the snow, three to five tall and white silhouettes appeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Their bodies were as white as the snow and they rose to a height of nearly three-storeys high. Their limbs were thick and their bodies, that were like mountains, were protected by a layer of rocky, armour-like ice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>These silhouettes, which resembled snow monsters, emerged from the snowy plains and moved passed Phoenix. The large foot belonging to one of them nearly stepped down on Phoenix as they moved past her. However, Phoenix did her best to maintain a state of stillness.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The snow monsters had large noses and ears; their pupils appeared almost silver in colour. As they walked, their large noses sniffed the air, as if trying to catch a certain scent.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Then, a snow monster, which had stopped right beside Phoenix, suddenly opened up its palm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A rocky layer of ice covered the back of its palm. However, its palm was a soft and flesh coloured pad. It suddenly spread its palm open. It seemed to possess the functions of a radar and it carefully attempted to detect some sort of signal.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After searching for a moment, the snow monster snorted in disappointment before leaving.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix maintained her motionless state within the snow. It was not until two minutes had passed and the snow monsters were far away from her – they had disappeared into the snowy plains – did Phoenix finally pop her head out from the snow.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The cold had assailed her entire body and all four of her limbs had turned stiff. Even so, she dared not make any excessive movements. Instead, she slowly pulled herself out from the snow. Then, she grabbed another handful of snow and used it to wipe her face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix silently crept through the snowy plains. After moving for roughly more than two hours, she reached a snowy mound that was no more than two metres in height. There, she quickly pulled out a shovel and began digging at the snow before her. It did not take long before an empty hole appeared in the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The hole was a natural-occurring one. To be exact, it was a gap. Beneath the layer of snow were the thick glaciers; there were plenty of such gaps in between the glaciers. Phoenix quickly made her way forward and she quickly reached a less narrow spot.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I am back.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After entering, Phoenix had said those words in a whisper. Two coughs rang out in response.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nagase Komi leaned against the corner within the hole, an energy rifle in her hand. The near-bald girl wore a thick layer of blanket over her body and her face was pale. Her lips had gone blue and she had a downcast look on her face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was one other figure in the hole. This figure lay on the ground. Shockingly, the figure was none other than Sawakita Mitsuo.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This Shogunate Generalissimo appeared to be in a rather bad state.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The old man lay down on his back without moving. Only his chest appeared to be rising slightly as he breathed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The wounds on his body were shocking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A long gash ran down from his left shoulder area to his lower abdomen area on his right. Looking at the wound, it seemed as though he had nearly been cleaved into two. Additionally, some of his ribs were also broken.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Layer after layer of bandages wrapped around his body. Despite that, the bandages were all soaked in blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Did you find anything?” Nagase Komi struggled to get up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No.” The expression on Phoenix’s face was extremely ugly to behold. “I went south for two hours but was unable to see any end to this snowy plain. Also… … the snow monsters seem to be growing in numbers. They seem to be consciously forming teams to look for us.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nagase Komi bit her lip.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix sighed. She retrieved two energy bars from her bosom and handed one over to Nagase Komi.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Eat. Although food is limited, we must maintain our stamina if we are to do battle.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nagase Komi watched as Phoenix bit down on the energy bar. Suddenly, she asked in a low voice, “Say, do you think we have any hope of getting out from this place?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix’s movement came to a momentary halt and she said, “I do not know. The three of us were inexplicably thrown into this weird place. Additionally, those snow monsters are too strong. Their defence is too powerful and unbreakable. Besides, they also have numbers on their side. As for us, we do not have enough supplies. It is very difficult for us to face them head-on. Maybe… … the three of us will die here.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nagase Komi pursed her lips and said, “I wonder… … where Guild Leader Xiaolian is at right now.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Maybe he is somewhere else. This instance dungeon is too weird,” Phoenix said faintly. “These snow monsters we encountered are very special. I have never encountered such a powerful instance dungeon monster. Additionally, it would appear that they possess awareness and intellect. Also… … they could, in the snowy plains, use the temperature to search for us. Just now, I had to throw my entire body into the snow to evade them. If not, I would be unable to return.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nagase Komi swore out in Japanese before slowly saying, “After stepping out from the castle, we ended up here. Then, we were ambushed by so many of those monsters… … teacher was seriously injured as well… … I think, this may be the end of the road for us.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix was silent.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Phoenix-san.” Suddenly, Nagase Komi’s face flickered and she turned to face Phoenix. “I… … have a proposal.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“At present, you are the one with the best state among us three. Teacher is heavily injured and on the verge of dying. I don’t even know how much longer he can last. As for me… … I am also heavily injured. The monsters here are too peculiar. They seem capable of suppressing my powers, stopping me from regenerating. They can also render our healing medicinal substances ineffective… … I think, maybe my teacher and I are destined to fall here. However, you are different. Phoenix-san, you are not injured. You are still alert and your powers are strong. What I want to say is… … if the situation is truly hopeless, you… … don’t bother with the two of us. Go alone. Maybe, you will be able to escape this snowy plain. Having one escape is better than having all three of us dying here.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Despite the youthfulness on Nagase Komi’s face, the expression on her face was one filled with solemnity.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Phoenix’s face sank.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>She lowered her head and pondered for a moment. Then, she raised her head and abruptly took a deep breath. “Do you know? In the last instance dungeon, I encountered many things. I also lost my companions. Since that day… … I swore, no matter what happens, I will never leave any of my companions behind! Thus, those words you just said, I will forget that you ever said that.”</span></p>
