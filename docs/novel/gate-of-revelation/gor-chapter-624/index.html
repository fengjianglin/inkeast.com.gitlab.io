 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 624 Faster? </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You… … what did you just say?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wu Ya stared at Chen Xiaolian with widened eyes, not believing what he had just heard.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He had already forgotten how long ago since someone dared to refuse him in World’s End.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Not only that, just now, he had spent so much time and effort to explain the current situation to this newcomer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The strength that this youngster displayed earlier had truly surprised Wu Ya.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>While he was certain the youngster was no match for him, the youngster’s strength was certainly not bad within World’s End.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Before they could restart the refreshing process for this Recycle Bin, the instance dungeons and Awakened ones will continue arriving. In order to ensure that their clearing speed outnumbers the speed of the arrival, the Coalition required more manpower.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Deiha, who could not even kill off former Awakened ones who had no abilities, was simply trash. Killing someone like him was no big deal. However, killing off this youngster would be a pity.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Do you still not understand what is going on?” Wu Ya narrowed his eyes and glared at Chen Xiaolian. “As long as the Recycle Bin’s clearing mechanism is restored, you will have eternal life here in this World’s End. Here, there will be no change to your body’s data. You will never age, thereby obtaining eternal life. But if the Development Team discovers this irregular situation and switch to manually deal with this situation, all of us will die! You included!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I know.” Chen Xiaolian gave a faint smile and looked at the SUV at the end of the bridge. “But there – is a friend of mine.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Fine.” Wu Ya suppressed his fury and gave one last try. “If so, I will give you preferential treatment. All you need to do is to stay here. I will do the killing.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It has been so long. Just what are they talking about?” Daniel clutched the front passenger’s backrest nervously as he looked through the window at the bridge.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That is right! They were clearly fighting just now! Why did they suddenly stop? They… … could they be joining up?” Grace mumbled in a hushed tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Wouldn’t it be better if things could be solved through a negotiation?” said Yang Lin heavily as he looked at them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Bluesea…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing Bluesea remain silent, Grace hesitated for a moment before speaking up, “Why don’t… … we go.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What do you mean by that?” Bluesea looked back at Grace.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“They have been talking for so long. Who knows what they are talking about…” Grace stammered. “The youngster known as Chen Xiaolian… … in the end, he is different from us. He is the same as them. What if…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Chen Xiaolian saved us before. Did you forget?” replied Bluesea calmly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I think there is logic in Grace’s words,” interrupted Daniel. “We have only just met this kid. We do not actually know what kind of person he is. Even if he did save us before… … what guarantee is there that he will always be on our side?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That is right!” Seeing that Daniel was in agreement with her, Grace quickly became excited. “You need to know, he is not an ordinary human! It doesn’t matter how much you trust him. If he wants to attack us, we will have no ability to resist! Listen to me, Bluesea! We should hurry up and leave! Use this opportunity while they are still preoccupied with each other!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Yang Lin, what do you think?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea did not answer Grace. Instead, he turned to look at Yang Lin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I… …” Yang Lin had remained taciturn all this while. Lowering his head to consider the question, he then said slowly, “No matter what you decide, I will follow your lead.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Thank you.” Bluesea sent a nod his way before turning to face Grace. “You worry that Chen Xiaolian will turn on us?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Are you not?” asked Grace.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I am uncertain if Chen Xiaolian will turn on us. However… …” Bluesea gave a faint smile. “If he does turn on us, I do not see anyway for us to escape them.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“But…” Grace was about to say something else only to be interrupted by Bluesea, who stretched out his hand to point at the other end of the bridge. “There are only roughly 1,000 metres between them and us. Even if we try to run away with this SUV, it will be easy for them to chase after us.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Besides, what if the other party failed to get Chen Xiaolian to their side? If we do something like that, won’t it dishearten him? Furthermore, the path leading home is not short. We will still need his protection along the way.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Grace grew silent.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Earlier, she had witnessed Chen Xiaolian’s skill. He had jumped off the SUV, which was barrelling forward at full speed, and ran forward at a greater velocity. In but the blink of an eye, he had managed to make it to the bridgehead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Despite the 1,000 metres distance between them, driving away right now may actually not do anything to shake Chen Xiaolian off.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, Grace was still unwilling to give up. Gritting her teeth, she said, “If he really holds no ill-will toward us, then us leaving now will not make him regard us as enemies. Besides… … we had managed to reach this place without any mishaps, didn’t we? Since we could make it here on our own, we will also be able to leave on our own.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea gave Grace a glance, wanting to say something. In the end, however, he did not. All he did was to release a soft sigh.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Bluesea! What do you say?” Seeing that Bluesea had remained mum about it, Grace grew agitated. “If we don’t leave now, I fear we won’t be able to leave anymore!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You guys look!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Daniel suddenly shouted, his hand pointing at Chen Xiaolian and the other fellow. Hearing him, the others turned to look.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>On the bridge, a large fireball was flying in the air, drawing a curve through the sky as it headed toward their SUV.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After having spoken out, Wu Ya decided not to give Chen Xiaolian any time to think. He opened his right palm and a speck of flames burst out within them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After appearing on his palm, the speck of flames rapidly expanded. In an instant, it had grown into a one-metre radius fireball.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even Chen Xiaolian, who was standing several metres away from Wu Ya, could feel the heat waves coming off the fireball. However, Wu Ya, who was the one holding the fireball, appeared unaffected by the fireball.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Ten Thousand Flames, Quick!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>With a hurling motion, Wu Ya tossed the fireball in his right hand up to the sky and it curved through the sky, shooting toward the other end of the bridge.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Golden light flashed out from Chen Xiaolian’s eyes and the long blade in his hand swung out. A golden beam shot out from the surface of the blade and flew in pursuit of the fireball. It then caught up to the fireball in the middle of the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Surprisingly, after the golden beam cut into the fireball, no explosion erupted. The golden beam, which was faint, instantly shone dazzlingly the moment it struck the fireball. Next, the large fireball turned dim and disappeared without a trace.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The expression on Wu Ya’s face instantly twisted. He turned toward Chen Xiaolian, killing intent surging out from his eyes. “Kid, did you really think that I, Wu Ya, would not kill you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian looked at Wu Ya and shook his head weakly. Next, he sighed and said, “Truth be told, no matter how I think about it, I cannot find any reason to object what you fellows are doing. As the saying goes, every man for himself, and the Devil takes the hindmost. No matter where you are in the world, there is no way that principle can be wrong. If I am in your position and someone tries to drag me down to my death, I will probably do the same. Unfortunately… …”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian spread his hands. “I cannot just stand and watch as you kill my friend.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Are you not in the same boat as us?” Wu Ya sneered. “If the Development Team finds out about the irregular situation here, everyone will be cleared. You think you can escape the fate of being cleared?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“About that… … no need for you to worry about it,” replied Chen Xiaolian with a weak smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What a pity.” Wu Ya cast a regretful look at Chen Xiaolian. “After all this time, you are the first to earn my respect here in World’s End.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Should I say thank you?” Chen Xiaolian smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“No matter. To me, gratitude from the dead is of no value. Right…” Wu Ya, too, smiled. “Do you know why I so patiently explained so many things to you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You want to boast about your own good-hearted nature?” Chen Xiaolian gave a mockful answer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Not exactly.” Wu Ya shook his head. “You are really strong. Thus… … I needed some time to arrange my next moves. After the wise come to understand the situation here, they will naturally be willing to join the Coalition. However, this world… … no, this World’s End has no shortage of fools either. Ten Thousand Edges, Quick!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After saying that, Wu Ya shouted loudly. Instantly, a grave and murderous atmosphere spread out to envelop the two of them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“And you, are one of those fools!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After saying that, the index finger and middle finger on Wu Ya’s right hand came together to form a sword hand-seal.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Countless beams of chilling light suddenly broke through the surface of the concrete bridge to swirl about within the sky around them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Those were the steel bars inside the bridge. Wu Ya had secretly twisted them with his powers, transforming each of them into long swords, which now swirled around them without respite.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You appear very proficient with the blade. If so, let’s see if your blade is faster, or mine!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
