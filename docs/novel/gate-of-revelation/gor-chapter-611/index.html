 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 611 Stick-like Body? </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Roddy watched as a flower of blood blossomed out from Chen Xiaolian’s head. Next, his body fell limply on the floor. Sweat oozing out from his entire body, Roddy himself fell on his buttocks upon the sofa.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Lifehymn Music Score immediately sent a prompt to his personal system, asking him, the prop holder, if he wanted to resurrect Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There were three options: Yes/ No/ Postpone. Roddy cautiously selected Postpone. After that, a countdown timer appeared in his personal system’s interface.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>[Present stored life: (1/3). Time remaining for life storage: 239:59:21.]</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Following the appearance of a green coloured beam of light, Chen Xiaolian’s body, which was on the floor, disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Roddy released a sigh of relief. Although he knew that Chen Xiaolian would be resurrected in the end, having to kill his own best friend was extremely discomforting. At least now he no longer had to look at Chen Xiaolian’s corpse.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>240 hours later…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Xiaolian, you will come back.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>And, you will bring Qiao Qiao with you!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The engines roared as the airplane landed heavily on the runway. During the cruising phase, the plane shook bumpily twice before slowing down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The captain of the airplane, a coarse-looking man who looked like a bear walked out from the cockpit and stood at the end of the cabin aisle. He laughed loudly and said, “Ok, dear passengers. Let us celebrate this smooth landing! Welcome to Moscow!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He took the lead and a warm applause rang out from within the cabin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nicole raised her wrist to check the time. They had arrived 15 minutes earlier than expected.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Russian airlines.” Tian Lie shrugged with a look of indifference. “You need to get used to the way of Russians.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After getting off the airplane, Tian Lie led Nicole out of the airport. They got on a cab and gave the driver an address.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Sit tight, my Khitan friend!” The cab driver laughed before stepping down on the accelerator to its limit. An ear-piercing, grinding sound came from the car tires as it barrelled forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Half an hour later, the cab came to a stop before an old building.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Appearance wise, it would appear that the building was at least 50 years old. The entire building had the leftover atmosphere of the Soviet era.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Khrushchyovka building?” After paying for the cab fare, Tian Lie stood before the building and looked up at the mottled surface of the building wall. “Truly… … an imprint within history.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“This is the place you mentioned? The location of the backdoor leading to Zero City?” She wrapped an overcoat over her body. Although she was an Awakened, she had not taken the physical enhancement route. Thus, her body was somewhat unaccustomed to the cold weather in Moscow.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“This is the place. Let’s go.” Tian Lie nodded his head and was the first to stride into the small building.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>During Khrushchev’s reign, countless of these five-storey residential buildings were constructed on Soviet Union lands and distributed among the workers. As time went by, the Soviet Union’s end and the decline in Russian population had led to the demolition of some of these Khrushchyovka buildings. Some were abandoned and some turned into rental apartments.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A pile of trash sat in the corner of the building entrance and some of its balconies had flowers. Clearly, this building was occupied.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It is a little strange…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie led Nicole with him to the third floor. Standing before room number 301, he had uttered out that word.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Strange?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“These Khrushchyovka buildings were only built in the 1950s. No matter how you look at it, there is no way this building could be here earlier than that. Those two ancient monsters… how could they have left a back door here?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What is wrong with that?” Nicole was puzzled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Oh, right. You weren’t there back then. You do not know about that matter.” Tian Lie gave Nicole a glance and nodded his head. “Those two old monsters mentioned that they were being held down by each other and were unable to leave the instance dungeon. This situation has continued for a long time. However, this back door could not have been built for longer than 70 years…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Why do you care so much about it? We’ll worry about it after we get in.” Nicole gave Tian Lie an impatient look. “Use the key to open the door.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“They did not give me a key. Still… … it is all right.” Tian Lie shrugged. After glancing sideways to ensure that there were no other tenants walking by, he stretched out his right index finger and pressed it upon the door lock.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A stream of data flow flashed across the surface of his index finger and a thin line extended out from it to enter the keyhole. Moments later, following a clicking sound, the door was opened.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Let’s go.” Tian Lie pushed open the door and entered the room together with Nicole.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The furnishing of the room maintained the Soviet Union style from the 1950s. Appearance wise, it would seem that the door had not been opened for decades. Both the floor and the furniture were covered by a thick layer of dust.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What next?” After closing the door, Nicole glanced at her surroundings and asked Tian Lie.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Next…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie walked forward. Pushing open the door of a room, he walked inside.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was a bedroom. The furnishing inside were limited to an ordinary double bed, a coat rack and a wardrobe.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie opened the wardrobe, which was revealed to be empty of clothes. The only thing inside was a black coloured stone. The stone was roughly half a metre square in size and had a twisted appearance.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie extended his hand to brush off the layer of dust on top of the stone to reveal a small narrow hole on the surface of the stone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The old monster was not lying.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>With a nod of his head, Tian Lie pulled out the small blade from his chest. Without pulling the blade from its sheath, he slid the blade into the hole on the stone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The moment the blade was inserted, the stone began to hum. Next, a faint green light shone out from one end of the stone. The light shone upon the bed in the middle of the room.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Under the illumination of the green light, the double bed began flashing a few times. Next, the colour of the bed became weak and it turned translucent.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“All right, let’s get on the bed.” Tian Lie straightened himself and turned to look at Nicole with a provocative smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You… … what did you say?” Nicole was stunned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I said, get on the bed. Do you not understand those words?” Tian Lie, who had already reached the side of the bed, grinned. Without even pulling off his shoes, he sat down and proceeded to lay on the bed. “This is the entry method that the old monster told me. If you have any objections, don’t take it up with me. Go pester the old monster in the instance dungeon.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Having said that, Tian Lie extended a hand to pat the empty half area of the bed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You…” Nicole gritted her teeth and sent a glare at Tian Lie. However, there was nothing she could do about it. Walking to the side of the bed, she laid herself on the other half of the bed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>At any rate… … this is just for a moment.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Why isn’t the teleportation starting up?” Not seeing the familiar teleportation beam from Zero City after having laid down for a few seconds, Nicole turned to see that Tian Lie had his eyes closed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You need to be asleep for it to work.” Tian Lie opened one eye and looked at Nicole. “If you do not sleep, the teleportation cannot begin.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What?!” Nicole jumped out from the bed and stared at Tian Lie with widened eyes. “Why would there be such a weird procedure? I have entered and exited Zero City many times. Never have I heard of a need to… … to sleep!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie closed his eyes once more and said leisurely, “This is a backdoor. Like I said, if you have any objections, do not take it up with me. Go find the two old monsters.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You… … you are not lying to me?” Nicole glared at Tian Lie.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Lie to you?” Tian Lie opened his eyes and regarded Nicole, who was now seated by the bed, from top to bottom before saying in a ridiculing manner, “What scheme could I have? Your stick-like body? Hurry up. If you want to follow me to Zero City, be nice and just go to sleep beside me. If you don’t want to, just get out. Oh, remember to close the door when you leave.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Having said that, Tian Lie closed his eyes once more. However, he appeared to disagree with the height of the pillow. Reaching out with his hand, he adjusted it for a bit. After that, he lay there silently with an easy-going expression.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nicole bit her lip. Looking at the leisurely expression on Tian Lie’s face, she could only suppress the feeling of discomfort as she lay down beside him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, despite closing her eyes, Nicole was unable to calm her mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The room must have seen no visitors for decades. Despite the cold weather in Moscow, there was still some mouldy air in the room. The mouldy air found its way to Nicole’s nose, causing her nose to feel itchy. However, she was unable to sneeze.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>I, Nicole, the Floating Angel of the Angel Corps had many suitors back in Zero City. You actually called me a stick-like body woman?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie, who was beside her, had begun snoring.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The two of them were lying close to one another, almost shoulder to shoulder. The snore became like blasts of air. The sound relentlessly blasted Nicole’s ear.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Enough! stop sleeping!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Nicole, who could no longer stand it, sat up. Looking at the still sleeping Tian Lie, she sent a kick over.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As Nicole’s leg was about to reach Tian Lie’s body, his eyes swiftly flew open. His right hand shot out from an angle that would have been impossible for ordinary humans and his palm caught Nicole’s kick by the toes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even in his sleep, an expert like Tian Lie would never let his guard down against surrounding dangers.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What are you throwing a ruckus for?” Tian Lie narrowed his eyes. An icy atmosphere exuded out from the depths of his eyes.&nbsp;“Are you not done?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Knock me unconscious.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What?” Tian Lie was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I can’t go to sleep,” said Nicole coolly. “According to what you just said, the two people on this bed must fall asleep before the teleportation can begin, right? I must go to Zero City, but I cannot sleep. So – knock me unconscious!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie lowered his head. Then, he narrowed his eyes at Nicole again. “Knock you unconscious? Are you not afraid that I might do something to you after you faint?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was an indifferent look on Nicole’s face. She tilted her neck forward ever so slightly and looked at Tian Lie. “What could you be scheming? You want my stick-like body?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You have a point.” Tian Lie grinned and nodded. Without saying anything else, he extended his right hand and swiftly struck Nicole’s slender neck with it.</span></p>
