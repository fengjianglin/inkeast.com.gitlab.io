 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 540 Impossible</strong></p>
 <p>“A a ahh!”</p>
 <p>Yang Yi quickly got up.</p>
 <p>Next, he found himself seated on a dilapidated looking bed with coarse sheets. The room he was in was very small and the air inside was stuffy.</p>
 <p>The clothes he presently wore were torn in many places and he found that his protective suit had been taken off. The only thing left on him was his skin-tight attire that was full of holes.</p>
 <p>He delved through his final memories before he last fainted and recalled himself fighting against the invading Players on the south street…</p>
 <p>“You're awake.”</p>
 <p>A figure standing before the window, back facing Yang Yi, turned around.</p>
 <p>The light from the outside shone inside to illuminate a slender figure.</p>
 <p>This figure was clearly a woman.</p>
 <p>As the woman slowly stepped to the bedside, Yang Yi was finally able to fully see her face. He grew shocked.</p>
 <p>“You are… … Tina?”</p>
 <p>There was a look of exhaustion on Tina’s face as she gently rubbed the corner of her eyes. After that, she sat down on a chair by the bed.</p>
 <p>“Yes, I am Tina. I know you too. You are Yang Yi, an outstanding warrior from Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild.” There was a hoarse quality to Tina’s voice and she continued, “My knowledge toward you is more comprehensive than you could imagine – truth be told, before the Blood Verdict, we had conducted an in-depth analysis on all the outstanding warriors within Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild. Well, in the end, all the effort we put into collecting that information became a joke during that Blood Verdict.”</p>
 <p>Yang Yi exhaled and looked at his own body. “My wounds…”</p>
 <p>“I had given you a healing substance. As you can see, your wounds are no longer an issue.”</p>
 <p>“Then, where are we now?”</p>
 <p>“A safe place.” Tina’s voice then took on a tangled tone. “To be exact, we are no longer inside Zero City. We are now in the outside world.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, she got up and walked to stand before the window. Next, she pulled open the curtains completely before pushing open the window.</p>
 <p>The outside sunlight spilled inside. So too did the sea breeze and the sound of the waves.</p>
 <p>“We are now in a seaside city on the east coast of South America. This place is only 500 meters away from the beach, a cheap tourist hotel. I did not bring much money with me when I left, so we will have to put up with these plain conditions for now.”</p>
 <p>Tina’s answer did not satisfy Yang Yi. He asked, “We… … how did we get out? I recall myself fighting against the enemies in the south street!”</p>
 <p>“That we were able to escape is all thanks to my husband.” Tina’s eyes suddenly turned red. “My husband… sacrificed his chance to escape, gave it to me and I brought you along as I escaped Zero City.”</p>
 <p>“I… I do not understand,” said Yang Yi with a frown.</p>
 <p>“For now, there is no need for you to understand too much. All you need to know is that my husband found a way to let people leave Zero City. Then, he gave me the first opportunity to escape.”</p>
 <p>“He… … is a real man!” Yang Yi nodded and looked at Tina. “Who is your husband?”</p>
 <p>“You may have heard of his name. His name is Gibbs, a member of the Angel Corps.” After saying that, Tina paused and said in a hushed tone, “You are right, he is a real man. And… … also a great father. He gave me the chance to escape, not only was it because he is my husband… … even more… … because I am pregnant. We have to protect our child! The child in me!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“Still cannot make contact.”</p>
 <p>Fatty glanced to his side to see Aunt Flame clutching her head in frustration.</p>
 <p>“This has never happened before,” Aunt Flame said coldly and she suddenly stood up.</p>
 <p>“Where are you going?”</p>
 <p>“I know of a semi-permanent passageway point nearby. I will go test my luck and see if I can find anything.” After saying that, Aunt Flame moved to leave.</p>
 <p>“I… I…”</p>
 <p>“You stay here.” Aunt Flame turned to look at Fatty and said, “Stay here and look after your father.”</p>
 <p>“Maybe… there is another way.” Fatty’s eyes suddenly shone.</p>
 <p>“Mm?”</p>
 <p>“I have an idea.” Fatty quickly got up from the ground.</p>
 <p>Aunt Flame strode over and grabbed hold of Fatty by his clothes. Then, she said fiercely, “Out with it!”</p>
 <p>“I, I have this device, an emergency communication device. I have inputted all the emergency communication frequencies for every resident guild in it. In other words, using this device, I can contact…”</p>
 <p>“Contact the people inside Zero City? That is not possible!” Aunt Flame’s face became twisted.</p>
 <p>Fatty smiled bitterly. “Of course that is not possible. My device does not have the ability to infiltrate Zero City’s space. What I mean is, if there is anyone from Zero City in the outside world, I will be able to use this device to contact them. However… … at present, its effective range is only 1,000 kilometres. If there is someone from Zero City within 1,000 kilometres from us, we might be able to ask them what is going on.”</p>
 <p>Aunt Flame the released her grip on Fatty and shouted, “What are you waiting for? Hurry!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Nicole was driving frantically.</p>
 <p>She had made her way to two secured internal passageway points that she knew of.</p>
 <p>To her utter disappointment, those two passageways had disappeared.</p>
 <p>She was simply incapable of entering Zero City.</p>
 <p>“Something must have happened.” Nicole’s face twisted to the extreme as she slammed down on the accelerator. She ignored all traffic lights and charged toward her next objective. Her objective was another of the secured passageway points that she knew of. These passageways were used by the Angel Corps to enter and exit Zero City.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, she slammed down on the brake.</p>
 <p>She turned to look at her wrist. The delicate looking lady’s watch that she was wearing was flashing with red light.</p>
 <p>Emergency communication signal?</p>
 <p>Nicole rapidly turned the steering wheel, moving her vehicle to stop by the road.</p>
 <p>The watch like device was actually an emergency communication device used by the Angel Corps.</p>
 <p>After her ‘rebirth’, Nicole had secretly taken this with her during her last visit to Zero City.</p>
 <p>Now that this device was suddenly showing a reaction, Nicole acted as though she had found a life-saving straw.</p>
 <p>Without showing any hesitation, she pressed the receive button.</p>
 <p>“Who is it?”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“Ah! There is a response!” Fatty jumped up in excitement only to be held down by Aunt Flame, who snapped at him, “Enough nonsense! Hurry and ask them!”</p>
 <p>Fatty took a deep breath. He held an oval-shaped device in his hands as he quickly said, “This is an emergency call, my security code is…”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Hearing the somewhat familiar voice, Nicole knitted her brows. After listening to the other fellow’s security code however, she became stunned.</p>
 <p>The security code did not belong to the Angel Corps. Instead…</p>
 <p>“Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild?” Nicole suddenly recalled the identity of the person talking. “You are… … that detestable fatso?”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“Eh? You can recognize my voice? Who are you?” Fatty felt a tingle on his scalp and he said, “Who are you? You do sound familiar. Damn it, I can’t remember.”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Nicole hesitated for a moment. In the end, she chose not to reveal her identity – her rebirth was not something she could easily explain.</p>
 <p>She settled her mind and said, “Enough, don’t spout nonsense now. Let me ask you, what is going on?”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“I…” Fatty cast a silent gaze at Aunt Flame, who was beside him.</p>
 <p>Aunt Flame coldly snatched the communication device and said in a solemn tone, “I am Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild’s Thunderflame! A member of the Board of Patriarchs! You there, I order you to reveal your identity right now!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Nicole flinched.</p>
 <p>Thunderflame!</p>
 <p>One of the titans of Blade Mountain Flame Sea Guild.</p>
 <p>Nicole exhaled and quickly replied, “My identity is my guild’s confidential information. It cannot be disclosed. Ma’am Thunderflame, may I ask you why are you contacting me using the emergency channel?”</p>
 <p>After a pause, she slowly continued, “Zero City… … what has happened?”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“What do you mean by that?” Thunderflame frowned. “Zero City…”</p>
 <p>She suddenly froze. “Could it be? You also cannot contact Zero City?”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“… … …” Nicole felt her scalp go numb.</p>
 <p>Biting her lips heavily, she quickly turned off the communication device.</p>
 <p><em>Zero City. As expected, something has happened!</em></p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“The, the other party hung up.” Fatty scratched his head in frustration. “Just who is that woman? I have definitely heard that voice before, but I just can’t recall it.”</p>
 <p>“… … …” At that moment, Thunderflame’s emotions were roiling.</p>
 <p>After a few seconds of silence, she turned to look at Fatty and said, “I… … do remember whose voice that belonged to, but… … that is impossible!”</p>
 <p>“Who?”</p>
 <p>Thunderflame sneered and said, “Did you forget already? A few years back, you nearly got one of your legs broken for trying to flirt with her.”</p>
 <p>Fatty was at a loss for a moment. Then, he swiftly jumped up. “You mean the Floating Angel? Impossible! She is already dead! Killed in action!”</p>
 <p>After a pause, Fatty quickly continued, “Even, even if she had been resurrected, she should just be an ordinary human! How could she still have an emergency communication device? Also… … it doesn’t seem like she lost her memories!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
