 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 673 Reversal </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The two of them remained immobile upon the sand dune, not moving in the slightest. However, inside the willpower dimension, Chen Xiaolian had had to suffer painfully countless times.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Within the willpower dimension, time had been seemingly extended to an infinitely long time.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu’s fingers drew across Chen Xiaolian’s body countless times. Every time he did so, Chen Xiaolian’s skin, muscles and bones would be casually cut apart.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After that came an intense feeling of pain comparable to that of the outside world.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, Chen Xiaolian did not die.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This was a contest within the willpower dimension, after all. What happened inside would not affect the flesh outside. After Chen Xiaolian’s body was torn apart, he will instantly recover, having to watch Lei Hu as he tore his body to pieces once again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, the pain of getting killed every single time was very real.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Let me tell you the result,” said Lei Hu with a smile. “The gap between your mental strength and mine is bigger than that of our physical bodies. Your resistance is futile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Here, your willpower will be tortured endlessly by me. In the end, it will disappear completely.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“After losing your willpower, all that will be left of you is an empty shell, a walking corpse.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu’s right hand suddenly stabbed into Chen Xiaolian’s heart, as though he had simply thrust his hand into a piece of tofu. When he pulled his hand out, it was holding on to a still palpitating heart.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Does it hurt? Do you like this feeling?” Lei Hu smiled as he gently squeezed with his hand, causing Chen Xiaolian’s heart to burst apart within his palm. “This pain will accompany you forever, until your willpower vanishes.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The wound on Chen Xiaolian’s chest quickly healed up, his heart quickly returning into his chest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He gritted his teeth, not letting himself scream at all. Instead, he glared at Lei Hu.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It has only been 10 minutes outside. As for your senses, how long did it feel like in this willpower dimension? Ten years? One hundred years? A thousand years?” Lei Hu tightened his grip on Chen Xiaolian’s shoulder, easily crushing it. “To me, it has only been 10 minutes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It seems you are waiting for your companion. Let’s not go to whether or not he can defeat me. Are you so confident that your willpower can last that long?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You will die.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian hissed out those few words through the cracks between his teeth and forced out a smile. “We’ll wait and see.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Five minutes.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu extended a palm out, placing five fingers before Chen Xiaolian and smiled. “In less than five minutes, your willpower will utterly vanish.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It is possible… … your willpower will vanish, you…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian smiled. However, as he was halfway through his words, he found that he could no longer say anything.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Why do you think you can still talk?” Lei Hu wagged his index finger and said in a leisurely manner, “Allowing you to talk in this willpower dimension is because I wanted to hear your wretched screams. A pity, it seems you have no love for screaming. Next up… … without my permission, in this willpower dimension, you cannot move even half a muscle.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After Lei Hu had said those words, Chen Xiaolian was indeed left immobile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>His eyeballs and tongue, which had been able to move, could no longer do so at all. He became like a clay doll.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Next…” Lei Hu lowered his head, placing his mouth next to Chen Xiaolian’s ear. “Let me see how long it takes to destroy your mind.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu extended his hand, pressing it on Chen Xiaolian’s finger. Next, he gave it a slight push.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A piece of nail was peeled off his finger, bringing blood along with it. It was followed by another.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian’s body remained motionless. Even his eyes remained the same.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You cannot talk right now. However, I know that you must be in great pain.” It did not take long for Lei Hu to peel off all 10 of Chen Xiaolian’s fingernails. With a smile, he continued, “People subjected to this torture will use these words to comfort themselves… humans only have 10 fingernails. For you, however, that is not the case.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even as Lei Hu was speaking, the peeled off nails had returned back to Chen Xiaolian’s hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If so, let us continue!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Who knew how long had gone by? Chen Xiaolian’s form in that willpower dimension had been shredded apart innumerable times.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, every time, he would be restored back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu twisted his head, smashed his body with one strike. As he watched Chen Xiaolian’s body re-form itself, his expression slowly grew slightly anxious.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was not as though he had never utilized this skill before. However, none had been able to endure it as long as Chen Xiaolian had.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The five minutes he said earlier had long since passed. However, the outer world’s five minutes were being extended numerous times within the willpower dimension.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Previously, he only needed to destroy his enemies’ form within this willpower dimension tens of times before they get destroyed and not recover.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, Chen Xiaolian’s consciousness had been able to endure for so long without dissipating.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu raised his hand. A serrated blade appeared in his hand and he swung it toward Chen Xiaolian’s neck.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, just as the serrated blade was about to cut across the neck, a hand suddenly shot out at lightning-like speed to catch the edge of the blade.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It was Chen Xiaolian’s hand!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu’s eyes popped wide open and he stared at Chen Xiaolian with disbelief.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>He… moved?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian had been sitting cross-legged within the void, incapable of moving his mouth, hands and eyes. So, why did his hand suddenly grab the blade?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu tugged backwards, easily pulling the serrated blade back. Next, the blade hacked down from above, cleaving Chen Xiaolian into two.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Next, Chen Xiaolian’s body recovered. This time, Lei Hu noticed Chen Xiaolian’s legs trembling. Then, he slowly… … stood up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was intense pain on Chen Xiaolian’s face. It was as though every move required a great deal of effort on his part. Even so, he was indeed moving.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu screamed and shot a punch out at Chen Xiaolian’s body, leaving a large hole on his chest. With a shake of his right hand, Chen Xiaolian’s whole body was reduced into foamy blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Without waiting for Chen Xiaolian’s body to re-form itself, Lei Hu sent another slash forward, cutting Chen Xiaolian’s waist. His continuous attacks made it so that Chen Xiaolian had almost no chance of recovering.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, after doing so for tens of times, Lei Hu’s blade was stopped.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian’s hand had caught the blade once more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The serrated edge of the blade bit into his palm, seemingly on the verge of cutting his palm into two. However, despite using his all, Lei Hu was incapable of pulling the serrated blade back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian’s hand remained steadfast as it held onto the serrated blade that Lei Hu was wielding. He raised his head to slowly reveal a smile. “Are you surprised? Did you not expect this?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You!” Lei Hu wanted to pull the serrated blade back. However, it was firmly held by Chen Xiaolian and could not be moved.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I admit, in the physical dimension, I am no match for you. However, if we are going with the strength of the mind, I am fairly confident in myself.” Chen Xiaolian turned to look at the serrated blade. “In this willpower dimension, it seems that as long as the mind is strong enough, you can casually materialize any object, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He closed his eyes. Next, his right hand suddenly created something radiant.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The radiance slowly faded away, revealing the Sword in the Stone in his hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It truly is so.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian nodded and the Sword in the Stone abruptly shot out like a viper, piercing Lei Hu’s heart.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>With a wretched scream, Lei Hu let go of the serrated blade and retreated backward. His hand gripped the heart position on his chest as he looked at Chen Xiaolian in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The wound on his chest recovered quickly. However, the aghast expression on Lei Hu’s face remained.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“This is impossible!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Why not?” Chen Xiaolian continued wielding the Sword in the Stone, his figure suspended in the void as he looked at Lei Hu coolly. “The reason you could suppress my movements here is solely because this is your skill and that you are the one who created this space. As long as I figure out the secret, I can easily break your suppression.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Easily?” Lei Hu’s face became warped.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It might not be easy for others. Honestly, though, I am quite lucky.” Chen Xiaolian smiled and continued, “Before this, I just so happened to encounter someone with a somewhat similar skill. He could be considered… … a reference.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian raised the Sword in the Stone and aimed it at Lei Hu. “From now onward, we will be at the same starting line.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
