 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 644 Let Him!&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun scoffed as a silver light flowed from within her into the spear handle and into the sea of blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Next, countless beams of light shot out beneath the sea of blood, intersecting one another and turning the area beneath the sea of blood into an expanse of silver.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Then, all the beams of light shone upward. All around the beams of light, the sea of blood began boiling due to the intense heat coming from the beams of light. The blood within the sea of blood turned into a thick layer of mist before slowly dissipating away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The sea of blood receded at a noticeable rate.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Dream on! How can my Bloodsoul Lake be destroyed so easily?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast’s thunderous roar echoed through the sky once more and even more blood hands rose up to smash down on them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, as each of the blood hands were still rising up, the beams of light shot out by Bluesea cut each hand into two and they fell into the sea.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The silver light gradually grew more intense; in turn, the sea of blood grew increasingly shallow. Finally, following a sudden howl resembling that from a wounded animal, the entirety of the sea of blood evaporated into the sky and dissipated away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The remaining blood hands that were in the middle of rising up into the sky lost its ability to remain standing. They crashed down and likewise, evaporated before disappearing into the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It’s on you now.” Bluesea, who no longer had the strength to remain standing properly, gasped as he looked at Sister Yun. Then, he fell on his back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The numerous tentacles wrapping his arms had already withered greatly; only 10 per cent of its original state remained. The resin-like crystal on either palm had also turned dim.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian rushed forward to grab Bluesea. Instinctively, he had wanted to give him a spicy bar (healing substance) only to realize that he no longer had either storage equipment or his personal system.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Damn it!” Chen Xiaolian gritted his teeth heavily. However, Bluesea shook his head and said, “It is fine, don’t worry. It seems this thing inside me won’t let me die so easily.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea appeared to be in an extremely weakened state. However, it would also appear that he was not in a life-threatening situation. Seeing that, Chen Xiaolian nodded gently and placed him down on the ground. Next, he raised his head to look up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Right before the sea of blood was completely evaporated, Sebast, with his pair of wings still flapping behind him, had reappeared in the sky. Sister Yun pulled out her spear, kicked the ground, and charged up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A trickle of black-coloured blood flowed down from the corner of Sebast’s mouth and he glared at Sister Yun. A layer of scales rapidly covered both his hands. Likewise, sharp claws extended out from his fingernails. Next, with a few flap of his wings, he dived toward Sister Yun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Since the Bloodsoul Lake cannot kill you, I will use my own hands!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As he roared, a thick mist of blood wrapped themselves around Sebast’s figure.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The tip of the claw struck the tip of the spear, but the one to be sent flying was the one with the higher position, Sebast.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The moment they clashed, the silvery glow from the tip of the spear had instantaneously ripped apart the mist of blood enveloping Sebast’s body. The spear cut off Sebast’s claw and stabbed him in the chest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Instantly, blood spurted out from the huge wound on Sebast’s chest. His figure flew for hundreds of metres backward before he was finally able to steady himself. A pair of spiteful eyes looked at Sister Yun with disbelief.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, before he could fully steady himself, the next attack was already upon his chest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast howled out as the spear once again stabbed into his body, this time piercing right through him. The silver-coloured energies within the spear flowed into his wound and erupted outward through his seven apertures. Sebast’s body became akin to a big fireworks display.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even so, Sebast remained alive.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Suddenly, both his hands gripped the spear piercing his body. Next, he pulled it out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The moment the spear was pulled out from his chest, another flower of blood blossomed in the sky, aggravating the wound on his chest. However, the energies from the spear were no longer flowing into him. Thus, they could no longer continue harming him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast, who held onto the spear handle with both his hands, glared at Sister Yun as he tussled with her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The force exerted by the two of them caused the spear handle to slowly bend out of shape. Sister Yun maintained a look of indifference, but her rate of breathing had increased slightly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast jerked his head to the side as his right hand lashed out to inflict a heavy cutting strike upon the centre part of the spear handle. Due to the force of the attack, the spear that was already nearly circular in shape rang out loudly as it broke into two.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At the same time, the forces that the two of them were channelling through the spear finally erupted upon the two of them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun shot down from the sky like an artillery blast, creating a huge crater when she landed. As for Sebast, he was pushed high up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The soil on the ground shook upward from the intensity of the Sister Yun’s landing. However, when Sister Yun stood up, not a speck of dust could be seen on her. There was also no sign of injury on her body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Not bad.” She looked up and sneered at the figure up in the sky, which had grown small at a rapid rate. Then, the figure slowly grew larger. She said, “To be able to clash with me, you are not too shabby.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast flapped his wings and finally hovered up in the sky before Sister Yun again. The sounds of his breathing sounded like that of a broken bellows.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Blood trickled down every part of his body and the large wound on his chest was such that his body appeared on the verge of tearing apart. The bones and internal organs inside were exposed. However, Sebast looked at Sister Yun without any hint of fear.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Powerful! Truly powerful!” Sebast took a deep breath, causing a froth of blood to burst out from his wound. The spiteful look in his eyes was no more as he laughed out. “How unexpected. To think that there would be an expert like you in World’s End. You have been concealing yourself all this time. Thankfully, I now possess Wu Ya’s magical dragon blood. Otherwise… … I might really die to you!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You think that by having that, you will not?” Sister Yun sneered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Your skill with the spear is indeed very good. However, I have already broken your spear. How do you plan on fighting me without any weapons?” Looking at the unarmed Sister Yun, Sebast continued, “I had checked you out. You do not have any storage equipment on you. Besides…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Both his hands punched the air before him before slowly pulling the air apart. As his arms moved, a rift appeared before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A river of blood rushed out from the rift, moving toward Sebast. The river of blood rushed into his wound, quickly repairing the large wound on his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Do you have any idea just how powerful the Bloodclan’s regenerative powers are?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“So, that is where you get your confidence.” Sister Yun nodded her head. Then, she sighed. “However, you have made a mistake.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Oh? What do you have to say?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Two things.” Sister Yun reached out with her hand to pull a strand of her long hair. “Firstly, the spear is not some equipment. Rather, it is created using my skill.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After plucking the strand of hair, her right hand made a gesture and a silver glow shone out from her palm. Next, a spear that looked just like the earlier one appeared within her grasp.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sebast’s face sank.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Secondly…” Sister Yun raised her head to look at Sebast. Suddenly, a smile appeared on her face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Since meeting her, Chen Xiaolian had not seen any other expression on her face other than indifference and coldness.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Only now, when she was smiling, did he realize how beautiful the woman was.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Her perfect facial features were already alluring in itself, but when she smiled, she became breathtakingly beautiful.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The smile did not contain a fawning look nor a delicately fragile look; it had none of those ‘unique to women’ look.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The beauty of her smile was one of purity and nothing to do with her gender.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Just now, I had not used my skill to fully arm myself.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After the spear appeared, the silvery light did not disappear. Instead, it quickly flowed along her arm toward her body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Wherever the silver light went, the clothing that Sister Yun was wearing would disappear only to be replaced with a set of armour.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A set of dazzlingly silver-coloured armour.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The armour covered Sister Yun from head to toe. And yet, she did not appear unflatteringly fat with armour on her. Instead, it accentuated the slender curves of her body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Looking at the set of armour, Chen Xiaolian was unable to recognize any unique style on it. He was unable to tell if it was an Eastern or Western armour. Rather, it looked more like…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Saint… … Saint Cloth?” <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian stared at the armour, his jaw on the verge of hitting the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The helmet did not completely envelop the back part of her head, allowing her long hair to flow down her back. Her long, black hair, which was like a waterfall, made the silver helmet and armour look even more striking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The silver light continued flowing down to form a mighty and spirited horse. Rearing up its front hooves, it then raised its head up high to release a snort.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun pointed her silver spear at Sebast, who was in the middle of the air. Next, Chen Xiaolian watched as the horse leapt up into the air. It appeared as though there was a transparent staircase leading upward before the horse as it galloped its way up the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun became like a meteor, leaving a long trail of light behind her. The spear in her hand was positioned horizontally, but was filled with power, ready to erupt at any time.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When Sister Yun reached Sebast, the spear in her hand shot forward. At the same time, a gigantic fang-filled jaw emerged from the rift before Sebast. The jaw shot toward Sister Yun and bit down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The gigantic jaw was as big as four to five people combined and it engulfed both Sister Yun and the white horse that she was riding.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In the next instant, silvery sword trails erupted and the gigantic jaw exploded like a water balloon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun maintained her valiant bearing of a hero on horseback. There was not a single trace of blood on her body. However, the jaw did manage to obstruct her charging momentum. Using the opportunity, Sebast quickly retreated.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Soon, even more monsters emerged from the rift.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Big spiders, two-headed giants, werewolves… … numerous monsters of varying types and sizes emerged from the rift before charging furiously at Sister Yun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As for Sebast, he had retreated far behind. Both his hands were intersecting each other as he used his nails to rake out a hexagram pattern on both his palms.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“This fellow is a magus! We cannot allow him the opportunity to unleash stronger spells!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian shouted loudly toward Sister Yun. However, Sister Yun merely sneered before replying nonchalantly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Let him.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
