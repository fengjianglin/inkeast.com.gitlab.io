 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 561 Do Your Parents Have A Grudge Against You?</strong></p>
 <p>The lights in the parking lot suddenly went out. One after another, the overhead lights automatically turned off, starting from the farthest one. An extremely terrifying atmosphere enveloped the parking lot.</p>
 <p>Finally, the overhead light above Chen Xiaolian went out and the entire parking lot descended into darkness.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian raised his brows.</p>
 <p>A strange sound came from afar. It sounded like footsteps and something being dragged across the ground.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian narrowed his eyes as he looked forward. He saw a strange figure emerge from the entrance to the parking lot and slowly made its way toward him.</p>
 <p>The figure was very big. No, it would be more accurate to say it was humongous.</p>
 <p>It was at least three metres tall. In the darkness, he was able to barely make out its silhouette. It appeared to have a humanoid shape. At the very least, it was walking on two legs.</p>
 <p>When it was near, Chen Xiaolian abruptly slipped his hand into his pocket and pressed the button on his car key.</p>
 <p>Instantly, the car beside Chen Xiaolian beeped twice before automatically turning on its headlamps. Two rays of light shone out, illuminating the humongous body.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was unable to stop himself from frowning at what he saw.</p>
 <p>“A monster?”</p>
 <p>It was a bipedal monster with hairy body. It had the appearance of the legendary ape-man. Judging by the contours of its muscles, it would seem that this monster possessed a vast amount of strength.</p>
 <p>Its head was somewhat shaped like an inverted triangle. Its mouth opened to reveal a messy array of fangs and saliva trickled down from them.</p>
 <p>The sight that caused Chen Xiaolian’s heart to sink was its arms. It had four arms.</p>
 <p>Two arms protruded out from its shoulder blades, giving it two more limbs compared to normal living creatures.</p>
 <p>Those two extra limbs were each dragging a person.</p>
 <p>Indeed, both its hands were gripping onto an ankle each. Two figures could be seen behind the monster as it dragged the two figures along with it.</p>
 <p>Surprisingly, judging from the appearances of the two figures on the ground, they were Lun Tai and Bei Tai.</p>
 <p>The two brothers were facing the ground and appeared unconscious. Chen Xiaolian could not tell if they were still alive or not.</p>
 <p>The monster dragged Lun Tai and Bei Tai forward and finally halted after reaching a spot that was roughly 10 metres away from Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>It released its grip and allowed the two brothers to fall to the ground. Next, it cast a grin at Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>It appeared to be… smiling?</p>
 <p>However, the smile was like the stuff of nightmares. The two headlamps, which shone upon its face, further magnified the atmosphere.</p>
 <p>“What a pity, you turned on the car lights. You have spoiled this scene of horror that I created.”</p>
 <p>The monster spoke with a human tongue. However, it had a grating voice, reminiscent of the sound produced by scraping the surface of a plate with a fork.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian exhaled. He subconsciously gripped the Sword in the Stone in his hand and an inexplicable smile appeared on his face.</p>
 <p>“Who are you? Or should I say, what are you?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian asked in a serious tone.</p>
 <p>The pair of eyes on the monster stared at Chen Xiaolian intently. It was a pair of eyes which brought about goose bumps all over his body – part of its eyes were covered by the hair growing out from its forehead.</p>
 <p>“Chen Xiaolian, Guild Leader of Meteor Rock Guild, a veteran Awakened… … also, it would appear that you possess quite the level of strength,” said the monster with a savage grin.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian did not make any move in response. However, he did shift his posture and placed his left feet half a step back.</p>
 <p>“Do not be surprised. It is not surprising for me to know about you.” Saliva trickled out from the monster’s mouth.</p>
 <p>“So, why do you want to look for me?” asked Chen Xiaolian coldly.</p>
 <p>“To have a little discussion with you.” Two of the monster’s hands were resting on its waist while the other two scratched at its head. Then, it said, “Do you wish to control your own destiny?”</p>
 <p>“What?” Hearing that, Chen Xiaolian sneered. “I do not understand what you mean.”</p>
 <p>“It is very simple.” The monster took another step forward. “Awakened ones have suffered under the oppression of the Players long enough! Forced into dangerous circumstances again and again – for far too long!”</p>
 <p>Unexpectedly, Chen Xiaolian turned calm. “What is the meaning behind those words of yours?”</p>
 <p>“Those Players, they would insult us at will and kill us. In the instance dungeons, they would treat us as in-game NPCs, enemies to be fought within a game, targets in a quest! Who knows how many Awakened ones have tried to confront them again and again. However, our numbers are few and our strength limited.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian took a deep breath and the corners of his lips curled to reveal a trace of ridicule. “And?”</p>
 <p>“We need to rise up and resist! Resist! Fight them head on! Fight them face to face! Fight those Players, let those bastards who wantonly invade out world understand that we are not to be messed with! We must let them pay the price for their actions!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian listened quietly. “And?”</p>
 <p>“… … and?” The monster became dumbfounded.</p>
 <p>“Right, what then?” Chen Xiaolian shrugged and continued, “Fight the Players head on… … and then? Even if we win, this world is still under the control of the Development Team. They can mess around with us at will. They can create an instance dungeon with impossible difficulty and throw us inside… … if so, your so-called fight against the Players, would it still mean anything?”</p>
 <p>The monster gnashed its teeth and replied, “Revenge! Honour! Freedom!”</p>
 <p>“Mm, revenge, honour, freedom… … and following that is the end where everyone dies, right?” Chen Xiaolian sneered.</p>
 <p>The monster became silent for a few seconds as it stared at Chen Xiaolian. Its stare grew increasingly hostile. “It would seem I was wrong. Chen Xiaolian, I thought you are someone with a backbone. I heard you had made it through several instance dungeons. Additionally, you also possess a considerable level of strength. I had assumed you to be a courageous fellow. Unexpectedly, you are a coward without the will to fight against the Players.”</p>
 <p>“Let us not first discuss about whether or not I am a coward,” said Chen Xiaolian with an icy tone. “Let us also not discuss about you coming here and telling me these stuff. Let us talk about the two fellows who are on the ground. Those two are my guild members. You attacked my guild members. What is up with that?”</p>
 <p>The monster cackled. “Oh? So, that is what you are more concerned with? It seems you want to fight me?”</p>
 <p>“Was there any other way?” Chen Xiaolian released a laugh and said, “Or did you think I would surrender just because of those nonsensical stuff you just mentioned?”</p>
 <p>“Fine, I will first beat you into submission. When that happens, you will be able to open your eyes and face reality! Then, you can make your choice once more!” All four of the monster’s hands balled up their fists, releasing cracking sounds.</p>
 <p>“By the way, what are you actually here for? It appears that you want to recruit me. If that is the case, which organization do you represent?”</p>
 <p>“An organization that is about to gain control over the future of this world! A resistance made up of Awakened ones with an unprecedented level of might!” the monster said loudly.</p>
 <p>“An unprecedented level of might?” Chen Xiaolian asked. “More powerful than Zero City?”</p>
 <p>“Zero City? Zero City has fallen!”</p>
 <p>A shudder ran through Chen Xiaolian’s body.</p>
 <p>A trace of shock appeared on his face.</p>
 <p><em>This monster… … how did it know about the fall of Zero City?</em></p>
 <p><em>If this fellow is an Awakened… … that should be impossible.</em></p>
 <p><em>News about Zero City’s fall should not have spread out just yet.</em></p>
 <p>“Do you find it strange?” The monster laughed loudly. “In this world, there is no such thing as an eternally invincible fortress! Those Zero City fools. Despite possessing so much power, they never used them. All they did was hide inside their fortress, dragging out an ignoble existence and struggling to live while on death’s door! They deserved extermination! However, we who possess the will and courage to stand up and fight are the future of the Awakened ones!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian waited patiently for the monster to finish before asking coolly, “Chinese?”</p>
 <p>“Eh?” The question took the monster by surprise.</p>
 <p>“Dragging out an ignoble existence, struggling to live while on death’s door <sup><a id="ref1" href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>. Not a bad use of the two idioms,” said Chen Xiaolian with a smile. “However, if I have to guess, you must be still young. Otherwise, you would not have so much Middle Second syndrome (chuuni) thoughts.” <sup><a id="ref2" href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
 <p>“Bastard! You dare act with such impudence toward me?!” The monster roared. “I will beat you to submission first. When you are kneeling before me, begging for mercy, you will understand!”</p>
 <p>“This is some serious Middle Second syndrome here… …” Chen Xiaolian sighed. Next, he crouched his body, Sword in the Stone in hand, and leapt forward.</p>
 <p>The monster sneered and let out a derisive laugh.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian raised the sword in his hand. Suddenly, as he was vaulting through the air, he felt himself slamming into something akin to an invisible wall. Next, the monster bellowed and a powerful unseen force pummelled Chen Xiaolian, sending him flying backward.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The powerful unseen force sent Chen Xiaolian smashing into the wall behind, causing the surface of the wall to cave in. Chen Xiaolian’s whole body was stuck on the wall and cracks spread out across the surface of the wall.</p>
 <p>After falling down to the ground, Chen Xiaolian felt his lips and saw blood on his fingers.</p>
 <p>“Quite painful,” said Chen Xiaolian with a frown. Next, however, he revealed a smile.</p>
 <p>He slowly got up and twisted his neck a little. “The feeling of pain in my body is quite realistic.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Chen Xiaolian looked forward and made a hooking finger gesture at the monster. “Is that it? Can you do more? For example, can you cut off my hands or legs?”</p>
 <p>The monster was in the middle of laughing triumphantly when it heard Chen Xiaolian’s words. It halted and gaped at Chen Xiaolian. “You, what did you say?”</p>
 <p>“You heard me.” Chen Xiaolian swung his arms about. “It really does hurt.”</p>
 <p>He then slowly turned and regarded his surroundings. “This parking lot also looks like the real thing. Ah… … let me think, why did you turn off the lights? I understand now. You are afraid that the details are not good enough and that I might see through it, right?”</p>
 <p>The monster’s body flinched slightly. “You… … I do not know what you are talking about!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian responded with a “Ha!” as he stepped forward once more. He raised the Sword in the Stone in his hand and was about to hack down with it when the monster roared out once more.</p>
 <p>Once again, Chen Xiaolian was sent flying. This time however, he slammed onto the roof of a nearby car, causing the roof of the car to deform inward.</p>
 <p>“See the difference in strength? If you do not want to die, then hurry up and surrender! Obey me and prosper, defy me and perish!” the monster howled.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian climbed his way down from the roof of the car and hissed for breath. “You don’t say. It sure does hurt. What is this? Disrupt my brain functions, hack my pain receptors so that my brain thinks I am actually hurt, is that how it works? How much more can you push it? Can you kill me on the spot? Trick my brain to think that I am dead and let my body react to that? Or cut my arms and legs… … that would mean tricking the brain into thinking that I had lost my limbs, leaving me paralyzed or disabled.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian staggered forward as he mumbled those words. Seeing that, the monster subconsciously took a few steps back. It widened its eye, “You… … do you not fear death?”</p>
 <p>“I fear it. Of course, I fear death. I still have many unfinished tasks before me. How could I just die right here?” Chen Xiaolian shook his head. “However, while I am fearful of death, there is no need for me to fear you. You have no ability to kill me.”</p>
 <p>“You… … it seems you have not suffered enough!” The monster forced out a laugh.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian smiled and said, “Let me guess how old you are. 15? 16? You are not an adult yet, right? Second Middle syndrome patient?”</p>
 <p>“You bastard!”</p>
 <p>The monster roared once more, sending Chen Xiaolian flying again.</p>
 <p>After getting up this time, Chen Xiaolian knitted his brows and mumbled to himself, “Mm, the feeling of pain seems to have reached its limit. It is not getting any worse. Looks like this is your limit, eh? However, this simulation is quite interesting. I am actually incapable of using my skills or strength. Mm, let me guess… … you probably do not know what level my skill is at, so you are unable to simulate it?”</p>
 <p>The monster’s rate of breathing had turned ragged. It would appear that it was under a heavy strain.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s whole body was clearly wounded. However, when the monster saw him stepping toward it, one step at a time, it let out a soft cry and took a few steps backward again.</p>
 <p>“Afraid?” Chen Xiaolian shook his head and smiled. “According to the present state of affairs, the one in an advantageous position should be you.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Chen Xiaolian took another two steps forward.</p>
 <p>This time, the monster screamed, “You psycho! Bastard!”</p>
 <p>It turned around and ran.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian suddenly stopped moving. He closed his eyes. At the same time, his hand reached out behind him and made a grabbing motion.</p>
 <p>In an instant, his body flashed forward a distance of tens of metres and his hand caught hold of the monster’s neck.</p>
 <p>Next, something strange happened.</p>
 <p>At his height, it was impossible for Chen Xiaolian to grab a three-metre tall monster by the neck.</p>
 <p>However, that was what just happened. Moreover, the monster in his hand suddenly shrank.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, the humongous body shrank until it was somewhere near Chen Xiaolian’s height.</p>
 <p>“Caught you, little fellow.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian opened his eyes and a slight look of ridicule appeared on his smile.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>The parking lot remained the same. However, the cracked wall and the smashed car had disappeared.</p>
 <p>The bodies of Lun Tai and Bei Tai on the ground had also disappeared.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian stood there, the clothes he wore unblemished. He appeared undamaged at all. However, his muscles and bones were faintly aching. Those were the only proof of the attacks he suffered earlier.</p>
 <p>There in Chen Xiaolian’s outstretched hand was a human figure’s neck. The figure struggled to free himself.</p>
 <p>It was no monster. It was… …</p>
 <p>A rather young kid.</p>
 <p>“As expected, you are a middle schooler,” said Chen Xiaolian with a smile.</p>
 <p>“You, you, you, let me go! If you dare hurt me, my companions will definitely kill you! Kill everyone in your guild!” The youngster struggled with all his might. The way he talked was the same as the monster’s. However, his voice had become a high-pitched voice of one who had yet to undergo voice break.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian released this person. He watched as the youngster crouched on the ground, both hands clutching his neck as he gasped for air. Chen Xiaolian then crouched down and looked at him closely, “Kid, now is the time for you to surrender, am I right?”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Chen Xiaolian pulled the fellow up and pinned him against the car.</p>
 <p>“Now, you will answer my questions! Understand? Although you are a minor, you are still an Awakened. I would say the Minors Protection Act do not apply to you, right? If you do not want to suffer, then be obedient and answer my questions. Otherwise… … you know as well, a veteran is someone who has killed plenty of people.”</p>
 <p>The youngster was scared stiff just looking at Chen Xiaolian. He gulped.</p>
 <p>Looking at him up close, this kid had a very average appearance. He appeared lacking in the ferocity of a monster. He was the type that would go unnoticed when standing among others.</p>
 <p>However, there were a lot of blackheads on his nose and acnes on his forehead. Chen Xiaolian could also smell the scent of cigarette from him.</p>
 <p>“It seems you are not just a middle schooler, you are also a bad boy.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian did not hesitate to reach out with his hand to pull out a packet of cigarette from the kid’s pocket. After giving it a glance, Chen Xiaolian kept it in his own pocket.</p>
 <p>“That is mine… …”</p>
 <p>The youngster opened his mouth only to be forced to close it after seeing Chen Xiaolian’s glare.</p>
