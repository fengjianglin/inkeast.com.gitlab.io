 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 654 Follow Me And Don’t Be Tardy&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian, who was gasping lightly, hid behind a stone statue. Slowly, he peeked his head out to observe the square before the Pantheon Temple.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There were around six Irregularities standing in the square. All of them kept firing with their weapons up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Up in the sky, Sister Yun was fighting against roughly eight Irregularities. Due to the supporting fire coming from below, there was no way to decide which side was winning for now.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Among the Irregularities in the square was a tall and thin man with a sinister face. He held a silver-coloured longbow but there was no quiver of arrows on him. Yet, he continued pulling his bow. Every time he released the string of his bow, an energy-based arrow would shoot out. Even with a distance of nearly 1,000 metres between them, his arrows were able to shoot toward Sister Yun’s vital spots.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The other Irregularities, however, do not appear too strong. Only, all of them were wielding powerful futuristic weapons.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A Thunderstorm Tank and even two mechs could be seen on the ground. They adjusted their weapons system to long-ranged fire mode and unleashed a constant barrage of bullets into the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As for the Irregularities who were circling and attacking Sister Yun in the sky, it would appear that they were the elite guardians of the Pantheon Temple.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Among the eight Irregularities up there, the man with the Chinese halberd was the strongest. Every time he brandished his halberd, a small area of the surrounding space would crack apart. It was such that not even Sister Yun could face it head on. She could only dodge it before retaliating.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In addition, there was also a white-robed magus who hovered at a distance while swinging his magic staff, unleashing cones of ice and searing flames toward Sister Yun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>By Chen Xiaolian’s estimate, even the weakest among them was at [A] class. With the two Irregularities leading the attack against Sister Yun and the supporting fire from the Irregularities on the ground, the defenders were able to force Sister Yun into a stalemate.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian and Bluesea exchanged glances. They slowly shook their heads.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At that moment, there was only way to enter the Pantheon Temple, and that was through the open square before the temple. Unfortunately, the Irregularities providing fire support to the Irregularities up in the sky were all scattered around the square, leaving no room for them to slip in.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Judging by the situation at hand, it would appear that there was no chance for the two of them to sneak in.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Rushing in under such circumstances was no different from walking to their deaths.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Since utilizing the Overwhelming Sunlight Purification skill, Chen Xiaolian had yet to regain all of his attributes. Not to mention, Skyblade’s power had been completely combusted in the process.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although Bluesea had been fortunate enough to acquire the Bug Armour, resulting in a boost to his fleshly strength, the Bug Armour was still something that depended on the attributes of its host. No matter how much stronger an ordinary human became thanks to the Bug Armour, he would be unable to stop the long-term effects of using the armour. Chen Xiaolian had noticed this particular weakness in their battle against Sebast. Utilizing the double-handed beam blaster allowed Bluesea to unleash a great deal of power for a short time. In return, however, it would suck up his stamina at a rapid rate.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian cast a questioning look at Bluesea, but Bluesea shook his head. He shut his eyes and entered a state of silence.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After a while, Bluesea reopened his eyes and whispered to Chen Xiaolian. “Can those Irregularities remember everyone on their side?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The question took Chen Xiaolian by surprise. After a moment’s consideration, he slowly shook his head. “I think… … that is unlikely.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea considered it before saying, “Later on, just follow behind me. Don’t say anything. Leave it all to me.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Then, without waiting for Chen Xiaolian’s reply, Bluesea moved out from the back of the statue and ran toward the square.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As he was running forward, he raised up his right arm. The Bug Armour on his arm formed a hi-temperature heat blaster and he shot at the sky non-stop.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, he had deliberately reduced the power behind each blast down to its minimum. Additionally, nearly 90 per cent of his attacks missed. Only one or two had been done after properly aiming at Sister Yun. Not to mention, those attacks were all easy to deflect. Yet, amid the many shots fired from below, his did not appear conspicuous.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian quickly rushed out as well to follow behind Bluesea.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Irregularities within the square quickly noticed the arrival of Bluesea and Chen Xiaolian. Glancing back, they saw that Bluesea was also attacking Sister Yun, who was up in the sky. Seeing that, they let their guard down and turned their attention back toward Sister Yun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As Bluesea was firing up into the sky, he carefully regarded the Irregularities within the square. One of them immediately caught his attention. The person held onto an energy-tier sniper rifle and was continuously firing out clusters of plasma bullets into the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Among all the Irregularities within the square, his equipment looked to be the most unremarkable.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>In World’s End, the stronger the Irregularity, the easier it would be for him or her to seize good equipment. Unless that someone possessed Heavenly defying luck, high quality equipment such as the Thunderstorm Tank was something that only high-level experts could possess.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As for these Irregularities, it was likely that the mechs and Thunderstorm Tank there were equipment temporarily provided by the Coalition. This was the headquarters of the Coalition, after all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Putting those inferences together, it meant that the one with the worst equipment was also the one with the weakest level of strength.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A weaker Irregularity also meant he had less knowledge. In this World’s End, the chances of him not knowing them would only increase.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Senior! What is going on here?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea rushed before the Irregularity, his hand continuously shooting upward as he turned to ask, “We have just cleared an instance dungeon and are on our way back to the Palace to report. Instead, we found that Mt Olympus has… … turned like this! That woman up in the sky… … just who is she?!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“The Hell do I know?” The Irregularity only gave Bluesea a glance before turning his attention back toward the sky. Keeping his other eye shut, he looked through the scope to aim at Sister Yun, who was still fighting up in the sky, and pulled the trigger without respite. “This person suddenly appeared out of the blue and broke the restrictive barrier without any warning! Thankfully, it just so happens that there are quite some people reporting here. With Sir Bu Dong here, that damned woman will not be able to escape! Eh… … wait!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He turned to look at Chen Xiaolian, who stood behind Bluesea with a bewildered expression. The Irregularity asked, “Why are you not attacking?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“This bro of mine is a melee fighter. For this refresh cycle, we had yet to pick up a long-ranged weapon,” said Bluesea without turning to face him. He kept his head raised upward to look at Sister Yun as he opened fire again. “At such a critical juncture, is the Coalition still not willing to distribute weapons?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Everyone is right here! Who could have the time to distribute weapons?” Hearing that Chen Xiaolian did not even have a basic long-ranged weapon, the Irregularity revealed a look of disdain. “Recently, so many high-end equipment had made its way into World’s End, how is it that you two had failed to acquire any? Just how were you two going about your lives?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Bad luck… … just bad luck…” Bluesea smiled in response. “Then… … we can’t just let my bro here watch and do nothing.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Get in, get in!” The Irregularity pointed at the Pantheon Temple contemptuously and waved them in. “Go to the storeroom and see if there are any more remaining!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Thank you, senior!” Bluesea quickly pulled Chen Xiaolian with him as he stepped toward the Pantheon Temple. “We will be back as soon as possible!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Wait up!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea had only taken a few steps forward when the Irregularity called out once more. “You two are just going to go? Do you even know where the storeroom is?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Without skipping a beat, Bluesea turned and said with a smile, “Previously, I did not have much of a chance to enter the Palace. So, I am not too familiar with its layout. However, seeing as how senior is busy, I dared not ask for fear of disturbing you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Irregularity regarded Bluesea from head to toe before letting out a low snort. “No wonder. Looking at your fresh-looking face, you are probably just a minor character. So be it, I will lead you fellows inside!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian’s heart gave a thump. However, before he could say anything, he heard Bluesea speak up in a respectful tone, “Thank you, senior!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Follow me! And don’t be tardy!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The Irregularity waved Bluesea along as he hastily made his way to the entrance of the Pantheon Temple.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bluesea and Chen Xiaolian swiftly exchanged glances. They could see traces of dismay in each other’s eyes. Even so, they chose to follow the Irregularity and quickly made their way into the Pantheon Temple.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although it was still somewhat troublesome… … at least, they would not need to confront those within the square.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
