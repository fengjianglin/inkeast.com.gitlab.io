 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 677 Finished </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Bai Qi! You! Are you really not going to stop this?!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun punched Bai Qi in the face once again, smashing him heavily down the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A large crater erupted into existence within the desert. The very next instant, however, the numerous specks of sand flew up as Bai Qi jumped out from the crater, charging at Sister Yun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Given Bai Qi’s present level of strength, it was not difficult for Sister Yun to kill him. However, given their friendship, Sister Yun could not bring herself to do so.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even though they had killed each other back in the battle for Thirty-three Heavens…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Also, after fighting him for so long, Sister Yun finally realized something amiss.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bai Qi… he was growing stronger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Every time Sister Yun’s fist struck Bai Qi’s face, a near inexistent stream of black energies would flow out from her body into Bai Qi’s body before disappearing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Every time he absorbed the black energies, Bai Qi’s strength and speed would increase by several notches.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, Sister Yun did not feel her strength getting absorbed. On the contrary, her strength was increasing at the same rate.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>That was how the two of them could continue the fight for all this time, even though Bai Qi was the one who kept getting hammered in the face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun’s surprise grew. A shocking speculation had begun to form within her mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Earlier, Bai Qi would occasionally repeat those words with a mechanical tone. Now, however, he said nothing. He simply charged at Sister Yun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun sent Bai Qi flying once more. Finally, he did not choose to charge her again. Instead, he stood up and remained still.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Zhao… Yun.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Bai Qi turned his gaze toward Sister Yun. Despite the indifferent expression on his face, his eyes revealed a more life within them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Power, returned. No longer, suppressing you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You…” Sister Yun was stunned. “Back then, you…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You, return, find me.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After saying that, Bai Qi ignored her. There was a trace of exhaustion on his face. Turning away from Sister Yun, he then made his way toward Chen Xiaolian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Consolidate, time. Sleep.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Standing before Chen Xiaolian, Bai Qi only uttered those words before disappearing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian was stunned. He abruptly jumped to his feet. Only then did he realize that the Puppet Plant within his body had been cleared by the antibodies that Bluesea injected into him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He looked at Sister Yun, and the unconscious Qiao Qiao behind him and released a gentle sigh. Standing before Bluesea’s corpse, he slowly crouched down. Reaching out with his hand, he placed his hand on his shoulder. His mouth was opened, but he said nothing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“He died?” Sister Yun made her way to stand beside Chen Xiaolian. Lowering her head to look at Bluesea, she said softly, “A pity, he is a decent man.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“If…” Chen Xiaolian had wanted to say “If you could arrive sooner, Bluesea would not have died’. However, after uttering only one word, he stopped himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Life and death are determined by fate, abundance and prosperity are determined by Heaven.” Sister Yun gave Chen Xiaolian a glance and moved toward Qiao Qiao. Extending a finger, she flicked it gently and the two blades of light shattered apart. “Take care of the living first.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Crouching down, she then checked Qiao Qiao’s wounds and nodded her head. “It is nothing, just external wounds. Even without healing substances, they will heal on their own with some time… … wait.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Her brows suddenly furrowed together.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What is wrong with Qiao Qiao?” Chen Xiaolian immediately panicked and he rushed over.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“She is fine.” Sister Yun shook her head and turned her head to look into the distant horizon. “It is just… … there is an annoying spectator.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian was astonished. He used his life signature detector to scan their surroundings but found no other life forms around them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“He is very far away, you won’t find him. Wait for me, I will deal with it quickly.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After saying that, Sister Yun walked toward a small dune located not too far from them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There atop the dune was a small and near unnoticeable leaf, fluttering about gently.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After flying helter-skelter through several instance dungeon areas, Lei Hu landed. Finding a suitable spot, he hid himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Naturally, he did not have the courage to return to the Pantheon Temple anymore. That was where the King used to reside. As the King had returned to World’s End, there was a possibility that he would return to the Pantheon Temple.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At that very moment, Lei Hu ardently hoped that Chen Xiaolian’s mockful words were true.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The King had not returned to World’s End on his own, but was brought in as Chen Xiaolian’s War Pet.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At least, that way… … he would still leave.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>And yet, the allure of a chance to return to the outside world continued to sway Lei Hu’s heart.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Staying in World’s End. Sooner or later, it will end with death.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The few, most powerful Irregularities have all died.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Truth be told, he never had much confidence in the clearing operation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Be it the instance dungeons or Awakened ones, all of them were continuously being refreshed into World’s End. Not to mention, the Awakened ones might move about on their own. In face of the ever-increasing number of Awakened ones and instance dungeons, Lei Hu suspected that it may be impossible to complete the clearing operation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Originally, his ultimate goal was still to return to the outside world. As long as he could succeed, there was no need for him to care about what will happen to World’s End.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>But now…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After hesitating for the longest time, Lei Hu made up his mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At the very least… … he should keep watch from afar.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>This skill Lei Hu was using was known as Myriad Woods of Spring. It was also a skill that could be developed through self-cultivation. The higher the skill’s level, the more plants he could control.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He tossed the seed for a Watermoon Flower Mirror into the cracks within a piece of concrete and the plant quickly grew up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The plant only had one leaf, which rested calmly on a thick stalk. The front surface of the leaf was as smooth as a mirror.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>From underground, a root continuously grew, making its way far into the distance.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Soon, an image appeared on the Watermoon Flower Mirror.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu carefully adjusted the Watermoon Flower Mirror on the other end to inspect the situation in its surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Unexpectedly, the first thing he saw was Bai Qi getting punched into the ground by Sister Yun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>This woman… … she actually found her way here!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu had once used his Foresight skill to divine out her existence. Thus, he had left a batch of the most powerful Irregularities back at the Pantheon Temple. Unexpectedly, this woman was stronger than he had expected.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>Even the King is no match for her?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>How could there be someone as powerful as that in this world?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>No… perhaps…</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu’s mind suddenly thought of something else.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>If, for some reason, the King had really become Chen Xiaolian’s War Pet and his strength declined greatly, this might be a reasonable situation…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>That woman… she may not be as powerful as he had imagined?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu’s mind began to race once more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>When Bai Qi finally stopped attacking and disappeared beside Chen Xiaolian, Lei Hu’s heart began thumping vigorously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Clearly, the King had not been summoned out by Chen Xiaolian. Rather, he had appeared due to some other reason. Otherwise, Chen Xiaolian would have summoned the King out right from the start.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>If so, it might still be possible…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As he was pondering the matter, Lei Hu suddenly saw the woman rushing forward. She was moving toward the other end of his Watermoon Mirror Flower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>She crouched down and looked at the Watermoon Mirror Flower on the other end. There was a displeased expression on her face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Seen enough?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You…” Looking at the cold face gazing into the Watermoon Mirror Flower, Lei Hu blurted out a word before recalling that the Watermoon Mirror Flower could only transmit images and sound in one direction.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Next, Lei Hu watched as the woman raised a finger and pressed down on the other end of the plant.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The picture before Lei Hu suddenly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Unbeknown to him, when Sister Yun gently tapped the plant on her end, a ripple, similar to water ripples, emerged from her finger to make contact with the Watermoon Mirror Flower, making contact with the little leaf.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The leaf continued to sway gently, as though nothing had happened.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“What did you do?” Chen Xiaolian watched as Sister Yun returned. He asked with a frown.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>She had made her way to the sand dune, tapped a small grass there and returned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That fellow, I finished him off.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Sister Yun said nonchalantly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Damn it! I was discovered!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Lei Hu jumped to his feet, slightly flustered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Since the woman had found the Watermoon Mirror Flower, it was possible for her to follow its root to find his spot.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He cannot stay there and fight her.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although Lei Hu did not have the same level of fear toward her as he did the King, he was someone who would only make his move after having confirmed the strength of his opponents.</span></p>
