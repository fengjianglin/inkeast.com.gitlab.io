 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span><strong>GOR Chapter 607 Part 1 Tian Lie’s Request </strong></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><br></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><em><span>The one… … whose hair is not red?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The astonished Chen Xiaolian turned to look at Tian Lie and his heart gave a thump.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Just now, he was the only one to walk through the door.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He was the only one to see the two old monsters within the white space.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Appearance wise, the punk youngster seemed to be only around 18 to 19 years old while the red-haired woman, too, looked fairly young. However, Chen Xiaolian knew all too well that the two of them were monstrosities who have lived through who knew how long. External appearance was something that could be modified.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>If so… how could Tian Lie know that one of the two had red hair?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After a moment of silence, a voice spoke up from the sky. “Why are you looking for me?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Chen Xiaolian frowned inwardly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Although this voice sounded deep like that of a man, Chen Xiaolian, who had met the two monsters, could identify the voice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Currently, the one talking to Tian Lie was the red-haired woman.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Given the fact that those two monsters possessed near GM-like authority within the instance dungeon, changing their voices was a simple matter for them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Despite that, Chen Xiaolian said nothing. He simply pondered the matter in secrecy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie had his face looking upward as he said loudly, “There is this person. You owe this person a big favour.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Me? Owing others? Nonsense!” The red-haired woman said with a dismissive snort. “Who in this world could I owe a favour to?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie smiled and continued, “He once mentioned, should he encounter a problem he could not solve, the only one who is willing to help him, the only one who can help him, is you alone. And now, he has likely encountered the aforementioned problem.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Who is he?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Shen.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A raging roar suddenly reverberated through the sky of the colosseum, like a clap of thunder spreading through the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Next, the space within the arena abruptly twisted. A pair of fair white hands appeared without any warning to tear the fabric of space.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>A red-haired figure in white emerged from the resulting spatial tear. With a flash, the figure appeared before Tian Lie.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“That name, say it one more time!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>At that very moment, there was an incomparably ferocious expression on the red-haired woman’s face as she glared intently at Tian Lie. Her eyes had turned as red as her hair.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Shen. I said, his name is Shen.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The moment Tian Lie saw the woman, he knew that things had taken a wrong turn. However, he did not reveal any look of fear. Instead, he simply smiled and replied.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Those words had just left his mouth when his feet suddenly flew upward. His entire body hovered in the air.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Several finger marks appeared on the surface of his neck. It was as though the red-haired woman was tightly choking his neck with her hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>However, the red-haired woman had not made any moves.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Even so, Tian Lie’s face was that of normalcy. In fact, there was a little look of disdain in his eyes. If that was a normal human in his shoes, that person would have long since struggled due to suffocation. For Tian Lie, however, the only change to him was the appearance of the faint metallic colour on the neck areas where the finger marks had appeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Looking closely, it was possible to see that there were minute streams of data flowing beneath the transformed layer of skin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“This little fellow’s skill is metal digitization. You think attacks like that bring any effect on him? Seriously… … getting stupider…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Another voice spoke up from the sky. It was the punk youngster, who had remained concealed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Shut up!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>There was a terrifying expression on the red-haired woman’s face. With a wave of her hand, Tian Lie’s massive body was sent flying. With an air-piercing sound, his body shot through the air like an artillery blast before slamming into the side area of the stands.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Half of the stands area collapsed as a result.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“It has been so long… … you still hold such a grudge against Shen…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It appeared that the punk youngster had no intention of appearing. Only his voice could be heard coming from the sky, echoing throughout the colosseum.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie stood up from amid the dust and rubble, causing broken rocks to fall around. He dusted his body before walking toward the centre of the colosseum once more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Seeing the nonchalant face on Tian Lie’s face, the expression of fury on the red-haired woman grew more intense. As she was about to make another move, a hand gently pressed down on her shoulder.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The punk youngster had, at an unknown moment, appeared behind her.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“See for yourself, he is not hurt at all. Here, you have no way of killing him. Even if you continue beating him up for the whole day, it is pointless, no?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The punk youngster smiled at the red-haired woman and continued, “Besides… … he said he is looking for me.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The red-haired woman abruptly turned her head to glare at the punk youngster. “Are you done being a busybody?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The punk youngster shrugged and pursed his lips to the side. “I am just giving you a suggestion. If you are bored to the point where beating up a sandbag who cannot feel pain feels like a… … mm, interesting thing to do, well, do whatever you like. I can just wait on the side lines until you are done.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After saying that, the punk youngster turned around and walked away. Seating himself in a corner with one knee up, he snapped his finger. Next, a bottle of coke appeared from thin air before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After unscrewing the bottle of coke, he took in a large mouthful. After that, he gave a loud burp and waved at the red-haired woman. “Go on, show me your sandbag hitting skills. Work hard, I will be watching you!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The red-haired woman turned around and glared at the punk youngster.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The two of them exchanged glances for a long time. The punk youngster’s face maintained that lackadaisical expression while the red-haired woman’s face only grew increasingly livid.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After a long time had passed, the red-haired woman suddenly turned her head. Charging toward Tian Lie, she sent her left hand out and her fingers pierced through Tian Lie’s right shoulder like a blade.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie should have possessed the ability to transform his body into streams of data. However, after the red-haired woman’s palm stabbed into him, Tian Lie found that he could no longer do anything to extricate himself. He was completely pinned down. Next, his body was slammed down the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The red-haired woman’s right fist became like a tempest as it struck Tian Lie’s body repeatedly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Knowing that he was no match for the old monster before him, Tian Lie was too lazy to put up a fight. No matter how powerful the red-haired woman’s strikes were, they were unable to bring him pain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The force behind every one of the red-haired woman’s punch was the equivalent of the force of a battering ram. Booming sounds echoed throughout the colosseum.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie’s body was bombarded by her punches and a huge crater was formed on the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The red-haired woman unleashed one final, heavy punch down at Tian Lie. After that, however, she saw that there was only a look of indifference on Tian Lie’s face. She then released a lengthy sigh. After sending another glare toward the punk youngster, she turned around and walked away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>As she was walking, a door appeared before her. In but an instant, she made her way through the door. Next, the door disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“I have to say, you sure are lucky.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>It just so happened that the punk youngster had just finished his bottle of coke. He tossed the bottle aside, but the bottle disappeared even before it reached the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He stood up and walked to stand before the crater. Crouching down, he looked at Tian Lie, who remained lying within the crater. “Mm, although she cannot kill you while you are inside this instance dungeon… … if your skill is not this digitization type capable of blocking off pain… … it is still easy for her to put you through hell for a bit. Can you get up on your own?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie turned to look at the punk youngster and nodded. Pushing with both hands, Tian Lie vaulted up from the crater and landed on his feet.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>The punk youngster regarded Tian Lie and smiled. “Quite the good disposition. To be able to remain so calm after receiving a beating from her… for an [S] class… mm, not an easy feat.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Hearing the punk youngster’s words, Tian Lie turned and gave Chen Xiaolian a solemn look: <em>Thanks to you.</em></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>After their exchange of glances, Chen Xiaolian quickly understood what Tian Lie meant.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>He had ‘died’ once and was resurrected as an Irregularity. Thus, his Tian Lie personality had merged with that of Da Gang.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>If not for that, given the original Tian Lie’s character, would he allow the red-haired woman to treat him like a sandbag?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>While the red-haired woman may not have any means of killing Tian Lie within this instance dungeon – even if Tian Lie retaliated against her attacks, it would not solve anything. Instead, it would only cause the others to be stuck there longer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>If being patient could solve the issue, well, be patient.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Well, then. That woman has left. Although she could see everything that happens here regardless, I believe… …” The punk youngster smiled and said, “Given her current state, I think she is in no mood to be looking at us. Tell me, Shen… what kind of trouble did he encounter?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie shook his head. “I… … do not know either.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“You do not know?” The punk youngster knitted his brows and smiled wryly. “It seems this is quite a big problem. At the very least, tell me what you know.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Shen has gone missing. No one can make contact with him.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Missing?” The punk youngster looked at Tian Lie. “He is a Player. Players are never a part of this world. If he does not log in, you will not be able to contact him. Isn’t that only normal?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie slowly shook his head. “That is not it. He has already gone missing for a long time. It is such that… … Thorned Flower Guild has entered a state of internal strife.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>“Is that so…” The punk youngster rubbed his chin and said with a serious tone, “Where was he last seen? Did you try to find him there?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>Tian Lie shook his head. “I am unable to go there. According to what I can gather, the place where he was last seen, where he had gone missing, is a place that we were never able to enter. Moreover… … at present, that place no longer exist.”</span></p>
