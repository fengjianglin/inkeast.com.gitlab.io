<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><strong>GOR Chapter 436 Guild… Leader…</strong></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s first objective was the 76-year-old Will Ritz Beyliah residing in 38 Bonfrettt Street.</p>
 <p>When the first phase begun earlier, Chen Xiaolian and Lun Tai had led their groups to act separately. This 76-year-old Will was Lun Tai’s target.</p>
 <p>Originally, the distance between Bonfrettt Street and their original position was shorter compared to the distance between them and Alfasi Street.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chen Xiaolian’s target was farther away.</p>
 <p>In the end, Chen Xiaolian’s group was the one to find their target first.</p>
 <p>That happened because Lun Tai’s group had encountered fights between participants on the way to their target and were thus delayed. Finally, before they could reach their target’s address, Chen Xiaolian had found the seven-year-old Will. Since their team had obtained the quest target, Lun Tai’s group abandoned getting to their target and moved to meet up with Chen Xiaolian’s group.</p>
 <p>At present, Chen Xiaolian, who had left his team, was going to meet the 76-year-old target.</p>
 <p>He drove the car until he reached Bonfrett Street. As the car moved, Chen Xiaolian searched for the house number that he was looking for. When the car was making a turn into a corner, he saw an open yard.</p>
 <p>The house number was nailed to the external surface of the door. It was none other than the number 38.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian immediately hit the brakes.</p>
 <p>He sat in the car, a frown on his face as he surveyed the open yard.</p>
 <p>Clearly, this was a small hospital.</p>
 <p>Surprisingly, the area inside the yard and the area outside were like two different worlds.</p>
 <p>The area outside the yard was empty, just like a ghost town. But inside, things were different. Doctors, nurses, patients and various other people could be seen walking before the entrance of the hospital. Some were being pushed on wheelchairs as they moved around.</p>
 <p>It seemed as though the system had completely cut out the inside area of the yard, where the hospital lay, and the outside area.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s heart gave a pound and he took a deep breath before stepping out of the car.</p>
 <p>When he stepped into the yard, Chen Xiaolian felt something strange. It was the same sense of strangeness that he felt when he stepped into the street where he found the seven-year-old Will.</p>
 <p>It was as though… … the people here could not see him.</p>
 <p><em>It seems the system is still separating this hospital’s plane of existence from mine.</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian moved inside with a solemn expression.</p>
 <p>The hospital was not too big – due to the difference in population and the share per capita for medical resources, it was rare to find a large public hospital like the ones in China in European countries. The high number of people going to the big public hospitals in China was a rare sight here as well.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian stepped forward into the hospital building – appearance wise, this building only had around five or six floors.</p>
 <p>The outpatient area on the first floor was very quiet. Even in the waiting area, the people there were either reading newspaper or fiddling with their mobile phones and would rarely talk.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian headed directly to the elevator.</p>
 <p>Five minutes later, Chen Xiaolian walked along the corridor of the third floor, the ward area. It did not take long for him to find what he was looking for.</p>
 <p>On the left side of the corridor was the door to the second ward area. Chen Xiaolian looked at the patient’s name written on the door.</p>
 <p>Will Ritz Beyliah.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian took a deep breath and stepped inside.</p>
 <p>There was another person in the ward. This person was clearly one of the care support worker and she sat before a patient. She held a newspaper in her hand and read aloud, likely reading for the patient.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian stood inside the ward and observed the surrounding furnishing.</p>
 <p>There were two beds. One was empty while the one closest to the door had a thin old man on it.</p>
 <p>An oxygen tube was inserted into his nose and each time he drew breath, the sound of broken bellows could be heard.</p>
 <p>Among the medical instruments beside the patient was a heart rate monitor machine.</p>
 <p>The support care worker inside the ward did not notice Chen Xiaolian at all – she was simply incapable of seeing Chen Xiaolian, who was in a different plane of existence. She continued reading a piece of social news from the newspaper.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian stood beside the bed and silently looked at the old man lying on the bed.</p>
 <p>The old man had thin hair and they had all gone white. He had a withered, skeletal looking face.</p>
 <p>His eyes were closed and it was uncertain if he was sleeping or not.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian walked along the bed to stand beside him.</p>
 <p>Looking at the medical equipment beside the old patient, it was clear that this old patient was not in a good situation. Under the bed sheets, there were tubes connecting to … … an urine bag.</p>
 <p>The old patient was also wearing a suprapubic catheter.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian frowned.</p>
 <p>At that very moment, the doors to the ward were pushed open and a bald middle-aged doctor in white coat entered. The support care worker quickly got up; there was a very courteous expression on her face.</p>
 <p>“How is he?” the bald doctor asked casually as he walked to the side of the bed. He reached out with his hand to touch the old patient’s forehead. Next, he pulled out a torchlight and pulled up the patient’s eyelids to check.</p>
 <p>He then picked up the medical record placed on the shelf beside the bed and looked over it.</p>
 <p>“Everything is normal.” The support care worker sighed before revealing a wry smile. “He is already like this. How much worse can he get?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian stood beside the doctor and glanced at the medical record that the doctor was holding.</p>
 <p>He noted many cerebrovascular related names… well, he was not familiar with medical terms…</p>
 <p>“His situation is still very stable. No improvement and also no deterioration.” The bald doctor put down the record. “Is he still not showing any response to external stimuli?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.” The support care worker raised the newspaper in her hand. “I have been reading the news for him every day. However, I do not know if he can hear me or not. He is presently unable to talk or move. Sometimes, he can open his eyes but he cannot communicate at all.”</p>
 <p>“If so… … just go on, then.” The bald doctor sighed. “May God bless him.”</p>
 <p>As the doctor was moving out of the ward, the support care worker quickly went after him. “Dr Kras, the support care department is very lacking in personnel. At present, we only have three people per day. I am about at my limit here. When can we increase the number of personnel? I…”</p>
 <p>The support care worker went out after the doctor, leaving only Chen Xiaolian and the old patient, who was lying on the bed.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian sighed. He turned around and went back to the bedridden old patient’s side.</p>
 <p>He reached out with his hand and placed his fingers on the old patient.</p>
 <p>Then, as though sensing something, the old patient finally opened his eyes.</p>
 <p>A pair of absent-minded eyes swivelled around weakly. Then, his pupils contracted and his gaze fell upon Chen Xiaolian’s face.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s heart gave a pound and he said, “You can see me, right?”</p>
 <p>His heart pounded with excitement.</p>
 <p><em>He can see me! </em></p>
 <p><em>What does this mean? </em></p>
 <p><em>It means… this old patient is a special existence just like the seven-year-old Will!</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian quickly leaned closer and he stared into the old man’s eyes. “Can you see me?”</p>
 <p>The bedridden old patient’s eyes trembled and his rate of breathing suddenly shot up. The sound of broken bellows became more intense.</p>
 <p>He was unable to move or say anything. He could only stare at Chen Xiaolian as passion and excitement seemingly gushed out of those absent-minded eyes.</p>
 <p>It was clear that he was struggling to send a signal of some sort. However, his body was no longer capable of doing that.</p>
 <p>“Beep beep beep beep beep…”</p>
 <p>The heart rate monitor machine beside the bed revealed that the old patient’s heart rate was rapidly increasing. His blood pressure was also rising.</p>
 <p>His rate of breathing grew even faster and his lips trembled as though he was attempting to say something.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian thought of something and he quickly pulled out a healing medicinal substance – this was a spicy bar ([Beginner] class Healing Medicinal Substance) that he had prepared before entering the instance dungeon. In order to avoid any unexpected circumstances, he had utilized a juicer in the island base to turn it into a cream state and put it into a plastic tube like that of a toothpaste tube.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian squeezed out some of it and stuffed it into the old patient’s mouth. Although the old patient was unable to chew, his saliva could dilute a portion of the cream and bring it into his throat.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian waited beside the bed.</p>
 <p>It did not take long for a special expression to appear on the bedridden patient.</p>
 <p>The sounds “Huh huh” appeared from his throat.</p>
 <p>“Beep beep beep beep…” His heart rate and blood pressure continued accelerating.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the old patient’s lips moved and he attempted to say something.</p>
 <p>The doors to the ward suddenly flew open as the bald doctor and several nurses rushed inside.</p>
 <p>“Hurry! Something has happened to the patient!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian ignored their arrival. As for the old patient, he kept his eyes on Chen Xiaolian.</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian leaned down, placing his ear beside the old man’s mouth.</p>
 <p>This time, he finally caught what the old patient was saying.</p>
 <p>When he heard it, Chen Xiaolian’s face abruptly twisted.</p>
 <p>Because he had heard it clearly. The bedridden old patient had said…</p>
 <p>“Guild… Leader…”</p>
 <p><em>Guild Leader?</em></p>
 <p><em>He… … called me Guild Leader?</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian was at a loss. He then straightened himself and stared at the bedridden old patient.</p>
 <p>There was a strange expression on the old patient’s face. He stared intently at Chen Xiaolian. In his eyes, there were surprise, disbelief, excitement, longing…</p>
 <p>However, a few seconds later, the light in his eyes faded.</p>
 <p>“Beep… … …”</p>
 <p>“His heartbeat has stopped! Hurry, the defibrillators!”</p>
 <p>“Dr Kras, all of the patient’s life signs has stopped!”</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian stood beside the bed and looked at the bedridden old patient.</p>
 <p>The old patient had retained his last expression on his face.</p>
 <p>It was… a satisfied smile.</p>
 <p>His eyes were closed.</p>
 <p>The bald doctor raised his torchlight and prodded the old patient’s eyelids up. After a careful examination, he released his hand in frustration.</p>
 <p>“Record. At 8.38 pm, the patient died.”</p>
 <p>The eyes of the support care worker, who was standing beside them, had turned red. The bald doctor then moved over to pat her shoulder and said in a hushed tone, “He is gone. This is God’s arrangement. Perhaps, this is a form of release for him. You understand as well, no matter who you are, having to live like this is very painful. Many of his internal organs had deteriorated. For him to be able to live this long is already… sigh… …”</p>
 <p>The doctor and the nurses began cleaning up.</p>
 <p>There was a tangled expression on Chen Xiaolian’s face. He slowly stepped out of the ward, out the door, and then sat down on one of the chairs in the corridor.</p>
 <p>At that very moment, the only thing in Chen Xiaolian’s mind was… shock!</p>
 <p><em>Guild Leader.</em></p>
 <p><em>He called me Guild Leader!</em></p>
 <p><em>This 76-year-old Will Ritz Beyliah called me Guild Leader!</em></p>
 <p><em>My guess is correct?</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xiaolian’s expression turned extremely gloomy.</p>
 <p>Two minutes later, Chen Xiaolian got up. With a grim expression on his face, he quickly left.</p>
 <p>…</p>
