The sword formation and jade were the only evidence to everything that had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The valley was completely silent, and the stone statue gave off a glow along with the jade. However, the light from the jade became even more dim and was like a candle in the wind, seeming like it would dissipate at any time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time slowly passed. On the 27th day after Li Qianmei left, an old woman wearing white slowly arrived on this wild continent almost no one went to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This old woman was gloomy and held a jade in her hand. She kept checking her direction as she moved and gradually closed in on this wild continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a day, the wild continent Wang Lin was on appeared in the fog before the old woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old woman let out a cold snort and stepped forward. She disappeared and reappeared on the wild continent. The old woman’s divine sense spread out, revealing her peak Nirvana Shatterer cultivation, and swept across the wild continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She instantly found the valley she was looking for!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After finding the valley, the old woman moved like a bolt of thunder toward the valley. Thunderous rumbles echoed and she immediately appeared outside the valley Wang Lin was in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the place!” The old woman frowned and was about to enter the valley when nine swords suddenly rushed out from the valley and prevented her from entering!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old woman’s expression was neutral, but there was a hint of complication as she looked at the flying swords. She let out a sigh as she threw a jade, and the jade immediately touched the nine swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The jade released a flash of light and gave off a gentle aura that surrounded the nine swords. The swords immediately trembled and gave up resisting before dissipating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without the swords stopping her, the old woman stepped into the valley and saw Wang Lin’s statue at the center! She also saw the jade hanging around his neck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the stone statue Wang Lin had turned into, the old woman revealed a complicated gaze. After a long time, she let out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qianmei, you sacrificed so much just for this man!! This old woman promised you I would deliver your soul blood, and I have completed my promise!” The old woman waved her sleeve and a storage space crack appeared. A fist-sized ball of blood flew out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This ball of blood didn’t look like real blood, it was more like a soul. After it appeared, the old woman waved her hand and it entered Wang Lin’s statue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment the soul blood entered Wang Lin, the statue shook and a monstrous, blood light shined. However, this blood light contained no killing intent. Instead, it was filled with vitality and 10 years of companionship...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the stone statue trembled, an aura seemed to be attempting to break out! Cracking sounds echoed and large amounts of cracks appeared around its eyes. After sleeping for 10 years, Wang Lin opened his eyes for the first time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As his eyes opened, the stone on his face collapsed. It seem like it would still take some time for him to completely break out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was confusion in his eyes. Wang Lin seemed to have had a dream, and during that dream, he entered a strange realm. It was the dao realm...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, you’re awake!” A cold voice interrupted Wang Lin’s confusion. This caused Wang Lin’s eyes to immediately recover. He looked at the old woman in white standing in the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are…” Wang Lin’s eyes were calm as he looked at the old woman. He clearly saw an origin soul inside the old woman and all the spells flashing inside the origin soul. Under his gaze, all those spells seemed to stop, and if he willed it, he could easily see through the root of all those spells!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As his gaze moved, he saw a seal on the right of the old woman’s heart. This seal was used for healing and had been there for at least 1,000 years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before his gaze, the old woman’s face changed greatly. She subconsciously took a few steps back and cold sweat covered her forehead. At that moment, she felt as if this person had seen through her and all her secrets. She even had the terrifying illusion that if this person wished it, all her spells would be wiped from her memory!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What terrified her even more was that the healing seal placed on her by a high elder of the Demon Sect 1,000 years ago almost collapsed from his gaze. It was enough to reverse the 1,000 years of healing and cause the serious injury she suffered 1,000 years ago to reappear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although she was terrified, her personality had always been fierce. While she retreated, she shouted, “This old woman came from the rank 9 Demon Sect to bring you Li Qianmei’s soul blood to help you awaken. What are you going to do? Are you going to kill this old woman!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qianmei?” Wang Lin was startled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the old woman saw Wang Lin’s expression, she suppressed her terror. She revealed a sad smile and said, “Li Qianmei, ah, Li Qianmei, you did all of this and he doesn’t even know about it! Forget it, this old body has already brought your soul blood here and returned your favor. I no longer owe you anymore!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old woman suddenly turned around and was going to leave!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin seemed to have guessed something and quickly said, “Fellow Cultivator, please don’t leave so quickly!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, the law of the world seemed to change. The old woman in white trembled, and she unexpectedly found that she wasn’t able to leave. She looked at Wang Lin and gloomily said, “You’re powerful and can kill me easily. Now you don’t want me to leave. What is the meaning of this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin looked at the old woman and slowly said, “I have been in a coma for a long time and don’t know what happened. I hope you can tell me what happened in detail!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old woman sneered. After a long time she said, “You want to know? Alright, I’ll tell you everything! Do you know a woman named Li Qianmei? You don’t have to answer, you must know her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know how you met, but did you know that 10 years ago, Li Qianmei gave up the great opportunity to become a Demon Sect disciple and abandoned the Demon Sect? She became the first person to leave the battlefield, only to meet someone in the Everlasting Sect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Demon Sect naturally didn’t want this, and even her Heaven Breaking Sect was not happy. Once this precedent was set, then naturally others will no longer abide by this rule as well! What she lost has nothing to do with you, and even if you didn’t know, it wouldn’t hurt you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin was startled. He really didn’t know about this. When he met Li Qianmei at the Everlasting Sect, she didn’t say any of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did you know that 10 years ago Li Qianmei returned to her sect due to an order from her teacher? You should know this. Did you know that after she returned, she was immediately trapped by her teacher and was not allowed to leave for three months? Why trap her for three months? Because a certain person was facing a life and death crisis! This old woman doesn’t know much about this, but I presume you understand!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s mind trembled. He naturally knew of this, but this was the first time he had heard about what happened to Li Qianmei at the Heaven Breaking Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did you know that in order to save you, Li Qianmei severed her relationship with her teacher, who was like a father to her, in exchange for a chance to leave? She then became someone without a sect or home!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did you know that in order for you to awaken, Li Qianmei covered your body with her blood over the last 10 years? After her blood was exhausted, she used her essence blood, and when that wasn’t enough, she used her own domain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you know how painful all of that was, to continue for 10 years and never stop?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did you know that in these 10 years, aside from the last few months, she never left the valley and accompanied you the entire time?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did you know in these 10 years, not only did she use her blood, but her vitality, her everything. She consumed her life to cover you with blood and then became extremely weak!</span></p>
