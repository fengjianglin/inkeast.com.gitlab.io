When he picked up the wine jug, he found that there was no wine left. So he took a big jug out from his bag and broke the seal. He drank directly from it and allowed the wine to drip down the corner of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After putting down the wine jug, he sighed and said, “Luckily, this old man is clever and came up with an extreme way to resist this poison. I used a female cultivator as my cultivation furnace. Through a special pair cultivation method, I was able to stimulate the Seventh Heaven, making it remain in the first stage. This is how I was able to delay it until now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The killing intent in Wang Lin’s cold gaze exploded as he looked up at the stars. His killing intent toward planet Feng Luan that pushed Situ Nan into this state was monstrous!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin slowly asked, “Does planet Feng Luan have Nirvana Shatterer cultivators?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Situ Nan shook his head and said “There are no Nirvana Shatterer cultivators, at most mid stage Nirvana Cleanser. There aren’t even any late stage or peak late stage Nirvana Cleanser cultivators. It’s just… there are a lot of Nirvana Cleanser cultivators on planet Feng Luan, and adding on their helpers, there are more than 10!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin sneered as he nodded and said, “We definitely have to get revenge, but more importantly, we need to focus on how to get rid of your poison!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Situ Nan’s eyes lit up and he said, “I do have some plans regarding this. Those damn women from planet Feng Luan had the poison but not the antidote. The real antidote should be in the Celestial Realm! Once the Rain Celestial Realm opens, I’ll head there and perhaps I can find it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s expression changed and he asked, “Celestial Realm? Was this poison refined by the Rain Celestial Realm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Situ Nan nodded and said, “From the records I found, it was refined by the Rain Celestial Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin pondered a bit. He still had the pagoda from Zhou Yi. Inside there laid Celestial Lord Qing Shuang’s corpse. Qing Shuang was a Celestial Lord of the Rain Celestial Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Back in the day, I found various clues pointing to the fact that inside that mysterious cave in the Demon Spirit Land lies the strongest Celestial Emperor from the past, Celestial Emperor Qing Lin! This Qing Lin was Qing Shuang’s father, and he may have a way to revive her. Once she revives, it will be easy to cure this poison!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s eyes shined as he looked at Situ Nan and slowly said, “Perhaps there is no need to go to the Rain Celestial Realm to find the antidote!” At this moment, he told Situ Nan what happened in the Demon Spirit Land, as well as his own deduction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Situ Nan listened, there was a mysterious light in his eyes. After Wang Lin finished speaking, he pondered a bit and smiled. “That sounds good. I’ll risk it and see what happens. Either way, even if there was no such thing, I’d still to go to the Demon Spirit Land with you. Now we might be able to kill two birds with one stone!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As for planet Feng Luan, they can’t escape!” The killing intent inside Wang Lin’s eyes was strong. He had always been one to not bother others if they didn’t offend him. However, since Situ Nan was pushed into such a state, they had touched his bottom line!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They began drinking and talking on the peak again until it was dawn. After Situ Nan finished drinking the last jug of wine in his bag, he looked at Wang Lin for a while before revealing a strange smile. “I say… Little Lin, could it be that you, a piece of wood, has gained enlightenment....”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin was startled, and he subconsciously rubbed his nose. He didn’t really understand what Situ Nan meant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t be silly. If you say your purpose for coming to planet Water Spirit isn’t those two girls, I won’t believe you!” Situ Nan revealed a smile that wasn’t a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I originally wanted take those two girls to make them your concubines, but I didn’t think you’d move even faster than me. You had already come here. Although gaining intimacy as an influential person is not bad, I still have to scold you. You’re not young anymore, yet you’re still playing these games of chasing girls. If it was me, I would’ve just taken them directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Later, once the rice is cooked, so what if she is unwilling? Even if she wasn’t willing, she’d still have to be willing for this old man!” Situ Nan snorted and continued, “Thinking back to when I was the Suzaku, I did this many times. If I fancied them, I’d just take them; who would dare to say no?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin wryly smiled. He understood Situ Nan too much and didn’t doubt Situ Nan had done such things. After letting out a dry cough, Wang Lin shook his head. “I don’t have any ideas about those two juniors. It’s just that one of them is somewhat fated with me, but not as a dao partner.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he spoke, Wang Lin’s expression became bleak. He thought of Li Muwan, who was inside the Heaven-Avoiding Coffin. Then there was also Liu Mei, who made him feel extremely complex and always made him feel a stab of pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Liu Mei probably isn’t be dead…”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Wang Lin looked at the sky. He became aware of this after returning to the Alliance Star System. It was a kind of an intuition, a sense for the future he gained after cultivating for over 1,000 years and entering the second step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Situ Nan naturally saw the pain hidden deep within Wang Lin’s eyes and let out a sigh. He knew a bit about the matter between Wang Lin and Li Muwan. This was why he wanted to find a suitable female cultivator for his brother, so Wang Lin could walk away from that sadness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t know that before Wang Lin’s sadness could heal, it was mercilessly ripped open again &nbsp;by Liu Mei. This caused an irreparable pain that was forever engraved in his soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s love life had been very sad. Li Muwan’s departure allowed him to learn to cherish, but by the time he understood it, the person he cherished was gone!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The kind of life where one lived alone among the stars was not something one could understand without living such a life themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His interactions with Liu Mei caused him great amounts of pain. He spent 100 years resolving the resentment Wang Pin had, but it couldn’t dissolve the pain in Wang Lin’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He picked up the last jug of wine on the table and mercilessly took a drank. He put it down with a bang and laughed. “Situ, you once taught me that the cultivation world is cruel and runs on the law of the jungle. If one is careless for a moment, they will perish. If you wish to live, you must become merciless and vicious. Only then do you have the qualifications to survive!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have learned how to become vicious, and I have slaughtered during my more than 1,300 years of cultivation. I’ve also learned loneliness, but I have lost far too much...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve lost my parents, my family, my lover, my child, my happiness, my everything! Sometimes, I ask myself ‘what am I after!’”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Situ Nan silently pondered as he looked at Wang Lin. He opened his mouth, but he couldn’t say anything. He was always arrogant and overbearing, but his heart was shaken by Wang Lin’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When Mother and Father died, I was devastated, but too weak to change anything. I could only change that anger into a demonic flame until the day it erupted!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When Li Muwan died, I was unable to change fate and recover her from the reincarnation cycle. I could only helplessly watch her become old until she died...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You still don’t know that due to the accident with me and Liu Mei, she became pregnant with my flesh and blood. However, what was sent to me was a soul that had absorbed hundreds of years of resentment. A child that resented its father!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All of this was caused by cultivation. If I didn’t cultivate, although I’d be one with the earth right now, none of this sadness would have fallen on me…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s face was filled with bitterness. He couldn’t say any of this to anyone else in the world. Only one person would let him vent all the bitterness he had experienced in this thousand years, and that person was Situ!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Situ, the one who had watched him start as an ignorant teenager until he walked on the true path of cultivation and finally left planet Suzaku!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Situ Nan pondered, he picked up the wine jug and handed it to Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin accepted it and drank another big mouthful before laughing. “Cultivators can’t even feel drunk when drinking!”</span></p>
