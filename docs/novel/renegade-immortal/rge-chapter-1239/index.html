A pressure surrounded the thousands of mosquito beasts, and they also witnessed the birth of a new king!</span></p>

Their eyes were filled with awe and they let out a cries of approval. As for the hundreds of blue mosquito beasts, there were hints of struggle in their eyes, but as the pressure of the mosquito king spread out, they also became submissive.</span></p>

The two mosquito beasts stared at Wang Lin’s mosquito king. No matter how much Wang Lin’s mosquito king sent out its pressure, their gazes were still cold.</span></p>

The gazes of all the mosquito beasts gathered on the two white mosquitos and turned into ferocious gazes.</span></p>

The one that battled Wang Lin’s mosquito trembled and its eyes revealed a demonic light. A destructive aura came from its body, and at that instant, its body collapsed!</span></p>

The pupils of Song Luohai, who was hiding in the rocks, suddenly shrank.</span></p>

It was a very special existence!</span></p>

In his mind, this mosquito king was a cultivator. Controlling a mosquito king was too difficult, but controlling the origin soul of a cultivator that had fused with the mosquito king shouldn’t be too difficult!</span></p>

He suddenly shot out from the rock and moved like a bolt of lightning. He moved through the shockwave of the two collapsed white mosquito beasts and charged at Wang Lin’s mosquito beast.</span></p>

Although his greed had overridden his common sense, he still had thought this through. The moment he flew out, his hands formed a seal and his mid stage Nirvana Shatterer power spread out like crazy. The illusion of a sun and moon appeared behind him; he started off with his strongest attack! He was from the Silent Soul Sect, and they specialized in spells against the soul. They would often not harm the body, but directly target the soul!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As his spell spread out, Song Luohai let out a roar. This roar contained a spell that targeted origin souls. Under this roar, origin souls would tremble and become dizzy for a moment.</span></p>

Now that the two white mosquito beasts had collapsed and Song Luohai appeared, the star of law Wang Lin was in began to flash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment the other party charged out, Wang Lin’s mosquito beast immediately retreated. Song Luohai’s body charged through the shockwave. Just as he was about to catch up, the star of law began to rotate and Wang Lin’s origin soul took form. Wang Lin’s eyes were filled with mockery as he waved his right hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A gust of wind that turned into a storm suddenly appeared and shot toward Song Luohai. It collided with Song Luohai’s spell and caused an earth-shattering rumble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Song Luohai’s expression immediately turned pale, and he coughed out blood. His body trembled and he involuntarily stepped back few dozen feet. His face was filled with terror. That wind wasn’t powerful, but it contained powerful dao intent and law. It had disturbed his mind and almost caused his domain to collapse!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the next scene caused him to lose his wits! He saw Wang Lin’s origin soul point at him! At the same time, the mosquito king immediately let out a hiss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an instant, all the surrounding mosquito beasts charged in from all directions and sealed all paths of escape. He was trapped inside the mosquito herd!</span></p>

This was also Wang Lin’s first time seeing them display their power as a group!</span></p>

Fellow Cultivator, have mercy, Fellow Cultivator, have mercy!! I’m an elder of the Silent Soul Sect. If Fellow Cultivator lets me go, I’ll definitely repay you in the future!” His voice was filled with anxiety and plea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s expression was calm. He sent out a command, causing the mosquito king to let out a cry, and the mosquito herd’s attack became even more crazy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, in the rank 8 region, where the Everlasting Sect was located, there were three cultivation planets. The competition was being held on the second cultivation planet, and it had begun several days ago.</span></p>

Around the platform, there were countless steps that went up into the sky, these were seats, and they were filled with cultivators.</span></p>

Compared to the other sects, who had hundreds of people, the Origin Sect only had 10 people and looked very bleak.</span></p>

Their eyes were filled with loss and sorrow, as if the fate of their Origin Sect could not be changed.</span></p>

She is indeed very good! It was worth spending so many origin crystals to make you a member of my Celestial Music Sect after your Origin Sect is disbanded!”&nbsp;</span></p>

When he appeared, some people recognized him, and their expressions immediately changed and they quickly left. This made the place the Origin Sect was located even more desolate and eye-catching.</span></p>

Even if they are powerful, none seem to be able to escape.”</span></p>

I head that he has some blood relation with Elder Lu of the Everlasting Sect… Elder Lu is at the peak of the Nirvana Shatterer stage, so, with Elder Lu behind him, it is no wonder this Lu Yingjie dares to be so overbearing.”</span></p>

This man was rather handsome and gave off a manly aura.</span></p>

I only heard about the cultivation furnace from others and am merely teasing. However, I come with good intentions. If the Origin Sect does disband, Lady Lu will have a good place to go.”</span></p>

Even if it disbands, my Purple Dao Sect will accept them all!” These cold words came from another direction as a man in purple gradually walked over. He coldly looked at Lu Yingjie before looking at Lu Yanfei and politely clasping his hands. “Greetings, Fellow Cultivator Lu.”</span></p>

Although Brother Liu and I only met once, that night of dao debate was something I’ll never forgot. If he returns, not only will the Origin Sect not disband, it is even possible it will become the number one branch sect.” Lu Yuncong revealed a look of reminiscence and melancholy.</span></p>

I just don’t know who this ‘Brother Liu’ you speak of is. Could it be me?” Liu Yingjie faintly smiled. It was impossible to tell if he was happy or angry; even his words were as light as the clouds.</span></p>

Who do you think you are to mention Brother Liu? If he was here, he could kill you as easily as squishing an ant!”&nbsp;</span></p>
