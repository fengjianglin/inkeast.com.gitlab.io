 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1691 - Can’t Be Wrong?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All this destruction caused Wang Lin to cough out blood, and his body began to fragment under the rumbles. He was constantly pushed back. As his right index finger continued to resist, he &nbsp;formed a seal with his left hand and waved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The stars trembled with this wave and the exact same palmprint appeared. It was the War Spirit Print!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the War Spirit Print appeared, it followed Wang Lin’s wave and collided with the Sovereign’s palmprint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A thunderous rumble echoed. The instant the invincible War Spirit Print collided with the Sovereign’s palmprint, it collapsed. Wang Lin was knocked back and large amounts of blood flowed out from his mouth. This was only his first collision with the Sovereign and he was already seriously injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Sovereign’s palmprint only paused for a moment before continuing forward. Wang Lin looked up and revealed a fierce expression as he pointed upward. Bursts of seven-colored light appeared, forming a lance that shot toward the palmprint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both sides began colliding once more, setting off monstrous sounds. Wang Lin’s body was swept by the wind and he retreated more than 10,000 feet. His hands were trembling and his legs were covered in blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the big palmprint didn’t disintegrate, though it had dissipated slightly and wasn’t as solid as before. The palmprint howled as it descended upon Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin’s eyes were filled with madness. The power of the Sovereign was not outside his expectations; this was the power of an Arcane Tribulant cultivator. As the palmprint closed in, the fire in Wang Lin’s left eye and the thunder in his right eye appeared. The three ethereal essences and the slaughter essence rumbled. The six essences in his body formed six illusory swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With one wave, these six swords shot out toward the palmprint. Wang Lin clenched his teeth, and rather than retreating, he charged forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The six swords instantly closed in on the palmprint and stabbed it. Ripples spread out, and as the swords attacked the palmprint, Wang Lin charged forward. He had a fierce expression as he raised his hand, his eyes filled with killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heaven Ripping!” The Heaven Ripping spell Wang Lin had learned from Ye Mo’s child was used. He grabbed space itself and mercilessly tore it open!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The space before Wang Lin trembled and a rift was ripped open before him. Borrowing the power of tearing space itself, the palmprint was also torn open!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, an ancient one shadow appeared behind Wang Lin. This was different from before; it was no longer just a head but had a vague body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This body was the ancient one’s body. Although Wang Lin hadn’t had time to refine those eight drops of blood, it had appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This vague ancient one figure also opened its arms and tore at the palmprint following Wang Lin’s movement!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The star domain trembled as an indescribable power ripped it open. It ripped opened the operation of the heavens and ripped open the Sovereign’s palmprint!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The palmprint collapsed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The six swords also shattered and returned back to Wang Lin’s body in fragments. Wang Lin’s hands were a bloody mess. The power of that spell relied on his fingers!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the ancient one shadow behind Wang Lin suddenly collapsed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin was knocked back. He coughed out large amounts of blood and blood sprayed out from his body. His face was pale, but the madness in his eyes disappeared and was replaced by calmness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was as if everything before was merely a play!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is the power of a peak Arcane Void cultivator that has entered Arcane Tribulant. Without the Li Guang Bow, I’m no match…”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wang Lin staggered back as sharp pain washed over his body. His origin soul had been damaged by the rebound shockwave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of this happened very fast. Although the palmprint had dissipated, the Sovereign laughed loudly. He was finally certain that Wang Lin didn’t have the power to pull the bow a third time. Now that he had no worries, he walked toward Wang Lin with a cruel grin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wang Lin, I want to see where you will run this time!! I have already sealed this star domain, you can’t escape!” The Sovereign was filled with joy. He had waited three years for this day!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as the Sovereign closed in, howls echoed from the distance. Ripples spread and the seventh concubine walked out with a sullen expression. At the same time, Dao Master Miao Yin and Devil Master Nine Heaven came from another direction toward Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three of the Five Masters of the Ancient Star System and the seventh celestial imperial concubine. Any one of them could shake the Inner and Outer Realms, but at this moment, they had all come to kill Wang Lin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing all four of them appear, Wang Lin’s eyes became cold. He had been waiting for all four of them to appear! Only then could he complete the first step of his plan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Destroy the Outer Realm’s Ancient Star System and cause chaos in the cave world so the powers were no longer in balance. This was the first step of Wang Lin’s plan, but how could he not realize that this would leave him trapped in the Ancient Star System only to be hunted?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes shined. Just as the Sovereign was about to close in, Wang Lin suddenly stopped. His left hand reached forward and the Li Guang Bow suddenly appeared in his hands!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment the Li Guang Bow appeared, the Sovereign’s expression changed greatly. He subconsciously stopped and even retreated more than 1,000 feet. His eyes were filled with shock and disbelief!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Impossible!! You only have the power of two shots, I can’t be wrong, impossible. You’re just taking out the bow to make a fool of us. You can’t draw that bow!” The Sovereign couldn’t accept such a thing. He couldn’t accept his plans being wrong again and again. This kind of blow was extremely deadly to him and could break his confidence, shake his dao heart!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, not only did the Sovereign retreat, but even the seventh concubine stopped and no longer moved forward. Dao Master Miao Yin and Devil Master Nine Heaven also stopped, and their expressions changed greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sovereign’s face turned pale, then madness filled his eyes and he roared at Wang Lin, “You’re pretending to be mysterious!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, just as he roared, he suddenly stopped as he saw Wang Lin’s right hand grab the bowstring and mercilessly pull back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a buzz. This beautiful sound terrified the Sovereign. The memory of his death three years ago couldn’t be suppressed and drowned him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Impossible!! This is absolutely impossible!! Even if you can draw the bow, you don’t have the celestial energy to trigger the arrow to appear…” The Sovereign retreated, his face deathly pale. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, just at this moment, a ghostly light flashed on the bow Wang Lin had drawn, and the arrow that suppressed all life appeared!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Holding the bow, he locked onto the Sovereign and the others that had come. He raised his left hand and pointed the arrow at the Sovereign!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sovereign’s face turned deathly pale after being pointed at by the arrow. The biggest blow came from his mind. His plans had collapsed again and again before Wang Lin. Even though he was sure this time, in the end, he found that he was wrong once more...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This old man refuses to believe!! All of this is false. Although you have summoned the arrow, you don’t have the celestial energy to shoot this arrow. I don’t believe it, I’m willing to bet on this!!” The Sovereign went mad. Instead of retreating, he rushed toward Wang Lin. His expression was twisted as his hands formed a seal and the giant palmprint appeared once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A giant, illusory well appeared behind the palmprint. The well suddenly spread and the surrounding star domain seemed to become part of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, a bright, red sun appeared in this star domain that was surrounded by the well’s water. The power of the law of origin appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sovereign went crazy. As he moved forward, he hit his forehead with his hand. A fist-sized bone bead suddenly came out of his forehead. The bone bead was grey and gave off a white glow. After it appeared, the Sovereign’s power increased several fold. He then charged straight at Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll make you believe, make you remember!” Wang Lin closed his cold eyes so the others couldn’t see the golden light in his gaze. He pulled the bow a bit more with his right hand so the bowstring was pulled back a bit more, then he suddenly let go!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment he let go, the arrow shot forward as a ray of heaven-shattering light!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The palmprint instantly collapsed and was penetrated by the arrow. Ripples echoed across the well, and as the arrow passed, the well shattered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the sun, it wasn’t able to stop the arrow from passing through. The arrow carried with it a powerful destructive force as it flew toward the Sovereign, who was filled with despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This can’t be…” The arrow was too fast and instantly passed through the Sovereign. His body trembled as the arrowed passed by. His body collapsed and the fragments of his body were knocked tens of thousands of kilometers away.</span></p>
