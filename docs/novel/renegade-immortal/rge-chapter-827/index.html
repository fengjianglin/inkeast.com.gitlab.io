Wang Lin’s steps were staggered and his face was pale. The battle with Yao Changdong was too dangerous; had he been a bit careless, he would have died.</span></p>

The gap between us was really big! However, if I was at the Nirvana Scryer stage, killing him wouldn’t have been difficult.”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Wang Lin’s eyes were fierce. He couldn’t remain merged with the world for too long. Now that he had appeared, he quickly flew. After a few breath of time, he merged with the world again without hesitation.</span></p>

After she appeared, she frowned, looked at where Wang Lin disappeared, and softly said, “</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Using Spatial Bending twice in a row; this Xu Mu’s grasp of the world’s origin energy is very strong!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">”</span></p>

Her name was Yao Bingyun, and in the Eastern Domain she was considered one of the three phoenixes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ice Phoenix Yao Bingyun. She could be considered top three in terms of cultivation level among the Yao family’s third generation. Her expression was always cold; even when facing her own family members, she still spoke indifferently.</span></p>

In order to pursue her own dao, after she reached the Ascendant stage, she began cultivating the celestial spell Soul Seal.</span></p>

Your eyes wouldn’t be able to see, your mouth wouldn’t be able to speak, your ears wouldn’t be able to hear, and your nose wouldn’t be able to smell. It was considered one of the three great forbidden spells of the Yao family. Very few people were able to remain calm enough themselves &nbsp;to cultivate it. The most important reason this was considered a forbidden spell was because if you were a bit careless while cultivating this spell, you would be trapped in the seal and die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Throughout the ages, many Yao family members died cultivating this spell, so gradually, fewer and fewer people cultivated it.</span></p>

Wherever she went, she would bring a chill. Her life was dedicated to dao and her determination was unimaginable!</span></p>

Yao Bingyun was one of them, and she had a deeper understanding than the other person!</span></p>

Wang Lin eventually realized that something was wrong and became even more cautious.</span></p>

Originally, given her temper, she wouldn’t be involved in this family matter. If she had the time, she’d rather spend it in closed door cultivation to comprehend the heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Yao family Ancestor, Blood God, had said something when he released the Heaven Order. Anyone who personally killed Xu Mu could use the entire force of the Yao family to do one thing!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During these 10 days of time, the news of Xu Mu’s appearance quickly spread, especially how several families had formed a team of 28 to intercept him. In the end, Xu Mu killed 26 people and only two had managed to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This incident set of a huge stir. Some of the people who had somewhat forgotten Xu Mu’s name remembered all the rumors about Xu Mu in the Thunder Celestial Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What shocked everyone more was that among the 28 people, there were three Corporeal Yang, nine Illusory Yin, &nbsp;and 16 peak Ascendant cultivators. With this team, Xu Mu was still able to easily slaughter them. Even among the two that managed to survive, when one of them returned, he immediately announced that his cultivation family and planet would not participate in the matter between Xu Mu and the Yao family!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other person was a Corporeal Yang cultivator. He was in an even a worse state and his origin soul was damaged. Once he returned, he immediately went into closed door cultivation and also announced he would not participate in this matter!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This series of news completely awakened the memories of Xu Mu from the minds of the cultivators of the Allheaven Star System!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At almost the same time, the news of the Yao family’s third generation Yao Changdong, an early stage Nirvana Scryer cultivator, being kill by Xu Mu was leaked. It set off a storm that swept the Allheaven Star System!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the Yao family’s Heaven Order, the person that was sent to kill was killed instead. Aside from shocking the cultivators, it made them remember the name “Xu Mu” even more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Similarly, the Yao family responded very quickly. Many family members and the cultivation families they contacted quickly gathered toward the Western Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was so many people that they formed a blockade that continued to tighten as they close in on the area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Wang Lin was very cautious while he continued to merged with the world. He didn’t do any long range moment in an attempt to lose the person who could also merge with the word that was chasing him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he had not seen the pursuer, the feeling of being chasing was extremely profound. Wang Lin decided to merge with the world and not come up. Instead, he kept changing directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, they were competing to see who had a deeper understanding. Whoever had a deeper understanding could remain merged with the world longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the other person comes out first, Wang Lin will have the initiative and will not let them perceive his location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin experienced being merged with the world for a long time when Master Flamespark took control of his body. Right now he clenched his teeth and was able to remain merged with the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time slowly passed. Although Yao Bingyun’s comprehension was profound, it couldn’t compare with what Wang Lin had experienced. After the 16th day, she couldn’t endure it any longer and appeared from the void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment she appeared, Wang Lin, who she had locked onto with her divine sense while merged with the world, disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yao Bingyun’s expression was calm as her hand touched a bag and a small mirror immediately appeared. Her left hand formed a seal as if she was predicting something. After a short while, she merged with the world again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s figure appeared next to an abandoned cultivation planet between the border of the Western and Northern Domains. When he appeared, his face was without any color. After all, he had been seriously injured and then forced to run for a long time. In addition, he had to be merged with the world for a long period of time, thus making his injuries worse. At this moment, his eyes lit up, and after he determined that his pursuer had been completely left behind, he let out a sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Yao family must have already launched their plan. From now on, every step will be difficult!”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Wang Lin’s body flickered as he charged toward the abandoned cultivation planet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no spiritual energy coming from the planet and there were ruins everywhere. It was obvious it had been countless years since the planet was in its prime.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin found a basin on this planet, and after sitting down, he slapped his bag of holding. The soul flag immediately flew out and turned into black mist that filled the area. After placing down many restrictions, he closed his eyes. Behind him, Ta Shan walked out form his shadow and sat down beside him. Ta Shan’s right arm was broken, his body was filled with scars, and he looked dispirited.</span></p>
