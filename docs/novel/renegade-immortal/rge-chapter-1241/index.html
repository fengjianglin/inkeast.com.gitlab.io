The six elders behind him followed with doubt in their hearts.</span></p>

The movement of over a hundred people immediately attracted the attention of the cultivators all over the platform!</span></p>

With someone taking the lead, even more people followed.</span></p>

The two people from the rank 4 sects were originally fighting fiercely, but now they bitterly smiled and looked north.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even further away, the dozen or so rays of light rushing over also closed in. The one in front was a red-haired elder who gave off a Nirvana Shatterer aura, and the dozen or so elders that followed him all had high cultivation levels.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After closing in, the red-haired old man immediately saw the chaos caused by the tens of thousands of cultivators and frowned. He shouted, “No flying!”</span></p>

Some cultivators that had just flown into the air trembled and immediately landed on the ground.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qianmei quickly flew, disregarding how she had alarmed the entire Everlasting Sect. She flew straight north to where the Origin Sect was. When she got near, she landed and her gaze swept forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The joy in Liu Yingjie was even stronger. Before, he only saw Li Qianmei from far away and didn’t dare to spread out his divine sense, so he hadn’t heard Li Qianmei ask about the Origin Sect. At this moment, he took a deep breath as he put a kind smile on his face. The moment Li Qianmei got close, he said, “Lady Li it’s been 100 years since we last met. I wonder if you still remember me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Long, who was beside him, also revealed a look of respect and clasped his hands with a smile. “So Fellow Cultivator Li knows Liu Yingjie. I’m the rank 7 Mountain Seeking Sect’s Zhao Long.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the two of them spoke, the surrounding people were all shocked. It was obvious that no one thought the reason for the daughter of the heavens to rush over would be Liu Yingjie!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Liu Yingjie is rumored to be very romantic. I didn’t think that even Li Qianmei would be acquainted with him, or would even come to the Everlasting Sect due to him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If this matter is true, the Celestial Music Sect will become famous before even competing. I didn’t expect this, I didn’t expect this!”</span></p>

I just don’t understand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the Everlasting Sect people who had followed Li Qianmei here looked at Liu Yingjie, but Feng Hai and company frowned. They had clearly heard Li Qianmei ask about the Origin Sect, but now with Liu Yingjie appearing, their doubts became even stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Yingjie smiled even wider as all the attention was on him. He walked forward a few steps and was about to catch up with Li Qianmei, who had just landed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Li Qianmei heard Liu Yingjie speak, her gaze locked on to him, and she frowned. As Liu Yingjie walked up, she indifferently walked past him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had battled against the beast tide in the crack for almost 100 years and had just come from the battleground without any rest. Her body was naturally filled with killing intent, and one gaze caused Liu Yingjie’s heart to feel a chill. His face immediately stiffened but soon returned to normal, and he clasped his hands, smiling. “It has been 100 years, but Lady Li is still so valiant and formidable…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, before Liu Yingjie could finish speaking, Li Qianmei walked past him without stopping. This caused Liu Yingjie to stiffen and swallow his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only him, but even Zhao Long, who was originally smiling, froze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sudden scene caused the surrounding cultivators to raise their eyebrows. This surprise completely reversed the situation; there was even a hint of mockery in the eyes of the surrounding cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qianmei didn’t even look at Liu Yingjie and headed straight for the Origin Sect. When she got closer, her gaze swept by everyone and landed on Lu Yanfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yanfei wiped the blood off the corner of her mouth as if erasing the bitterness on her body and looked at Li Qianmei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qianmei silently pondered and bit her lower lip. After a long time, she softly said, “Did he come…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words clearly entered the ears of the surrounding cultivators and immediately caused an uproar. Everyone was guessing who this “he” was!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the people of the Everlasting Sect were wondering the same thing. Feng Hai’s eyes lit up and an answer to his doubts gradually formed. At this moment, the red-haired elder with more than 10 other elders arrived and saw this. There was a hint of shock in his eyes as he looked at Feng Hai, and they both had their own thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Yingjie also heard these words. Even with his mental strength, his expression changed. After experiencing what he just had, it was extremely difficult to remain calm. His expression was extremely ugly, but he also had vague feeling that something bad was going to happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expression of Zhao Long beside him changed greatly. He was different from Liu Yingjie, and immediately looked at Lu Yuncong. After Lu Yuncong felt his gaze, he sneered and revealed an unhidden trace of disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Long suddenly felt his heart skip a beat. He felt that the mysterious persion Lu Yuncong had spoken of wasn’t… as simple as he had thought!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yanfei silently pondered, and after a while, she shook her head. Although she hadn’t met Li Qianmei, she could clearly understand who the “he” Li Qianmei was talking about was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He didn’t come…” Li Qianmei let out a sigh as she raised her head and looked up at the sky with a hint of melancholy. Her blue hair gently blew with the wind, containing a crestfallen feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There hasn’t been any news of him in 100 years,” Lu Yanfei said as she looked at Li Qianmei. She hesitated for a moment but didn’t continue speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qianmei bit her lower lip as she shook her head and softly said, “Forget it.” With that, there was a flash of coldness as she looked at Lu Yanfei and gently said, “You’re injured? The injury is fresh. Who did it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Yanfei’s expression was calm as she indifferently said, “Earlier, this Liu Yingjie said that after the Origin Sect disbands, I’ll become his cultivation furnace, and he threatened to fight Uncle-Teacher. Next to him is the rank 7 Mountain Seeking Sect’s elder, Zhao Long. He thought that this little woman’s voice was unpleasant and that I wasn’t qualified to talk, so he punished me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Liu Yingjie heard this, his expression changed. He looked at Lu Yanfei before shouting, “She’s full of nonsense!” In fact what, he said was true. He didn’t say he wanted Lu Yanfei to become his cultivation furnace, but he did intend to make her one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Long’s expression changed and there was a flash of coldness in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Qianmei’s expression calm down as she turned around to look at Zhao Long and Liu Yingjie. Liu Yingjie was about to speak, but Zhao Long quickly retreated. His hands formed seal and a spell began to appear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just as Zhao Long retreated, Li Qianmei suddenly moved. She was very fast and created afterimages as she rushed forward. She cross the crowd in just a moment with her late stage Nirvana Shatterer cultivation and appeared behind Zhao Long before gently waving her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A monstrous killing aura suddenly appeared. This killing intent was shocking and contained thunderous roars. It gave off a demonic feel, and it immediately enveloped Zhao Long’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A miserable scream echoed as Zhao Long coughed out blood and was immediately throw into the air.

If he doesn’t come, then I’ll take yours and that person named Zhao’s lives!”</span></p>

Feng Hai looked at the red-haired elder before he coughed and said, “Fellow Cultivator Li, who is this person you speak of, I wonder? The Origin Sect’s Lu Yanfei’s Uncle-Teacher?”</span></p>

It was like a red cloud that covered the sky, and it swept across the outer edge of the Wind Celestial Realm.</span></p>
