 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin raised his head and looked at the person in the black robe. How could Wang Lin forget this appearance? This person was the Sovereign!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The leader of the five masters of the Ancient Star System. Someone with great cunning who had schemed against heaven and earth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whether it was killing the previous Lord of the Sealed Realm, the destruction of the four Celestial Realms, scheming against Celestial Emperor Qing Lin, setting up the Tattoo Clan to find Li Guang’s arrow, the betrayal of Daoist Water, Master Simo’s fall, the death of the Zhan family ancestor, and various other things all contained the shadow of the Sovereign!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Ancient Star System, Wang Lin faintly felt like his mind was being manipulated. Thinking about it now, it must have also been an act of the Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Wang Lin’s memory, there was a spell he couldn’t erase, it was Fishing the Moon in the Well!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had seen that spell when he faced the third Vermillion Bird that he suspected to be the Sovereign. When he saw the water, he feared that this calamity was also a Fishing the Moon in the Well!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was fished out was planet Suzaku and Wang Lin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fishing the Moon in the Well…”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wang Lin stood up on the water and calmly looked at the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The celestial imperial concubine that hadn’t died stood in a daze between the two of them. She retreated a few steps and became silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man in the black robe seemed to smile as he said in a hoarse voice, “If it wasn’t for Blue Dream taking pity on you, you would have already become this old man’s pawn.” He then leisurely squeezed and the arrow trembled and dissipated in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He dreaded the power of this arrow, which was why he had delayed his appearance. He had waited until after Wang Lin used the arrow to reveal himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This arrow had already already formed a connection with the bow in Wang Lin’s body. After it dissipated, it reappeared inside Wang Lin through some strange method. If Li Guang hadn’t died, this arrow would have returned to Li Guang’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tell me, where did you obtain your celestial bloodline?” After the black-robed man squeezed the arrow, he slowly walked toward Wang Lin. Although his pace was slow, each step he took caused Wang Lin to tremble. It was as if endless pressure was pressing on his body from all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was even more bizarre was that a reflection of the black-robed man had appeared on the water’s surface and was walking toward Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It looked like there were two Sovereigns, one in the sky and one on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That pressure suddenly doubled and came from both the sky and the earth. This caused Wang Lin’s face turn pale, and he couldn’t move his body at all, as if he was being stopped by the Stop spell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, his eyes were calm. Things had already reached this point, and Wang Lin knew that it would be very difficult to survive this calamity. He understood this when he released that arrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not going to speak? It doesn’t matter. I’ll get my answer from you.” The black-robed man shook his head and raised his dried-up right hand. He pointed toward Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With this, the blue sky disappeared without a trace and was replaced with golden light. This golden light was sunlight that came from a sun that had suddenly appeared in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sun appeared suddenly and hung in the sky. The aura of the law of origin spread out. As the sunlight flashed, the Sovereign’s figure became dark. As he walked forward, halos appeared around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aside from that arrow, you have nothing left to use against me… Since the beginning, there was light, and this light is one of the essences this old man has comprehended. Law of origin essence… under the power of the law of origin, your ancient and celestial powers will separate!” The Sovereign’s voice was ancient, and all the light in the world formed a pillar of light that shined on Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin couldn’t resist absolute power. Intense pain came from his body as the light surrounded him; the light was as hot as the sun. Wang Lin felt the familiar law of origin as it burned everything inside him, including the wandering souls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This law of origin was extremely deadly to the wandering souls. Miserable screams echoed and all the wandering souls inside Wang Lin dissipated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without the wandering souls, Wang Lin’s body collapsed under the rejection force and the light. The law of origin forced its way into Wang Lin’s flesh and blood. It was going to force Wang Lin’s ancient and celestial powers apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One could faintly see that after Wang Lin’s body reformed, the golden light in his body was about to rush out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That feeling of being separated by force was several times more intense than when he fused. Wang Lin’s expression became twisted, but he didn’t make a sound, he just stared at the Sovereign. He was going to remember this, remember everything that had happened to him today!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he had another life, if he didn’t die today, then all the pain he had suffered on this day would be paid back 10, 100 fold!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He still had one ace he hadn’t used!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This ace was likely out of his control, but at this moment, Wang Lin didn’t care. But he was waiting, waiting for the most critical moment, waiting for the Sovereign to come closer. Maybe then this ace might be able to change everything!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black-robed figure didn’t seem to have any change in his expression from being stared at by Wang Lin. His right index finger slowly stretched out with the other four fingers and formed a palm. As the law of origin caused Wang Lin’s ancient and celestial powers to separate, he walked closer and closer to Wang Lin. Then his right hand reached toward Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fishing the Moon in the Well!” As the black-robed man reached out, his reflection on the surface also reached toward Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wanted to reach out to the celestial bloodline that was forcibly being separated from Wang Lin’s body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he moved, a tearing pain came from Wang Lin’s body. This pain almost caused him to scream, but he held back. The veins on his face swelled up and his eyes were bloodshot, but he continued to stare at the Sovereign!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A little closer…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Large amounts of golden light spread out from Wang Lin’s body and endless golden blood came from his orifices. Also, inside Wang Lin’s bones, the most important bone marrow that made the blood also squeezed its way out of his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a flash, under the intense pain, all the blood inside Wang Lin’s body spread out, including the bone marrow. All the fortune the madman had given him erupted from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From afar, this scene looked extremely shocking. The golden blood that was spraying from Wang Lin’s body took human form, and it was shaped like Wang Lin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was like a soul. Wang Lin seemed to have been split in half, and the figure made of golden light slowly separated from Wang Lin’s body. It floated seven inches above Wang Lin, and less and less golden light connecting them remained!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the golden figure flew out, Wang Lin’s ancient god stars appeared, but there was no golden light. Even the ancient devil stars in his right eye had lost the golden light!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black-robed man’s eyes lit up and he mercilessly reached out. The remaining golden light broke. Wang Lin’s celestial bloodline was completely separated from his body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When it was separated, the golden figure moved and then turned into a drop of golden blood!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This drop of blood contained the half-complete rune for the Immortal Celestial Body. This drop of blood was refined from the fortune the madman had given Wang Lin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without the celestial bloodline, there was no rejection force. Wang Lin returned back to the way he was when he met the madman. Popping sounds echoed inside him and he returned to his ancient god body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Immortal Celestial Body… This is the Immortal Celestial Body… Where did you get it?!” The black-robed man looked at the drop of golden blood floating above Wang Lin. There was strong excitement in his eyes but also a strong sense of fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sovereign would rarely lose his composure like this; only this blood could make him like this! He could know everything about Wang Lin, but there was no way for him to know what had happened to Wang Lin inside the Nether Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the Sovereign stepped forward and his right hand reached out for the drop of golden blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he did so, there was a monstrous cold gaze in Wang Lin’s eyes. He bit the tip of his tongue and spat out a mouthful of his ancient blood like an arrow. This opened his storage space and a black palace flew out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment this palace appeared, the world darkened and Wang Lin’s ancient blood landed on one of the windows, dying it red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“With my name as Ancient Wang Lin, I release your seal to give you your freedom and help me kill my enemy!!” With Wang Lin’s cultivation level, he could only open one window and release one of the powerful souls sealed by Ye Mo!</span></p>

Cracking sounds echoed and it suddenly collapsed. A powerful and excited roar came from the collapsed window.</span></p>
