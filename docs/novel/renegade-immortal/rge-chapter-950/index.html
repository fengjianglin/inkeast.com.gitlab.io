The Slaughter Realm created their own world as their base. Countless years ago, the founder of the Slaughter Realm took over a crack left over from the collapsed Rain Celestial Realm. He also gathered lot of heavenly metal to create the 99 Heaven Raising Swords!</span></p>

Whether it was the first battle against the Four Divine Sect or the later exchanges with the Corpse Sect, all of those conflicts had the shadow of the Slaughter Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not many rank 6 cultivation countries had heard of the Slaughter Realm, but once they reached rank 7, the Slaughter Realm would be a well-known name!</span></p>

The series of events caused by this sentiment were all dealt with by the Slaughter Realm. The bloodbath caused by these matters gave them a vicious reputation!</span></p>

These were dealt with by other forces within the Cultivation Alliance.</span></p>

If anyone died, they would immediately be replenished. Aside from these 99 cultivators, there were also the outer disciples. There were many outer disciples, and they were led by these 99 cultivators.</span></p>

Not many people were willing to provoke the Slaughter Realm in the Alliance!</span></p>

Not only were these people vicious, they were also very good at stealth. If they failed their mission, they could immediately retreat and hide all traces of themselves.</span></p>

Countless iron chains fell off and turned into a storm that swept the Slaughter Realm.</span></p>

These cultivators were all dressed in black and were of varying ages. Their cultivation levels varied from Illusory Yin to mid stage Nirvana Scryer. Most of them were at the Yin and Yang stage, very few at Nirvana Scryer.</span></p>

His voice was like a blast of cold air.</span></p>

Although there were many cultivators, he had the body of an ancient god, so it wouldn’t be difficult to kill them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Brother can be at ease!” As Wang Lin spoke, he took a step out and suddenly threw a punch!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a heaven-shaking bang and a sonic boom appeared before Wang Lin. The void shattered and the cracks swept forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The endless storm formed by Wang Lin’s punch condensed into one point and rushed out. Even a peak late stage Nirvana Scryer cultivator’s expression would change when facing it. If they were a bit late in dodging, they would be killed instantly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Wang Lin were several Illusory Yin cultivators who had spent their lives in slaughter. Just as they approached, their expressions were changed by Wang Lin’s punch. Popping sounds echoed within their bodies and large amounts of blood gushed out from their bodies. The person in front pf Wang Lin wasn’t able to resist at all and his body collapsed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As his body splattered, the surrounding cultivators were filled with shock and fear. They wanted to escape, but at this moment, they clearly felt that a mysterious force had locked down the surroundings, so they couldn’t escape at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang. All of these cultivators’ bodies collapsed and their origin souls flew out and were caught by Wang Lin.</span></p>

All of the surrounding Slaughter Realm cultivators were shaken!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s face was cold. There were about 100 cultivators before him. Although there were many of them, he considered none of them a threat! If it was before, it would be impossible for Wang Lin to face these cultivators. However, now that he had become a 5-star royal ancient god, everything was different!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin took a step, ripples appeared under his feet, and he disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Spatial Bending!!!” An early stage Nirvana Scryer cultivator’s eyes opened wide. Shock and aghast filled his eyes and his scalp went numb. He was about to lose his wits, and he retreated without hesitation.</span></p>

No matter how many people my Slaughter Realm has, it will be extremely difficult to hurt him!”</span></p>

When reappeared, he was behind an Illusory Yin cultivator. After he appeared, it looked like his fist slightly punched forward and landed on the cultivator’s back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That person didn’t even have the qualifications to dodge or detect this punch. He trembled and popping sounds echoed from his body. A powerful force rushed into his body, causing his bones to shatter inch by inch. Then his body exploded with a bang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After grabbing this person’s origin soul, Wang Lin’s figure disappeared.</span></p>

He suddenly turned, opened his mouth, and spat out a ray of red light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a long sword inside the red light, and it released a whistle when it shot forward. There were thousands of soul fragments coming from the sword. The mournful cries of the souls made the flying sword reach a peak!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This sword is very good!” A cold voice came from all directions. Wang Lin stepped out from the void before the mid stage Nirvana Scryer cultivator. His hand reached out and instantly grew into the arm of an ancient god. He grabbed the flying sword and pulled it back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mid stage Nirvana Scryer cultivator let out a muffled groan and his face became pale. This flying sword was his life treasure, and now that Wang Lin had cut off his connection to it, he was seriously injured.</span></p>

This person… What exactly is his cultivation level!?!”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;This mid stage Nirvana Scryer cultivator was famous even in the Slaughter Realm. His prestige was even higher than that of Killer Yu Fei.</span></p>

Recalling this made his scalp go numb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without hesitation, he quickly retreated and slapped his bag of holding. A large amount of jades flew out and he shouted, “Explode!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These jades all exploded, forming a powerful impact.</span></p>

After taking the flying sword, Wang Lin charged out without hesitation. The explosion of all those jades had no effect on him. The mid stage Nirvana Scryer cultivator was completely shocked when Wang Lin approached him. Wang Lin’s two fingers formed a sword and he pressed it down between the mid stage Nirvana Scryer cultivator’s eyebrows.</span></p>
