Even among the four star systems, only a few people even knew they existed, and even then, it was only from reading ancient records.</span></p>

Their bodies were even larger than cultivation planets, a unique trait of the ancient gods.</span></p>

The real reason came from Wang Lin’s revolting personality! The avatar was seriously injured and forced into a coma. Even the unbreakable connection between the original body and the avatar was very weak at this moment, and it felt as if it could break at any moment.</span></p>

The avatar had been painstakingly cultivated for many years. In truth, there was no primary or secondary body to him. The original body was him and the avatar was him as well.</span></p>

However, with his eight-star ancient god body, he will be recognized by those powerful cultivators as soon as he appears. Even if he causes havoc in the Alliance Star System, what does it have to do with me!? I, Wang Lin, am not a saint!” His eyes became even colder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were many blood slaves on the Blood Planet. These people were controlled by the Blood Ancestor and had the Blood Ancestor’s branding on their souls. If the Blood Ancestor lives, they live, and if the Blood Ancestor dies, they die.</span></p>

He took away their freedom and forced them to work for him. He also collected gifted youths that he fed blood pills to and groomed them to be blood guardians that protected the Blood Planet.</span></p>

She should occasionally look back at the blood pavilion. That place was a forbidden area; not even she was allowed to enter.</span></p>

Four elders appeared before Zi Xin. The four of them all gave off origin energy; clearly they were all powerful cultivators who had reached the second step.</span></p>

Is this something you can ask?!” This made Zi Xin even more anxious. Before, none of them would dare to say something like this, but at this moment, even Zi Xin wondered if the Blood Ancestor was dying...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man sneered as he turned around and walked away. His mood was very bad, but there was also a trace of relief. His body also contained the Blood Ancestor’s imprint, but right now it wasn’t important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ever since I was forcibly branded by the Blood Ancestor 6,000 years ago, I can’t even take half a step out of the Blood Planet without the Blood Ancestor’s order. Now the Blood Ancestor has obviously encountered misfortune. This old man… if I’m going to die, I’d rather die in my hometown than here!” The old man’s eyes were filled with sorrow and he headed straight for space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three elders all looked up at the sky and watched their companion disappear into the sky. After silently pondering, the three of them looked at each other. They no longer spoke and flew into the sky.</span></p>

He looked at her coldly and said, “Noisy! You are only one of the Blood Ancestor’s playthings. Do you really think you are the mistress?! I and the other cultivators give you respect because of the Blood Ancestor. Without him, what are you worth!? I have been on the Blood Planet for almost ten thousand years and have seen at least a dozen girls like you!”</span></p>

No one knew who was the first, but after that, almost all of the blood slaves flew away.</span></p>
