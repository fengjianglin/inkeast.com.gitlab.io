There was a team of carriages galloping along the road. These carriages were made of exquisite material and gave off a fragrance. They gave off the feeling of wealth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sounds of hooves and wheels echoed, but the carriage in front suddenly stopped and a seven or eight-year-old girl jumped down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This girl was wearing silk clothes and her face was pink, as if she was made of jade. She felt something in her bosom as she got off the carriage with some difficulty. She took a few quick steps into the grass on the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She squatted down and placed the thing in her arms onto the ground. It was a small beast with a bandage on its leg.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Black, go back…” The girl’s eyes revealed innocence and reluctance as she touched the small beast’s head. The small beast looked up. It was as if he had intelligence and looked meaningfully at the girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the curtain of the carriage behind the girl was opened, exposing a man and woman. They were both middle-aged and they looked at the girl with loving gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gentle breeze blew by, causing the curtain to flutter. The eyes of the two people in the carriage were filled with confusion. They weren’t the only ones; all the surrounding mortals became like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the girl was also filled with confusion. Only the small beast suddenly began to make hostile noises with its mouth and exposing its teeth. It seemed to have forgotten about its injuries and jumped behind the girl’s back. It looked up at the sky and let out a long roar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was fear in its eyes, but there was also a force in its eyes that made it not back down. At this moment, it didn’t even notice that a trace of blood had come out of its bandaged leg.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The heavens’ dao is endless, the path of dao is boundless. The kind act of today will create karmic cause… In the future, the cycle will be completed and karmic effect will form…” An ancient voice echoed across the world with a hint of enlightenment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The small beast’s body trembled, but it still let out a roar. Its eyes were filled with intelligence as it looked up at the sky. It could feel that there was an aura that could suffocate it, but it wasn’t willing to retreat!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sigh slowly came and gradually disappeared. The small beast was filled with confusion as it hadn’t fully awakened its intelligence and couldn’t understand what the sigh meant. However, the moment it heard the sigh, its vision blurred and it seemed to see something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An old woman in her twilight years was lying in a very luxurious room. Even though her face covered in wrinkles, they couldn’t cover her kind appearance. Although she was dying, her eyes were not cloudy. She revealed a smile as she closed her eyes. Suddenly, a large and ferocious beast came from the sky. After the beast landed, it looked at the old woman and spat out a cloud of white gas. The white gas surrounded the old woman and then it left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Black…” The old woman opened her eyes.</span></p>

The breeze blew by and swept everything away. Everyone from the carriages became sober and had no idea anything had happened. Even the little girl was unaware, She smiled and turned back to the little beast. “Little Black… go home.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a village in the mortal world, a middle-aged woman was pointing at a broken bowl and loudly reprimanding a child. The child looked extremely wronged as he stood there crying, but he didn’t dare to say a word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beside them was a middle-aged man. He was squatting on the ground holding a pip. After taking a few drags, he opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but in the end he only sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the gentle breeze came by. The cursing stopped and the woman’s eyes were filled with confusion. Not only her, but even the man smoking the pipe stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only the child seemed not to notice and whispered while crying, “Mother, there was already a crack on the bowl…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dao is like this bowl, not perfect and filled with cracks. It can be broken at any time…” An ancient sigh slowly came from the world and then left like a gentle breeze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The confusion disappeared from the woman’s eyes and she continued to reprimand the child due to the heartache of the bowl breaking without being aware of what had happened. The middle-aged man picked up the pipe that fell on the ground and took a big drag.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only the child’s eyes widened as he looked into the distant sky. He seemed to see an uncle stepping into the sky. The child disregarded his mother’s scolding and rubbed his eyes, but after that, he saw nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the mountain there was a middle-aged man wearing a blue robe running through the mountain in panic. His eyes were filled with fear, as if he had encountered something terrifying.</span></p>

Every time she got close, she would raise her sword and mercilessly stab him, leaving him bleeding. She let out a sad laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You damn officer, you caused the death of my family, but you fell into my hands today. If I don’t kill you, then it will be offense to the heavens for giving me this chance!”</span></p>

Even the black-robed woman was filled with confusion. She raised the sword in her hand, but it didn’t fall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Another karmic cause and karmic effect…” An ancient voice echoed with a sigh that slowly drifted away.</span></p>

Her sword cut off the middle-aged man’s head. She was filled with tears as he kneeled down weeping. “Father, mother, your child has gotten you revenge!”</span></p>
