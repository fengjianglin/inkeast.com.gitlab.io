To be more accurate, very few lives. Before Wang Lin, there was only one other person!</span></p>

This planet was no longer round, there was no vegetation on it, and it was completely silent.</span></p>

A few days ago, before I left, he wasn’t this large, and after leaving for a few days, he grew quite a bit. From the looks of this, it will take a few years to be completely grown… Well, it seems to have something to do with my blood…” The dull-eyed cultivator touched his chin as he walked around the corpse several times and kicked it a bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damn it, you dare to pretend to be dead before this king?” The cultivator glared and kicked the body. Seeing no response, he immediately went for a few more kicks. Finally, he giggled and jumped on the body. After jumping on it for a hour, he felt satisfied and lied down on the ground, staying at the sky in a daze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had been searching this place for countless years, but he hadn’t seen a second person. He still remembered that an unknown number of years ago, he was also lying here, looking at the sky in a daze.</span></p>

Just as he thought of this, his eyes widened and there was a flash of light in the starry sky. He saw something fall from the sky and land on the other side of this planet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was startled for four or five days before he reacted. He then rushed toward the other side of the planet in joy.</span></p>

Oh… Maybe, who knows. I say, today is going to rain… Little Red, go bring the Rain Shelter Jade.. Eh? I ate it last time I got drunk, you say… Then go ask the Lee family for another. Damn it, if they won’t give it, tell them this king will ask my big brother to steal it tomorrow!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That might be the case… Maybe there isn’t enough silver to use… What if there is not enough… Little Gui, go find my big brother and tell him to give me some. If he doesn’t give any, tell him that tomorrow this king will let… Uh, I’ll go steal it myself!” The cultivator didn’t even know what he was muttering. This phenomenon started when he was trapped in the Seven-Colored Realm. If it wasn’t for this random muttering, he would have really gone crazy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After muttering for a long time, he let out a big breath and he looked at the corpse. His expression suddenly changed and became fierce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You dare to scare this king? Let’s see how this king will deal with you!” he roared.</span></p>

The earth rumbled for a long time, and before the rumbling stopped, this madman cultivator used even more spells.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bombardment continued for several consecutive days… If a third step cultivator saw the spells this madman was using, they would terrified!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Pink, take my move!” The madman raised his right. The world rumbled and then a giant palmprint appeared. However, the palmprint seemed to be lacking power and immediately collapsed when it touched the body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the palm was filled with power and majesty. This was the most authentic War Spirit Print! It was like the War Spirit Print the Lord of the Sealed Realm left at the God Sect, but the one used by this madman was even more authentic!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Silver, watch how this king hits you!” the madman roared, then he pointed at the sky. The entire sky suddenly turned into the a canopy and a giant pillar that supported the sky appeared. It was a giant umbrella!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Realm Burning Umbrella, burn for this king!” The madman waved his right hand and the umbrella shrank until he could hold it in his right hand. He poked the body on the ground with it, but although the umbrella was powerful, it was, in fact, powerless. The moment it touched the corpse, it immediately dissipated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old Man Li Guang, take this old man’s arrow!” The mandman smiled and raised his hands as if he was holding a bow. There was no bow in his hands, but an arrow suddenly appeared and shot toward Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seven-Colored little girl, your husband has been forced away by my big brother. I say, you better follow this king. You see, I can use the seven-colored spell as well!” The madman raised his right hand and there was a flash of seven-colored light. The seven-colored light turned into a spell wheel that flew forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time slowly passed. The madman continued to chatter and used large amounts of spells that had never appeared in the Inner or Outer Realms!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t until a few days later that the madman slowly stopped. He was gasping for breath on the side and revealed a look of satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not bad, not bad. This king’s spells have become even stronger, not bad! Now it’s time to practice my strength.” He stood up and walked up to the corpse. There was a bow in the corpse’s hand!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bow was being held tightly by the corpse, but its string was broken. It was attached to the bow on one end and the other was fused with the flesh of the corpse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The madman rubbed his hands and grabbed the bow. His face turned red as he tired to drag the bow away. His body jumped and he continued to roar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damn it, this damn person from the Ancient Nation holding the Li Guang bow. Even when dead, he is still so strong… Eh, what did I just say? Ancient Nation? Li Guang’s bow?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The madman was startled for a moment and loosened his hand. He then thought for a long time. He looked at the corpse and shook his head, saying, “Ancient Nation, that feels very familiar… I feel a lot of hatred…” After a long time, he still couldn’t think of anything. He scratched his head and let out a sigh as he looked down at the body before him. He then bit his finger on his right hand and place it in the mouth of the corpse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Drink it, drink more so you can quickly regrow your body so you can play with me…” He had not just been feeding this body for one or two days. Ever since he found the body, whenever he remembered, he would feed the body some of his blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This king’s blood is very precious. That little girl from the Li family begged me for many years before I gave her a drop. And there was also who, who, who, who, was it? Little Red, who was it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, it was that sect’s saintess who was kidnapped by that person. If not for the fact that I thought she was pitiful, this king wouldn’t have given it to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“One drop of this king’s blood is more precious than the Dao Sage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alas, there is no food to eat. Little Red, go to the Chi Mu family to get me some fruit. That fruit their family grows that only grows once every 100,000 years. The Dream Fruit. Bring it to me. If they don’t give it, tell them that this king will get my big brother to steal it for me tomorrow!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the madman muttered to himself, he didn’t notice that the corpse that was rapidly recovering suddenly slowed down after absorbing his blood. Not only did the recovery stop, but it reversed, making the injury even worse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a power that was rejecting this blood like crazy, as if they couldn’t exist together. However, during this rejection, there was a hint of fusion… This corpse was Wang Lin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blood from the madman couldn’t merge with the Ancient Order power inside him at all. The two devoured each other like crazy, as if they were in a life and death struggle. This mutual destruction caused Wang Lin’s body to go through a strange change. This change seemed to be changing his bloodline… A change from a mortal to a true celestial!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Li Guang Bow hadn’t recognized another owner since its owner’s death, and not even Old Ghost Zhan thought anyone would be recognized as its owner. As this change took place within Wang Lin, a heaven-shaking change was happening with the Li Guang Bow as well!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Old Ghost Zhan saw this personally, even he would be filled with disbelief!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The broken bow string that had grown into Wang Lin’s body was slowly fusing with Wang Lin’s new bloodline.
