He was calm and there were no injuries on his body. The image of a furnace slowly disappeared around Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only was Liu Qingyun filled with disbelief, even the big-headed boy in the distance also gasped and his eyes became filled with shock. He knew that Wang Lin was strong, but he didn’t think Wang Lin could have escaped without a scratch. He no longer dared to go against Wang Lin anymore; he was now even more afraid of Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin coldly looked at Li Qingyun, took a step, and then disappeared. Liu Qingyun was terrified as he anxiously said, “Fellow Cultivator, it was a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding. This time, I’ll really give you a treasure to trade for my life. I have…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without waiting for him to finish, Wang Lin’s figure appeared behind Liu Qingyun just as he turned around to escape. Both of Wang Lin’s fingers contained the thunder of the heavens. As the thunder rumbled in the sky, Wang Lin pressed down on the center of Liu Qingyun’s back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a loud bang and Liu Qingyun was knocked away. His face was pale and his body was no longer solid, it was rapidly dissipating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin had clearly seen through Liu Qingyun’s trick. He had grown up in the Alliance Star System and had witnessed too many sinister schemes. If he believed Liu Qingyun, then he wouldn’t be Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Liu Qingyun took out the fire corpse, Wang Lin had already noticed something wrong and activated the ancient god furnace. The moment the fire corpse collapsed, he easily avoided everything with the ancient god furnace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin had his reasons for giving Liu Qingyun this opportunity. He knew that as the Vice Hall Master of the Corpse Sect, Liu Qingyun must’ve had some life-saving measures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Wang Lin had just attacked, then, during the heat of battle, it would’ve been difficult to kill this person without suffering injuries. Thus, Wang Lin simply waited for Liu Qingyun to use his ace so he could easily avoid it. The moment Liu Qingyun used his ace would also be the moment he died!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In truth, everything was as Wang Lin expected. This time, he didn’t hold back. After attacking, he merged with the world once more and charged directly at Liu Qingyun once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Qingyun was very smart. As his origin soul was dissipating, he let out a wry smile and realized what Wang Lin was thinking. He secretly regretted his actions. Wang Lin’s figure appeared once more, and as he pointed with his finger, countless bolts of thunder shot out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thunder rumbled in the sky as bolts of lightning descended on Liu Qingyun. Then Wang Lin’s fingers continued to land on Liu Qingyun. Each finger caused Liu Qingyun’s origin soul to almost collapse, and he continued to retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that he had almost no chance to escape, Liu Qingyun’s eyes revealed a flash of viciousness and he shouted, “If you want to kill me, then be buried with me!” There was madness in Liu Qingyun’s eyes as he chose to self-destruct without any hesitation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn’t all of his origin soul. With his cunning, he would never take this risk. Back then, he split off a small portion of his origin soul to save his life in a moment of crisis.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, he decided to give it his all. A destructive aura came out from his origin soul. He had a ferocious expression as he was about to explode. The self-destruction of a Nirvana Scryer cultivator was far more powerful than the fire corpse’s. Once he exploded, planet Suzaku would collapse!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All life on the planet aside from a select few would die!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its effect the Cultivation Planet Crystal would be unimaginable. This was one of the main concerns Wang Lin had that prevented him from attacking right away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that Liu Qingyun chose to explode, Wang Lin was calm and softly said, “Celestial spell, Stop!” In an instant, the Stop spell suddenly appeared. This spell’s power was increased after infusing it with the celestial origin energy from Qing Shui. Liu Qingyun’s exploding origin soul was frozen in place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin arrived in front of Liu Qingyun’s origin soul. As he grabbed the origin soul, ripples appeared under his feet, then he disappeared without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ripples appeared somewhere in the Alliance Star System far away from planet Suzaku. Wang Lin appeared and quickly placed restrictions on Liu Qingyun’s origin soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then his left hand mercilessly slapped Liu Qingyun’s origin soul. The origin energy in his body surged out and shook Liu Qingyun’s origin soul. This caused the destructive aura coming from Liu Qingyun’s origin toul to immediately dissipate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After placing countless restrictions on the origin soul to completely stop its self-destruction, Wang Lin threw the origin soul into his bag. He then turned around, ripples appeared under his feet, and he disappeared into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The big-headed boy’s pupils contracted and his fear of Wang Lin became even stronger in his heart. He knew that if he was facing that collapsing Nirvana Scryer origin soul, he wouldn’t have been able to deal with it so easily. If he was careless, he could’ve even been injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In particular, when Liu Qingyun chose to self-destruct, the big-headed boy’s scalp tinged. However, what shocked him even more was Wang Lin’s calm expression that made it seem as if everything was going as planned. Wang Lin’s actions were extremely fluid as he took away the origin soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of this shocked the big-headed boy. He truly respected Wang Lin at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Serving as this person’s servant is not an insult to my status!”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The big-headed boy took a deep breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ripples appeared in the sky before him and Wang Lin appeared. Wang Lin didn’t say anything to him before looking down on the earth and saying, “Lei Ji, come out!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The earth shook as Lei Ji’s huge body slowly flew into the air. At this moment, he was still a bit weak. When he saw Wang Lin, his eyes contained a trace of awe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was watching the battle just now, and he was very shocked by Wang Lin’s strange spell and constantly calm expression. He stood there and respectfully said, “Lei Ji greets Master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“From now on, you are my mount. If you have any rebellious thoughts, your origin soul will be destroyed!” When Wang Lin’s eyes fell on Lei Ji, Lei Ji felt as if two rays of sword energy had just pierced his eyes. His mind trembled and he quickly nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin slapped his bag of holding and took out a bottle. He threw it at Lei Ji and said, “Take out some of your heart blood and fill this bottle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, Wang Lin began to walk forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ta Shan and the big-headed boy followed behind Wang Lin. Lei Ji held the small bottle and let out a sigh. Popping sounds came from his body and his body immediately contracted. He went from being thousands of feet tall and shrank until he was only 30 feet tall as he followed Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, his heart ached as he pointed at this heart with his right hand. Blood flew out of his heart and made its way into the small bottle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin had saved this Giant Demon Clan ancestor for the trace of ancient god aura in his blood. Although Wang Lin’s cultivation level was higher during his return to the Alliance Star System, the danger he sensed was also increasing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He needed to refine his spells on planet Suzaku, and the first were his ancient god spells! With this blood, Wang Lin would be able to use some of the ancient god spells.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even his original body would be able to use them.</span></p>

There was a planet inside this sea of flames that was completely red. It was covered in flames as if it was a burning cultivation planet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This planet was named the Holy Vermilion Bird Planet!</span></p>

It was as if this place had spent countless years burning.</span></p>

It was a young cultivator riding a firebird. He went into the sea of flames and disappeared.</span></p>

 <p>So a little note on the translation here regarding the translation of 朱雀 to Suzaku. Back when I first start translated I just put 朱雀 and it gave me Suzaku which is basically the Vermillion Bird in japanese but I really didn't look too deep into it back then. It wasn't until much later when I read ahead I found that the 朱雀 here is the Vermillion Bird as part of the four holy beasts but kinda late to go change it consider how many time Suzaku is used also I think its a better fit because now we calling the country, continent, planet, title Vermillion Bird would be even more confusing.. So I'll still refer to planet Suzaku as Suzaku but the refer to the 朱雀圣星 which is the <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Holy Vermillion Bird Planet</span> will be that instead of Holy Suzaku Planet so it make more sense when later stuff are mentioned.</p>
 <p>Also I'll stick to Stop for the spell given the poll result.</p>
