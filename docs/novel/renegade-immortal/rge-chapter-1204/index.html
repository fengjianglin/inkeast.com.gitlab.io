His right hand trembled even more intensely, but it was glued to the skeleton.</span></p>

However, his figure was vague, making it difficult to see him clearly.</span></p>

If I take your Zhan family soul, I can use it as a guide to find where that Old Ghost Zhan hid his old bones for his Void Tribulant. Then I’ll take his skeleton and force out the dao essence from both of you! I’ll destroy his nirvana and complete the heavenly plan!” The ancient voice sound exhausted and gradually disappeared.</span></p>

He knew that the Zhan family ancestor from Allheaven had disappeared among the stars, and no one knew where he had gone. Zhan Xingye was extremely talented, and at some point he accidently found the Battle Scroll. He studied it to comprehend the Battle Domain and then disappeared in pursuit of a higher realm.</span></p>

Thinking back about what happened, his heart felt cold. That seven-colored light was a spell similar to Sundered Night, but far more powerful. Just one spell was enough to kill Zhan Xingye without him being able to resist at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s mouth became dry. While pondering, he frowned and his eyes lit up.</span></p>

If Zhan Xingye was killed like this, how could such a clear will remain? If he died, his will should have dissipated. Even though the will still exists, it shouldn’t be this clear… Also, the voice of the Sovereign at the end clearly seemed exhausted…”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Ideas raced through Wang Lin’s mind, but he couldn’t find any clues.</span></p>

Could these be two realms in the third step? When I comprehended the Battle Scrolls, I saw an old man. The Battle Scrolls were created by that person. He once said that his cultivation level had reached the void and that he was going to have a breakthrough. Could it be… could it be that he was the ‘Old Ghost Zhan’ the Sovereign mentioned...</span></p>

In order to find where this Old Ghost Zhan hid his bones, the Sovereign gave the Battle Scroll to Zhan Xingye. He let Zhan Xingye cultivate the battle domain before killing him for his soul.

What exactly is this heavenly plan?”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Wang Lin’s mind became even more clear.

Before Wang Lin left, he went to the first cave where the mosquito beast was and left a lot of origin crystals.</span></p>

He needed to see the tablet that he saw with his mind before; he needed to see the other half of Zhan Xingye’s remains.</span></p>

All the routes were deeply imprinted in his mind. He moved like a ray of light but didn’t fly, instead moving along the ground.</span></p>

The restriction had been opened and the old woman had disappeared.</span></p>

He passed by the mountain into the fog. Wang Lin was very familiar with this area. The murmuring of the Enlightened Ones entered his ears and some even drifted by him.</span></p>

They were all former cultivators, but they had become things to help someone else nourish dao.</span></p>

That’s why they were trapped by the dao scripture and became Enlightened Ones to nourish dao.</span></p>

He gradually saw a giant statue in the fog. Wang Lin stopped before the statue.</span></p>

The seventh spirit of the Sealed Realm he summoned was comprehended from this statue.</span></p>

More importantly, they would allow Master Ashen Pine to increase the speed at which he cultivated a spell by nine fold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was even more shocking was that each nascent soul could form a spell. Often, there were many spells that couldn’t be cultivated together. No matter how good they were, you had to make a choice. The old woman’s Ying Yang Ancestral spell was like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this was not an issue for Master Ashen Pine. His nine blood nascent souls could cultivate separately.</span></p>
