He had thoroughly seen through Yao Bingyun’s dao heart. Her younger sister was her dao heart and her only flaw!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin didn’t raise his head and calmly said, “I can’t help you with my current strength!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the air, Yao Bingyun looked bleak. She silently pondered for a long time and softly said, “Perhaps I heard wrong…” She turned around with tears in the corners of her eyes and gradually disappear into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From beginning to end, Wang Lin didn’t raise his head, but his eyes were close as he was immersed in his karma dao. Inside his body, the black and white yin and yang fishes slowly turned. They appeared behind him and condensed as they rotated behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every rotation would create a suction force that constantly sucked in everything around him. Then everything was converted to origin energy that went into Wang Lin’s body with a part of it absorbed by the heaven defying bead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Similarly, the surface of the heaven defying bead changed. A yin and yang picture formed and slowly rotated inside Wang Lin’s origin soul.</span></p>

This meant that he had truly reached the second step with his domain and became a Nirvana Scryer cultivator.</span></p>

His left eye contained yang and his right hand contained yin. They were like the sun and moon, and they looked every strange!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As his eyes opened, the yin and yang fishes began to rotate even faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rotation became even faster. In the end, Heng Yun Peak became the center of the spiritual energy movement across the entire planet. It began to fluctuate as if there was a large pair of hands moving it, resulting in a drastic change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Also, due to this, a mad storm of spiritual energy was set off on planet Qing Ling. Although it was invisible, every single cultivator on planet Qing Ling could clearly feel it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Large amounts of spiritual energy gathered toward Heng Yun Peak like crazy. Wang Lin’s eyes revealed a mysterious light as he took a deep breath and the yin and yang fishes stopped rotating.</span></p>

However, after one step, his expression changed and he looked into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if his gaze could penetrate countless kilometers. He saw the old man name Xie struggling to walk this way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was continuing to walk with his mortal body. It was as if it was a pilgrimage and his goal was Heng Yun Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin silently pondered before withdrawing his gaze. He sat down once more and closed his eyes,</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time slowly passed. In the blink of an eye, half a month passed. During this half a month, Wang Lin remained unmoving. As for the old man named Xie, he began walking faster and faster. Originally, with his mortal body, it was impossible for him to persist. However, every time he was exhausted, he would feel a hot energy cycle through his body, causing all his fatigue to disappear and filling him with energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like this, he arrived under Heng Yun Peak after half a month. The old man named Xie looked up at the peak. After taking a deep breath, he revealed a decisive gaze and walked up the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He climbed step by step. Even though his knee broke and blood flowed out, he climbed without pause toward the top. In his heart, there was a belief that supported him to continue moving forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I thought I understood everything about human relations and gained enlightenment in the world of academics. I gave myself the duty of civilizing the world. However, in my twilight years, I suddenly gained enlightenment. I am a fish in the water…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man named Xie’s face was filled with bitterness, but his eyes became even brighter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Humans are the fishes, the heavens are the water, dao is the net, and the net is the creator!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">” On this day, he finally reached the peak. There he saw a person cultivating with a pair of eyes that contained the universe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the old man named Xie was tired and the blood on his knees had crusted, at this moment, it was as if he was struck by thunder. The thunderous roar echoed inside his body, causing him to feel as if his soul had left his body. For an instant, he felt like he saw a black and white yin and yang image. He immediately knelt on the ground as if he was worshiping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Please teach me dao!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin calmly looked at the old man named Xie and silently pondered for a moment. This old man was an honored mortal on planet Qing Ling. They were different from other mortals because they had a dao heart. Although it was very illusory, it did exist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though it didn’t mean that these people were suitable to cultivate dao. In fact, children with pure minds were much more suited. It’s just that once these people completed their dao, although their cultivation level wouldn’t be high, their comprehension of dao would be extremely profound, so they would be able to travel much farther down the road in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, his body was already old and couldn’t withstand the force of spiritual energy. It would be difficult for him to cultivate dao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin calmly said, “You don’t have much life left. Cultivating dao is not something obtained easily. Have you considered his carefully?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man named Xie looked at Wang Lin. His eyes were filled with determination as he said, “When I was three, I learned words. I learned poems by age six. My name shocked the capital when I was 14. However, my heart has always been in a daze. I told myself that I understood humans, but there was always the feeling of being suppressed by the world. I’m old and have resigned to teaching the next generation. I was ready to spend the remainder of my life in a daze and suppression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, that wind that entered my room allowed me to find the source of that daze. What is dao… The enlightenment at the river forced me to make a decision. Even if I died, I had to make it here just to… find dao! Please teach me dao! Accept me as your disciple!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s gaze fell on the old man named Xie. He looked at the old man’s eyes as if he could see through the old man’s mind. He could vaguely see the scene of reincarnation behind the old man!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a long time, Wang Lin withdrew his gaze and calmly asked, “What is your name?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man took a deep breath and said, “Xie Qing!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In my entire life, I’ve never had any disciples. Since your enlightenment was a karmic cause I created, I can accept you as an honorary disciple! I’ll gift you this mountain for a while to cultivate. I won’t teach you any spells and will instead only gift you a chance at comprehension!” Wang Lin raised his right hand and pointed forward. The yin and yang fishes suddenly rotated. They seemed to enter Wang Lin’s finger and then went in between Xie Qing’s eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xie Qing’s body trembled. His eyes were filled with confusion as he fell onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin took a look at Xie Qing before waving his sleeves. A large amount of white mist appeared under his feet and he disappeared into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One day later, Xie Qing opened his eyes. They were still filled with confusion. After silently pondering for a long time, he sat down on the mountain peak, closed his eyes, and quietly began his comprehension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin didn’t immediately leave planet Qing Ling but went to find the Chosen Immortal Clan. He took out the yellow talisman, but none of them recognized it. They felt a powerful sense of familiarity with it but had no memories of it.</span></p>
