It contained the force of a mountain as it smashed into the middle-aged man.</span></p>

A destructive aura was about to erupt from his body.</span></p>

After he sent out the origin energy, he opened his storage space and the iron sword swept forward.</span></p>

Blood appeared on his neck and then sprayed everywhere. What died wasn’t just his body, but also his weakened origin soul.</span></p>

His dim gaze was still ferocious.</span></p>

However, Wang Lin didn’t know anything about them.</span></p>

On the surface, they all looked the same, like they had died from the poison in their bodies.</span></p>

Wang Lin was always cautious, so although the differences were small, he still saw them.</span></p>

The other four were not like this; they were killed first and then the poison in their bodies activated. The positions of the four bodies made Wang Lin speculate.</span></p>

They could’ve been his disciple as he said, or they could have been the old woman’s disciples.</span></p>

He just knew that the middle-aged man was lying when he said he couldn’t use origin energy.</span></p>

However, he wasn’t willing to give up. A flame shot out of his left eye and surrounded the four corpses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sound of fire crackling echoed in the valley. There was a powerful poison inside the corpses, and the fire gave off a ghostly glow. Soon, they were burned to ashes.</span></p>

He held the beast bone fragment tightly in his hand and a monstrous killing intent appeared in his eyes. At this moment, if anyone tried to rob this fragment from him, they would receive Wang Lin’s crazed attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The person who takes this pill will have 10% chance of turning law into source origin and reaching what us cultivators call the third step!

He quickly put the jade and beast bone away in his storage space. He didn’t have time to think of the details, but he was extremely sure that these things were enough to cause a calamity in the cultivation world!</span></p>

Just as he was about to take them away, Wang Lin hesitated and decisively pointed at one of the skulls. The skull immediately collapsed and the shattered fragments fell inside and outside the valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s eyes flashed and thoughts raced through his mind as he took the remaining seven skulls. Then, after pondering a bit, he took out the corpse of the disciple and placed it back in its original location.</span></p>

Wang Lin didn’t dare to stay for too long and could only achieve something like this.</span></p>

Then he disappeared using Spatial Bending. When he reappeared, he was next to the escaping black ape.</span></p>

It was obviously telling Wang Lin there were herbs there.</span></p>

He took the yellow talisman off the black ape and put the giant ape in his storage space. Then he charged off into the sky, broke through the fog, and placed the yellow talisman on his body. He was still dissatisfied with his speed, so he took out the beast skin and put it on his body as well.</span></p>

This would be the same even in the Alliance and Allheaven because this recipe was enough to make some cultivators go crazy!</span></p>

Wang Lin had a feeling that there were many cultivators rushing toward that wild continent in the rank 5 region right now.</span></p>
