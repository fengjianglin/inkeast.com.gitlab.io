Although Wang Lin’s expression was calm, his heart was shaken as he looked at the five-colored butterfly flapping next to him. After pondering for a moment, Wang Lin lifted his right hand to form a seal and carefully pressed it toward the butterfly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The butterfly’s wings paused and then turned into specks of five-colored light that slowly dispersed. After a moment, it turned back into the God Slaying War Chariot.</span></p>

The feeling of cold sweat was very rare for him. However, the scene of a peak Corporeal Yang cultivator’s body and origin soul completely collapsing from just a flap of the butterfly’s wing shocked him greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With this God Slaying War Chariot and the Wither Dao Pair, I can battle Nirvana Scryer Cultivators!”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Wang Lin’s eyes shined brightly as he looked around. The Chosen Immortal Clan members returned to normal after the middle-aged man died. Their eyes were filled with sorrow and they silently pondered on the ground.</span></p>

He was holding a big pot in his hand. He had managed to capture the fog beast that went after the children. However, he was very injured, so after he came back, he fell into a coma.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time flashed by and 10 days passed. For these 10 days, Wang Lin lived with the Chosen Immortal Clan. The ancestor had prepared a quiet place for him to stay.</span></p>

After a detailed conversation with the old man, Wang Lin felt that his previous guess was 80% accurate.</span></p>

Wang Lin’s focus was on how to leave this place.</span></p>

It was just as Ta Shan had said, the end of the sky was a boundless wall of flesh. However, blue light penetrated the wall of flesh, making it look like a real world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aside from the sky, Wang Lin had searched the entire continent, but he still hadn’t found an exit. At this point, Wang Lin was convinced that the formation inside the Mysterious Yin Furnace at the altar was the way out!</span></p>

All of this makes this entire place very strange. That blue-robed man claimed he was a celestial and the power he used was similar to celestial spiritual energy, but it also contained the aura of origin energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It was very similar to Celestial Lord Qing Shui back in the Thunder Celestial Realm. Adding on the reaction of the Chosen Immortal Clan members, it is very likely that the blue-robed man was a real celestial!”</span></p>

He reappeared at a plain on the eastern side of the continent.</span></p>

The mosquito beast flew in the sky, and after circling a few times, it flew toward Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thunder toad’s body that was like a small mountain was lying in the grass in the distance. It opened its eyes to look at Wang Lin before closing them once more.</span></p>

He had already gone to who-knows-where to look for fun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the mosquito closed in, Wang Lin revealed a smile and patted the mosquito’s head. The mosquito revealed a comfortable expression as it flew into the air once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin stepped forward in the grass, and a moment later, he arrived at an open area about 1,000 feet wide. The grass here had been cleaned out and replaced with gulches. These gulches intersected and formed a complex image, as if it was a formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin didn’t even look at the gulches on the ground before stepping inside. He sat down at the center of the formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since Wang Lin had released the thunder toad and mosquito beast, he hadn’t taken them back and let them move around freely. As for Xu Liguo, Wang Lin was too lazy to care.</span></p>

After removing the grass, he placed a restriction formation here. With the mosquito beast and thunder toad guarding, there was a certain degree of safety.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he sat there, Wang Lin’s hand formed a seal and pressed down on the formation. There was a flash of light and then everything disappeared and was replaced with a field of grass.</span></p>

During his trip to the Thunder Celestial Realm, he had managed to obtain a lot among all the dangers he had faced. However, he hadn’t had time to refine any of them since he left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally, he planned to go to planet Qing Ling after leaving the Thunder Celestial Realm to refine the treasures, but he didn’t expect to be sent here.</span></p>

That way, the road to leaving here will be smoother.”</span></p>

The skin used to make this armor was very rough and there were some runes on it. While holding the leather armor, Wang Lin’s left hand gently touched it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ancient God Leather Armor…”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin silently stared at it for a moment before he threw it into the air.

The leather armor showed no change inside the flame. However, not only did Wang Lin not stop, he spat out more essence origin energy.</span></p>

Although he was dead, his cultivation was very strong. Even now, there was still a trace of broken yet independent divine sense on the armor.</span></p>

Although not all treasure spirits were formed like this, this was how most were formed.</span></p>

It will end up like Rain Celestial Swords, whose true master is only the spirit inside. Moreover, this is only a fragment of a celestial’s divine sense, and it conflicts with the ancient gods. Although they have begun to fuse after countless years, it still isn’t enough!”</span></p>

On this day, a blue mist came out of the Ancient God Leather Armor that was being refined by Wang Lin. The blue mist moved as if it was under extreme pain, but it was forced out of the leather armor by Wang Lin’s essence origin energy.</span></p>

At this moment, Wang Lin opened his eyes and they turned cold. He raised his hand and mercilessly chopped down!</span></p>

Wang Lin took out the one-billion-soul soul flag. It turned into black mist and devoured the blue mist.</span></p>

Wang Lin’s eyes lit up and his divine sense spread out and entered the leather armor, leaving behind his own imprint. This imprint was very strong and the leather armor immediately gave off an ancient aura.</span></p>

It was very familiar and kind… like a child that had been wandering for many years that suddenly met his relatives. This was the feeling Wang Lin felt, but it was also the feeling the Ancient God Leather Armor had as well.</span></p>

The Ancient God Leather Armor didn’t need to be summoned by Wang Lin; it flew toward Wang Lin and entered his chest. Wang Lin didn’t reject it, and he felt a familiar feeling when the leather armor entered his body.</span></p>

There was a flash of light and his origin soul flew out. The Ancient God Leather Armor was almost impossible to see in his ancient dragon form, but Wang Lin could clearly feel that his origin soul’s defense had reached a terrifying degree.</span></p>

However, a spell that can seal a person’s spell is very interesting!” Origin energy filled Wang Lin’s right hand and he mercilessly crushed the golden lock.</span></p>
