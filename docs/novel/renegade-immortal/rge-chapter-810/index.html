His eyes were cold but had a demonic glow. His lips were thin and he gave off a harsh aura. His scattered hair made him look like a devil among celestials.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He walked out from the gate of the altar and flew into the air. His figure hadn’t solidified yet. If one looked at him, they would still see the altar behind him.</span></p>

The butterfly gently flapped its wings to keep itself afloat.</span></p>

Ta Shan’s eyes were cold as he took a step forward and shouted, “Who is this!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blue-robed middle-aged man’s gaze moved from Ta Shan and swept through the members of the Chosen Immortal Clan. His gaze finally fell on Wang Lin and became serious.</span></p>

He was able to see through this middle-aged man’s cultivation at a glance. The middle-aged man was at the peak of the Corporeal Yang stage, a bit higher than himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Ta Shan frowned and rushed forward with his right first. The tattoos on his body flashed and condensed on his right fist as he punched toward the middle-aged man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ta Shan shouted, “Who is this!?”</span></p>

It was as if he was looking at an ant when he looked at Ta Shan. His raised his right hand and pointed with one finger. A ripple appeared with this finger as the center and began to spread.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Ta Shan closed in, his expression immediately turned pale. He could clearly feel a power inside his body that prevented him from getting closer and attacking.</span></p>

When he was 200 feet from the middle-aged man, Ta Shan couldn’t move any closer. His face revealed pain as his whole body trembled and large drops of sweat dripped down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He clearly felt that the power that prevented him from moving forward came from his own tattoos. The power from the tattoos made it so he couldn’t resist.</span></p>

No matter how strong he became, he still wouldn’t dare to attack the middle-aged man.</span></p>

It was as if the other party only needed one thought to cause him to collapse immediately.</span></p>

However, the moment this feeling appeared, it was as if it had always been there. It was something that was branded into the life of all Chosen Immortal Clan members.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He couldn’t resist! Ta Shan’s body trembled. When the middle-aged man’s gaze landed on him, he even had the impulse to kneel down and worship the middle-aged man. However, due to his own dignity, Ta Shan clenched his teeth and stopped this feeling coming from his soul and the tattoos on his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A growl of struggle that was almost like a roar came from his throat, and his eyes were bloodshot. What came out of his body was no longer sweat, it was blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While struggling, Ta Shan lifted his feet and took another step. His body trembled once more as if he was facing the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This step had only risen, and before it could land, Ta Shan’s vision went black and he coughed out a large mouthful of blood. His body could no longer withstand the force. It was as if there was a big, invisible hand pressing down on him and making him kneel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two streams of blood came out from his eyes. His eyes contained a mix of sadness and unyieldingness, but his body could no longer stand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could only kneel!</span></p>

If it wasn’t for the fact that I didn’t want to kill you, you would’ve died with just a thought from this celestial! Now scram!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if Ta Shan’s body was hit by an invisible fist. Sounds of explosions came from his body when he was thrown away. He crashed into the ground more than 1,000 feet away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ta Shan struggled to get up. His eyes were filled with an unyielding and murderous gaze as he shouted, “Who are you!?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, not only Ta Shan, but all the Chosen Celestial Clan members sucked in breaths of cold air as they stared at the middle-aged man. What just happened was too strange, and they couldn’t accept it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ancestor’s face was pale as he looked at the middle-aged man. He seemed to remember something and his body began to tremble.</span></p>

Why aren’t you kneeling yet?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ancestor of the Chosen Immortal Clan let out a wry smile, and at this moment, he didn’t doubt the middle-aged man’s words. He remembered how the ancestors described their excitement and respect when meeting a celestial in the records.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no need to guess this person’s identity. “As soon as you meet them, you will know.” These were words left beyond by the ancestors of the Chosen Immortal Clan.</span></p>

He mistook that excitement and respect with loyalty. However, when he saw the celestial, he suddenly understood.</span></p>

The hearts of the other Chosen Immortal Clan members trembled as the middle-aged man stared at them. There was a force inside their bodies that made them yield. Even if they died, even if their souls shattered, they still had to yield!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One by one, the Chosen Immortal Clan members knelt down and lowered their heads.</span></p>

This time, no matter how much blood came out from his body or how much the invisible force pressured him, he struggled to force himself to not kneel!</span></p>

He had already been injured in his battle with Wang Lin, so right now his body couldn’t bear it anymore. His eyes were dim, but they still revealed an unyielding gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin frowned when he saw what was happening.

This slave imprint is extremely overbearing and is far more powerful than the one used on Li Yuan’s family. After all, the one used on Li Yuan’s family only made his family serve one celestial.</span></p>
