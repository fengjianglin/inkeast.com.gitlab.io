It pulled the clan member into the air and let out a cry that penetrated that clan member’s body. That clan member’s body exploded into a mist of blood that was absorbed by the fog beast.</span></p>

He struggled to raise his head and looked at the deaths of his clan members. A sound like the roar of a beast came from his throat. The veins on his face were bulging as he tried to resist the slave imprint that had become an instinct for his clan.</span></p>

A force came from the deepest part of his heart and filled his body. The old man’s eyes were filled with sadness as he looked at the blue-robed man and shouted, “Why!?”</span></p>

I won’t let all of you die, because I need you to reproduce future generations…” The blue-robed man’s voice was extremely calm.</span></p>

Just at this moment, Wang Lin let out a sigh and pointed at the void. The fog beast that was about to devour the old man suddenly collapsed. The old man stared at &nbsp;the fog beast that was closing in on the buildings. He could even hear the children calling out in panic. They were calling for their love dones...</span></p>

My clan guarded the Mysterious Yin Furnace for countless years, but what did we get!?! It was these fog beasts and the countless deaths of my clan members!</span></p>

This is your life! You can’t change it!”</span></p>

Blood sprayed out of the body of the Chosen Immortal Clan members and they were stopped from getting up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Ta Shan charged out with a roar. The moment he charged out, explosions came from inside his body as his bones were shattering, but he still charged out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blue-robed man’s eyes lit up and he pointed with his finger. Wang Lin let out a sigh. He originally didn’t want to meddle. This blue-robed man’s origin was very mysterious, and he was actually a celestial!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, as he let out a sigh, he opened his mouth and the fragment flew out. The moment it appeared, it flew between Ta Shan and the blue-robed dman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blue-robed man’s eyes lit up and his gaze turned cold. His right hand formed a seal and a rune filled with celestial spiritual energy shot out toward Wang Lin.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s right hand pointed at the fragment, causing it to rotate and smash toward the blue-robed man. At the same time, Wang Lin arrived beside Ta Shan. His left hand touched Ta Shan and sent out some origin energy into Ta Shan’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ta Shan’s body was immediately thrown out toward the fog beast that was charging at the buildings.</span></p>

The incoming rune immediately collapsed and turned into ripples that quickly dissipated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the fragment landed and the blue-robed man’s eyes became cold. His hand formed a seal and the celestial spiritual energy inside his body surged, then a spear appeared in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This spear was completely white and gave off rich celestial spiritual energy. He let out a laugh as he smashed the spear into the incoming fragment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a loud bang and the blue-robed man was knocked backwards. His eyes became serious. However, the fragment was also pushed back several dozen feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the middle-aged man retreated, he shouted, “Lowly slaves, attack with me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When his voice entered the struggling Chosen Immortal Clan members’ ears, the order became their instinct and they couldn’t resist. Their eyes were filled with sadness and struggle, but their bodies all rushed toward Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s eyes lit up and he retreated. The butterfly formed by the God Slaying War Chariot was still following Wang Lin. Now that Wang Lin was retreating, it followed Wang Lin like a shadow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin had a thought. He wasn’t clear about the power of the third God Slaying War Chariot. His eyes lit up as his right hand formed a seal and pressed it down on the butterfly’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Killing intent appeared in Wang Lin’s eyes and he pointed at the blue-robed man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The butterfly didn’t move at all and its wings gently fluttered, but this time they were a little faster. Five-colored powder fell from its wings and slowly filled the area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blue-robed man immediately stopped, and his eyes were filled with caution. He had long noticed the butterfly, and it was the butterfly that gave him a feeling of dread. Otherwise, he would have already attacked instead of waiting until now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Chosen Immortal Clan members all flew into the air without their control and flew toward Wang Lin. The struggle in their eyes became even stronger, but they couldn’t resist the power of the slave imprint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s eyes shined brightly as he stared at the butterfly.
