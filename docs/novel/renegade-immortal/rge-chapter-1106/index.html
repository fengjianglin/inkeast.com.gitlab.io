The mountain that sprayed out the black smoke and flames trembled once more. Waves of lava began to surge out to the top of the mountain and intense heat filled the area. Then an aura that could destroy everything in the world appeared.</span></p>

Although they didn’t escape death, the pain they suffered couldn’t be compared to what the four remaining ones experienced. These last four were a bit slow and didn’t even have time to fly away before the lava smashed into them. The moment the lava got close, their bodies began to burn, leaving behind nothing but black skeletons that maintained the posture of what they were doing before death.</span></p>

They didn’t die in the first wave of lava but couldn’t escape the lava. They could only struggle inside. Even though they used various spells and treasures, it was difficult to escape this calamity!</span></p>

Its eyes were filled with coldness as it flew into the Mountain Crumbles, where its companions were. Wang Lin’s Mountain Crumble had destroyed all sealing forces, and there were no flames around the mosquito beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the mosquito king arriving, the mosquito beasts let out a cries and immediately followed after their king. This group of mosquito beasts charged left and right inside Wang Lin’s Mountain Crumbles. They were very vengeful as the charged at a terrified cultivator in yellow.</span></p>

He had just avoided a flaming boulder when he felt a gust of wind behind him. Seeing the mosquito beasts, his expression changed, but he was too late. The group of mosquito beasts surrounded him and tore his body apart.</span></p>

Under the power of Mountain Crumbles, there were no injuries, only death. The origin soul of the elder in purple that had lost his body was terrified. He dodged the burning boulders and black smoke as he clenched his teeth and charged at the formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other elder in purple was also pale as he dodged the black smoke and charged at the formation, completely disregarding the lives of the disciples. He was terrified, and his heart was filled with regret and hatred. He regretted his greed, and he hated the three disciples under him that brought the giant mosquito beasts that caused this calamity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s eyes were calm, but he didn’t show any mercy toward these people. They dared to think about stealing the mosquito beasts, so they deserved to pay the price! He opened his arms and shouted, “Mountain, first crumble!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Wang Lin shouted, the mountain trembled once more and a large amount of rocks fell off into the lava. The surrounding lava suddenly soared into the air, and at the same time, it filled the starfield with an unimaginable force. Some of the remaining cultivators were touched by this lava and were turned into black ashes while screaming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fastest elder in purple’s origin soul got near the center of the formation. Thanks to the first crumble, countless cracks had appeared on the already broken formation, and it released a harsh glow.</span></p>

The intense, flashing light suddenly penetrated anything nearby.</span></p>

However, due to this pause, a burning boulder smashed into his origin soul from above.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder coughed out a mouthful of essence origin energy as he retreated, and his origin soul began to burn. However, the crisis wasn’t over yet. The poisonous black smoke formed a storm around him. As miserable screams echoed, the elder used some unknown method to charged out of his storm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was covered in flames and his origin soul was bleak, as if it would dissipate at any time. His origin soul looked like the skin of a toad and was covered in pustules. These pustules were filled with fire poison!</span></p>

The elder roared in anguish as he retreated. He jerked his head up to look at Wang Lin, and there was madness in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If I die, you will die with me!!” The old man let out a roar and charged at Wang Lin. At this moment, he was prepared to self-destruct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Waves of origin energy came from the elder’s origin soul, forming a violent force that charged at Wang Lin. Wang Lin’s expression was neutral, and as the elder got close, Wang Lin pointed with his right hand. Celestial origin energy moved along his body and went into his right hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop!” Wang Lin’s voice was cold, but the moment he spoke, the old man’s origin soul paused for a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s cultivation level was higher than Wang Lin’s, so Wang Lin activated his fire origin energy to suppress the rebound from the Stop spell. He waved his right hand, and with a thought, the Karma Whip appeared like a dragon and shot toward the elder. There was a snap, and the destructive aura coming from the elder’s origin soul was shattered by the Karma Whip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the snapping sound echoed, the elder’s origin soul let out miserable screams. The madness in his eyes was gone and was replaced with fear. Just as he was about to retreat, the Karma Whip pulled him to Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin grabbed the origin soul and threw into the crack leading to Wang Lin’s storage space. It looked as if the origin soul was devoured.</span></p>

This caused the remaining elder to tremble, and he turned to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But how could Wang Lin let him escape? His right hand pointed at the sky and he shouted, “Second crumble!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One mountain two crumbles was the limit of Wang Lin’s current understanding of Mountain Crumbles.
