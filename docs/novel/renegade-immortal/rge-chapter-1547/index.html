It had gained some intelligence and began to panic. However, it was also surrounded by the golden light and erased from existence!</span></p>

He carried with him a lifetime of nightmares as he retreated in fear.</span></p>

After he disappeared, Master Hong Shan and the others launched the full force of the Inner Realm to find them. In the end, including the one inside the Alliance Headquarters, we only found a total of five!</span></p>

In the end, he was trapped inside the Seven-Colored Realm in Summoned River, with 30,000 cultivators guarding it! Currently, the person leading the Inner Realm is one of his avatars.</span></p>

At the most critical moment, Celestial Emperor Qing Lin left the Rain Celestial Realm and led the battle. Even with the third step cultivators from the Summoned River delaying them, we were unable to stop the approach of the Outer Realm army!</span></p>

In the end, Celestial Emperor Qing Lin used an ancient celestial spell that summoned the ancient light to seal the connection between the Seven-Colored Realms and the Outer Realm. This made it so the passages were sealed for a short period of time, allowing us to barely survive the second battle!</span></p>

Several Outer Realm third step cultivators were killed and seriously injured, but it was the same for us. Celestial Emperor Qing Lin was seriously injured, two from the Summoned River died, and the rest were all forced into closed door cultivation to heal.</span></p>

According to Master Hong Shan’s calculations, it won’t take long for the Outer Realm to break the ancient light. Then they will enter and combine forces with the two remaining Seven-Colored Realms. The Inner Realm is in danger!”</span></p>

The Inner Realm is in danger. There was no Seven-Colored Realm in Allheaven. The one in the Cloud Sea was destroyed by you. After you disappeared, we found the other five places. Aside from the one in the Brilliant Void, the rest were all at the Summoned River!</span></p>

Allheaven is the most calm and there wasn’t much collapse. However, the Brilliant Void is similar to the Summoned River. Due to the Seven-Colored Realm in the Alliance Headquarters, this star system is controlled by both sides!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master Hong Shan tried to destroy the remaining Seven-Colored Realms because he was afraid of facing two fronts once the fourth battle began. However, he has tried many times, but the Inner Realm doesn’t have the power to destroy them anymore… Everyone is in closed door cultivation…”</span></p>

He didn’t expect time to flow differently inside the Nether Beast. So much fighting had happened outside!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Summoned River has fallen… the Alliance Headquarters is occupied by Outer Realm cultivators…”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a flash of killing intent in Wang Lin’s eyes.</span></p>

When it landed on Master Flamespark, he felt like he was an ant before Wang Lin and Wang Lin was like the heavens. He had long felt that Wang Lin was even stronger than before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lord of the Sealed Realm said that you would come here… I… I didn’t believe you were dead, and I guessed that you would come here once you appeared.

If anything happens to the Seven-Colored Realm, I need to report it.” Master Flamespark was very respectful and didn’t dare to look at Wang Lin’s eyes. That golden light made him feel fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin raised his right hand and waved at Master Flamespark as he pondered. A ray of golden light flew into Master Flamespark and his body trembled. The veins on his face swelled and large amount of sweat appeared, but his eyes became even brighter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an instant, he let out a painful roar. The sweat from his body was dark and smelled, but his scattering aura began to condense; it was even showing signs of a breakthrough!</span></p>

His appearance went from an old man to middle-aged. His eyes were filled with disbelief as he stared at this body and became even more excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This… This… Thanks… Thank you, Lord of the Sealed Realm!!” There was fervor in Master Flamespark’s eyes and he deeply bowed at Wang Lin. He could clearly feel that the golden light had caused his body to be reborn. The golden light that made him feel suffocated had changed everything!</span></p>
