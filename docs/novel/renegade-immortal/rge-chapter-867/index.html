 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s eyes darkened a bit and he said, “Rumor has it that this stone is a relic from the ancient Celestial Realm. If one can leave their name on it, their soul can directly go into the ancient Celestial Realm that is rumored to have vanished!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I didn’t expect the Celestial Bestowing Stone to be at the Thunder Celestial Temple!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle-aged man named Gongsun opened and closed his eyes. Every time his eyes opened, light would shine out, and he calmly said, “Although the ancient Celestial Realm has disappeared, rumors were left behind, saying that countless years from now, the ancient Celestial Realm will reopen. When that happens, only the people whose names were left on the Celestial Bestowing Stone will be allowed to go! Although it is only a rumor, it is the only clue left!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surroundings were completely quiet. Aside from a select few people, almost no one knew what the Celestial Bestowing Stone was. However, after hearing what the old man named Xiang said, they all immediately understood the important of this stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there were many cultivators who didn’t know what the ancient Celestial Realm was. They all looked at their families’ ancestors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Master Flamespark calmly said, “The Celestial Bestowing Stone shattered into countless fragments when the Thunder Celestial Realm collapsed. My Thunder Celestial Temple didn’t obtain it, so no need to think about this matter. It was when that senior captured the Moon Beast that he found me and gave me a piece the size of my fist!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he said this, all the old monsters on the praying mats became silent and no longer inquired about this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The three trials of heaven, earth, and human. The first trial is human. If you can withstand 10 breaths of time, then you pass!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Russell, enter the thunder lake!” Master Thunderspark’s voice spread across the area and a ray of green light closed in. The green light turned into a green-robed middle-aged man before everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This person clasped his hands at everyone and said, “As the Lord of the Temple orders!” As he spoke, he descended toward the square. He stood on top of the square with his hand behind his back. There was a trace of pride in his calm expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His appearance caught the attention of the surrounding cultivators. There were naturally people who were aware of Russell’s identity, and discussions began.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Thunder Celestial Temple’s Russell!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumor has it that he reached the mid stage of Nirvana Scryer 300 years ago and that he has been in closed door cultivation for 300 years and never appeared. I didn’t expect him to be the gatekeeper for the human trial.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This Russell is not simple, especially the change in his divine sense. Rumor has it that even some famous old monsters praise him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bursts of discussion echoed throughout the area. Russell raised his head and looked up at the hundreds of juniors. He was calm as he said, “In my eyes, none of you are eligible to become the 108 celestials, because killing you would be no more difficult than crushing ants! Now I’m going to point at one of you. Anyone I point at will come down!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Russell spoke, a majority of cultivators that came out from the transfer arrays looked gloomily at Russell. This was especially true for Xu Ting. His eyes flashed red, but he didn’t speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Russell didn’t waste time and his right hand casually pointed at a cultivator from the Northern Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the cultivator was pointed at, he hesitated for a moment, but it was that hesitation that caused Russell to let out a cold snort and his right hand reached out. A large hand appeared and rushed out so fast that even the surrounding cultivators could feel the wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That large hand moved as fast as lightning and caught the cultivator in an instant. It mercilessly dragged the cultivator down and threw that cultivator to the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cultivator’s expression immediately turned pale. His was only at the Illusory Yin stage, and after being grabbed by that large hand, he felt as if ice had entered his body and solidified his origin energy. Once he landed, he immediately sat down in the lotus position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Russell revealed his impatience. He didn’t consider this so-called celestial title competition worthy of his time. If it wasn’t for the fact that the Lord of the Temple had asked him personally, which meant that he couldn’t refuse, he wouldn’t have come to become the judge for the first trial. In addition, there was another reason why he became the judge for this trial.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After dragging down the cultivator, the impatience in his eyes became even stronger. His divine sense spread out and the world changed colors. Russell’s divine sense was extremely strange and could change shape. When it came out, a golden giant immediately appeared and a loud rumble echoed across the void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the giant appeared, it rushed toward the cultivator that was sitting there. It was very fast and it closed in on the cultivator in only three steps. The golden giant raised its fist and threw it at the cultivator sitting there!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This punch was still on its way when the cultivator’s face turned deathly pale and his eyes became filled with terror. His clothes and hair were blown backward by the wind created by the punch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s eyes lit up like a torch as he stared at this scene. At the moment the golden giant’s fist landed, the cultivator’s body trembled and he coughed out blood. There was a blur when the cultivator’s origin soul was knocked out. Terrified, the cultivator’s origin soul quickly retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Russell let out a cold snort, the golden giant withdrew its fist, took a few steps back, and stood next to Russell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Trash, with your cultivation and mental strength, you’re not qualified to participate in the celestial title competition. You’re not qualified!” The impatience in Russell’s eyes became even stronger. He felt that testing this person was a waste of his time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That cultivator’s origin soul turned to his body. He then looked at Russell with a pale expression and opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something. However, in the end he didn’t say anything and bowed. He sadly returned to the transfer array and in a flash disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was now one less from the original 325.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Russell frowned as his gaze swept across the cultivators in the sky and he casually pointed at a person. The cultivator he pointed at clenched his teeth and rushed down. After landing in the square, the cultivator clasped his hands at Russell and respectfully said, “Senior, please enlighten me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Russell’s expression became a bit softer, but he didn’t speak. Then the golden giant stepped forward and used the same spell it used before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cultivator clenched his teeth as his hand formed a seal and a white light covered his body to stop the golden giant. However, the white light immediately collapsed before the golden fist. The cultivator was pushed back, then he bit the tip of this tongue and spat out blood to block the fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the golden giant’s fist landed on the blood mist, it caused a loud rumble. The blood mist immediately collapsed and the cultivator’s face turned pale. His origin soul was more than halfway out of his body, but as he let out a cry of anguish, there was popping sound from his body and he pulled his origin soul back in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this was beyond his endurance. Although his origin soul had returned to his body, he became weakened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you lasted for 10 breaths of time, you pass, but even though a piece of trash like you has passed, you will be eliminated in the next trial!” Russell waved his sleeves and the cultivator’s body was thrown into the air. The man’s face was pale as he bowed at Russell. Then he returned to his transfer array and sat down to cultivate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shortly after, one cultivator after another was pointed at by Russell. If they acted fast, it was fine; otherwise, they would be forcibly dragged down by Russell like the first person and would suffer injuries before the test even began.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As cultivators landed one by one, the word “trash” was constantly thrown out. Even people who qualified couldn’t help but be called trash by Russell. Russell gradually grew more impatient until it got to the point where the golden giant would throw a punch before the participant even landed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time quickly passed. More than half of the cultivators had been tested and about 40% of them qualified. The man with six fingers, the big headed boy, and Nangong Shan, who had high cultivation levels, all advanced. Only when testing them did Russell’s expression soften a bit and he didn’t call them trash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You, come down!” Russell pointed at a person in the sky. This person was Xu Ting from planet Dong Lin. His eyes flashed red and he revealed a grim smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Russell’s eyes were cold as his right hand reached out and the large hand appeared. It charged directly at Xu Ting. As the hand closed, in Xu Ting’s hands formed a seal. Black gas surrounded him and formed a devil-like being. The devil-like being let out a roar and entangled with the large hand. Xu Ting sneered as he rushed out. He wasn’t going into the square just to be tested, and as he rushed out, he put his hands together and then separated them. Black gas came out from his hands and formed a black lance.</span></p>
