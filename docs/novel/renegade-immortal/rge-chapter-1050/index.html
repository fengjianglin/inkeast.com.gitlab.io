Every single Nirvana Shatterer old monster would treasure a Void treasure greatly. After all, the method of producing them was lost, and they couldn’t be repaired. Once they were broken, they would lose a lot of their power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In truth, some Pseudo Nirvana Void treasures weren’t really Pseudo Nirvana Void; they were merely just Void treasures. They were just a bit stronger, and the “Pseudo Nirvana Void” name was just for vanity’s sake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For normal Nirvana Shatterer old monsters, Void treasures were already the peak, and they would do anything for them. However, for those that stood at the top, although Void treasures were still precious, they weren’t lacking these kinds of treasures.&nbsp;</span></p>

What they pursued was how to transcend the second step toward the legendary third step they all dreamed of.</span></p>

One could only wait for the five Heaven’s Blights to arrive one by one. In the end, they would become a grain of sand among the waves and die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For those old monsters that had lived such long lives, it was no longer a dream or hope of reaching the third step, but a desire to live. Only with the power of the third step could they endure the five Heaven’s Blights; otherwise, what awaited them was death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, a cultivator from the system under the Wind Celestial Realm arrived in the Alliance Star System. Although he hadn’t reached the third step, he had passed the fourth Heaven’s Blight!</span></p>

Every time they passed a Heaven’s Blight, their strength would increase greatly. However, they were simply too difficult, and failure meant they would immediately die!</span></p>

This treasure was a Nirvana treasure! After investigating, Nirvana treasures seemed to come from primordial times, but the amount that remained was extremely low.</span></p>

Almost all of them were in the hands of peak Nirvana Shatterer cultivators.</span></p>

They were split into low, mid, high, and top tier, like normal treasures. After all, these treasures were all left behind by ancestors. The descendants didn’t even know how to make them, much less categorize them properly.</span></p>

The man in black immediately jumped between the statues and copied Wang Lin to leave this place. Master Void and the beautiful woman also flew over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, at the in the second floor of the Celestial Emperor Cave, there was a flash of purple light at a pavilion near the center of the second floor. Wang Lin’s figure walked out from the light.</span></p>

I didn’t think it would have this kind of power. If I can get all five iron swords for the sword sheaths and use them…”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Wang Lin took a deep breath and shook his head. If he were to use them at the same time, he would likely be drained dry in an instant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He put the iron sword back into the sword sheath and put it back inside his bag. Wang Lin took out some pills and devoured them. Without waiting for them to digest, he clenched his teeth and moved forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had put up a front and used his momentum form seriously injuring Master Void to shock the man in black and the beautiful woman. Otherwise, if both of them attacked, Wang Lin would have without a doubt died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, he had no time to sit down and recover. He had to use his advantage of knowing the layout of the cave to create distance between him and them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After taking a deep breath, Wang Lin moved through the various restrictions and soon arrived at one of the restriction eyes marked on the map. After taking a look, Wang Lin immediately confirmed his speculation that someone else had come here first and broke the restriction eyes. It was unknown what floor they had already reached.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He dragged his weary body toward the palace at the center surrounded by the black fog. The first six floors of the Celestial Emperor Cave were mostly structured the same. With Wang Lin’s familiarity, although he was slower than usual, he still quickly arrived at the center of the second floor where the entrance to the third floor was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the man in black, the beautiful woman, and the heavily injured Master Void also arrived at the second floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The seriously injured Master Void was no longer as arrogant as he was in the first floor. He moved forward slowly, and this gave Wang Lin time in the palace in the second floor. There were no statues here, only nine stone candlesticks. Wang Lin calmed his anxious heart, and after carefully observing for a long time, he frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, his gaze suddenly landed on the candlesticks on the table, and he noticed faint traces of movement. There were deep and shallow traces, so they were moved more than once. It was obviously made to confuse people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes lit up, and he squatted down and carefully observed them. His eyes gradually lit up. He felt a sliver of sword energy from these candles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sword energy was very ordinary, so even if others felt it, they would think it was just residue from someone trying to break the candlesticks by force. However. to Wang Lin. the meaning was significant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Zhou Yi’s sword energy… If he left the sword energy here, that means he is already at the third floor, so why did he leave it here… Could it be…”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Wang Lin’s eyes narrowed. He had recovered some origin energy on the way here. Now he waved his hand and the nine candlesticks immediately lit up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment the candles lit up, the light from the flames surrounded Wang Lin, and he disappeared to the third floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moving the candlesticks was only to confuse others. Even the trace of being moved was just to distract people from the fact that the candlesticks needed to be lit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time slowly passed, and in the blink of an eye, Wang Lin had spent two months in the Celestial Emperor Cave. In these two months, he only had a short period of time to heal. The rest of the time was spent traveling through each floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The deeper he went, the stronger the restrictions became. Even with Wang Lin’s restriction knowledge and the map’s instructions, it took some time to get past them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What wasted the most time were the palaces at the center of each floor. They were like balls of mysteries that required a lot of effort to find the entrance to the next floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If that was it, it wouldn’t be such a big deal, but after the fourth floor, the map showed many storage spaces as well. Wang Lin was naturally unwilling to let them go, so he checked them out. Most of them had already been opened by others, but there were still a few places not found. Wang Lin moved everything he had found into his bag. Just thinking about his harvest in these two months made Wang Lin excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even he was shocked greatly by the stuff inside the storage spaces. When it came to things such as celestial jades, Wang Lin had enough to supply a sect for 1,000 years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were many other things as well. From Wang Lin’s point of view, these storage spaces were storage points set up by Celestial Emperor Qing Lin. There was obviously a purpose for all of them.</span></p>

What was even more exciting was that according to the jade, there were two transfer arrays to storage spaces on the sixth floor.</span></p>

At this moment, those pills and elixirs were more important than any treasure.</span></p>

His physical injuries were no longer an issue due to his strong recovery from his ancient god body. The problem was his loss of origin energy and how his origin soul had weakened from using the iron sword. If he had no pills, it would be difficult to recover in a short period of time. Wang Lin was almost out of pills, and adding on the dangers that were everywhere, Wang Lin absolutely had to obtain that storage space full of pills.</span></p>

Wang Lin walked out from the light. The place he appeared in was surrounded by pavilions, as if it was its own little garden. There were mountains sounding area and a river flowing not far away. The sound of the flowing river echoed and was very soothing.</span></p>

After quickly matching his location with the map, he immediately knew his current location.</span></p>

This was the first time he detected someone!</span></p>
