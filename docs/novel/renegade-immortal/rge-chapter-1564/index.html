He took a deep breath and popping sounds echoed inside his body. A red mist came out of his pores and formed blood-colored cloth over his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked at Wang Lin and clasped his hands.</span></p>

His eyes shined with wisdom.</span></p>

You will not die, this old man will refine you into a blood puppet and you will become a great help for my Inner Realm!” After he spoke, Master Hong Shan turned into a red shadow and charged ahead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man in black was pale. Although he was a third step cultivator, he was still a cultivator. He was powerless to fight against four of them. As Master Hong Shan closed in, the old man in black quickly retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Master Long Pan calmly raised his right hand behind the old man in black and the Mountain and River Painting blocked the old man’s path.</span></p>

The five cracks on the old man’s face began to tear open once more! Dark Moon Clear Sky was a spell that engraved itself on the enemy and could continuously erupt with terrifying power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s expression was calm, and the moment the other three attacked, his eyes shined. Golden light gathered in his finger tip and he pointed at the old man in black.</span></p>

The Seven-Colored Realm collapsed and the Heaven Punishment Palace Lord Qin Jiuyan was captured and taken away by Master Hong Shan.</span></p>

He left with his disciple, Master Zhong Xuan, to silently wait for the next battle against the Outer Realm.</span></p>

Then he led the Inner Realm cultivators to carry out the final counter attack.</span></p>

The most important thing right now was to complete his three daos before the rejection force inside his body exploded. He had to break open the void gate and complete his dao!</span></p>

His green robe fluttered among the stars with a sense of sadness and loneliness. He went to find his daughter. Perhaps he would find her, perhaps he would never find her in his entire life.</span></p>

There was no need to speak too much between them. The things they experienced together was something Qing Shui wouldn’t forget.</span></p>

The retake of Summoned River gave the remaining Inner Realm cultivators hope!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were no Seven-Colored Realms left in the Inner Realm. After decades of war, the remaining cultivators were all seasoned warriors. They had to fight because once they failed, the only remaining path would be death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Master Hong Shan spreading the news that the Lord of the Sealed Realm had returned was the most impactful! This caused the Inner Realm cultivators to raise their heads, and the flame of battle in their hearts became even more intense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Brilliant Void Realm, there was a place near the border between the Cloud Sea and Allheaven. This place quickly developed into a large trading area.</span></p>

Lots of cultivators from all four systems gathered on these planets to trade for the resources they needed.</span></p>

As the cultivators came and went, it was extremely lively.</span></p>

The fragrance they gave off made the single male cultivators in the other three systems do their best to find themselves dao partners that would accompany them for the rest of their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With female cultivators from the Summoned River present, the city became even more lively.</span></p>

The inn was often full.</span></p>

They would learn from each other, and perhaps simple acquaintances would have a chance to meet again on the battlefield in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, there were several cultivators sitting at the table in the northern end of the inn. One was a middle-aged scholar that was smiling and talking to his friends.</span></p>

However, their ages were somewhat different. The woman in a pink robe that was younger became curious.</span></p>

There were traces of time on her face, and she was calmly sitting there and hadn’t said a word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beside the middle-aged scholar was a old man. He smiled and interjected, “Lady Xu, don’t believe Fellow Cultivator Zhou’s words. Everytime this guy meets female cultivators from the Summoned River like you, he says the same thing. I have almost grown calluses in my ears from listening to him.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It was on planet Suzaku. The Lord of Sealed Realm at that time could not match his cultivation today. I remember back then, he was still a little Core Formation cultivator. I didn’t think he would become the Lord of the Sealed Realm one day!” The middle-aged scholar smiled and ignored the old man’s words. His face was filled with emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman blinked and revealed a hint of interest.

They all looked toward the woman in purple with shock and envy. There was also a faint look of respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the nearby cultivators became silent when they heard this.

He clasped his hands at the woman in purple and said, “I, Zhou Dongde, greet Fellow Cultivator from planet Suzaku. What I said before was false, I hope Fellow Cultivator doesn’t mind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only him, but even the old man and the large amount of surrounding cultivators all clasped their hands to greet her.</span></p>

The fame of the Lord of the Sealed Realm was not a personal glory but was obtained through shocking events that happened in the war.
