 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1716 - Scheme Again All-Seer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Outside the spatial crack in the Cloud Sea, there were still a large amount of fierce beasts gathered around it. They still couldn’t forget the restriction storm that had driven them out from the spatial crack a few months ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the spatial crack was their home, so they had been hanging around it because they were unwilling to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As time passed, these fierce beasts became irritated, but none of them dared to enter, so they could only let out low roars. On this day, a white figure slowly came out of the spatial crack, and his appearance immediately caused the beasts to retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They could clearly feel a terrifying aura coming from Wang Lin’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wang Lin walked out from the spatial crack, his gaze swept by the large amount of fierce beasts. But he didn’t pause; he took a step forward and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t until after Wang Lin had been gone for a long time that the surrounding beasts slowly closed in on the spatial rift. A few carefully went inside, and after they found no danger, a large amount of them returned back into the spatial crack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin walked through the stars as he pierced through the void. He would sometimes appear but disappear instantly. Soon, Wang Lin arrived at the edge of the Cloud Sea. This was where the new Celestial Realm was located.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The floating continent with the silver river surrounding it gave off a soft glow that lit up the surrounding area. Fluctuations of restrictions echoed as they protected the Celestial Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at this place, Wang Lin’s expression was no longer cold. This was a place he had created and the only other place he considered home in this cave world beside planet Suzaku.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many people he knew here, so he could not give up on this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The silver river from the Summoned River contains a lot of restrictions, but it is not powerful enough…”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Before, Wang Lin didn’t have the ability to make these restrictions stronger, but now he could.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin didn’t enter the Celestial Realm but stood outside, staring at the silver river. After looking at it for a while, the horizontal blood lines that had disappeared from his eyes reappeared and gave off a ghostly, red glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin raised his right hand and waved. The blood lines in his eyes silently appeared before him and flew toward the silver river.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, the blood lines in his eyes shined and the blood lines outside shined as if they were connected. They both flew toward the silver river.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After doing all of this, Wang Lin looked at the stars. The blurry lines of laws appeared before him. He moved his right hand and a large number of these lines gathered around the silver river.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This should allow the Celestial Realm to remain safe during the search for the third soul!”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wang Lin silently pondered for a moment and then walked toward the silver river.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment he entered the Celestial Realm, Master Hong Shan and company noticed him. They all awakened from their cultivation and flew into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Lin, Qing Shui, Situ Nan, Master South Cloud, and company all floated there, looking at the white figure in the distance, and smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even more people Wang Lin was familiar with noticed him. When they saw the white figure, they smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin looked at the familiar faces and heartwarming smile, and he also smiled. He saw Red Butterfly beside Qing Shui. It was obvious the father and daughter had gotten to know each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He saw Qing Shuang behind Qing Lin, and in the distance, there was a melancholy man. He silently looked at Qing Shuang. His expression was complicated and sad, but even more so, he was satisfied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was Zhou Yi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin also saw Zhou Ru. In his heart, although Zhou Ru was already an adult, she was still a child. The tiger still accompanied Zhou Ru.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His gaze swept by everyone and he gently smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve returned home.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These three words set off a burst of cheers in the Celestial Realm. The western part of the Celestial Realm was originally empty, but a clan from the Ancient Star System had settled here. This was the Blue Silk Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dao Master Blue Dream was sitting inside a hut he had built himself as he looked into the sky and revealed a smile. His daughter, Li Qianmei, was not beside him but instead had gone into closed door cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dao Master Blue Dream felt that Li Qianmei’s cultivation was lacking, so when he brought the people of the Blue Silk Clan here, he made her go into closed door cultivation to comprehend his essence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After simply conversing with many of his friends, Wang Lin left. Along with him were Situ Nan, Zhou Ru, Big Head, Thirteen, and others. They settled down in the mountains in the north.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During this period of time, Wang Lin had gone to see Blue Master Dao Dream. When he heard that Li Qianmei was in closed door cultivation, he let out a breath of relief for some unknown reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps it was because he didn’t know what he would say if he were to see Li Qianmei. Even he didn’t know whether the feeling behind him and Li Qianmei was just gratitude or love.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Gratitude is not love…” Li Qianmei’s words still echoed in Wang Lin’s ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The new Celestial Realm was like a paradise. It was far away from the dispute that was happening outside as people looked for the third soul. Due to Wang Lin’s return, the cultivators here became even more confident and continued their peaceful lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin lived on a mountain. There was a very simple house here. This place was Wang Lin’s home.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Ru would not leave; she accompanied Wang Lin like a daughter. She would occasionally look at Wang Lin with a gaze full of attachment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the grown-up Zhou Ru, aside from warmth, Wang Lin also felt pain. The pain was because he thought of Li Muwan and what had happened back on planet Suzaku.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He felt like he had wronged Wan Er. His pain was something only he knew, something only he could see. And 2,000 years was enough to hide everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was also Thirteen and Big Head. They were cultivating here. With Wang Lin’s occasional pointer, they gained a lot of enlightenment. Wang Lin returned Big Head’s soul blood and released the servant seal, giving Big Head his freedom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Big Head didn’t choose to leave, but sometimes he would look at the sky, depressed. Wang Lin knew Big Head was homesick, only his home was no longer there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The memories of his painful childhood had become precious to him, and he was unwilling to give them up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thirteen was a simple person; he didn’t think about much. He only wanted to cultivate so he could become his teacher’s strongest disciple. When his teacher needed him, he would give up everything, including his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Situ Nan, he would drink wine with Wang Lin all day and pat Wang Lin’s back. He looked very happy, and when they were drinking, it was as if he had forgotten all his worries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Occasionally, he would be drunk and look at Wang Lin while feeling melancholy. He wasn’t feeling melancholy about Wang Lin’s growth but the fact that he hadn’t been a king for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yi also came once. His melancholy expression became even more intense after he came to drink with Wang Lin. He never said a word and just began drinking with Wang Lin. He looked at Wang Lin profoundly and revealed the first smile before he left with a nod.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His back was bleak. He was still trying to make Qing Shuang recognize his existence or remember him. No matter the outcome, he had chosen to wait even if it meant waiting for a lifetime.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, Wang Lin had spent one month in the new Celestial Realm. During this time, he took out the celestial pavilion he had obtained in the Thunder Celestial Realm. He took out all the celestial spells inside and gave them to Qing Lin and company.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They would arrange for these celestial spells to be passed down, which would increase the overall strength of the Celestial Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, outside the Celestial Realm, a giant mess was slowly unfolding. The four celestial generals had used a rather special method to look for the third soul. They had combined their power, and with the help of the celestial bloodline of many celestials, they formed a formation to look for the third soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, there were some unknown special methods; this was something even Wang Lin didn’t know about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aside from the ancient celestials led by the four generals, Old Ghost Zhan didn’t move at all. His divine sense had been merely locked onto the four generals, watching them search.</span></p>
