 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1775 - Ancient Tomb Inheritance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin felt no joy in taking the Sovereign’s soul. Instead, he felt somewhat sad. Wang Lin had heard the Sovereign’s name when he was only at the second step and then, once he had gone to the Ancient Star System, they had encountered each other many times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This person could be considered the leader of a generation, but his life had been sad. He was but a slave to the madman. Then, after the madman had gone missing, he had been forced to worship the Seven-Colored Daoist as his teacher and listen to the Seven-Colored Daoist’s commands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now he had half his soul taken by Wang Lin and had fallen into such a state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of this was very similar to how the Sovereign had gathered the third step cultivators of the Outer Realm to attack the Lord of the Sealed Realm until the Lord of the Sealed Realm was only a sliver of a soul inside the Heaven Defying Bead. It was like a reincarnation cycle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The killer had been killed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin let out a sigh and clasped his hands at Dao Master Blue Dream and company.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Many thanks for this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dao Master Blue Dream’s gaze swept past the dwarf and looked at Wang Lin. He slowly said, “I can’t help you much, but no matter what happens, I’ll do my best. This is my promise to you!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His tone on the last two words was quite heavy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tu Si or Tuo Sen returned to the size of a normal person and calmly said, “You’ve returned my inheritance to me and allowed my Flowing Ink Transformation Divine Technique to be complete. I’ll help you to return the favor.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin could not tell if the person was Tuo Sen or Tu Si, but he vaguely understood what had happened to this person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Yun Yifeng, he smiled bitterly and didn’t respond to Wang Lin’s thanks. He had lost so he must due to listening to Wang Lin’s orders. He still had courage, so even though there was no more oath blood, he wouldn’t take back his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin looked at the third concubine, Tang Shan, and softly said, “I helped you leave this place and you helped me fight the Sovereign, so your debt is cleared. You don’t have to take this matter to heart anymore in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Shan silently pondered for a while and nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distance, the mountain the Yi Si Puppet came from collapsed and revealed a hole. Slivers of Ancient Dao aura spread out. This was the entrance to the last layer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once Wang Lin entered, he could reach the place where Ye Mo’s heart was located.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, just at this moment, ripples echoed in the sky. In the distance, several rays of light closed in and a powerful divine sense spread out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This change attracted Wang Lin’s attention. He looked up at the sky and his expression slowly became gloomy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Ghost Zhan had caught up!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can go down. This old man has promised to help you, so I’ll keep doing so!” Dao Master Blue Dream let out a sigh and blue light spread across his body. He looked at the sky with battle intent in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tuo Sen silently pondered and looked at Wang Lin. He didn’t speak, but popping sounds echoed inside his body. He looked up and clenched his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uncle Ma will act too and help you delay long enough.” Yun Yifeng revealed a bitter smile as he took out a large handful of pills to devour. He waved his right hand and his body gave off the light of the five elements. A suit of armor slowly began to appear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Shan waved her right hand without speaking. Seven golden doors appeared around everyone here. She took a deep breath and looked up at the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin opened his mouth, but he didn’t know what to say. He couldn’t control the Yi Si Puppet unless he was here, and it had to follow him. Therefore, if he wasn’t here. the Yi Si Puppet would have no effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin bowed deeply at everyone. He knew that this was not the time for words. He had to obtain the last of Ye Mo’s inheritance aside from the left eye. Then leave this fourth flower and find the real door in the fifth flower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the condition was that it had to be done before Old Ghost Zhan caught up, but he was already closing in...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin took a deep breath and no longer hesitated. He charged toward the collapsed mountain. After he disappeared, the sky rumbled and Old Ghost Zhan’s figure appeared in the air!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seven-colored light surrounded his body. This was because he had devoured the Seven-Colored Daoist. Although the two souls hadn’t fused, the benefits to him were great. This allowed him to use even more of his cultivation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was also different from the Seven-Colored Daoist. He was the Seven-Colored Celestial Sovereign’s soul and Old Ghost Zhan. Old Ghost Zhan already had a high cultivation level, &nbsp;then he obtained the Seven-Colored Celestial Sovereign’s dao. Now that he had devoured the Seven-Colored Daoist, his cultivation level was infinitely close to that of the Seven-Colored Celestial Sovereign of the past!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re all ants, scram for this old man!” Old Ghost Zhan’s voice rumbled and spread through the layer. The earth collapsed and the sky was torn open.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the last layer of the Ancient Tomb, Wang Lin appeared. The moment he appeared, he vaguely heard the sound of a heart beating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sound entered his mind but didn’t cause his heart to beat with it. Instead, it caused his heart to become chaotic, as if there were two different beats echoing in his ears. Wang Lin’s eyes lit up as he looked around. This last layer had no earth or sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were only blood vessel-like things that were thousands of feet thick. Every time he heard that heartbeat, these blood vessels would all move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Wang Lin’s divine sense, he clearly saw a giant heart where all the blood vessels connected to. Every time the heart beat, Wang Lin felt a stab of pain in his chest. It was like his heart was going to collapse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything here was somewhat different from what he had seen when he first obtained the inheritance, but the general idea was the same. After all, back then, he had only caught a vague glimpse of this place, and this was the first time he had entered this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin knew time was of the essence. He didn’t know how long Blue Dream and company above could delay Old Ghost Zhan. Every breath he delayed could mean Old Ghost Zhan catching up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he couldn’t carefully observe behind him; he had to slowly move forward. He travelled at his fastest speed as he moved between the blood vessels.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, there were no beasts here. Wang Lin didn’t encounter any obstacle as he traversed endless distances. However, the heart seemed to be able to detect Wang Lin arriving, and it was beating even faster. The beats from the heart were off sync with Wang Lin’s own heartbeat. This caused Wang Lin’s face to turn pale and created an unbearable pain in his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The closer he got to the heart, the stronger the feeling became. In the end, the heartbeats were like roaring thunder. The sound was like a needle was drilling into Wang Lin’s heart. Words could not describe the pain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this strange change had no effect on the Yi Si Puppet following Wang Lin. It still had its long tongue out, and its gaze became even more intense. There was a sense of irritation coming from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although his pain was intense, Wang Lin didn’t stop at all; he moved like the wind. The pain almost reached the point of driving him insane when he arrived at the center of this layer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He spotted the giant heart and saw the countless blood vessels connected to it, extending in all directions. The blood vessels moved along with the heartbeats.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon arriving here, Wang Lin’s heartbeat became even more desynced with the giant heart. He coughed out a mouthful of blood. This was a sign that his heart was going to explode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inside Wang Lin’s body, all the blood vessels were swollen and his blood flow was sometimes fast and sometimes slow. Along with this erratic heartbeat, these were all signs that his heart was going to explode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was not a spell, ability, or dao spell; it was just that this heartbeat was extremely lethal. Even Wang Lin’s Ancient Dao body could not resist it unless he didn’t have a heart!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin’s face was deathly pale and his right hand clenched his chest. He could feel his heart’s erratic heartbeats, and the vibrations even caused his hand to tremble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin staggered as he clenched his teeth and let out a roar. He coughed out blood and arrived next to the hurge heart. His body moved with the beating heart.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, just as his divine sense spread out, the heart began to beat even faster and more violently. It didn’t want to be in sync with Wang Lin at all, and it produced a powerful rejection force.</span></p>
