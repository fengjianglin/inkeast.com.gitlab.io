However, in the 100 years I was there, I only carefully moved around the other edge. I didn’t dare to move to the inner region, so I didn’t know what’s there.</span></p>

With my cultivation level, I would’ve without a doubt died, so I could only retreat and enter into the depths of that place.</span></p>

It wasn’t until a few years later that I had the guts to move. I wanted to leave and return to the outer edge. I had a feeling that the inner part wasn’t somewhere I could go and I would die!</span></p>

When I woke up, I was beside a large, withered forest.</span></p>

Even my divine sense couldn’t cover the area. All the trees had withered and died, there was not a single leaf.</span></p>

This was the first leaf I had seen there! The leaf was later taken by me… I also put the tree that hadn’t completely withered into my bag of holding.</span></p>

It felt like hundreds and thousands of years had passed. The more I walked forward, the more serious the withering was. At the end, the trees would turn to ashes the moment I touched them… One day, I arrived at the center of the forest. I believe that’s where the center should be. I saw a statue, and at the moment, I had a feeling that it was due to this statue that this boundless forest was withering.</span></p>

The moment I picked it up, a vortex appeared. It was the same vortex that had brought me there. I was ecstatic and rushed into the vortex.</span></p>

Later, I learned that I had come to the Outer Realm…” After Greed finished speaking, he looked at Wang Lin.</span></p>

Halfway through his story, he found that his body was no longer frozen. The Stop spell seemed to have expired.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, seeing that Wang Lin was pondering, Greed was extremely nervous and slowly retreated before suddenly speeding up. Just as he was about to escape, Wang Lin raised his right hand and casually reached out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an instant, Greed let out a miserable scream as he was caught by an invisible hand and was pulled back toward Wang Lin. Wang Lin’s palm nearly touched Greed’s forehead and a mysterious suction force came from his palm and clearly entered Greed’s head.</span></p>

His divine sense rushed into Greed’s origin soul and swept Greed’s memory!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, along with Wang Lin’s powerful divine sense, thunder rumbled and gathered in his right hand. The thunder went into Greed’s origin soul and cleansed his origin soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Greed’s body trembled, and in a moment, sweat covered his whole body. This only took an instant, then Wang Lin waved his right hand, throwing Greed far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I won’t take your treasures for nothing. You can go!”</span></p>

His speed increased greatly and he flew away. In the blink of an eye, not a trace of him remained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Greed’s eyes were filled with lingering fear from escaping death and feeling wronged.</span></p>

I swear I’ll never let it happen a third time!! Most of my treasure have been taken, so staying in the Fallen Land is too dangerous. I must quickly return to my cave to take what’s left and leave!”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Greed felt wronged, and after teleporting countless times to make sure Wang Lin wasn’t following him, he disappeared.</span></p>

The moment he reappeared, he charged at a mountain and waved his hand when he arrived at the outer edge. The mountain rumbled and a thin crack opened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Greed didn’t hesitate to enter, but the moment he entered, his body trembled. A foul smell came out from the crack and rushed into his face. It was so bad that he almost passed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why does it stink so much…”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Greed cursed, and his body suddenly trembled. He was frozen for a moment before he pinched his nose. After smelling carefully again, disbelief filled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The stench from my body is gone!! Even my sense of smell has been restored. I couldn’t smell the stench of this cave before!!”</span></p>

During these hundreds of years, he had spent a lot of effort to resolve the stench from his body. After meeting Wang Lin and losing the chance to obtain the ancient scorpion corpse, he despaired. However, now the stench had unexpectedly disappeared on its own!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I won’t take your treasures for nothing, you can go...” Greed remembered Wang Lin’s words before he left, and he revealed a complicated expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After letting Greed go, Wang Lin had turned around and returned to the Dark Scorpion Clan. Greed had come out of the Inner Realm before him and had collected all these treasures for him. After obtaining all of Greed’s hard-earned treasures, and adding the joy of meeting someone from home, how could Wang Lin be willing to kill him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That Greed is my lucky star. I can’t kill him, I must let him go. I’m looking forward to our third meeting. He will probably have more treasures to give me!”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Wang Lin smiled as he appeared above the Dark Scorpion Clan’s planet.</span></p>

Zhong Big Red had become spirited and picked a few cultivators with high cultivation levels to heal him. He laid there and continued to let out cold snorts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every time he let out a cold snort, the surrounding cultivators would tremble.</span></p>

They weren’t afraid of Zhong Big Red, but of the master behind him! The expression of their patriarch after seeing the jade token made them realize that they had provoked someone they shouldn’t and that a calamity was coming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dark Scorpion Clan members that were dispersed were respectfully escorted back one by one. Pills were taken out to help them recover. Even the old man named Zhang was brought back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were two female Cloud Escape cultivators rubbing Zhong Big Red’s shoulders. He felt very comfortable and arrogantly said, “I already told you all long ago! This old man clearly told all of you, but you all won’t believe me! What’s the use of keeping your eyes!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not this old man looking down upon you, but with your cultivation levels, not to mention my master, even I don’t consider you all a threat. Just one slap is enough to crush you all like ants!” Zhong Big Red raised his chin and scolded them with disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surrounding Cloud Escape cultivators all nodded in agreement. Even those that were haughty didn’t dare to refute when their entire clan was facing destruction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Cloud Escape Patriarch and elders respectfully stood beside Zhong Big Red. They all had flattering smiles and continued to nod.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lord, please forgive us. I really didn’t know Lord’s identity. I hope Lord will say good things about us, and afterward, I’ll send you a generous gift.” The Cloud Escape Patriarch felt bitterness in his heart. His cultivation level was clearly much higher. He could kill Zhong Big Red with one finger, but now he had to carefully serve this person.</span></p>

He let out a snort and proudly said, “Since you realize your mistake, I should give you a chance to repent, but…”&nbsp;</span></p>

The moment he walked out, Zhong Big Red’s expression changed and he suddenly stood up.

Master, Big Red hasn’t seen you in such a long time that I felt lost. Even when I cultivate, I can’t calm down unless I recite Master’s name 100 times.
