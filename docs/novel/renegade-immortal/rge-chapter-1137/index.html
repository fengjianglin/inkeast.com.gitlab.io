Due to the fact that not many cultivators came here, it was quite peaceful. At this moment, it was winter on this abandoned planet, and snowflakes fell from the sky. In some villages, the snow attracted the playful children.</span></p>

The origin of this festival had long since disappeared in the river of time and was forgotten by a majority of the people. However, this custom was unknowingly passed down until it became a habit.</span></p>

However, the footprints weren’t very deep and were soon covered up by the snow, all traces swept away.</span></p>

The snow eventually fell once more, and there was no distinction between the new and old snow.</span></p>

The snow was very deep, and the youth produced slight crunching sounds as he walked. However, the wind was very loud, and this crunching sound was covered by the wind.</span></p>

He silently faced the wind and snow. His heart was filled with melancholy and the bitterness of having to leave as he slowly walked forward in the snow.</span></p>

The snowflakes fell before him and blanketed the ground.</span></p>

Wang Lin let out a deep breath and turned to white mist that gradually disappeared. He gently took a step and then the surroundings shook. At this moment, a silent storm picked up all the snow within the area and blew it into the sky. The snow was blown far away by the wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the snow was gone, a giant formation appeared in this 10,000 feet area. This formation was very complex and had pieces of stone positioned within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After silently pondering a bit, Wang Lin let out a sigh and walked into the center of the formation. Then his right hand reached at the void and a crack to this storage space opened. With a thought, the stones he had gathered on the way here all flew out one by one. They hovered in the air, and there were no less than 100.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Wang Lin waved his right hand, these stones all scattered and landed in different positions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an instant, the formation lit up and slowly showed signs of activating. As the formation activated, the snow that was falling didn’t get close; it was all pushed away by the formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin sat on the ground and silently pondered. His right hand reached out and grabbed an origin soul from his storage space. This origin soul’s eyes were closed; it was unconscious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Holding the origin soul, Wang Lin’s left hand formed a seal and pointed at the origin soul multiple time. The origin soul trembled with every point and then was finally thrown into the air by Wang Lin. The origin soul began to stretch and twist until it formed a vortex.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This vortex whistled and miserable screams came from inside it. At this moment, the formation on the ground activated and a roar replaced the wind. The formation lit up, but the light didn’t fly into the sky. Instead, it went into the vortex.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As popping sounds echoed, the vortex seemed to be constantly open. As Wang Lin sat there, his hands formed a seal and he calmly said, “Use the soul as the guide!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood light immediately came from the vortex. As Wang Lin’s words echoed, the light entered the vortex. It seemed like all the power from the formation was sucked out and it turned into dust. Even the stones became ashes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vortex in the sky stopped rotating and began flashing. It was completely dark inside, as if it was a passage.</span></p>

He looked back at the ground. Although this was an unfamiliar planet, it was still the Alliance Star System. This place contained the aura of his home, his family, his friends, and his story.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know when I can return… Perhaps I’ll never be able to return… Fortunately, I have the snow and wind to send me off… That’s enough!”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Wang Lin revealed a bitter gaze as he let out a laugh. He walked into the depths of the vortex and the vortex gradually disappeared without a trace.</span></p>

The laughter was slowly drowned out by the snow.</span></p>

Just like Wang Lin’s footprints, it all disappeared...</span></p>

The Rain Celestial Realm had the Alliance, and they only had one rank 9 cultivation country. The Thunder Celestial Realm had Allheaven, which had families with inheritances from ancient times. The two different types of environments caused the cultivation methods and directions of each system’s cultivators to be very different. Even though they were all cultivators, the difference was huge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to the Alliance’s strict rules, Allheaven had more freedom. However, all that freedom could be given up for the honor of the family!</span></p>

It could be said that among the four star systems, the Cloud Sea Star System was the biggest. At a glance, the space wasn’t dark, but covered by a thin layer of fog. This fog existed almost everywhere in the Cloud Sea, and divine sense would be hindered by it to a certain degree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to the fog that had existed for almost an eternity, the Cloud Sea Star System didn’t look like a star system, but more like a cloud sea. This was the origin of its name.</span></p>

They would be forever trapped inside this fog if they didn’t have one.</span></p>

This fog that filled the Cloud Sea seemed to have existed since before the Ancient Celestial Realm disappeared...</span></p>

The Cloud Sea made it difficult for cultivators to know the exact direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fog also didn’t allow the Cloud Sea Star System to be divided like that, and instead it was based on the concentration of fog. From inside to out, there were a total of nine ranks!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These nine ranks were actually nine irregular-shaped rings.

From afar, the continent would fade in and out of existence. At the center of the continent, there was a towering black tower that exuded a soft light that enveloped the continent. This made it so the fog couldn’t get into the continent and always pushed it away. This made the area around the continent clear.</span></p>
