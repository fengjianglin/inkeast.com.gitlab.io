 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin looked at the youth with an indifferent gaze, and the fire around became more intense. The first time he met the youth was inside the void in the battle against the Moongazer Serpent. He had come from the Outer Realm and formed a vortex in an attempt to take the Moongazer Serpent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This person was extremely arrogant and proudly said he that he was the heavenly dao before the people of the Sealed Realm like Wang Lin. Wang Lin was shocked at the time, but the more he learned about the past, the colder his gaze toward the youth became.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The slave clan of the ancient gods. The one who was sheltered by the ancient gods in primordial times, the Moon-Devouring Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Wang Lin let out a cold snort, his right hand formed a fist and he threw a punch. The power of an ancient god rushed through the void and a thunderous rumble echoed as if it could destroy the world. It quickly closed in on the youth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth’s face was pale. He knew that he could not escape. If he wanted to live, he had to fight! However, his heart felt bitter. Even if he fought, what were the chances of him surviving… He didn’t know.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it he was outside and he was fighting with one of his own clan members, he could at least surrender. However, this person was a Sealed Realm cultivator and also an ancient god, a royal ancient god. From the records from his family, his clan had betrayed the ancient gods. Even if he surrendered, he couldn’t escape the fate of death and having his soul searched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What exactly is this damn place? Why would Sealed Realm cultivators appear here?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth’s expression became even more ferocious and he let out a roar. His hands formed a seal and his body became even more crystal-like, as if he was covered in moonlight. As Wang Lin’s fist closed in, he began to rotate and formed a vortex. Within the vortex, a giant, crescent moon appeared!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment Wang Lin’s fist landed, there was a thunderous rumble. The crescent moon trembled violently but didn’t collapse. However, blood came out from the corner of the youth’s mooth. He clench his teeth and surged all the power in his body. He then pushed forward and shouted, “Rebound Moon Force!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an instant, the light from the crescent moon became blinding and the image of an ancient god punch shot out at Wang Lin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s expression was unchanged as he sneered and lifted his right hand for another punch. At the same time, he took a step and closed in at an unimaginable speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The punch landed with the punch formed by the crescent moon and a roar echoed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How can the spell of a slave clan fight against an ancient god?” Wang Lin rushed forward and his right fist continued to throw punches at the vortex. The rumbling continued and the youth inside the vortex continued to retreat. Every step he took back caused his body to tremble violently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Wang Lin was like a battle celestial. He was filled with endless battle intent as he closed in step by step!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of them pushed forward and one retreated, and each punch created a Rebound Moon Force. At this instant, all sounds were suppressed by these rumbles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Break for me!” Wang Lin’s voice was calm, but it contained an invisible pressure. At this moment, his body rotated and his right foot kicked the vortex.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the popping sounds echoed, the vortex collapsed. The crescent moon inside fragmented and exploded!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A bloody shadow was pushed out. It was the youth covered in blood. He was thrown into the distance in an arc. Wang Lin walked toward the youth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth’s eyes were blurry, but he struggled to chant a very complex spell. At the same time, his hands formed a seal and he pointed to between his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Forbidden Moon Spell, God’s Wrath!” This youth knew that his Moon-Devouring Clan had an ancient forbidden spell. He was not supposed to use this spell until it was the last resort, because it was humiliating for his Moon-Devouring Clan to use it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he roared, he knelt down on the ground. Wang Lin closed in. The youth’s hand formed a strange seal and he began worshiping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lend the power of the gods’ souls to the members of my Moon-Devouring Clan!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment his voice echoed, a powerful ancient god power appeared around the youth. The space behind him twisted and the shadow of an ancient god several thousand feet tall appeared!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ancient god was a blur and his eyes were closed. Only his seven ancient god stars gave off a dazzling glow!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth’s heart felt humiliation, but at this moment of crisis, he couldn’t care for too much as his hoarse voice echoed across the void. “I request the ancient god soul to give this slave the power of the moon to destroy all my enemies!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ancient god shadow that appeared behind him suddenly opened his eyes and revealed an ancient and tyrannical gaze. He slowly lifted his right hand, then it descended toward Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth’s eyes were vicious as he thought in his heart,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you’re both ancient gods, then I’ll let you ancient gods kill each other!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s eyes were filled with sorrow as he looked at the shadow of the ancient god and the punch that was closing in. He let out a sigh and the ancient god stars between his eyebrows appeared. They began to rotate and ancient god aura filled his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ancient god language came from Wang Lin’s mouth and spread out like ripples. “The clan you protect has betrayed my ancient god clan. As a royal ancient god, I order you all to scatter!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The shadow of the ancient god paused. His eyes became filled with confusion and then liberation as he gradually disappeared… It had been a long time since a royal ancient god had appeared among the ancient gods. The ancient god soul that protected the Moon-Devouring Clan was just a sliver of will… Back then, it was a royal ancient god that decided to protect the slave Moon-Devouring Clan, and the entire ancient god clan carried it out without hesitation for a long time. Even as time passed and they died, the will that existed in the world continued to shelter them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This would go on until another royal ancient god appeared to give the order to stop. That was the only way for this ancient covenant to be resolved!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Today, at this moment, Wang Lin’s words were the will the royal ancient gods!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth was completely startled. With his experience, how could he know this big secret? He didn’t know, and that’s why he was stupid enough to borrow the power of the ancient gods before a royal ancient god like Wang Lin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“From now on, the ancient gods will no longer shelter the Moon-Devouring Clan, they will destroy the Moon-Devouring Clan!” These were the last words the youth heard. Wang Lin walked forward and a kick swept forward. A rumble echoed through the youth’s body as all his bones collapsed, but his flesh didn’t disintegrate. Instead, he was swept toward the skeleton under the stone tablet by Wang Lin’s kick. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a bang, his body overlapped with the skeleton and his shoulder was pierced by the two seven-colored nails! A burst of earth-shattering cries came from the youth as his body was affixed by the two seven-colored nails. The pain of having your dao sucked away and your soul constantly crushed was not something an ordinary person could endure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin didn’t immediately kill him but made him suffer the pain Zhan Xingye had gone through. To wait for death after endless torture!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth’s body trembled under the stone tablet. He struggled to leave but couldn’t. Not even his origin soul could escape, as it was sealed inside his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin slowly came closer and pressed his right hand on the youth’s head. His divine sense rushed in and searched his soul by force. After obtaining the memories, the youth was about to pass out. However, the pain was so intense that he was unable to pass out. He couldn’t kill himself and could only endure the endless torture until he slowly died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin withdrew his right hand and let out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the fire on the Vermillion Bird reached a new height.
