It was Wang Lin! Wang Lin was the sun, and bursts of golden light came from his body!</span></p>

He then calmly said one thing.</span></p>

A force that could tear the night surged out without reservation. The endless sunlight swept forward like crazy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The law of origin moved with it and flooded the world!</span></p>

The endless sunlight and intense heat would destroy everything before it as if it was the dark night. There were no exceptions!</span></p>

His arms turned into a mist of blood and dissipated, followed by his legs and a large part of this body. In just a moment, the purple-robed All-Seer collapsed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he collapsed, countless shadows came out of his body. Those shadows all hissed and pounced at Wang Lin inside the sun. However, they were like snowflakes under the sun; they all melted without a trace!</span></p>

Not even the sun could penetrate the palm, and it came reaching for Wang Lin inside the sun. Wang Lin was still calm, and he sneered even though the palm grabbed a hold of the sun that surrounded his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the moment the palm grabbed the sun, a miserable scream came from the palm. The Yang fire that could burn anything swept across the palm, causing it to tremble, and the palm immediately transformed back into the yellow-robed All-Seer!</span></p>

It immediately stabbed into the blazing sun.</span></p>

The grey-robed All-Seer let out a roar and his right eye suddenly collapsed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment his right eye collapsed, the blood sword’s power increased several fold. The flames wrapped around it were all force back, and even the sunlight around it was shattered. The impact from the blood sword immediately broke through a majority of the sun and was only 10 feet away from Wang Lin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The grey-robed All-Seer let out another roar and then his left eye shattered as well. The blood sword became even more powerful and was able to pierce through the sun. It headed straight for Wang Lin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the grey-robed All-Seer’s desperate attack, the night that was torn apart seemed to unexpectedly condense once more. It seemed like it wanted to devour the sun.</span></p>

However, when it was halfway through his chest, Wang Lin caught the sword with his right hand. He was force back several steps and he coughed out a mouthful of blood. Then his head jerked up and he revealed a ferocious expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old thing, you almost killed me by making me cultivate the Celestial Slaughter Art. Today, die for me!!” As Wang Lin roared, the sun around his body unexpectedly exploded and quickly spread out with him as the center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the self-destruction of the sun, and the power contained within was unimaginable. It was as if the sky was cracked open and pushed back!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sea began to rage and the ground collapsed. The destructive force in the world reached a terrifying degree when the sun exploded.</span></p>

He only had time to form a seal and place his hand before him. He huddled together like a baby before he was swept by this insane power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble, rumble, rumble!</span></p>

At this moment, the sky and earth disappeared; the only thing that remained was the chaos from the collapse of the blazing sun!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, in just a moment, the world disappeared. The sea disappeared, the sun disappeared, and even the shattered sky disappeared. Everything disappeared without a trace, and what appeared before them was the Demon Spirit Land!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if everything that had just happened was just a dream. The sky was still red and filled with fire. The Vermillion Bird cry pierced through the flames and came closer and closer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the shocking gazes of everyone on the ground were enough to explain that everything that had just happened was real!</span></p>

In a flash, he returned back to the All-Seer’s original body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sundered Night had killed three people!</span></p>

Even the grey-robed was seriously injured, and only a sliver of his will remained!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Tianhou trembled. Before, he only dreaded Wang Lin. Even though that giant palm had brought him some fear, it didn’t leave him terrified like he was now. He would’ve never guessed that Wang Lin’s spell would become this powerful!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He… What is his cultivation level… This kind of spell is unheard of!”</span></p>

He was forced back several steps and his head jerked up to look at Wang Lin. Out of his three avatars, two were destroyed, and the grey-robed one was now only a sliver of will. This was a rare blow that he hadn’t suffered in countless years, and now he was also injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the injuries to his body and origin soul were insignificant compared to his calculations. He had been wrong multiple times with Wang Lin, and it was a serious blow to his confidence. No one noticed, but his body was trembling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was trembling, trembling because of that spell!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The All-Seer was immediately able to see that it was the law of origin, the origin of all laws. It was not something a cultivator could master, and its power was unimaginable!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He destroyed three of my avatars. Wang Lin, the biggest mistake I made was accepting you as my disciple and giving you the chance to leave planet Suzaku!!!”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The All-Seer was gnashing his teeth. He took deep breath before he suppressed the shock in his mind and forced himself to calm down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn’t the only one. Situ Nan, Big Head, Master Hollow Wind, and everyone else was also stunned. Master Hollow Wind was slightly less shocked as he had experienced Sundered Night before. His scalp felt numb and fear lingered in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Wang Wei and Hu Juan gasped. They looked each other and could see the shock and terror in each other’s eyes. Just now, they were also pulled into that illusion, only it was as if they were placed in a separate space. They could only watch but not help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They weren’t even the ones that were most shocked by this. It was Ancient Devil Ta Jia, who was charging into the sky with his blade, and the Flower Imperial Concubine!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Flower Imperial Concubine looked at Wang Lin with eyes filled with reminiscence and fear. What made her reminisce was how her husband said he would be saved by someone named “Wang.” What made her feel fear was the law of origin spell Wang Lin had displayed!</span></p>
