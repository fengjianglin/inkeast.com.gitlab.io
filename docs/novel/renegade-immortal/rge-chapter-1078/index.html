It was a boundless domain and was one of the forbidden lands of the Cultivation Alliance.</span></p>

There were trees piercing through the sky and grass as far as the eyes could see. At a glance, it looked extremely fake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This beautiful jungle that should exist on a planet just floated in boundless space. It also wasn’t just a jungle, but a vast forest that seemed to have always existed.</span></p>

It formed a green mist that shrouded the star domain and lingered for a long time...</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, a person slowly appeared in the distance. This person looked middle-aged, and there was a trace of reminiscence and melancholy in his eyes. He looked at the Azure Dragon Divine Sect and let out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He then raised his right hand and pointed forward. The shadow of a Vermillion Bird appeared and let out a cry that echoed across the world as it charged into the green mist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A moment later, several figures flew out from the green light. The three people that charged out all had white hair and there were traces of time on their faces. Behind them were six elders followingly closely after them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Greetings, Vermillion Bird Divine Emperor.” After the nine old men walked out from the green mist and saw the middle-aged man, they revealed looks of respect as they clasped their hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Vermillion Bird awakener has appeared and I need to borrow your Azure Dragon Divine Sect’s holy treasure. I also need you all to come with me!” The middle-aged man was the origin soul of the Vermillion Bird Divine Emperor. To ensure nothing would go wrong on this trip, he had already gone to the Black Tortoise Divine Sect and the White Tiger Divine Sect. The Azure Dragon Divine Sect was the last one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The nine old men from the Azure Dragon Divine Sect looked at each other and didn’t hesitate much. One of the three elders in front respectfully nodded. “We will obey the order of the Vermillion Bird Divine Emperor!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for what was going on in the Demon Spirit Land, by borrowing the self-destruction of one of the six Vermillion Bird Divine Sect elders, Wang Lin was able to get away from the All-Seer. His eyes were completely red and intense pain shot through his heart due to his injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, the five remaining elders of the Vermillion Bird Divine Sect were too late to come to help. The five of them weren’t at peak Nirvana Shatterer cultivators; they were mostly in the early and mid stages, and they were already finding it difficult to deal with Ancient Devil Ta Jia. If they were distracted for a moment, they would be seriously injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These five elders were surrounded by flames and had magic treasures surrounding them. These were no ordinary treasure either; they were all Void treasures stored by the Vermillion Bird Divine Sect for countless years. Although they were not as good as Pseudo Nirvana Void treasures, the way the five of them used them with the flame giant and adding on the Flower Imperial Concubine, who had won over the human-like thing, they were able to confront the ancient devil. However, when the ancient devil used spells, it was obvious they were at a disadvantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The All-Seer’s expression was calm. After tearing the mark from between his eyebrows, he had a powerful aura around him. He slowly approached Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To be killed by me while I’m at first Heaven’s Blight, you can laugh in hell.” The All-Seer walked one step and a stormed echoed. Before he even got close, the storm swept Wang Lin. It was as if knives were cutting his body, creating popping sounds, and then Wang Lin was knocked back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin coughed out a mouthful of blood and revealed a ferocious expression. During his entire cultivation life, if not for his struggling and resilience, he would have already died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was still blood at the corner of his mouth as he slapped his bag of holding, causing dozens of flying swords to appear. With a roar, he pointed at the All-Seer and they all shot forward. At the same time, Wang Lin took out the third God Slaying War Chariot!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the third war chariot appeared, it turned into the butterfly, and with a flap of its wings, laws appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The All-Seer’s expression was calm, and his feet didn’t stop at all. Facing the dozens of swords, only his mouth moved lightly as if he was chanting a spell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dozens of swords suddenly paused in the air and then there was a thunderous rumble. The dozens of sword all shattered into pieces, and the pieces flew at Wang Lin,</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the fragments flew back due to some unknown spell casted by the All-Seer, they formed into a dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This dragon was covered in sharp blade fragments and charged straight at Wang Lin, but it crashed into the butterfly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The butterfly flapped its wings and crackling sounds came from the dragon. This sound was very harsh; it was like countless metal pieces were rubbing each other. In just a moment, the dragon shattered once more into powder that scattered with the wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene caused Wang Lin’s scalp go numb. This was the first time he had been in a situation where he didn’t even know what spell the other party had used and he almost died. If not for the fact that he had pulled out the God Slaying War Chariot quickly enough, he would have been caught unprepared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The butterfly flapped its wings and invisible wind containing law blew toward the All-Seer. However, the All-Seer’s expression didn’t change when the butterfly appeared; he just chanted once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Earth-shattering explosions went off before the butterfly and layers of ripples spread. It caused the butterfly to tremble and show signs of collapse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s expression revealed a deep struggle as his hand formed a seal and he coughed out a large mouthful of blood on the butterfly. He then shouted. “Activate the third seal!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The butterfly trembled and flapped its wings once more. Four incomplete petals appeared above the butterfly, and as it flapped its wings, the four incomplete petals floated forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The All-Seer exclaimed slightly as he raised his right hand and waved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Large amounts of fragments appeared in the void before him as if he had shattered the sky with the wave of his hand. Those fragments all flew toward Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The butterfly still had the four petals out, but they didn’t have time to display their true power before the fragments swept past Wang Lin and it disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And at this moment, the All-Seer closed in. He had a calm expression as he raised his right index finger and ruthlessly pointed between to Wang Lin’s eyebrows!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If this finger landed, even Wang Lin’s ancient god body would immediately collapse and his weaken origin soul would instantly disappear. From that day on, there wouldn’t be anyone named Wang Lin anymore!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The All-Seer’s strength was like a giant mountain that stood before Wang Lin. Wang Lin subconsciously felt like he couldn’t resist, and even if he did resist, he wouldn’t be able to cross this mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this feeling was suppressed by Wang Lin the moment it appeared!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not willing!!” Wang Lin’s voice echoed across with a roar of madness. As the All-Seer’s finger fell, Wang Lin took out a sword sheath from his bag of holding and held it out before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an instant, the All-Seer’s index finger collided with that sword sheath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a heaven-shaking sound and cracks appeared on the sword sheath. Although it didn’t shatter, the force threw Wang Lin into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He coughed out a large mouthful of blood. Wang Lin’s vision had blurred and his origin soul was almost ripped asunder. He felt like he was about to fall apart, and at this moment, the only thing holding him together was his unwillingness to surrender and his will to defy the heavens!</span></p>
