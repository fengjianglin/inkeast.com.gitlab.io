The moment the white-haired man appeared, he caused more than 10 cultivators to die. He also directly devoured their flesh and origin souls.</span></p>

Just at this moment, one person among the several cultivators near the celestial gate flew out. He was middle-aged and was wearing a golden robe. His eyes were like lightning and he was at the Illusory Yin stage. He slapped his bag of holding and 13 flying swords flew out.</span></p>

They all took out their treasures and charged out.</span></p>

When he re-appeared, he was next to the celestial gate, which was the giant bolt of red thunder that descended from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment he appeared, his right hand formed a seal and hit the red thunder. There was a loud rumble that echoed across the heavens and earth.</span></p>

They all took out various treasures and charged toward the strange man. Among them were less than 10 Illusory Yin cultivators. They were the primary force of this attack, and they were charging straight toward the strange man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Thunder Celestial Realm will close and all of you will be my food!” The strange, white-haired man’s eyes revealed a cold gaze. Without even looking at the attacks coming toward him, he disappeared and then reappeared behind a late stage Ascendant cultivator. His speed was beyond imagination</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ascendant cultivator was an old man. His expression changed greatly and his eyes were filled with fear. However, before he had time to turn around, the strange, white-haired man’s hand directly penetrated the old man’s chest. He seized the old man’s origin soul and directly crushed it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man was able to hear his chest shatter and his origin soul collapse. His vision blacked out and his life was lost. His entire body, along with his origin soul, was devoured by the strange, white-haired man.</span></p>

However, it was too late. The white-haired man let out a creepy laugh, then his body turned into a bloody shadow that went into the golden-robed man’s body. Explosions echoed inside the golden-robed man’s body before he bursted into a mist of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The white-haired man took form inside the mist of blood and devoured the golden-robed man’s origin soul.</span></p>

They obviously wanted to leave through here. As the number of cultivators increased, the white-haired man was like a fish in water. He was simply too fast and vicious, and he could kill a person in an instant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, it was impossible for the surrounding cultivators to work together. Fear gradually grew, and as the celestial gate rapidly shrank to the point of disappearing completely, the fear grew even stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was unknown who started it, but all the surrounding cultivators gave up sieging the white-haired man. Instead, they dispersed and charged toward the disappearing celestial gate from all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The white-haired man let out a grim smile as he devoured a few more cultivators. Then his hand formed a seal and he shouted, “Celestial spell, clones!” In an instant, the white-haired man split into two and then again from two to four. This continued, and in an instant there were 32 of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The 32 clones charged out and immediately merged with the world. When they re-appeared, they were within 10,000 feet of the celestial gate. At the same moment, miserable screams filled the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of the cultivators that were within 10,000 feet had their bodies destroyed by the clones and their origin souls devoured.</span></p>

After all, the celestial gate was the only path to survival.</span></p>

He didn’t retreat and instead inhaled in all the surrounding origin energy into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is a qi cultivator with guts!”</span></p>

Most of the cultivators were rushing in like crazy in order to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the celestial gate was the only hope.</span></p>

Everyone else would die before even getting within 1,000 feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the Illusory Yin cultivators that rushed within 1,000 feet, they all suffered the same fate. They all died as soon as the white-haired man’s origin body appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bursts of creepy laughter came from the white-haired man. As he continued to slaughter and devour, his originally skinny body gradually expanded slightly. It was as if something was moving inside his body, and this made him look even more terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The aura his body gave off became even stronger. Almost every time he devoured a cultivator, his aura became a bit stronger. The red light from his eyes became even stronger.</span></p>

The celestial gate was just about to dissipate completely. It didn’t seem like it would take long before it disappeared completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once that bolt of red thunder disappeared, the Thunder Celestial Realm would be completely sealed.</span></p>

These rays of sword energy were filled with origin energy and created a sharp roar as they rushed over. At the front, Zhan Konglie’s eyes were cold, and behind him were more than 10 cultivators at the Illusory Yin stage. They were all charging toward the white-haired man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, several more rays of light came from another direction.
