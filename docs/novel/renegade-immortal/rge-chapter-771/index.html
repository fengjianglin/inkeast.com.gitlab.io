This cycle continued until the black clouds showed signs of collapse. Wang Lin’s eyes became cold and he open his mouth to spit out origin energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This origin energy entered the black cloud and suddenly made it feel like it was filled with endless power, causing it to contract like crazy. However, at this moment, the resistance coming from the Blood Ancestor also grew endlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sounds of explosions came from inside and the black cloud actually began to collapse. The Blood Ancestor’s muffled roar came through and sounded like roaring thunder in Wang Lin’s ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blood Ancestor’s roar came out. “You brat, Wang Lin, are not qualified to seal this old man!” The dense, black clouds collapsed again. They were now very thin and were about to disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once the the black clouds disappeared, it meant that the one-billion-soul soul flag was destroyed!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Through the clouds, Wang Lin could see the qilin turn into black smoke and surround the Blood Ancestor. The qilin’s head took shape and bit down on the Blood Ancestor’s neck. The fourth soul was constantly flying in and out of the Blood Ancestor. Every time it &nbsp;penetrated the Blood Ancestor’s origin soul, it would leave with a large amount of origin energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was still that human figure that the last primary soul formed. It turned into black gas that surrounded the Blood Ancestor, making his movements slow.</span></p>

The red light shined like crazy from his body and gradually filled the black clouds until they looked purple!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A roar came out from the Blood Ancestor’s mouth. “Blood soul, collapse!” The red light around his body was almost demonic and his origin soul suddenly released unimaginable power. The qilin immediately let out a miserable groan and the impact of the force caused it to dissipate rapidly. Terrified of this, it immediate let go and backed up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The primary soul around the Blood Ancestor collapsed and quickly retreated. Even the fourth soul that penetrated the Blood Ancestor’s origin soul was caught by the Blood Ancestor. With a merciless pinch, cracks appeared on it before it dissipated and retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little brat Wang Lin!” The Blood Ancestor’s eyes were bloodshot as his hand ripped open the black clouds before him.</span></p>

When the Blood Ancestor was about to step out, he opened his mouth and spat out a ray of yellow light. There was a grain of sand inside the yellow light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment the sand appeared, a powerful pressure immediately shrouded the area. In an instant, this grain of sand immediately grew until it was more than 1,000 feet wide. It was like a mountain, but it looked more like a stamp!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This object had used a celestial fragment as material and was refined in a furnace formed by the heavens with divine retribution!</span></p>

The step he was taking to step out was forced back.</span></p>

The Blood Ancestor charged out, but after a series of rumbles, he was pressed down under the stamp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the stamp rose up, the Blood Ancestor looked weaker, but he was still fierce and red light flashed brightly around him. At this moment, the Karma Whip suddenly appeared and lashed toward him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a bang, the Blood Ancestor’s origin soul became more unstable. Just as he was about to retaliate, the stamp smashed down. The Blood Ancestor’s origin soul was about to collapse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He let out a miserable smile and his eyes were filled with madness. Just at this moment, Wang Lin’s voice came.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Blood Ancestor, I will not kill you and will give you a chance to see Yao Xixue again! If you explode, you will never see Yao Xixue again!” Wang Lin’s voice was cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blood Ancestor silently pondered and the madness in his eyes slowly disappeared. Wang Lin’s eyes lit up as his hand formed a seal and he shouted, “Collect!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surrounding black cloud immediately surrounded the Blood Ancestor. The Karma Whip also appeared and wrapped around the Blood Ancestor. The damaged three primary souls also appeared and began to devour like crazy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The stamp floated above, Although it didn’t press down again, the pressure was still there. This pressure cause the black cloud to contract even more rapidly. It contracted to a ball in almost an instant before turning back into a 30-foot-long flag in Wang Lin’s hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The 100-feet-wide flag spread out and there was a radical change. Before, it was just a black flag with nothing on it, but now there was an image.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blood Ancestor’s figure was lifelike with the Karma Whip around him like a lock and the three primary souls fiercely surrounding him. The Blood Ancestor’s expression revealed indignation and unwillingness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like this, the image on the flag took form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the one-billion-soul soul flag, Wang Lin was silent. He didn’t feel pride in defeating the Blood Ancestor, and his heart felt melancholy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had struggled a lot to defeat the Blood Ancestor and was not nearly as calm he seemed on the outside. This fight was filled with life and death moments, and a moment of carelessness would have meant death. This battle was no less dangerous than his escape from the Moongazer Serpen. In fact, it was even a bit more dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the Moongazer Serpent’s intelligence was very limited.</span></p>

If you had just taken Yao Xixue with you, you wouldn’t have ended up like this…” Wang Lin sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unless it was the last resort and he was crazy, he won’t have forced the Blood Ancestor down like this. He was helpless on his matter because if he wanted to live, he had to resist. If he wanted to continued to exist, he had to kill the Blood Ancestor that swore to destroy him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yao Xixue was the Blood Ancestor’s weakness. In order to seal the Blood Ancestor, Wang Lin had to use this! In the face of survival, there was no such thing as despicable!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin looked at the soul flag and said, “Blood Ancestor, I respect your fatherly love. I also have a son. If someone were to act against my child... I can understand your anger… However, did you give me a chance to explain? I didn’t touch your daughter once while I had her captured. If it wasn’t for your daughter plotting against me, why would I dare to provoke the Blood Ancestor?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that the Blood Ancestor could hear!</span></p>

You love your daughter, so you don’t think about right or wrong and don’t think about the cause. Although this is love, it is spoiled love!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I gave you a chance, but senior Blood Ancestor held the idea of killing me. In my eyes, your actions are no different from Yao Xixue’s. I understood the job of a father 1,000 years ago, but you still don’t understand it even today!” Wang Lin looked up at the distance and put the flag away. He didn’t bother considering if the Blood Ancestor understood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He only needed to have a clear conscience, and this was enough!</span></p>

There was a flash of yellow light as it shrank to the size of a grain of sand before Wang Lin swallowed it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He patted his clothes as if he wanted to sweep away all the gloominess from the past several days. Then his body turned into a ray of light and he flew far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll make myself as strong as possible in the Thunder Celestial Realm. My spells are still very lacking. Before, my cultivation level wasn’t high enough to be eligible for celestial spells. However, with my current cultivation, I am strong enough to participate in the battles for celestial caves.</span></p>
