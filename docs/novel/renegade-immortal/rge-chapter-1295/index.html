However, in this short period of time, he had brought indescribable shock to the thousands of cultivators there.</span></p>

Not only had he not lost and had showed overwhelming strength, he had also caused the elder to unknowingly suffer a hidden injury!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of this terrified the thousands of cultivators outside the spatial crack!</span></p>

They could never be erased!</span></p>

They were familiar with the ongoing war but unfamiliar with where it led and ended.</span></p>

It was like its own universe, and it couldn’t be explored with only a few people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Out of 100 people that enter, less than three people would return. The rest would all die or go missing. However, the Demon Sect had never given up; they continued to send people every once in a while.</span></p>

Li Qianmei had become a scout to once again explore the spatial crack. Either she lived and came back with new discoveries, or she’d die and become one of the cultivators that disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s divine sense withdrew from the jade in his hand and he looked at the dark world without any light. Even with his cultivation, he could only see about 1,000 feet. Everything else past that was a black blur.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The path in the jade is a passage into the depths of the spatial crack the Demon Sect obtained by sacrificing countless lives. It is also the path Li Qianmei took, but this place is simply too big. Not even the passage inside the jade really enters the depths.”</span></p>

It moved extremely fast with its 10,000 foot body like a bizarre bolt of lightning. The reason it was bizarre was that the Nine Abyss Dragon was completely silent as it flew. There were no thunderous rumbles or sonic booms caused by its speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Wang Lin sat on top of the Nine Abyss Dragon’s head, he silently looked around. He seemed to be able to completely fit into this dark world without any discomfort.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because the roars were so far away, it sounded like someone was breathing. However, it wasn’t one, but many...</span></p>

However, none of this affected Wang Lin at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He calmly sat there and silently looked ahead, recalling the 10 years when he was a stone statue and couldn’t feel anything in the outside world… Also, the blood light and warmth that were always there while he was inside the Heaven Defying Bead for 10 years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If there was no blood light, Wang Lin’s soul would have stayed inside the Heaven Defying Bead until he dissipated. He remembered that at the beginning, he was very cold and was slowly dissipating… It wasn’t until the blood light came that he became warm and his body slowly started reforming. He had regained his senses and awakened his memories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because of the blood light that he could find the Lord of the Sealed Realm and enter the dao realm to comprehend his first dao spell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dream Dao… This is the spell that I comprehended in the dao realm. It is my third spell after Sundered Night and Flowing time. It is a dao spell…”</span></p>

The more he recalled the old woman’s words, the more he thought about the blood light inside the Heaven Defying Bead. He felt like he owed Li Qianmei even more and was unable to repay her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time slowly passed as Wang Lin recalled his memories. The world inside the spatial crack seemed to never change. Everything was always dark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only difference was that when Wang Lin occasionally looked up, the beast shadows that appeared 1,000 feet away became more and more numerous. If this world lit up, the sight that would be unveiled would shock any cultivator!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin raised his head and origin energy gathered in his right hand. A golden light gathered in his palm and then shot upward like a meteor. It broke the silence and suddenly exploded into a bright light that lit everything up!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment the light appeared, heaven-shaking roars came from the surrounding fierce beasts. With the light, Wang Lin could clearly see that many different kinds of fierce beasts had surrounded him and the Nine Abyss Dragon. There were no less than 10,000 of them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They seemed to be extremely sensitive to the light. The moment the light shined in the darkness, they all roared violently and quickly retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blinding light was soon devoured by the darkness, causing the world to become dark once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Abyss Dragon was one of the king beasts in the spatial crack, and it gave off an aura that belonged to a king beast. This was preventing the surrounding beasts from approaching. This was why Wang Lin was able to get so far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the fierce beasts should retreat when encountering the Nine Abyss Dragon, but due to Wang Lin’s existence, they had become conflicted. This was why so many of them had gathered but didn’t dare to get too close.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The light allowed Wang Lin to see the the surrounding fierce beasts. Although there was a lot, most of them were rank 10. There weren’t many above rank 10.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The light dissipated. Wang Lin was still sitting calmly on the head of the Nine Abyss Dragon when his divine sense spread out. The Nine Abyss Dragon seemed to be stimulated by the divine sense and let out a roar. The roar was heaven-shaking, and it violently echoed inside this dark world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Abyss Dragon suddenly sped up and charged ahead. The fierce beasts all retreated, opening a path. The Nine Abyss Dragon broke through the beast herd and pierced into the depths of the dark world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was difficult to keep track of time inside the spatial crack. There was no day, only endless darkness. As the Nine Abyss Dragon went deeper, Wang Lin’s expression gradually became serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he still could only see 1,000 feet ahead, he found that something was different. As he went deeper, the color of this world changed. It was no longer black, but purple!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Abyss Dragon began to move slower and slower. There was a faint tremble from its soul, as if the purple world terrified it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn’t Wang Lin’s divine sense surrounding it, the Nine Abyss Dragon would’ve been trembling violently and would not dare to move further. It would immediately leave and fly away. The beasts that had been following them all trembled and didn’t dare to follow deeper. However, the amount of fierce beasts surrounding them didn’t decrease, but increased. These were all beasts that lived in this purple world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin naturally noticed the Nine Abyss Dragon’s abnormal state. His eyes lit up. Although the amount of time that had passed was not obvious, based on their speed, Wang Lin calculated how far they had traveled. Based on his analysis, he was at the edge of the purple realm that was recorded in the jade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was very close to the end of the passage marked in the jade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sitting on the head of the Nine Abyss Dragon, Wang Lin closed his eyes and felt his surroundings. He gradually felt faint traces of spells nearby. It was as if someone had just used a spell not long ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin had come all the way here and was still a bit farther away from the end of the passage. However, he didn’t know if he had followed the right path, not had he found any clue about Li Qianmei. After entering the spatial crack, he faintly felt several powerful auras. They seemed to be aware of Wang Lin but strangely didn’t stop him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, this was the first time he had found a clue about Li Qianmei. Although the traces of spells were faint, they were real. They weren’t left by a beast, but a cultivator!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Qianmei… Is it you…”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin opened his eyes, and they lit up. His hands formed a seal and he pressed it hard between his eyebrows. A powerful force rushed into his forehead, and his origin soul trembled violently.</span></p>
