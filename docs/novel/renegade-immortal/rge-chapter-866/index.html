 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the old man’s guidance, they headed straight toward the eastern side of the Thunder Celestial Temple. From far away, Wang Lin saw a palace much larger than the others. It was like a giant beast that was lying there, and a pressure came from it before he even closed in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Several kilometers away from the hall, the old man stopped and smiled. “Fellow Cultivator Xu, the Lord of the Temple only summoned you, so I can’t accompany you. If will be fine if you enter by yourself!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s gaze fell on the large hall several kilometers away. He turned toward the old man and said, “Senior, thank you for leading the way!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not any kind of senior. Since Fellow Cultivator Xu can be summoned by the Lord of the Temple, you will definitely not be merely a small fish in the pond. When that time comes, we should get to know each other better.” The old man shook his head before he excused himself and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin carefully spread out his divine sense and flew forward. He gradually closed in on the main hall, and when he got near, he saw a person standing outside. Although the person’s back was facing Wang Lin, that person was like a towering mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master Flamespark!” Wang Lin wasn’t surprised. When he got close, he landed and clasped his hands. “Greetings Senior Master Thunderflame!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Should I call you Master Demon Xu Mu or Wang Lin from the Alliance Star System?” Master Flamespark turned around and calmly looked at Wang Lin. When his gaze fell on Wang Lin, he was a bit surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nirvana Scryer? Good, very good!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s expression was calm. He didn’t panic when his identity was pointed out and calmly said, “Either Xu Mu or Wang Lin is fine. I believe Senior didn’t call me here just to ask about my real name.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Master Flamespark looked at Wang Lin and revealed a smile. There was a flash of admiration when he smiled. “Good, you are worthy of someone who is fated with this old man. I don’t care if you are Wang Lin or Xu Mu. I want to ask you are you willing to participate in the battle against the Alliance Star System.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin silently pondered for a while and slowly said, “Junior’s strength is meager; even if I participle, it won’t matter much.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A Nirvana Scryer cultivator like you dares to say your strength is meager?” Master Flamespark laughed, but there was a flash of coldness in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin silently pondered a little and nodded. “Since Senior Master Flamespark value me so much, then I’ll participate in the war!” Wang Lin had already decided this long ago in his heart. Since he came to participate in the 108 celestial title competition, he would be forced to get involved in the battle with the Alliance Star System.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good. Keep the token I gave you safe. It might be of great use to you in the future! It can also be considered the fortune I originally promised you!” Master Flamespark waved his sleeve and a gust of &nbsp;wind suddenly appeared before Wang Lin. There was a flash of light and a transfer array appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Leave with this transfer array. In three days, this old man will personally go watch the competition along with some friends. Your senior apprentice brother, Qing Shui, will also go!” With that, Master Flamespark turned around and walked into the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin looked at Master Flamespark and calmly said, “Senior Master Flamespark, can you return Junior’s Thunder Beast?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Once the passage is opened, I’ll naturally return it to you!” Master Flamespark’s figure disappeared into the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin silently pondered for a bit before he raised his foot and stepped into the transfer array. When he reappeared, he was in the outer hall next to the four transfer arrays.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no one left. It was obvious they had all been taken to where they would stay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Wang Lin appeared, he immediately turned around. There was a woman standing behind him. She was extremely beautiful, as if she was made of jade, and she was wearing a blue, water pattern dress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is senior Xu Mu?” Her voice was crisp and very pleasant to listen to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior is Chen Shan and was ordered by Lord Messenger to wait for Senior. This is Senior’s token for this celestial competition. As for your residence, the information is inside.” Chen Shan’s expression was respectful as she took out a token the size of her fist and handed it to Wang Lin. Then she hesitated and her face turned red and she softy said, “If Senior needs a cultivation furnace during cultivation, Senior can call Junior with the token. The Thunder Celestial Temple is willing to offer all the help needed for the participants of this competition.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After she finished speaking, her face became even more red as she bowed and retreated. Her figure was very alluring, and when she left, she faintly revealed the charm under her dress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin held up the token and scanned it with his divine sense. This object was like a piece of jade. It held a simple map of the Thunder Celestial Temple and an inactive transfer array. After finding his residence, Wang Lin headed straight there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three days of time passed by in the blink of an eye. During these three days, Wang Lin cultivated with his eyes closed to keep himself at peak condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire Thunder Celestial Temple became extremely lively when it was nearing noon of the third day. Transfer arrays flashed non-stop as groups of cultivators arrived. There were a lot of viewers for this celestial title competition. First were the cultivators of the cultivation families from the main planets of each domain. They only had the qualifications to watch from the outer edge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then it was the cultivation families that were above the families on the main planets but below the likes of the Yao family. They were families like the Shengong family and the Zhan family. After them were the four great families with inheritances from the Celestial Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Last were the family members of the two cultivation families from ancient times that were hosting this competition along with the Thunder Celestial Temple. Although the number of cultivators viewing this competition was relatively low, there were still tens of thousands of them. The Thunder Celestial Temple had arranged numerous floating platforms, so the cultivators had places to sit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battlefield for the celestial title was determined to be at the 10,000-feet-wide thunder lake square!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Outside the square, there were more than 10 white pillars that gave off waves of celestial spiritual energy. Master Flamespark was sitting on a praying mat on top of one of the white pillars. Beside him sat Celestial Lord Qing Shui. His eyes were closed as if he had no interest in any of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As more and more cultivators that came to observe appeared, the Xiang family ancestor appeared. He clasped his hands at Master Flamespark and sat down on the praying mat next to Master Flamespark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the two talked, the man named Gongsun appeared wearing black and sat down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shortly after, the Yao family and the other three families with inheritances from the Celestial Realm arrived. The person from the Yao family was Blood God. He arrived with the old monsters from the other three families and sat down on the praying mat. They didn’t even look at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Shengong family and the Zhan family arrived, the Shengong family ancestor and Li Yunzi each sat down on the praying mats one after the other. Shortly after, various ancestors of different cultivation families all arrived and sat down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When noon arrived, &nbsp;Master Flamespark’s eyes lit up. He calmly said, “Allheaven Star System 108 celestial title battle, begin!” His voice turned into countless thunderclaps that echoed across the Thunder Celestial Temple. Countless transfer arrays appeared in the sky. They were all the same size, and one by one, cultivators appeared from within them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin was included!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood God raised his head and looked at Wang Lin with an eerie gaze. He let out a cold snort as he withdrew his gaze. His expression was gloomy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aside from Blood God, there was another gaze from the crowd on the outside that landed on Wang Lin. Xi Zifeng bit her lower lip as she silently looked at Wang Lin in the sky. She let out a sigh and her eyes revealed a hint of confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since she returned from the Thunder Celestial Realm, Wang Lin’s figure remained in her heart. She couldn’t get rid of his figure, and when she heard of Wang Lin being hunted by the Yao family, her heart trembled, but she had no way to help. Every day, she was in no mood to cultivate, but when she heard that Wang Lin had escaped, she was extremely happy. However, there was a thick sense of bitterness behind that joy.</span></p>
