The blood was slowly refined after many sacrifices over the countless years. It was one of the two family protection treasures they had.</span></p>

After that, a lot of ancient cultivators came to study it. Although they couldn’t understand the cause, they gained an understanding of the ball of blood. Thus the spell for the Lou Fu blood ball came to be.</span></p>

This was found by the Thunder Celestial Temple 30,000 years ago. Rumor had it that it was a celestial tree that supported the Ancient Celestial Realm. Only the Thunder Celestial Realm was able to keep theirs relatively intact. The other three realms lost theirs during the collapse of the Celestial Realms.</span></p>

After the Thunder Celestial Temple found it, they hid it away. Now it was taken out as a powerful method of attack against the Alliance.</span></p>

These tens of thousands of cultivators were mercilessly pushing this giant piece of wood forward! There were even old monsters, like the Xiang family ancestor and the middle-aged man from the Gongsun family, at the back. With their help, this giant piece of wood moved toward the tunnel ahead with a thunderous rumble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This giant piece of wood had the power to pierce anything slowly gained speed.

The power contained within it was unimaginable. The barrier created by the spatial rifts couldn’t resist the force of this impact at all. As the endless rumbles echoed, large amounts of ripples spread in every direction. At the center of the ripple, the giant piece of wood charged through and forcibly opened a passage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A large amount of Allheaven cultivators followed around and behind the giant piece of wood, charging into the Alliance filled with killing intent!</span></p>

They wanted to dodge, but due to the impact of the giant piece of wood, they couldn’t dodge at all. Even though they were very far, they were sucked in by the powerful storm formed by the giant piece of wood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were some cultivators that were hit directly by the piece of wood. Their bodies and origin souls were destroyed, leaving behind a mist of blood. However, compared to the size of the wood, this blood was insignificant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The 18 Lou Fu was the first great treasure the Allheaven cultivators had prepared, and this giant piece of wood was the second, but this still wasn’t the end!</span></p>

Ripples spread across the barrier and a roar that shook the entire western region came from the tunnel to Allheaven Star System.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This roar tore through the western region and violently shook the Alliance cultivators. Some of them even bled from their orifices due to the vibrations.</span></p>

A giant cultivation planet appeared in the tunnel between the two systems. It was surrounded by white gas and was very strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment it came out, the mist around the planet quickly withdrew until it all disappeared, then a crack appeared in the middle of the planet. The planet opened up and countless tentacles stretched out. This was the Moongazer Serpent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Moongazer Serpent’s eyes were bloodshot and were filled with endless anger, enough for it to go crazy. Its tentacles waved like crazy as it charged out.</span></p>

This roar turned into a storm and shot forward. In an instant, those spatial cracks were pushed back like pieces of torn paper!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, as the roar closed in on the giant piece of wood, a barrier of yellow light appeared. It was like an egg shell that allowed the roar to pass along side it without any resistance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The angry roar of the Moongazer Serpent was so intense that it even caused space to collapse. The space before the giant piece of wood twisted and a white-robed old man was forced out in a somewhat sorry state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His face was extremely gloomy and his gaze seemed like it would penetrate space. When he saw the giant Moongazer Serpent come out from the tunnel, he retreated without any hesitation, but just at that moment, the giant piece of wood arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man was one of the four saints, the Heavenly Dao Origin Saint. He let out a sigh as he shook his head and retreated even faster.</span></p>

A red wind quickly appeared and surrounded the surrounding 5,000 kilometers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This great battle began in the western and northern regions and quickly spread. The battle was fierce, and various magical treasures flashed across the battlefields!</span></p>

The angered Moongazer Serpent seemed to be able to differentiate between Alliance and Allheaven cultivators. It would rarely affect Allheaven cultivators but often slaughtered Alliance cultivators.</span></p>

Lei Ji’s body, which was a lot smaller, only 30 feet tall, was opening the way. The big-headed boy was behind him. As for Ta Shan, he still had a cold expression as he observed his surrounding.</span></p>

Along the way, he had met several Alliance cultivators. Whenever they saw Wang Lin, their expressions changed due to Wang Lin’s group’s cultivation levels. They turned around and ran without any hesitation.</span></p>

They attacked Wang Lin’s group after some hesitation. But all of them were directly killed by Wang Lin without any exception.</span></p>

The further he went, the more Alliance cultivators he met, but there weren’t many that were willing to fight him.</span></p>

The familiar surroundings had all collapsed and spatial cracks would whistle by. All of this showed that the western region was now completely deserted. However, these cracks before Wang Lin were moved to the side by some mysterious force.</span></p>

This was the sign of starting to control law. Although Nirvana Scryer cultivators comprehended law, comprehending and controlling were very different things. Controlling law was something only Nirvana Cleanser cultivators could do. Wang Lin had not reached the Nirvana Cleanser stage, but with the help of the heaven defying bead, he had a sliver of aura similar to that of a Nirvana Cleanser cultivator, though this aura was very faint.</span></p>
