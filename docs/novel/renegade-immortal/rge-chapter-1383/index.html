No one knew when he had appeared in the Fallen Land, and his cultivation level wasn’t that special, only Nirvana Scryer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this person had repeatedly made shocking appearances. The pills and treasures he would take out had set of wave after wave in the Fallen Land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Greed’s cultivation level wasn’t high, he was extremely slippery. Adding his strange spells and powerful treasures, he could always protect himself. Even people with higher cultivation levels than him found it difficult to capture him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In particular, this person was good at escaping and had a spell that could increase his speed 97 fold, making it impossible for ordinary cultivators to catch up. Greed was also extremely cautious and often wouldn’t hesitate to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, he rarely faced danger.</span></p>

Then his spells became even more mysterious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He gradually caught the attention of powerful cultivators in some of the clans. They became greedy and pursued Greed. Many thought that Greed would without a doubt die, but then Greed unexpectedly took out a lot of treasures he had never used before!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every treasure had heaven-shaking power. The three Nirvana Shatterer cultivators chasing Greed were injured when they were caught off guard by him. One of them was even killed!</span></p>

A Nirvana Cleanser cultivation hadn’t died under the pursuit of three Nirvana Shatterer cultivators and had even killed one of them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Greed’s name swept across the Fallen Land like a storm, but, similarly, the clan of the dead Nirvana Shatterer cultivator was furious. Although this clan didn’t have a Fallen Elder, it was still very strong. In order to kill Greed, the clan had sent out a first Heaven’s Blight cultivator!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A first Heaven’s Blight cultivator killing a Nirvana Cleanser cultivator was like a tiger trampling an ant! This matter set off an uproar, and just as everyone was sure Greed was doomed, another miracle happened!</span></p>

There were many rumors about this treasure later on. Most rumors said that this treasure was a broken statue!</span></p>

Roars that seemed to come from ancient times echoed, and the first Heaven’s Blight cultivator instantly died to this treasure!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That destructive force had shaken all the Heaven’s Blight cultivators in the Fallen Land. That power was enough to destroy even third Heaven’s Blight cultivators!</span></p>

After all, Greed owned endless treasures.</span></p>

However, could there be a treasure that could instantly kill Nirvana Shatterer and Heaven’s Blight cultivators?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After this battle, Greed became famous. Rumor had it that the Great Emperor became interested and looked for Greed. Greed took this chance to hand over a treasure, and the Great Emperor gave him a pill to help increase his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few years later, after Greed reappeared before everyone, he was at the mid stage of Nirvana Shatterer! His reappearance had caught the attention of many cultivators at the fourth Heaven’s Blight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In secret, a fourth Heaven’s Blight cultivator wanted Greed’s treasure and attacked him in secret. But in the end, he was seriously injured and was forced to retreat. In the end, no one dared to plot against him anymore!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumors of Greed having many treasures spread.</span></p>

Wherever he appeared, there would be a heavenly treasure. Even if it was an abandoned planet, he would be able to find some heaven-shaking treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because of this that the phrase “Greed never goes anywhere without treasures” began to spread.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aside from Greed’s spells and treasures, he also had another quirk. Whenever someone made a strange reaction around him, they would receive his retaliation.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Greed cultivated an unknown spell, and wherever he went, a foul smell would linger for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the 10 cultivators around Greed also smelled that almost unbearable stench. However, they didn’t dare to reveal it and remained respectful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They moved very fast and soon spotted the planet the Dark Scorpion Clan was on. Greed’s eyes lit up as he stared at the cultivation planet in the distance. There was excitement in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, he had almost died to get to the Outer Realm and had used his own strength to accomplish his current achievements. He was now several times stronger than before, and he had even obtained new treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were even several treasures he had almost given up his life to obtain, and they were incomparably powerful! Today, he was not the same person as he was in the past. If he went back to the Inner Realm, his status would be extremely high!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he couldn’t get excited, as the stench on his body was like a shadow on his heart. He couldn’t smell it anymore, but whenever he saw the expressions of the people around him, it was enough for him to go crazy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He thought of a lot of methods to get rid of this stench, but this smell existed in his origin soul and was fused with his origin soul. No matter what he did, he couldn’t get rid of the smell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This pain had tortured him until today. This made his hatred for the All-Seer, Wang Lin, and the Moongazer Serpent reach a peak!!</span></p>

There is also that Moongazer. This old man vows that I’m going to tear it to shreds!!</span></p>

That person… That person is my nemensis! He robbed me of all my treasures. My teleporting furnace, my ancient thunder dragon, my Mountain and River Painting, my mountain soul… All the treasures I spent tens of thousands of years gathering were taken by him!!!”</span></p>

Aside from his hatred toward Wang Lin, there was a huge shadow over his heart. After encountering Wang Lin a few times, he felt extreme dread toward him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This dread became fear as time passed. Although his cultivation level had increased, this fear didn’t dissipate, but became even stronger.</span></p>

On planet Suzaku, the Heaven Defying Bead I fancied was taken by him… In the Demon Spirit Land, my cultivation level was clearly higher, but in the end he devoured my ancient thunder dragon… My thunder dragon!!! It had accompanied me from my childhood, and if I still had it, I could have fused with it to become a thunder cultivator!!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then I was forced by All-Seer and them to go to Allheaven to search for Wang Lin. Then, after suffering at the hands of the Moongazer Serpent, I met Wang Lin! He took my furnace, my Mountain and River Painting, my everything!!</span></p>

However, fortunately, heaven isn’t blind and I finally escaped. I managed to land on a cultivation planet!”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Greed recalled his past, and his encounters with Wang Lin were especially painful.</span></p>

This was a nightmare he couldn’t forget.</span></p>
