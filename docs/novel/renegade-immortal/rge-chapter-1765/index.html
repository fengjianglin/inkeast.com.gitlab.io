 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment the second arrow shot out, the golden light in Wang Lin’s eyes collapsed as if it was going to dissipate. However, just at this moment, Wang Lin forced it to reform and retained a sliver.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sliver was the last of his celestial bloodline power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin was worried that others would see, so he closed his eyes when he shot the second arrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin understood he still had the power for one more shot, but it would be the last shot!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The arrow shot out and the world rumbled. Space folded like silk cloth as if it was about to collapse. The Seven-Colored Daoist let out a roar. The eight Eye Fishes that had opened their eyes already startled him. When Wang Lin’s second arrow shot out, the Seven-Colored Daoist was even more shocked, and he erupted his full cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A seven-colored light spread out and seven different-colored layers of light screens appeared before him. Just as they appeared, the eight Eye Fishes closed in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The eight Eye Fishes shrank as they closed in. As the black light shined, they turned into eight arrows!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These eight arrow were exactly the same as the Li Guang Arrow. There was no difference, even the aura was same. Everyone here was startled by this!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Could this be the rumored superpower the Eye Fishes have once they open their eyes?”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man named Ma from planet Five Element looked closely from the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grand Empyrean Xuan Luo calmly looked at the eight Eye Fishes. He was the only person who knew about the superpower the Eye Fishes had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Once the Eye Fishes opens their eyes, they can take the form of anything and obtain part of its power… However, it is very difficult for this beast to open its eyes. These ones in this cave are very interesting…”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Xuan Luo’s eyes lit up with a hint of interest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The nine Li Guang Arrows mixed together, making it impossible to figure out which one was the real one. They shot straight for the Seven-Colored Daoist. His expression changed quickly and the seven-colored light screens around him distorted as thunderous rumbles echoed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The seven-colored light screens collapsed, and along with them, the nine Li Guang Arrows collapsed as well. However, they didn’t dissipate; they reformed into the eight Eye Fishes. They landed not far from where the first one was, and all nine Eye Fishes were on their last breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This collapse created a shockwave that covered one’s vision and divine sense. The ninth Li Guang Arrow penetrated everything and headed toward the Seven-Colored Daoist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A miserable groan came from the shockwave, and thunderous rumbles echoed. When the shockwave dissipated, the Seven-Colored Daoist could be seen. He coughed out blood and there was a fist-sized hole in his chest. He had been seriously injured by the Li Guang Bow!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He let out an angry roar and charged forward. Disregarding his injuries, he charged toward Wang Lin. He was filled with killing intent and a sense of madness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This old man would give up the third soul to kill you!” The Seven-Colored Daoist let out a roar and his hands formed a seal. Nine blinding suns appeared around his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These nine suns were the Seven-Colored Daoist’s most powerful spell. He used it without hesitation to kill Wang Lin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin’s face was deathly pale. At this moment, he was like a dried-up oil lamp and was very weak. He gritted his teeth as he raised the Li Guang Bow with his left hand and drew it with his right. This was his third time, and Wang Lin knew it was likely the last time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bowstring was pulled back and the arrow appeared once more. There was still blood on the arrow. Wang Lin’s right hand loosened and the arrow shot out for the third time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the third arrow shot out, Wang Lin immediately closed his eyes to hide the golden light that was completely dissipating from his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Seven-Colored Daoist’s chest was covered in blood. As the third arrow closed in, his hands formed a seal and he waved his hand. There was madness in his eyes; he had never been this injured in his life. What was driving him even more crazy was that the person who had injured him was Wang Lin, whose cultivation level was far beneath his!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What made him feel even more suffocated was that the Li Guang Bow that had injured him was something he had told the Sovereign to gift out. He originally intended to give Wang Lin the bow to lure out Lian Daofei. Then, once there was a feud between Wang Lin and Old Ghost Zhan, Wang Lin would use the bow to injure Old Ghost Zhan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, neither he nor Old Ghost Zhan could use this bow, as they were incomplete.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he didn’t expect to be seriously injured by the Li Guang Bow. The madness in his heart made him disregard everything to kill Wang Lin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As his hands formed seals, the nine suns shined brightly. They flew out and charged at the third arrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thunderous rumbles echoed when the third arrow collided with the nine suns. The nine suns collapsed, but the third arrow also showed signs of dissipating. A blinding light erupted and enveloped everything!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The nine suns exploded and a destructive force spread out. Their power was indescribable. The Azure Dragon General was too close, and the destructive force for touched him. His body collapsed and he immediately died!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The world began to shatter. This world was destroyed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this wasn’t the end. This destructive force was the full power of the Seven-Colored Daoist, and the 300 destroyed worlds could not resist it. As the destructive force spread, the 300 destroyed worlds began to collapse one by one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Tortoise’s face was filled with terror and he let out a scream as he retreated with the Vermillion Bird General. The Sovereign turned pale and turned into a ray of red light as he escaped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distance, the expressions of the third concubine, Dao Master Blue Dream, and the people from planet Five Elements changed. They all retreated out of the first flower that formed the 300 destroyed worlds!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the center of destructive force, the Seven-Colored Daoist’s chest trembled. The collision of the third arrow and nine suns created a shockwave that rushed into his body. Blood sprayed out from his chest and he was seriously injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, his eyes were still filled with madness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re so close to this destructive force. With your cultivation level, I want to see how you will resist it!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin was indeed the closest, and the destructive force closed in on him. Worlds were collapsing, and even with his Ancient Dao inheritance, he couldn’t resist. As long as it touched his body, he would be destroyed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, since Wang Lin dared to set this ambush, he was naturally prepared. He had expected this destructive force to appear. As the destructive force closed in on him, his hands formed a seal and his right hand reached at the void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry!” Wang Lin let out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A monstrous golden light burst out and the sleeping madman wearing a messy robe appeared before Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The madman had the complete Immortal Celestial body. Even if the star system collapsed, his body wouldn’t be injured!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The madman was still sleeping and had never awakened. He felt a bit uncomfortable from Wang Lin grabbing his shoulder, so he twisted a bit and continued to sleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, just at this moment, the destructive force arrived and hit the madman. The madman’s body shined brightly and remained unscathed under the destructive force!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the madman’s body trembled and his eyes slowly opened. His eyes were filled with confusion and a hint of anger. He was still not awakened and was half asleep. He began to roar angrily at the Seven-Colored Daoist, who was in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who!? Who is it?! Who dares to disturb this king’s sleep!? You’re all bullies, this king will tell his big brother!” the madman roared at the Seven-Colored Daoist, not even noticing that Wang Lin was holding his shoulder and using him to block most of the destructive force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re all too much. You all dare to tickle this king while I’m sleeping? You… You…” As the madman roared, he actually began to snore. His head tilted and he fell asleep once more as if everything he had said before were merely just him sleep talking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, his appearance and words caused a great deal of chaos in the surrounding area. The Seven-Colored Daoist was seriously injured, and after he saw Lian Daofei, his expression changed. His mind became sober. He didn’t know how many times Wang Lin could shoot the Li Guang Bow, and if Wang Lin teamed up with Lian Daofei, he might actually die here. Now that he was seriously injured, he clenched his teeth and, for the first time since he began fighting Wang Lin, chose to escape!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distance, Old Ghost Zhan, who was surrounded by the Ghostly Sail, had already opened his eyes, but he chose not to come out of the fog. He had witnessed everything, and his eyes were shining. It was unknown what he was thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distance, the escaping Sovereign trembled and almost tripped when the Madman roared.</span></p>
