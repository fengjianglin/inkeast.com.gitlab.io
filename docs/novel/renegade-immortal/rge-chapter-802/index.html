The moment they appeared, the flash of light caused the fog to suddenly stop. It was as if it had been attacked, and it retreated back to more than 10,000 feet away.</span></p>

The fog around him was simply too strange, so he didn’t dare to spread out his divine sense. He had a feeling that if he spread his divine sense, it would cause a huge change in the fog.</span></p>

It was extremely big and seemed to extend forever. When when he looked up, it was still covering the area.</span></p>

As his body flew upward, the ball of flesh began to move. Countless cracks opened and spat out black mist.</span></p>

His appearance was very ordinary, but he had tattoos marks on his face that twisted like vines. He was holding a strange instrument in his hand. It was like the mouth of a kettle but many time largers, almost the height of half a person.</span></p>
