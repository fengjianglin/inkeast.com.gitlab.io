The girl that had been hiding on the burly man’s right shoulder and was preparing to sneak attack Wang Lin was forced out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter what cultivation level one was at, everyone had to suffer the test of the fog from the Ancient Order Tromb. Even third step cultivators had to face it, not to mention this little girl from the Sealing Extermination Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment she appeared, her body trembled violently. Her body withered rapidly and was instantly corroded by the fog until she was only a skeleton!</span></p>

Flesh began to grow out from the bones once more, and in just a few breaths, the girl that had died was reborn!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was fear in her eyes. In a short period of time, she had been killed by Wang Lin’s scheme. She was still feeling thankful when she was hit by this fog and died without being able to resist at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Out of her three lives, she had already used two!</span></p>

What she feared was that even if she revived, she was still inside the fog, and it was her last life!!</span></p>

If she were to be reborn inside the fog, the result would be… her real death!!</span></p>

However, how could she compare to the speed of the fog?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as her body reformed, the fog rushed into her body before she could retreat far. Despair filled her eyes. Her Sealing Extermination Clan had almost immortal bodies, but right now the fear of death washed over her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of this happened in a flash. The girl was surrounded by the fog once more. She felt desperate as the fog cycled through her body once. However, not only did she not die, but endless vitality rushed into her body and formed a number beside her clan mark!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this short instant, the girl had experienced life and death, and cold sweat soaked her clothes. Before she regained her senses, the suction force shrouded her. She struggled in terror as she was pulled deep into the fog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was also the burly man from the Esteemed Heavenly Wolf Clan. He had been pulled into the fog one step before this girl!</span></p>

His eyes lit up, and the scene of the girl dying and resurrecting shook his mind!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I already killed her once before, and this strange fog killed her again, but she still isn’t dead!! The Sealing Extermination Clan… is a bit too strong!</span></p>

If that woman dies again, she won’t be able to come back!”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Wang Lin was observant and intelligent, so it wasn’t difficult for him to figure out something like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What really puzzled him was his current state. When the fog rushed at him, it didn’t form a number mark once it entered his body. Instead, it turned into ancient god power and was absorbed by the stars between his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this ancient god power was filled with death energy and resentment. After Wang Lin absorbed it, many violent thoughts raged in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn’t for him suppressing them quickly and stopping the absorption, his mind would’ve been taken over. However, after dispelling the rage from the ancient god power, his mind was unprecedentedly clear. This feeling was very obvious, like the difference between summer and winter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No number had appeared between his eyebrows, so he wasn’t pulled by the suction force. Inside the fog, Wang Lin’s eyes lit up and he began to analyze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes grew brighter and brighter. Recalling the number marks and the location of his place, his pupils shrank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That number mark, outsiders can’t understand it, but it is clearly the language of the ancient gods! Could this place be the place where Greed came out of the Ancient Order Tomb?”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s heart pounded and his eyes lit up. He suddenly looked toward where the girl and the burly man were pulled toward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No wonder no ancient god language didn’t appear between my eyebrows… No wonder the mist entered my body and turned into ancient god power… The number on the burly man was 14… The number on the girl was 29…”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin licked his lips and pondered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This place is perilous, and the Ancient Order Tomb is &nbsp;even more dangerous… Should I go or not!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After three breaths, Wang Lin’s eyes became determined. His personality had always been like this, to find benefit in danger! If he gave up going in this time, who knows when it will open again? He might never have another chance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes lit up, revealing an indifference gaze as he carefully moved toward the depths of the fog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The more dangerous it was, the more opportunity and good fortune were present!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Ancient Order Tomb, let me experience what kind of terrifying dangers and fortunates lie here! As an ancient god, this place will benefit me much more than others!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin moved like a fish and charged forward. He decisively gave up absorbing this fog filled with death and resentment. Although it could strengthen him, he knew that if he absorbed it, his mind would no longer belong to him. He would be controlled by the death and resentment aura like a living puppet!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin moved faster and faster, but his expression became even more cautious. Although he wasn’t taking every step slowly, it was close. He had lived through many life and death situations due to his caution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only thing that could be considered reckless was his plan to scheme against the Sovereign. There was no reason for this idea to appear, it had just suddenly appeared after talking with the first Vermillion Bird.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his heart, he had come up with a lot of reasons and excuses to do this. He had also entered the All-Seer’s soul to divinate the chance. He had also made up his mind that if the Sovereign was really there and had recovered, he would use the jade to retreat back into the Inner Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of these seemed to be his own ideas that had appeared on their own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, after escaping from the Fire Sparrow Clan, when Wang Lin began to doubt if the middle-aged man was really the Sovereign, he had a terrifying doubt… This doubt caused his body to turn cold!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why would I do such a crazy thing and come up with such a crazy idea…”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as he began to doubt it, the thought immediately dissipated and other things just naturally disrupted him. This had caused him to almost forget this doubt that had appeared in his mind when he was doubting the identity of the Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, after entering the fog, his mind suddenly became clear. It was as if the fog was a different world from the outside. It was as if some unknown power had descended upon Wang Lin and was being blocked by the fog!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The disappearance of this power caused the doubt that appeared in Wang Lin’s mind to appear once more. This doubt became stronger and stronger. In just a moment, he was covered in cold sweat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He suddenly looked back and stared at the churning fog behind him. His gaze seemed to be able to penetrate the endless fog and see the calm Ancient Star System. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a long time, Wang Lin withdrew his gaze, and there was a hint of fear in his eyes. Thinking about what had happened after arriving in the Ancient Star System, Wang Lin clearly felt a power controlling him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After pondering for a bit, the fear in Wang Lin’s eyes was replaced by coldness. He pondered for a long time and then determined that entering the Ancient Order Tomb was something he had decided after carefully analyzing; the idea hadn’t appeared for no reason. He then turned and went into the depths of the fog.</span></p>
