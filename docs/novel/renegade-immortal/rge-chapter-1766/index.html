 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thanks to using the madman as a shield, the destructive force was weakened to a point where Wang Lin’s Ancient Dao inheritance could resist it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the madman went back to sleep, Wang Lin rapidly retreated toward the nine Eye Fishes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin moved very fast and arrived next to the nine Eye Fishes while holding the sleeping madman. When he looked over, his pupils shrank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He saw that only four of the nine Eye Fishes remained!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other five had disappeared!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin didn’t have time to think, so he waved his sleeve. Three Eye Fishes were taken by him. Just as he was about to take the fourth one, it disappeared before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin’s scalp went numb and he looked toward where the Eye Fish had disappeared. There was nothing there; only the sound of the collapse of the 300 destroyed worlds echoed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Luo stood there and looked at the cautious and surprised Wang Lin, revealing a proud smile. Seeing Wang Lin’s expression, his smile became even wider.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin’s eyes flashed an indiscernible amount. He knew a secret about the Eye Fishes. It was something the Seven-Colored Sovereign had discovered after he began raising them in the 300 destroyed worlds. Wang Lin had found it in the memories of the third soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If there were two Eye Fishes, one male and one female, a connection would be made between the two. This connection would exist even if one went into a storage space or a barrier. This connection would last until death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin quickly thought of everything and retreated without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just at his moment, Old Ghost Zhan, who had long become sober but stayed inside the fog, walked out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After walking out of the fog, Old Ghost Zhan had two choices before him. He could either kill Wang Lin and take the third soul, or chase after the Seven-Colored Daoist and use this once-in-a-lifetime chance when the Seven-Colored Daoist was seriously injured to fuse their souls!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although, this fusion wouldn’t be complete without the third soul; it would only be containment and not fusion, but there wouldn’t be any regrets. Although his cultivation level would remain the same, there would be no one to contest him for the third soul!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both choices held great temptation for Old Ghost Zhan. If he first tried to kill Wang Lin, he would still be afraid of the Li Guang Bow. He wasn’t sure how many shots Wang Lin could still use, and if he wasted too much time, the Seven-Colored Daoist would recover, so it wouldn’t be worth it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he was unwilling to let Wang Lin go! He wanted to hit two birds with one stone and capture both of them here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This hesitation only lasted for a moment before Old Ghost Zhan walked out of the fog. At this moment, Wang Lin’s hoarse voice echoed across the collapsed 300 destroyed worlds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Old Ghost Zhan, how many shots do you think I have left?” Wang Lin spoke with a gloomy tone as he carried the madman and retreated into the vortex. Even as he disappeared into the vortex, he still coldly stared at Old Ghost Zhan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The illusion around Old Ghost Zhan was blurry, but he also stared at Wang Lin, though didn’t chase. He couldn’t figure out how many shots Wang Lin had left. He was always cautious and wasn’t willing to gamble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin had chosen to seriously injure the Seven-Colored Daoist instead of Old Ghost Zhan because, according to his analysis, the Seven-Colored Daoist was more emotional. After all, his soul had only inherited the spells, whereas Old Ghost Zhan had inherited all the comprehension, so it was likely that Old Ghost Zhan would be more rational.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it was the Seven-Colored Daoist, Wang Lin couldn’t accurately judge what decision he would make, but if it was Old Ghost Zhan, Wang Lin would be 80% confident!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the most satisfactory result he could get from these seven ambushes. Wang Lin wasn’t arrogant enough to think he could kill the Seven-Colored Daoist, but he could use the opportunity to display his might!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had created many disadvantages for the Seven-Colored Daoist and even seriously injured him before luring Old Ghost Zhan to act. On the one hand, him fighting the Seven-Colored Daoist was to scare Old Ghost Zhan so that Old Ghost Zhan wouldn’t act rashly. On the other hand, he had also prepared a great gift for Old Ghost Zhan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything would depend on whether Old Ghost Zhan would accept the gift or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, although Wang Lin’s plan had flaws, it made Old Ghost Zhan hesitate even more. After Wang Lin disappeared, Old Ghost Zhan’s eyes lit up. He turned toward where the Seven-Colored Daoist escaped and rushed out with greed in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sovereign had witnessed everything from a distance, and his eyes lit up. He vaguely saw through something, and his heart skipped a beat. He didn’t speak to remind Old Ghost Zhan but began to scheme his own plans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment Wang Lin entered the vortex, the 300 destroyed worlds all collapsed. In the core of the cave world, all the dew on the yellow flower inside the furnace turned to gas and dissipated. Then the large flower slowly withered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin didn’t know if the remaining people had lived or died. After he disappeared from the vortex, he disappeared from where the first flower was and appeared in another world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right after he appeared, blood flowed out from the corner of Wang Lin’s mouth and his face was pale. He put away the sleeping madman and didn’t have time to heal as he looked around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This place was dim, but there was a flower giving of a ghostly light and a chill. This chill came from ice!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This flower was a frozen flower!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Five Flowers Eight Doors! This is the name of the defense mechanism of the core of the cave world!”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin stared at the frozen flower. Although he didn’t have much information from the third soul, he knew the name of this defense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The 300 destroyed worlds was the first flower, and this frozen world was the second flower! Perhaps the remaining flowers were damaged or had even dissipated, but Wang Lin couldn’t see them, so he couldn’t make any good guesses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The so-called Eight Doors were hidden in the last flower. Wang Lin had learned from the third soul that the key to opening the last flower was the memories from the third soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among the eight doors, seven were fake and only one door was real. That door led to the Immortal Astral Continent. The reason they were on the last flower was because the fifth flower was the seal on the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Staring at the frozen second flower, Wang Lin hesitated, but soon his eyes were filled with determination. His body fused with the flower and he slowly disappeared into the ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was already seriously injured, and he entered the second flower without healing. The cold energy surrounded him. When his body appeared in the frozen world, he coughed out a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment his blood sprayed out, it froze and fell to the ground. Wang Lin staggered onto the ground and raised his head to look around. As he looked around, he became startled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This place was a frozen world. The earth, sky, and even the clouds were all frozen. The floating continents were hanging like giant icicles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What place is this second flower…”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin’s expression was serious as his divine sense spread out. He didn’t find any information about this place from the third soul. As his divine sense spread out, his eyes gradually shined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a lot of life force in this world. This life force was inside this frozen world as if it was sleeping. Wang Lin even felt a familiar ancient god aura here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A moment later, Wang Lin’s expression suddenly changed and he looked to his left. The ancient god aura coming from that direction was very strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After pondering a bit, Wang Lin suppressed his injuries and moved to the left toward the ancient god aura. After an incense stick of time, Wang Lin stopped. He let the cold wind hit his face as he looked ahead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">100,000 kilometers before Wang Lin, it was another frozen world, and there sat a woman with long hair. She faced Wang Lin, and between her eyebrows were seven ancient gods stars. The stars slowly rotated and gave off bursts of ancient god aura!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Female ancient god!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spatial rift outside of planet Dong Ling!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman’s eyelashes trembled and she slowly opened her eyes. She calmly looked into the distance and saw Wang Lin. Their gazes collided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Welcome to the Dong Ling Sect,” the woman spoke softly. Her voice was very beautiful as it echoed through this frozen world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">100,000 kilometers away, Wang Lin silently pondered. Wang Lin remembered why this ancient god aura was so familiar. When he killed the Xiang family ancestor on planet Dong Ling, he felt this aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This place is planet Dong Ling?” Wang Lin took a step and ripples echoed under his feet. He crossed 100,000 kilometers in one step and arrived 1,000 feet away from the female ancient god.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman looked at Wang Lin with a mysterious light hidden under her calm gaze. After hearing Wang Lin’s words, she shook her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This place is the Dong Ling Sect, not planet Dong Ling.”</span></p>

My name is Wang Lin, I wonder what your name is.” Wang Lin looked at the woman, especially at the seven stars between her eyebrows, and sat down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman softly said, “Yun Na, the Dong Ling Sect’s god elder under the Celestial Sovereign.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re the first person to enter this frozen world from the entrance in the core of the cave. I can feel Master’s soul in you…” The woman’s words were soft, but when Wang Lin heard them, his heart skipped a beat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master…”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wang Lin didn’t speak, but he looked at Yun Na, waiting for her to continue.</span></p>
