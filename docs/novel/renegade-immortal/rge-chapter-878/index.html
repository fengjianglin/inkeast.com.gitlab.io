There are real people among the fakes and fakes among the real! Master Flamespark’s scheme really runs deep! I admire him! Excluding the 108 people outside, four out of 112 people came in with their real bodies! The two I killed earlier had their bags, so there is another one left beside me! I just don’t know who it is.”</span></p>

If he noticed a cultivator, he would immediately rush over. Along the way, Wang Lin showed no mercy. Since this was a slaughter battlefield, if one entered, they were prepared to kill and be killed. If they died, it wasn’t real death. As a result, all of the cultivators Wang Lin encountered found it difficult to escape! However, before Wang Lin attacked, he would check if the other person could open their bag of holding or not. If they couldn’t, then he would attack.</span></p>

Then the golden runes flew out, causing a series of rumbling sounds. The two of them began a great battle in the air!</span></p>

He intently watched the battle in the sky. At this moment, a hand suddenly tapped his shoulder.</span></p>

In fact, when he suddenly rushed forward, you were also scared me for a moment.” Nangong Hu smiled mischievously. He sat down next to Shengong Hu, looked up, and exclaimed, “To be able to watch such a spectacular battle during the night is one of life’s great joys! Ah!” As he spoke, he slapped his bag of holding, took out a pot of wine, and took a drink.</span></p>

I can’t help it; I was unlucky to have my actual body brought here. Fortunately, I found out early. Otherwise, if I had gone to carelessly kill like a fool and died, it wouldn’t have been worth it at all! As a result, I found a place to hide and waited for it to end, then I come out when it was safe!”</span></p>
