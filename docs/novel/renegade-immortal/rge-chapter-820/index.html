After all, no one likes sharing a cultivation planet, but all of the planets with spiritual energy had been taken. If one wanted their own cultivation planet, they would have to steal it from the Alliance Star System.</span></p>

This is the first time such a large scale granting happened since the Thunder Celestial Realm collapsed. There will be 36 Heavenly Dippers and 72 Earth Fiends for a total of 108 people. Everyone who has a celestial title will have status above messengers of the Thunder Celestial Temple and will be admired by all cultivators in the Allheaven Star System!</span></p>

After all, not everyone liked reputation. However, the Thunder Celestial Temple had obviously thought of this, so they added something else to increase the stakes! The Thunder Celestial Temple announced that all the people granted celestial titles will be personally taught a celestial spell by Celestial Lord Qing Shui!</span></p>

Instead, they had an energy that was an integration of celestial spiritual energy and origin energy: celestial origin energy!</span></p>

However, most cultivators believed that this name would be short lived as his life would end soon!</span></p>

It wasn’t that they didn’t want to help, but they all had their own families and they couldn’t resist the Yao family!</span></p>

There was only grey fog before Wang Lin, but that couldn’t stop him at all.</span></p>

The months of flying in the fog had caused their mentality to undergo a series of evolutions.</span></p>

Although their numbers had reduced, their killing aura gradually thickened.</span></p>

Amidst their ranks were women and children, but the weak expressions had disappeared from them as well.</span></p>

There were shadows of Wang Lin among them. After all, for these simple people, Wang Lin was the only example they could learn from.</span></p>

Their group attacks were almost seamless and could multiply their strength. If it wasn’t for the fact that they had to guard their women and children, they would be even more fierce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin silently pondered as he wrapped the women and children of the Chosen Immortal Clan in his spell so they could move even faster.</span></p>

The members of the Chosen Immortal Clan charged out one by one. What appeared before them was a bright and starry sky!</span></p>

Right after what happened at the Thunder Celestial Realm, he was transferred into the Nether Beast. Seeing the stars again after all this made everything that had happened feel like a dream.</span></p>

Now the first order of business is to find which domain this is. I must find a cultivation planet!” Wang Lin muttered to himself as he took out a jade. This was the map Shengong Hu had given him. After looking at it for a bit, he put it back into his bag.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin looked back at the Chosen Immortal Clan members.</span></p>

Do you happen to have a cultivation planet that &nbsp;could shelter us temporarily? Once we are familiar with this Allheaven Star System, we will definitely leave!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin pondered slightly and nodded. Planet Qing Ling was very large and could fit these Chosen Immortal Clan members.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He turned back around, took a step, and rushed forward like a meteor. The Chosen Immortal Clan members followed after him. There were hundreds of rays of light flying toward planet Qing Ling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along the way, Wang Lin had his divine spread out, looking for cultivation planets. This place was extremely open, so it was very difficult to find a cultivation planet. After 10 days, Wang Lin’s eyes lit up and he locked onto a yellow planet in the distance. The spiritual energy fluctuations weren’t very strong but not weak either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they flew, the fluctuations of their flight was so large that they spread everywhere, so they were detected by the cultivators from that yellow planet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as Wang Lin closed in, three rays of light flew out from the yellow planet, revealing three people. Among the three, one of them was a middle-aged man and the other two were old men.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were strong origin energy fluctuations from the three of them; clearly they were all at the Illusory Yin stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the three appeared, they had serious expressions. The middle-aged man looked at Wang Lin and calmly said, “Fellow Cultivator, you rushed over so quickly; I wonder what do you need!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other two’s gazes swept across the Chosen Immortal Clan behind Wang Lin. The more they saw, the more shocked they became. The people behind had no spiritual energy fluctuations at all. Instead, they possessed a mysterious force they had never seen before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, they could clearly feel killing intent from these people. This killing intent was very strong and was obviously built up from killing for a long period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">More importantly, these people’s expressions revealed a very cold aura. Their expressions didn’t change in the slightest when facing the two of them, and they even contained a hint of killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the other two felt it was strange that there were women and children among them. It made it hard for them to guess these people’s background.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just at this moment, the middle-aged man finished speaking and carefully looked at Wang Lin. He felt as if he was hit by lightning and thought that Wang Lin’s appearance was similar to the Heaven Order sent out by the Yao family.</span></p>
