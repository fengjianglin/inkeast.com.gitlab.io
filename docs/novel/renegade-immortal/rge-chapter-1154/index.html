He slaughtered his way into the sect and completely destroyed the sect with some of his friends, leaving behind a blood bath.</span></p>

As the spirit beast moved through the rank 5 region, disciples of the Clear Flower Sect followed him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I didn’t think that clue would be true!” Every time Noble Money thought of his matter, his heart beat faster. Several months ago, his Clear Flower Sect accidently found some clue related to the legendary Nirvana Void Pill and a jade that showed one how to become a core disciple of the Heaven Breaking Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a native cultivator of the Cloud Sea, Noble Money obviously knew of the heaven-shaking event that occured 18,000 years ago in the Cloud Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">18,000 years ago in the Cloud Sea, the Heaven Breaking Sect was a rank 8 sect ready to move into the mighty rank 9 region. Two months before the move, they accidently found a spatial crack, and it was filled with restrictions and danger. The Heaven Breaking Sect gathered large amounts of cultivators together to enter the crack, including elders that were at Heaven’s Blight. They broke their way through and had countless casualties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, they found a corpse in the depths of the spatial crack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were three things next to the corpse: a pill, a broken sword, and a piece of beast bone. After obtaining the three items, the elders of the Heaven Breaking Sect went crazy and quickly left the spatial crack to return to the Heaven Breaking Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was because their discovery was too incredible and could shock the entire Cloud Sea Star System! It was possible for the Heaven Breaking Sect to take supremacy from the rank 9 God Sect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they had a traitor in their midst, and the news got leaked out. What awaited them was the entire rank 8 region moving against them. Countless old monsters that rarely appeared all participated in this battle that made their eyes red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Heaven Breaking Sect, which had the right to enter the rank 9 region, had the power to battle the entire rank 8 region. A blood bath was created in the rank 8 region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rank 7 region was affected, and they also sent out cultivators, and the rank 6 region was also dragged in. Even the rank 5 region was affected, and a catastrophe that swept across the Cloud Sea began.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This matter was extremely fierce. Even after 18,000 years, Noble Money would tremble when thinking about this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, this caused the rank 9 region that almost never interfered to finally step in. This matter was a bit disadvantageous for the Heaven Breaking Sect, and at this moment, the Heaven Breaking Sect split!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A large amount of people in the Heaven Breaking Sect weren’t willing to fight for these three items. They traded the pill and broken sword for their survival. They also maintained their original trajectory of moving to the rank 9 region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A small part of the Heaven Breaking Sect took the beast bone fragment and began a life and death battle with those that tried to steal them before disappearing into the long river of history.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the beast bone with the pill recipe, it disappeared, and no one knew where it went. Some believed it was taken by the cultivators of the rank 9 region and other believed that it was hidden among one of the rank 8 sects that fought against the Heaven Breaking Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, this matter ended, and where the beast bone went remained a mystery. That was until 18,000 years later, when the Clear Flower Sect found a clue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whether this clue was true or false, it shocked the entire Clear Flower Sect. They immediately locked down the information and even killed some of the disciples that knew of this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This matter was simply too shocking. If they were a bit careless, it would lead to the destruction of their sect. After all, the bloody lesson the Heaven Breaking Sect learned was enough to warn people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to the Heaven Breaking Sect of the past, the Clear Flower Sect was like an ant. They had no qualification to hold this beast bone fragment. Although they were greedy, they weren’t intending on keeping it for themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were hoping to find the beast bone fragment and then gift it to a powerful rank 8 sect in exchange for a large amount of benefits and long term protection. They also hoped to use this to get help from the rank 8 sect to become the overlord of the rank 6 region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, all of this would depend on whether this clue was true! If they only gave the clue to the rank 8 sect and it turned out to be false, then the Clear Flower Sect couldn’t afford the anger of the rank 8 sect. This was why they didn’t dare to hand over a clue and went to check it themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, if they wanted to check it, they would have to prevent any rumors from spreading so the other rank 6 sects wouldn’t notice that something was wrong. Also, this clue led to a sect in the rank 3 region, so if a large amount of Clear Flower Sect disciples moved, they would raise the suspicion of the other sects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the one thing the Clear Flower Sect was worried about. In the end, they chose the dependable head disciple, Shi Luoxing, to take 19 disciples and secretly head to the rank 3 region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Luoxing’s cultivation level wasn’t the highest in the rank 6 region, so him taking some disciples and leaving wouldn’t cause too much attention. This was proven true when no unnecessary trouble occurred even after he reached the rank 3 region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Shi Luoxing didn’t think that clue was true! He easily obtained the beast bone fragment and got a jade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just as he was on his way back to the Clear Flower Sect, he was pursued by the Five Poison Sect. The other sects of the rank 6 region also learned of this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shi Luoxing, you must hold on!”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Noble Money’s origin energy was injected into the spirit beast below him. The spirit beast moved even faster as it pierced through layers of fog toward the wild continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was only leading the first batch of aid. Behind him, almost the entire Clear Flower Sect had moved out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While they were rushing through the star fog, Noble Money’s gaze narrowed as he saw a cultivator within the range of his divine sense. This cultivator was riding on a 1,000 feet black ape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along the way here, this white-haired cultivator wasn’t the first cultivator he had seen. However, this place wasn’t far from the wild continent, so Noble Money couldn’t help but pay attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While he moved forward, his gaze was still locked onto the white-haired cultivator. Not only him, but the 10 or so Clear Flower Sect disciples were all looking at the white-haired cultivator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These gazes seem solid, and Wang Lin’s face turned pale and revealed a shocking stare as he looked dumbfoundedly at the more than 10 rays of light. He stopped in the air as if he had forgotten how to fly. He knew that his cultivation was a bit strange and outsiders couldn’t see through it right away, so it might cause some unnecessary suspicion. Thus, he kept his origin energy always active at the mid stage of Nirvana Scryer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Noble Money withdrew his gaze. He was impatient to go to the wild continent. At first glance, he found nothing abnormal about this white-haired cultivator who was obviously shocked by their sudden appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to the star map he had, there were several wild continents nearby. Looking at the white-haired cultivator’s path, this person had obviously come from another wild continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He longer paid any attention to Wang Lin. He then ordered his spirit beast to pass right by Wang Lin. The other disciples also withdrew their gazes as they passed by Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin was secretly relieved. He couldn’t see through what sect they were from, but they were obviously cultivators from the rank 6 region. They were heading toward the wild continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just at this moment, a ray of light broke through from the distance at an unimaginable speed. This light was bright, and Wang Lin clearly saw a jade inside!</span></p>

These spells were used within sects to transfer messages using jade that moved far faster than cultivators. They didn’t have to worry about it being intercepted, because unless one knew the right seal, the jade would collapse immediately. In order to prevent any accidents, more than one jade was sent out at a time.</span></p>

It landed in the hand of Noble Money, who hadn’t gone far. Noble Money’s expression changed, then his left hand formed a seal and he used a unique hand seal to check the jade. Once his divine sense entered the jade, his body trembled.</span></p>

There was only one piece of information inside, and it stated that Shi Luoxing’s life tablet had shattered!</span></p>

Then his gaze suddenly fell on Wang Lin. He didn’t suspect Wang Lin, but now Shi Luoxing was dead, and they didn’t know who killed him. Whether it was the Five Poison Sect or any of the other rank 6 sects, they were all targets of suspicion!</span></p>

He stood up with respect but also just the right amount of panic. “Fellow Cultivators, what is the meaning of this?”</span></p>

Fellow Cultivator, quickly, follow us!” Among the eight disciples, six of them were at the Corporeal Yang stage and two of them were at early stage of Nirvana Scryer.</span></p>

After all, Wang Lin had higher cultivation level than them. However, with Elder Noble Money here and this being a great matter for their sect, they all became hostile.</span></p>
