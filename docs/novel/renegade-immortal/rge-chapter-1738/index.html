 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ninth cycle’s first breath!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin closed his eyes. He tried using the true and false essence, but it had no effect, as if it was gone. Here, where it was true or false, everything depended on his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of Wang Lin’s heart had been triggered, then everything would move!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment Wang Lin closed his eyes, he suddenly reopened them. They were as calm as water. He understood that everything was merely a trial for his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As long as his heart was calm, the world would be calm. However, it was difficult to calm his heart, especially with all the irritations around him. Although he looked calm now, he hadn’t completely calmed down yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now he had only calmed his body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Wang Lin’s body gradually calmed down, the planet before him suddenly slow down from its rapid vortex state. This change was really obvious, and it was several times slower in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ninth cycle’s second breath!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After his body calmed down, the planet’s rotation suddenly slowed down. Although the planet was still a vortex, the dizziness, nauseousness, and madness all died down as if cold water had been poured on his heart. This allowed his heart to show signs of completely calming down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result, Wang Lin’s soul calmed down!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his soul calm, the planet’s vortex slowed down by several times. It seemed to stagger between being a planet and a vortex. It seemed almost unable to keep up its vortex-like state that made you dizzy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ninth cycle’s third breath!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment the third breath passed, after Wang Lin’s body and soul calmed down, his origin soul also calmed down. With his origin soul calm, Wang Lin felt like he was floating there with his white hair fluttering. His face was no longer pale and was simply calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his view, planet Five Elements’ rotation slowed down even more, and it was no longer a vortex. It had returned to the appearance of a planet, and although he still couldn’t see the scenery on the planet clearly, he could detect the speed with just his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at planet Five Elements, Wang Lin slowly smiled. This smile was very peaceful, without any anger. It was as if he had seen through everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time went by. The fourth, fifth, and sixth breaths of the ninth cycle passed...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, it was completely silent on planet Five Elements. All the cultivators looked at the sky with indescribable shock in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In particular, the old man in the golden robe’s face was pale as he murmured something. He still couldn’t believe what he was seeing. This was beyond his imagination and expectations; in his mind, this was impossible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t belong to the Cave World; he was from the Gui Yi Sect on the Immortal Astral Continent. He was far too aware of the terror and power of the Nine Cycle Heart Wheel Formation. This formation was famous on the Immortal Astral Continent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He never thought that a cave world cultivator would show signs of breaking the formation in such a short period of time. Although the formation here was much weaker than the one on the Immortal Astral Continent, this was a real Nine Cycle Heart Wheel Formation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is impossible… Even if he was able to comprehend the formation, it had already reached the ninth cycle. Time is limited, and it’s impossible for his heart to calm down in time during the ninth cycle!!”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man in the golden robe clenched his fist and muttered words he wasn’t certain about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beside him, Na Duo revealed fear in his eyes as he noticed the change where Wang Lin was. He was far too aware of the strangeness of the formation. He gasped and wasn’t able to say a word for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huge waves set off his head, and he felt an inexplicable fear toward Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Outside planet Five Elements, Grand Empyrean Xuan Luo’s eyes revealed a strange light as he looked at Wang Lin. The light in his eyes grew brighter and brighter. He had seen everything Wang Lin had done, and his heart began beating rapidly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Because he couldn’t calm down in an instant, he first calmed his body. Using his body as an anchor to calm his soul. Then he used his soul as a guide to calm his origin soul. His origin soul then seized the heart and calmed it down...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As a result of the body, soul, and origin soul calming down, the heart would naturally calm down… It’s rare for someone to think of such a method in such a short period of time!! Such comprehension is rare!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll take this child as my disciple!”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grand Empyrean Xuan Luo revealed excitement rarely shown even in 10,000 years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ninth cycle’s eighth breath!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin’s heart completely calmed down at this moment. He stood there with a smile on his face. The rotation of planet Five Elements had slowed down to the point where it could hardly be noticed. The planet appeared clearly before Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the ninth breath arrived, planet Five Elements no longer rotated at all and completely stopped in Wang Lin’s eyes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he wanted to, he only needed to take one step forward to walk out of the Nine Cycle Heart Wheel and enter the planet, but he didn’t do so. Throughout his life, after suffering a loss, he always got his payback. He had nearly died due to his mental energy being drained just now, and if he simply endured it, he wouldn’t be Wang Lin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t know the name of this formation, but it changes every nine breaths, and now it has changed a total of nine times… After each change, it rotates even faster, so it wouldn’t be wrong to call it the Nine Cycle Heart Wheel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How can this formation turn and stop as you wish?” There was a flash of coldness in Wang Lin’s eyes and his right hand pointed forward at planet Five Elements. Then his hand drew a circle in reverse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If the heart moves, then the planet moves. Since my heart has reversed, then this planet will reverse as well. You all wanted to trap me inside the formation, now you can all taste how wonderful this formation is!”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wang Lin’s right hand drew several circles in a row.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When his right hand moved, planet Five Elements, which had stopped moving, began to rotate again. However, this time it was rotating in reverse!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As it rotated in reverse, Grand Empyrean Xuan Luo began to laugh. He was filled with admiration toward Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This child fits my temper. Very good, very good!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, opposite of Grand Empyrean Xuan Luo’s joy were the cultivators on planet Five Elements. They were looking at the sky, but the clouds suddenly scattered and the sky rapidly changed. The sky was no longer blue or bright; it was instead replaced with the void outside planet Five Elements!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the cultivators of the Gui Yi Sect saw a planet in this void. It was planet Five Elements!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This feeling was very mysterious. They were clearly on planet Five Elements, but they were seeing planet Five Elements. This immediately made the hearts of everyone who saw it tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man in the golden robe also trembled. After being startled, his expression changed greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not good!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In an instant, the planet Five Elements in their vision began to rotate. As the rumbling echoed, the planet rotated even faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The heart moves, so the planet moves!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sudden scene caused a disturbance in their hearts and thus they became trapped in the Nine Cycle Heart Wheel!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In their eyes, the planet’s rotation had already turned into a vortex, and this was only the eighth breath of the first cycle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One by one, the cultivators coughed out blood and continued to retreat. They were terrified, and screams of panic echoed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The second cycle suddenly arrived!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Na Duo coughed out blood and immediately closed his eyes. However, the pain and dizziness made it impossible to calm down, so he could only resist. But the more he resisted, the faster the planet rotated in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fear from back then filled his mind again. This caused Na Duo to go crazy from fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was also the old man in the golden robe. His face was deathly pale. His right hand immediately pointed to the spot between his eyebrows, trying to force himself to calm down. However, the screams and calls for help disturbed him again and again, making it hard for him to calm down quickly.</span></p>
