This scene was earth-shattering, and as the sound of thunder spread, it caused more thunder to appear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was like divine retribution!</span></p>

However, this laughter was filled with endless chill.</span></p>

It wasn’t a waste of time for me to come personally take your head. If you die, you can smile while you’re in the underworld. Everyone that was killed by me was famous!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Arrogant!” Wang Lin’s expression was cold. He pointed with his finger and made the thunder in the area become several times stronger. Thunder from tens of thousands of kilometers away began to gather. If one were to look from above, they would see that the area within tens of thousands of kilometers had turned into a thunder lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And the thunder lake shrank amidst the endless rumbles. The center of all of this was the red-robed man!</span></p>

The might of the thunder was like the end of the world!</span></p>

Whenever the thunder passed by, large amounts of cold wind would escape from those cracks. This scene was very shocking!</span></p>

It was as like a huge circle that was tens of thousands of kilometers wide and was rapidly shrinking with the red-robed man as the center.</span></p>

The power this thunder had was comparable to divine retribution!</span></p>

Even Ta Shan and the big-headed boy, who were battling, immediately retreated and revealed serious expressions.</span></p>

All the thunder within tens of thousands of kilometers compressed and finally bombarded the flyings swords!</span></p>

The surrounding thunder didn’t pause, it charged toward the red-robed man with monstrous momentum.</span></p>

The thunder quickly smashed into them, causing them to tremble, and cracking sounds came from the swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Fei’s expression was still neutral. He coldly looked at Wang Lin and said, “I indeed underestimated the power of your thunder, but before me, it is not enough!” As he spoke, he slapped his bag of holding and something appeared in his hand!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This object was a branch, It looked very normal, but it gave off an ancient aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“One of my Slaughter Domain’s treasures, the Branch of the Thunder World Tree. The domain master said that this could suppress your thunder. Let me show you how I’ll break your thunder!” With that, he threw the branch forward. At the same time, the five swords blocking the thunder quickly retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment the five blood swords retreated, there was nothing blocking the thunder, so it immediately charged toward the red-robed man. However, at this moment, Wang Lin seemed to lose control of the thunder, and it all charged toward the branch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the thunder rumbled, the branch absorbed all of it, and bursts of thunder could be seen around the branch. Yu Fei stood beside the branch with a sneer. The thunder seemed to be turning a blind eye to him; it didn’t injure him at all, and it all rushed into the branch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Wang Lin became gloomy at this.</span></p>

It is time to end everything!” Yu Fei’s eyes revealed killing intent as he charged through the thunder. The five flying swords charged with him and closed in on Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin retreated as he stared Yu Fei, who was closing in, and calmly said, “I’ll give you a miracle!” With that, ripples appeared under his feet and he suddenly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Fei was startled and his pupils shrank. His origin energy surged out, creating a storm around him, but he still didn’t find a trace of Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a cultivation planet in the Alliance Star System that was far away from planet Suzaku. The spiritual energy from this cultivation planet was dense, and it was a rank 6 cultivation country.</span></p>

In one of the rank 5 cultivation countries, one named Fallen Moon, there was a woman standing outside the alchemy room in a back mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This woman was wearing a pink butterfly dress. She didn’t look very old and was very beautiful. There were specks of metal chips above her right eyebrow that made her look very cute.</span></p>

I’m Song Ying.” This woman’s face was red and her voice sounded like a songbird. She was very beautiful and she looked into the room as she spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A person was sitting in the alchemy room. He had a head of red hair and his expression was very cold. He looked around 30 years old, and the cold aura he gave off made it feel as if it would feel like winter wherever he went!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the voice of the woman came in from outside, the man frowned and coldly said, “I’m not here!” After that, he closed his eyes and focused on cultivating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the woman heard this cold voice, she immediately became happy. She took a few steps and walked directly into the alchemy room. She smiled and said, “Brother Wang Lin, I won’t disturb you for too long. I’ll just sit here for a while and then leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she spoke, she arrived outside the room but didn’t go inside. She sat down outside. She could feel the cold aura coming from the room. This aura entered her body and made her face turn red, but she felt very comfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her cultivation was related to cold energy and had been stagnant. There weren’t many places in the sect with cold energy, and she couldn’t enter those places with her status. One time, she came here to pick up pills and accidently found that the cold energy in her body had increased a lot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This discovery made her very excited and she continued to come here. Eventually, she discovered there was an outer sect disciple named Wang Lin here!</span></p>

Even though he was a worker, she had never seen him do any work. She even saw the uncle-master at the alchemy room be extremely respectful toward Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had a feeling that Wang Lin had a lot of secrets, that he was very mysterious. With this in mind, she had the urge to uncover all those secrets for some reason. In addition, this place helped her cultivation a lot, so she came here almost every day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Wang Lin’s coldness, not only was she not afraid, it made her want to uncover his secrets even more. She was almost always thinking of Wang Lin’s cold figure.</span></p>

 <p>Edit edit: Ok I figure out where I screwed up. Chapter 902-903 was 9th and 10th chapter. But for the 904-905 release I put 10th and 11th instead of 11th and 12th. Then again for 906-907 i put 11th and 12th instead of 13th and 14th. Which lead to the confusion why people thought 2 chapters from last week was missing but it was just me fucking up on the numbering. Derp really hard there but its all fixed now!</p>
 <p>This is the 1st and 2nd chapter for this week XD!</p>
