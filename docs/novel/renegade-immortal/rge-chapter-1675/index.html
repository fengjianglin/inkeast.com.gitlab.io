 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cracking sounds echoed next to Wang Lin’s ears. A crack appeared in his skull, and in his chest, his bones began to shatter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment of life and death, Wang Lin closed his eyes. When his eyes closed, everything in this world became false and all the pain disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, Wang Lin raised his hand and waved with his eyes closed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wave caused the sky to become dim and the earth to wither. The three ancient clan auras disappeared. One portion flew into the sky and another flew into the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dream dao, fuse with Dream of Ancient Times. This dream will be my dream… Auras of the three ancient clans, turn into the power of dream to form my spell, Immortal Dream… With my eyes closed, everything is false; with my eyes open, enter my dream!!” Wang Lin suddenly opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin had studied Dream of Ancient Times, and although it was strong, it had limitations. Dream of Ancient Times was just the owner of the shield summoning everything he remembered and turning it into a dream to kill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the master of the shield had died and the dream was also dead, unable to change. Wang Lin’s own dream dao was inspired by this. At this moment, he became the master of the shield and the master of this dream!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he became the master, his thoughts could change everything about the dream!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment he opened his eyes, he became the Dream of Ancient Time! His eyes opened and the illusory heaven and earth trembled. Heaven became his eye and the earth also became his eye!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When his eyes opened, the world opened. The world had become Wang Lin’s eyes. Ye Mo’s child’s face turned pale as he looked back. What he saw shocked him, so much so that he awakened from his madness!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He saw a faint pupil appear in this world, and it was filled with coldness and killing intent. The sky was the upper eyelid and the earth was the the lower eyelid. Together, they formed a giant eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this was it, he wouldn’t be terrified. What terrified him was what he saw with his divine sense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His divine sense spread out and broke free from this illusory world. He saw that there was a giant face outside. His body was located in front of the left eye of the face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That wasn’t just a face but also an infinitely large body. The body had a white robe and white hair that fluttered in the wind. It was Wang lin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This scene shocked him and he was stunned there. He didn’t dare to believe what he was seeing with this divine sense and eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He froze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he froze, there was a flash of coldness in Wang Lin’s left eye and it slowly closed. A power that could kill anything spread out as the left eye closed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Impossible!” Ye Mo’s child turned around to look at Wang Lin, who he was tearing, but when he turned around, he saw no one before him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin had disappeared. Not only had Wang Lin disappeared, but this rapidly closing world had nothing beside him. A sense of fear from being alone immediately filled his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What kind of spell is this?!” Ye Mo’s child’s face was extremely pale. His eyes were filled with horror and he quickly retreated, but he wasn’t faster than the collapsing world. Wang Lin’s left eye slowly closed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t believe it, it’s all fake!!” Ye Mo’s child suddenly looked up at the sky that was pressing down and threw punches at it. Thunderous rumbles echoed, but he couldn’t stop the sky from collapsing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A moment later, as the world continued to squeeze, there were only several thousand feet of space left. Ye Mo’s hands held up the sky and kicked against the earth. His expression was twisted from pain as he resisted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is all fake!!” With a bang, Ye Mo’s child’s knees collapsed and he knelt down. The world squeezed until it was only few thousand feet high!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m Ye Mo’s child, I was formed by the essence blood from his head, I can’t lose!!” Ye Mo’s child let out a painful roar and his arms exploded. The world darkened and completely closed. There was no gap remaining!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If one looked from a distance, the giant Wang Lin’s left eye had completely closed! Then his body flickered and dissipated into specks of crystal light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dream was over!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the dream ended, the world disappeared. They were still in the space outside the wheel formation. The tens of thousands of cultivators watching didn’t know what had happened at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From their view, Ye Mo’s child had just stopped there and started letting out painful roars. There was nothing before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin stood tens of thousands of feet away with his eyes closed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After less than 10 breaths of time, Wang Lin opened his eyes. His eyes were filled with fatigue and killing intent as he stepped forward like a meteor. There was a flash of blood light and the blood sword appeared in his right hand as Wang Lin closed in on the terrified Ye Mo’s child.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the moment Ye Mo’s child opened his eyes and revealed a confused gaze, Wang Lin flashed by with the blood sword. Ye Mo’s child’s body was split in half. Even at the moment of his death, his eyes were still filled with confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When his body was split in half, the two halves turned into eight drops of purple blood that flew toward Wang Lin and entered his forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin became even more exhausted. After taking the eight drops of blood, he didn’t immediately absorb them but took one step toward the wheel formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he entered the formation, he could no longer suppress his injuries and coughed out blood. He immediately sat down next to Xi Zifeng and began healing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That battle earlier was extremely dangerous. Killing Ye Mo’s child was extremely difficult for Wang Lin without the Li Guang Bow. Although he had won, he had been injured by that terrifying Heaven Ripping spell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heaven Ripping spell still made Wang Lin feel a lingering sense of fear. That line of blood still existed between Wang Lin’s eyebrows. Everything that had taken place in Dream of Ancient Times was real.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was nearly torn to pieces and killed by Ye Mo’s child!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the tens of thousands of Outer Realm cultivators saw him healing. After a brief moment of silence, roars filled with killing intent echoed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He is injured!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He is healing, this is the best time to kill him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When he is injured, the wheel formation can’t function properly. Break the formation and kill him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those tens of thousands of cultivators became hot-blooded when they noticed that Wang Lin was injured. They all rushed toward Wang Lin, who was inside the formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thunderous rumbles echoed. As the tens of thousands of cultivators attacked like crazy, the formation became distorted as it withstood the attacks. Xi Zifeng sat next to Wang Lin and anxiety appeared in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Outside the formation, the five injured third step cultivators clenched their teeth and also flew out, ignoring their injuries. They began bombarding the formation with their Joss Flame spells.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the tens of thousands of cultivators bombarded, the wheel formation faintly trembled. The countless slave souls pushed the wheel to offset all those destructive attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, just as Xi Zifeng was worrying and Mu Bingmei and the woman in pink also became anxious, Wang Lin opened his eyes. His eyes gave off a cold gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Although I’m injured, it isn’t difficult killing you all!” Wang Lin suppressed his injuries. His right hand formed a seal and pressed down on the formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wheel, appear and rotate!” Wang Lin roared as his cultivation poured into the formation. The formation rumbled and a giant wheel appeared outside the formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wheel had countless slave souls pushing it, making it turn. This wheel had the power to change how the world functioned. As the wheel turned, it erupted with the power of death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the wheel continued to turn, all the Outer Realm cultivators trembled and their bodies exploded. Their origin souls were absorbed to become slaves to turn the wheel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tens of thousands of Outer Realm cultivators retreated in terror, and in the blink of an eye, the wheel turned three times! After three turns, countless people died. At this moment, the Outer Realm cultivators lost their wits. They rapidly fled and no longer dared to turn back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just at this moment, Wang Lin suddenly stood up and waved his hand. The drop of celestial blood appeared from between his eyebrows and the Li Guang Bow appeared!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin pulled the bowstring back until it was fully drawn.
