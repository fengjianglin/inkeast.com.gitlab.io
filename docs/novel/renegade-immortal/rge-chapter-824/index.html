The Yao family member rushing over had already broken through the Yin and Yang stage and was at the Nirvana Scryer stage.</span></p>

Wang Lin’s eyes were filled with battle intent. Ever since he reached the Corporeal Yang stage, he hadn’t battled a real Nirvana Scryer cultivator. At this moment, he was filled with killing intent, but at the same time, endless battle intent filled his heart as well!</span></p>

He had to deal with this &nbsp;Corporeal Yang cultivator before the other one arrived. If the two of them teamed up, Wang Lin would immediately be at a disadvantage!</span></p>

He no longer wanted to battle Ta Shan, as he had completed his task. All he had to do was help the Yao family member complete his task and then obtain the reward.</span></p>

He was like a meteor and he charged very far in a flash.</span></p>

However, just at this moment, Ta Shan’s body began to shine dozens of times brighter than before. This golden glow was too strong; if a mortal saw it, they would immediately go blind.</span></p>

Although the old man was at the Corporeal Yang stage, he was too close to Ta Shan. At this moment, the old man’s pupil’s shrank and he wasn’t able to see clearly.</span></p>

Ripples appeared under his feet and Wang Lin disappeared.</span></p>

A vortex was formed from all the origin energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was still a step too late! Wang Lin’s figure had appeared behind the old man right as the vortexes appeared. His fingers were filled with origin energy and he mercilessly attacked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s origin energy vortex hadn’t formed when Wang Lin’s finger landed on the old man’s back. The old man’s face turned pale and he refrained himself from coughing out blood. As the origin energy swept through his body, he wanted to use Wang Lin’s attack to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just at this moment, Ta Shan’s body shined brightly and the tattoo on his forehead melted into his right fist. Just as the old man was about to escape, Ta Shan’s fist landed on him. This fist caused a series of sonic booms that echoed across the stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man was worthy of being a peak Corporeal Yang cultivator. He spat out a mouthful or origin energy during this moment of crisis and created a shield. Ta Shan’s fist landed on the shield, causing it to shatter, and the old man was thrown backwards. The old man’s eyes were filled with resentment as he couldn’t keep the blood back anymore and coughed out a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, his body turned into a bloody shadow and he quickly merged with the blood before him. His figure became ghost-like and he somehow managed to escape from Wang Lin and Ta Shan’s combined attack.</span></p>

As the old man used the blood to escape, he raised his right hand and chopped down. The Heavenly Chop immediately shot out and the escaping blood shadow was split in half.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The peak Corporeal Yang old man let out a miserable scream. His origin soul was wrapped in a blood light and it escaped, abandoning his body.</span></p>

Wang Lin had no time to pursue, so he raised his hand and formed a seal. The Celestial Sealing Stamp immediately appeared before him to form a shield!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yao Chandong’s sword energy suddenly changed directions and landed directly on the Celestial Sealing Stamp.</span></p>

Under the impact of the sword energy, the Celestial Sealing Stamp was forced back and Wang Lin was forced back with it. Only after he retreated 100 feet was he able to slow down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yao family’s third generation Yao Changdong!” After the ray of light dissapeared, a young man dressed in white looked proudly at Wang Lin. Under his feet was a 30-foot-long sword!</span></p>

If you had met another member of my Yao family, they may have accepted your pleads for forgiveness. However, before I, Yao Changdong, your begging is useless!” Yao Changdong looked extremely proud and thought,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have to finish this before Yao Bingyun gets here. Otherwise, the credit will be stolen by that cold woman!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s expression was calm and eyes were cold. He had already noticed that the cultivators of the Allheaven Star System all had a high sense of pride. This kind of pride was formed by the cultivation family model here. This was very different from all the fighting and scheming in the Alliance Star System.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin nodded slightly as he clasped his hands as if he was about to speak. However, at this moment, essence origin energy came out of his mouth to form an illusory sword that rushed toward Yao Changdong with extreme speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, Wang Lin took a step forward and disappeared into the void.</span></p>

Yao Changdong’s eyes lit up and he let out a cold snort. His right hand formed a seal and pressed forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A flash of green light came from his hand and it turned into a skull that attempted to devour the sword. Just as he rose his right hand, a ripple appeared behind him and Wang Lin stepped out. Wang Lin’s two fingers pressed down. He didn’t even look at the result and disappeared once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yao Changdong’s expression became gloomy. The moment Wang Lin appeared, he suddenly turned around and two rays of light shot out from his eyes. However, the two lights didn’t hit Wang Lin and flew through the void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just at this moment, the Celestial Sealing Stamp suddenly began to rotate, and it smashed toward Yao Changdong with immense pressure.</span></p>

The endless golden runes rushed toward Yao Changdong to seal him.</span></p>

Yao Changdong quickly turned but still missed.</span></p>

Although Wang Lin’s attacks weren’t too strong for him, he still had to pay attention. Everytime Wang Lin appeared, he would have to react immediately.</span></p>

This kind of strange method of fighting made him very frustrated. Although Yao Changdong hadn’t been in a lot of fights, the number was absolutely not little, but never had he had a fight like this.</span></p>

He had to constantly be on guard and could never take the initiative to attack.</span></p>

His hand formed a seal and the large sword under him emitted powerful sword intent. The large sword split into 19 smaller swords that began to rotate to form a strange sword array. Then the sword array suddenly charged out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the 19 swords charged out, dense origin energy spread out from the sword array, creating a storm. The sword formation spun around Yao Changdong, and the origin energy within the area began to twist and Wang Lin appeared 1,000 feet away. Wang Lin’s eyes were cold as he stared ahead.</span></p>

At the same time, more golden runes charged out even faster through the vortex formed by the sword array.</span></p>

However, just at this moment, Ta Shan appeared next to him and began a bombardment of punches.</span></p>

Xu Liguo had already returned to the sword. Wang Lin raised the celestial sword and the origin energy inside his body surged and mercilessly chopped down. One time, two times, three times… ten times… twenty times!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Twenty Heavenly Chops consumed most of Wang Lin’s origin energy. However, they instantly condensed into a huge ray of sword energy and flew out.</span></p>

Ta Shan’s face immediately became pale, but he didn’t retreat and instead threw another punch.</span></p>
