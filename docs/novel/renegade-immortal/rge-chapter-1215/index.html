It was as if the collapse of the world couldn’t attract his attention at all. The rumbles echoed for a long time before Wang Lin raised his head. Tears still flowed down from his face, but his eyes were filled with clarity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the Seven-Colored Realm… You’ve forced me to to remember the painful past. I want you to pay the price of death!” Wang Lin’s voice was low, but every word contained monstrous killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment his voice echoed, the rumbling became even more intense. The sky was torn open and the blue sky was no longer there. Instead, it was replaced by the sky of the Seven-Colored Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The earth trembled and collapsed layer by layer. Finally, it became a ruined land burned by fire. It was the land of the Seven-Colored Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The white-haired old man’s chest was stained with blood, and there was still blood flowing out from the corner of his mouth. His eyes were blurry; they were filled with disbelief and shock! In truth, the moment he saw the Heaven Defying Bead in Wang Lin’s memories, his dao spell collapsed and his vitality was extinguished. The shock he felt was like millions of bolts of thunder exploding in his ears. It filled him with fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, when the dao spell was collapsing, he saw Wang Lin’s Ji Realm being born. This caused him to cough out blood and he became extremely weak. He almost lost the ability to think as he lost his wits. This became a battle of his dao spell against the Ji Realm, the dao spell against the Heaven Defying Bead. He had no chance of victory!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin raised his head, and the moment he uttered those words filled with killing intent, he charged out like lightning toward the old man. His fingers formed a sword and pointed directly to between the old man’s eyebrows!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s body trembled and blood sprayed out from the back of his head as his skull shattered. Wang Lin didn’t stop here and pointed six times in a row!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The popping sounds were earth shattering. The old man’s arm collapsed, his legs collapsed, and in the blink of an eye, his body turned into a mist of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside the fog, the old man’s origin soul screamed and was surrounded by a seven-colored glow as he escaped into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin was filled with killing intent as he chased after him. While he chased, he pointed at the old man, and every time he did so, the seven-colored light would tremble. The old man’s origin soul let out miserable screams and became weaker and weaker.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He chased closely behind the old man. It had been a long time since he wanted to kill anyone this much. Anyone who made him recall his memories had touched his bottom line and had to die!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he chased, the old man surrounded by the seven-colored light charged for the mountain. He was filled with panic and continued to scream in his heart.</span></p>

The seven-colored light suddenly paused. At this moment, Wang Lin charged in and his two fingers pierce through the seven-colored light, landing directly on the old man’s origin soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a bang, the old man’s origin soul was about to collapse. However, he was, after all, a late stage Nirvana Shatterer cultivator. He was seriously injured but not dead as he struggled to escape even faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While pursuing, Wang Lin let out a roar at the sky and the blue flame appeared in his left eye. The seal trembled, but in the end it collapsed before the blue flame!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The seal dissipated and Wang Lin was surrounded by a sea of fire. He pointed forward and the monstrous flames charged at the the seven-colored light surrounding the old man’s origin soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Miserable screams echoed. This time the white-haired old man’s origin soul was extremely weak. Four of the seven colors around him dissipated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them were both moving very fast, but the distance between them was getting smaller and smaller!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just at this moment, the lightning mark appeared in his right eye. There was also a seal on it, but it only struggled for a few breaths before it collapsed. Without the seal, thunder rushed out and danced within the fire!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumbles shook the heavens and earth as the endless thunderbolts whistled through the fire. They all charged at the old man under Wang Lin’s command!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A thunderous rumble echoed and the remaining three colors around the old man collapsed into specks of light. Without the seven-colored light protecting him, the old man’s origin soul was exposed to the blue fire and thunder!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No!! Sovereign, save me!!” The old man’s expression was filled with the fear of death as he let out a roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, he had already reached the mountain deep within the Seven-Colored Realm. However, just as he got close, Wang Lin let out a roar and the blue fire immediately shot out and surrounded his origin soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From afar, it was impossible to see the old man’s figure. The thing that could be seen was a sea of blue fire. Thunder gathered from all directions as if all the thunder in the world was congregating toward the old man’s origin soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment the thunder gathered, all the fire in the world also gathered toward the trapped old man.</span></p>

All the fire in the world suddenly gathered at one point. The thunder gathered as well, forming a combined attack of fire and thunder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were two circles contracting. One was the sea of blue fire and the other was all the thunder in the world. The moment the two circles overlapped into one point, the world trembled!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A heaven-shaking rumble replaced all sound, causing the Seven-Colored Realm to collapse once more!</span></p>

A pillar of blue fire shot directly into the sky as if it was going to pierce the heavens! Countless thunderbolts filled the inside and outside of this fire pillar, forming a pillar of thunder that overlapped with the pillar of fire and also pierced the heavens!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene could be clearly seen from anywhere within the Seven-Colored Realm!</span></p>
