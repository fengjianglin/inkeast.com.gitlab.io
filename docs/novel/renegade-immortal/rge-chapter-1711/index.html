 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1711 - Ancient Dao Defying</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fifth drop, sixth drop… until the ninth drop of blood flew out from the vortex and shot toward Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin’s eyes shined brightly as he stared at the drops of blood that were flying toward him. He didn’t dodge and allowed the five drops of blood to land between his eyebrows. They seemed to penetrate through his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the fifth drop of blood fused, a thunderous rumble came from Wang Lin’s body and a powerful force erupted from the blood. Wang Lin couldn’t help but take a few steps back, his eyes shining brightly. That powerful feeling made him clench his fists.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the sixth drop of blood followed shortly after and entered Wang Lin. Thunderous rumbles echoed and all the blood in his body seemed to boil. He rapidly absorbed the bloodline force inside this drop of blood. It flowed through his entire body, and when it entered his heart, his heartbeat was like a roaring bolt of thunder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He retreated once more and let out a roar at the sky. Intense pain came from his body. This pain was countless times stronger than the fusion of the previous four drops of blood. It was as if his body was being torn apart and new flesh and blood were growing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shortly after, the seventh drop arrived, and the moment it entered the spot between Wang Lin’s eyebrows, his expression became twisted. The veins on his body swelled and the speed of his blood flow reached a limit. Wang Lin’s body began to move strangely, and as the blood flowed through his body, his bones also gave off a red light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ancient bloodline forced inside his body rapidly increased. It went from very thin to extremely pure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The members of the ancient clan were same as the celestials. The stronger their bloodline, the more noble their identity and the more power they could display.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fusion of seven drops of blood made Wang Lin’s bloodline second only to the Ancient Dao Emperor. It has to be known that the emperor was a descendant of the Ancient Emperor and therefore held the Ancient Ancestor’s bloodline. As a result, after obtaining six drops of blood, he became the Ancient Dao Emperor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wang Lin didn’t have any ancient one bloodline and hadn’t received recognition yet. Even though this was the case, the bloodline formed by seven drops of blood could compare to the emperor, who already had the bloodline and had obtained six drops of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The difference between the two was a difference in essence, like that of an emperor and an ordinary citizen. However, this difference wasn’t immutable, and the eighth drop of blood flew toward Wang Lin. The moment it fused with him, the bloodline became even more pure and the rumbles from his body became more intense. Bursts of pain came from Wang Lin’s bone marrow, causing him to continue to retreat and tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ancient bloodline was the same as the celestial bloodline, it changed the bone marrow! Once the bone marrow was changed, the blood one produced would change and the power of the bloodline would be born!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was difficult to change the bone marrow from within, so external force was needed to slowly change it. This external force was the drops of blood that had entered Wang Lin’s body. As they flowed through his body, they were rapidly changing his bone marrow! Wang Lin’s bloodline had gone from ordinary to noble, from a mess to authentic!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fusion of eight drops of blood didn’t make Wang Lin’s blood become pure enough to reach the same level as the emperor, but it was infinitely close, just a trace more! This gap was crossed and surpassed once the ninth drop fused!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nine drops of blood fused with Wang Lin’s bones and changed his bone marrow completely. He now had a bloodline that was even more pure than the emperor’s. In terms of bloodline, Wang Lin had the most pure blood among the Dao clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was not over yet. The appearance of the Soul Blood caused the surroundings to be bathed in a purple light. This purple blood had a strange force, and the moment it appeared, it captured Wang Lin’s full attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked at the purple drop of blood. A sense of longing from his blood filled his body. The purple blood released a monstrous purple light and imprinted itself between Wang Lin’s eyebrows!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It didn’t fuse with his blood or bloodline; this drop of blood fused with Wang Lin’s soul!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The purity his bloodline would allow Wang Lin to erupt with ancient power, but it wouldn’t change his soul. In the end, his soul would still be that of a member of the Ancient Dao clan. However, this Soul Blood could change Wang Lin’s soul, allow his soul to be above the others of the Dao clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Allow him to truly become an existence more noble than that emperor! It would be as if he had become the Ancient Ancestor’s fourth son!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment the drop of Soul Blood flew over, Wang Lin was stunned and his eyes were filled with confusion. His body moved back on its own until he landed on the altar. He leaned against Ye Mo’s arm and lied there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The vortex slowly dissipated and soon disappeared without a trace. Everything returned to normal, as if nothing had happened. If there was any difference, then it was quiet. It was so terrifyingly quiet that there was not the slightest bit of sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the fierce beasts had hidden themselves. They trembled and didn’t dare to make a sound. There seemed to be a pressure spreading out in this strange silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin was unconscious. If he didn’t wake up, this place would remain quiet for tens of thousands of years. If he didn’t wake up, no sound would appear here. This pressure came from his body and spread out across the surrounding area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin’s original body was asleep and his avatar was floating outside the altar. His avatar sat there with its eyes closed and remained motionless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Wang Lin was asleep, he had a dream. This dream was different from the dream dao; it wasn’t clear and very blurry. In this dream, Wang Lin saw a person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an ordinary-looking man. His body was extremely large and the heavens and earth seemed to be below his feet. He stood there, looking over the world with a hint of contempt.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If I want this sky to collapse, it will collapse. If I want this earth to break, it will break! If I want a being to die, no one would dare to stop me. If I want no celestials to remain alive, who would dare to save them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m an ancient one. I was born before the heavens and earth and survived the beginning of the world. However, before me, there were celestials. The celestials wanted to make me their slave, so let me destroy the celestials!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If I fail, then all my future generations will become enemies of the celestials and vow to rid the world of celestials!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But will I lose? I’ll never lose!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nine drops of Soul Blood I give to my three sons. You all take command of my ancient people. Wait for my reincarnation, wait for my heir to appear...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Obeying means being a mortal. Defying means being a celestial. Defying the celestials means becoming an ancient one!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This dream slowly come to an end as the ordinary-looking man spoke those shocking words. Even after Wang Lin opened his eyes, those words still echoed in his ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The eight ancient god stars between Wang Lin’s eyebrows revealed a hint of a purple glow and slowed rotated. The ancient devil and ancient demon stars in his eyes also rotated and gave off a faint hint of purple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This purple came from that Soul Blood, it came from Wang Lin’s ancient one soul!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He slowly sat up and looked at the space before him. After pondering for a long time, a powerful aura that looked down upon the world came from his body. This aura disrespected heavens and the earth. Even if the heavens and earth decay, I won’t decay! Even if the world withers, I won’t wither!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This aura belonged to the defying nature of the ancient ones!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Wang Lin was vastly different from before!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he sat on the altar, his gaze swept past his surroundings. His gaze moved past his avatar and eventually landed on Ye Mo’s giant arm. His eyes shined brightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This arm contained a powerful force. This power seemed to be able to tear open the world. This was Ancient Dao Ye Mo’s most powerful force!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Staring at this arm, Wang Lin slowly raised his right hand and pressed down. The moment he pressed down, his 24 stars rotated and a burst of purple light surrounded him. This purple light entered Ye Mo’s arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In an instant, the giant arm trembled and seemed like it was going to struggle and resist. Although Wang Lin had obtained Ye Mo’s inheritance, it wasn’t perfect. If he wanted to merge with the arm, there would be some difficulties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this was only difficult for Wang Lin before he went through the Ancient Race Heavenly Blood calamity. Now that he had obtained nine drops of blood and the drop of Soul Blood, it was simply insignificant to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ye Mo, give this arm to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin spoke slowly. It was as if he was muttering to himself, but also as if he was speaking to the dead Ye Mo. His voice was calm, and as he spoke, the purple light from the 24 stars became even stronger. It spread out an aura that would frighten Ye Mo if he was alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This aura entered Wang Lin’s right hand and he pressed down on the arm once more. There was a thunderous rumble and the arm stopped struggling. The arm slowly shrank until it integrated with Wang Lin’s right hand, causing his right hand to suddenly become very different!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin’s right hand was extremely rough compared to his left arm and was covered in countless complicated runes.
