She closed her eyes, but there were no tears.</span></p>

Her origin soul created a thread of divine sense that moved toward the cultivation planet that had already been evacuated.</span></p>

Her face was pale as she clenched her teeth and her divine sense pulled!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xi Zifeng coughed out blood. The divine sense that had split off from her origin soul wasn’t able to bear the rebound force, and it began to tear down the middle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her face was deathly pale and she retreated hundreds of feet. Her origin soul flew out once more to form the thread of divine sense. The thread flew toward the planet and pulled once more!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The intense rumble echoed and the planet showed signs of changing trajectory. However, the rebound force was even more intense than before. As the thunderous rumbles echoed, Xi Zifeng’s divine sense collapsed once more!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This collapse caused Xi Zifeng’s divine sense to collapse layer by layer, and her origin soul was knocked back into her body. She coughed out blood as her body trembled, and she looked like she couldn’t even stand. Her face was ashen and her eyes became dim.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Useless trash!” With a cold snort, the Thunder Celestial Temple messenger flew past Xi Zifeng and waved his sleeves. His origin soul formed a thread of divine sense and connected to the planet. With a roar, he pulled the planet out from the trajectory it had been on for countless years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle-aged man’s hand reached out as if he was holding onto the planet, and he roared, “Move the planet!”</span></p>

They all pulled at the same time to move the planet.</span></p>

He took out a bottle of pills and quickly passed it to Xi Zifeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fellow Cultivator Xi Zi, this old man was also brought out of the Thunder Celestial Realm by him back then…” the old man whispered as he walked past Xi Zifeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xi Zifeng silently took the pills and revealed gratitude. The bottle contained precious pills that could help speed up her recovery. Over the past 800 years, her family and friends had helped her less than those people that were saved by Wang Lin in the Thunder Celestial Realm. If not for them, Xi Zifeng’s path would have been even more difficult.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you standing there for? Come here and move this planet. A waste is a waste; you had a good face, but then you had to destroy it. If you had agreed to my request, you wouldn’t have ended up like you are today!” The middle-aged man from the Thunder Celestial Temple sneered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man who had given her the pills before couldn’t hold back anymore, and he retorted, “Lord Messenger, Fellow Cultivator Xi Zi has also joined the Thunder Celestial Temple. Although her cultivation is lacking, she has the same status as us. She has already shaken a number of planets off their trajectory and is still injured. Why do you force her to continue? Let her recover a bit!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle-aged man’s eyes lit up and he looked at the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This messenger doesn’t need you to point out the things I do!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man was only at the early stage of Nirvana Scryer, so he felt a huge pressure from the middle-aged man that was staring at him. However, the old man clenched his teeth and sneered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You also know that Fellow Cultivator Xi Zi loved him. When he was around, did you dare to be like this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the old man spoke, the middle-aged man revealed a fierce gaze and his mind trembled. He naturally knew who that person was. He still remember everything that happened during the competition. Back then, that person was only at the Corporeal Yang, but he was still an existence he looked up to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t dare to show any disrespect before that person. That person had risen up during the war with the Alliance. That person had become famous in both Allheaven and the Alliance, and the middle-aged man had to admit that he was but an ant before that person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He is long gone, he could even be dead…” Before the middle-aged man finished speaking, the old man interrupted him with a sneer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What if he comes back?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sentence caused the middle-aged man to silently ponder. After a long time, he let out a cold snort and waved his hand. He shouted, “You sure have a lot of words. You and Xi Zifeng, go move that planet!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man looked at the middle-aged man and no longer spoke. He joined the cultivators that were moving the planet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xi Zifeng still silently pondered. She gave up healing and moved forward. She clenched her teeth and split a thread of her origin soul into a silver thread to attach to the planet. She slowly moved with the crowd, pulling the planet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle-aged man was in the front and his expression was gloomy. He was a bit restless from the old man’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What if he comes back…” These words lingered in his ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A line of nearly 100 people slowly flew forward, pulling the planet with them. They gradually went further and further away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, shortly after, a white figure appeared before them. He had a head of white hair that fluttered as he slowly moved forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he looked slow, every step he took crossed an immeasurable distance. In just a few steps, the white figure closed in, and an almost suffocating aura spread out. A moment later, this pressure disappeared and the white figure disappeared before everyone’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of this happened in a flash; it was so fast that no one could react. They felt like it was a mere illusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone trembled and terror filled their eyes. The middle-aged man in front was startled for a moment and was filled with shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, before they could awaken from their shock, they heard a soft exclamation that echoed through space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sound entered the ears of everyone and shook their minds. Their expressions changed and they quickly retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xi Zifeng trembled. Although that voice was soft, it was enough to cause her to collapse. Her mind trembled violently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She subconsciously wanted to look up, but she held herself back and instead lowered her head even more. She backed up to hide inside the crowd of cultivators. An inexplicable emotion filled her body, and she didn’t want to be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the soft exclamation echoed, the white figure that had disappeared reappeared before them and his gaze swept toward them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under this gaze, no one could clearly see this figure. It was as if this figure was a radiant sun, so no one dared to look at it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle-aged man at the front trembled. Under that light, it was as if everything inside him had stopped. Even his origin soul was suppressed inside his body and he didn’t dare to move an inch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if this gaze had become solid and was holding his neck and origin soul. It felt like this person only needed one thought for his body to explode and his origin soul to be erased!</span></p>

His body became soft and he unexpectedly knelt down. His voice trembled as if he wanted to say something.</span></p>

The cultivators before him disappeared from his vision, leaving only the one figure hiding with her head lowered. A trembling woman with a pale face… Even though she had her head lowered, he could clearly see the hideous scars on her face. Wang Lin silently pondered.</span></p>

In these 800 years, she thought her tears had dried up and could not flow anymore. However, today, at this moment, two streams of tears flowed down her cheeks. However, they didn’t go down a straight line but entered the gully-like scars on her face and changed directions… She wanted to hide, she didn’t want this person to see her. It was a very complicated emotion, and she was very different from the past her… She would rather die alone from old age than being seen in such a sorry state. She didn’t want him to see her ugly face… Tears continued to flow as she lowered her head even more and subconsciously retreated more and more… To hide among the people, to hide at the end of the world, to hide in a place where no one could see her, where she silently touch her own memories… silently wipe away the tears she had forgotten.</span></p>

The face that had slowly become old and injured was staring at him.</span></p>

The middle-aged man in front lost all traces of blood on his face and his heart seemed to stop beating. Even his origin soul seemed to collapse, and he lost his wits from hearing that name!</span></p>
