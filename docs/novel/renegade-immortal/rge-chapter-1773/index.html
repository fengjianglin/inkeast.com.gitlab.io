 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1773 - Struggle of the Trapped Beast!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin vaguely guessed Yun Yifeng’s thoughts. This person was very cunning, so he wouldn’t do things for no reason. However, Wang Lin had no time to pay attention to it. He raised his right hand and the golden print landed in his grasp. A cold feeling cycled through Wang Lin, and he felt a connection with the golden print.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This item had just been created from the void and had no owner. Wang Lin’s cultivation was imprinted in it and he became this treasure’s first owner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This golden print gave off a powerful aura and sealed the Sovereign’ god destruction dao spell. This spell had been used by the Sovereign at full power, so its strength was the same as the Sovereign using the spell himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And due to it being created by Xuan Luo, it contained a hint of the Nine Suns’ power. As a result, this treasure was indestructible!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sovereign was terrified as Wang Lin devoured the print and began refining it in his origin soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Luo stood before Wang Lin. He looked at Wang Lin profoundly and then suddenly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the fear in the Sovereign’s heart reached a limit. He gave up on killing Wang Lin and retreated without hesitation. He was scared out of his mind, and his mind was buzzing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was very smart and cunning, but he could have never expected Xuan Luo to be here. He believed that his master’s big brother had found this place!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking about how terrifying his master’s big brother was, the Sovereign was soaked in cold sweat. He almost lost his wits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he started retreating, there was a flash of coldness in Wang Lin’s eyes. He stood up and took a step forward. Thunderous rumbles echoed as he chased after the Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Back then, you tried to kill me with the life and death calamity. Today, I’ll give you a life and death calamity as well! Tuo Sen, you have already arrived. Do you want to fight me or help me fight this person!?” Wang Lin’s voice echoed as he chased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as his voice echoed, a laugh echoed across the world. The world distorted behind the Sovereign and a giant figure appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His body was half naked and gave off an ancient aura. It also gave off an arrogant aura. It was Tuo Sen!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When his body appeared, his right hand formed a seal and punched toward the Sovereign. With this punch, the world rumbled. It was as if this punch had absorbed all the power here, and it landed on the Sovereign’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sovereign suddenly turned around. His hands formed a seal and sunlight surrounded his body. He seemed to turn into a sun when he collided with the punch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thunderous rumbles echoed. The Sovereign let out a muffled groan and retreated several steps. Tuo Sen’s body also trembled, and he retreated 1,000 feet. He revealed a fierce smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Satisfying! Wang Lin, don’t fight with spells like these celestials; our clan must fight with our powerful bodies. Break the world and battle the celestials!” As Tuo Sen spoke, popping sounds echoed from his body. His body expanded to more than tens of thousands of feet tall, but he didn’t stop; he continued to expand. Soon, a giant ancient god hundreds of thousands of feet tall appeared in the second to last layer of the Ancient Tomb!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin’s eyes narrowed and he revealed a smile. Rumbles came from his body, and for the first time, he completely expanded his body. Wang Lin’s body instantly grew until he was the same size as Tuo Sen!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From afar, the two giants looked like two mountains sealing the Sovereign’s path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, Yun Yifeng’s eyes flashed. He knew that the mysterious Xuan Luo was around, so he moved decisively. His hands formed a seal and his right hand pointed at the sky. There was a flash of purple light, and the purple light instantly formed a purple monkey. The monkey revealed a vicious gaze as it pounced toward the Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wang Lin has no chance of failing in the core of the cave. My plan won’t go wrong!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was also the third concubine, Tang Shan. She clenched her teeth and the golden bead on her wrist shone. Golden doors appeared and overlapped with each other. The seven golden doors fused into one. Golden light shined as the door transformed into a golden dragon that rushed toward the Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four of them attacked at the same time, and their power was amazing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin and Tuo Sen each formed a fist,and their punches smashed down like two giant meteors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sovereign’s face was deathly pale and he had no will to battle. He was completely shaken by what had happened to the golden print. He suspected his master’s big brother was hiding around here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This thought made him tremble and made it impossible for him to use his full strength. The only thought in his mind was to escape. As Wang Lin and Tuo Sen’s fists descended, the Sovereign let out a roar as if he wanted to release all the fear in his body. He moved his hand as if he was holding two runs and collided with Wang Lin and Tuo Sen’s punches.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thunderous rumbles echoed across the world. Tuo Sen’s arm trembled and he retreated several steps. Wang Lin also trembled and retreated a few steps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, Yun Yifeng’s spell that formed the monkey arrived, and it pounced on the Sovereign. It turned into purple gas and entered the Sovereign’s body. The shadow of a monkey appeared between the Sovereign’s eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sovereign trembled. Wang Lin and Tuo Sen’s attacks had already caused his blood to boil. Then Yun Yifeng’s spell from the Immortal Astral Continent made it feel like his body was being torn apart. Then Tang Shan’s golden dragon smashed into the Sovereign’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sovereign turned around and smashed the golden dragon with his right hand. As the golden dragon collapsed, the Sovereign coughed out a mouthful of blood for the first time. His expression became dim and the fear in his eyes became even stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Lin and Tuo Sen’s ancient god power was something the Sovereign’ dreaded. However, the difference between their cultivation levels were simply too wide. Although they were difficult to deal with, they had also paid a big price to seriously injure him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What he feared the most was what had happened to the golden print. He had a feeling that there was a fifth pair of eyes calmly looking at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This feeling was very strong and almost made him go crazy. He also felt Dao Master Blue Dream’s aura closing in. If Blue Dream arrived, he would be in danger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After coughing out blood, the Sovereign’s eyes were bloodshot. He suddenly looked up and ripples echoed under his feet as he tried to leave. However, at this moment, Wang Lin’s right hand reached toward the void and he opened his storage stpage. A dozen Ancient Leaves flew out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the ghostly light flickered, these dozen Ancient Leaves rushed toward the Sovereign and sealed his path of retreat!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Sovereign was sealed, there was a flash of killing inside Wang Lin’s eyes and he walked forward. He raised his hand to use his strongest spell, Heaven Ripping. The world was torn open and the rift flew toward the Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rift closed in on the Sovereign in an instant. The Sovereign formed a seal and slammed his hand toward the rift.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, Tuo Sen’s body moved and an overlapping shadow appeared. In a flash, the arrogant aura around him disappeared and was replaced by calmness and steadiness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was as if he had become another person, as if he had become the awakened Tu Si!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To be more accurate, the person that appeared was Tu Si. He raised his right hand and reached toward the void. Thunderous rumbles echoed and a giant spear appeared in his hand. Grabbing the spear, he stabbed toward the Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yun Yifeng and Tang Shan attacked once more. They all used their most powerful spells.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thunderous rumbles echoed. Yun Yifeng coughed out blood and was knocked into the ground. Blood started flowing from the corner of Tang Shan’s mouth. She staggered back more than 10,000 feet, looking extremely weak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tu Si’s spear was caught by the Sovereign. The Sovereign’s expression was fierce as his right palm slammed toward Tu Si.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tu Si’s body trembled and he retreated 1,000 feet, but he was not injured!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After pushing back Tu Si, the Sovereign turned around. At this moment, the Heaven Ripping rift closed in and was less than 10 feet away. The Sovereign’s hair was a mess and he bit his tongue without hesitation to spit out some of his essence blood. This blood was golden, and it penetrated the rift toward Wang Lin.</span></p>
