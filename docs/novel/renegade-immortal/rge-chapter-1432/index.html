As early as 1,200 years ago, I heard of your name and learned that the only reason you cultivate is to bring your wife back!” The Sovereign’s voice was weak as it slowly floated among the stars, but they were like heavy hammers slamming on Wang Lin’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this impact turned into waves that surged in Wang Lin’s brain, causing him to tune out the Sovereign’s voice. Only the last four words were like a bolt of lightning that tore open his flesh and rushed into his soul!</span></p>

You probably don’t believe my words; you presume that since I’m seriously injured, how can I achieve this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This matter is indeed extremely difficult; even if I wasn’t injured, I wouldn’t have the ability to bring your wife back. However, my teacher is someone on par with the Ancient Celestial Sovereign. He is even famous in the ancient world!</span></p>

He was speechless for a while. He was already seriously injured and was holding on with just one breath. Now that he couldn’t hold that breath anymore, his body trembled and he coughed out blood.</span></p>

His struggle had never been this intense. Neither Dao Master Blue Dream’s proposal nor the first generation Vermillion Bird’s words could compare! None of them had directly struck at Wang Lin’s most vulnerable spot in his heart!</span></p>

Right now there was hope, and even if it was just a glimmer, it weighed heavily in his heart. He struggled like crazy.</span></p>

There was a voice frantically screaming in his mind, shaking his body!</span></p>

Wang Lin, haven’t you been cultivating all your life just for her?”</span></p>

Isn’t reuniting your family your biggest dream?”</span></p>

You’re not going to become the Sovereign’s slave, you’ll just have to listen to all his orders. Compare your personal freedom to Wan Er’s life; which is more important?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Take his offer, become the second Master Simo and become a slave to the Sovereign. Betray the Inner Realm. Break off from Situ Nan, Qing Shui, and everyone you knew in the Inner Realm. From now on, they’re your enemies!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This voice became louder and louder until it become a heaven-shaking roar in Wang Lin’s mind. His face turned pale and he subconsciously took a few steps back. Right now his eyes were bloodshot, he was trembling, and his mind was on the verge of collapse. The struggle to make a choice had turned into a flood that was drowning him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If one day the Sovereign asks me to kill Situ… what would I do…. If one day the Sovereign asked me to kill Qing Shui… what would I do… If one day the Sovereign asked me to slaughter my way back into the Inner Realm, how could I face all those familiar faces… Zhou Yi, Zhou Ru, Big Head, everyone… If one day the Sovereign orders me to harm the second generation Vermillion Bird… will I be able to do it…”</span></p>

His heart was being ripped in half due to this decision, and the pain was something words couldn’t describe at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wan Er was his everything and his one weakness. He wouldn’t allow anyone to hurt her. In order to resurrect Wan Er, Wang Lin could give up many things. In order to resurrect Wan Er, he could give up his vitality. Right now he was willing to give up his life!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there were some things that were even more important than his life! It was just that in life, there were emotions beside love that he couldn’t cut off!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“From now on, I’ll hand the Soul Refining Sect to you…” On planet Suzaku, the Soul Refining Sect’s master, Dun Tian, had placed the Soul Refining Sect’s treasure in his hands after passing away. After placing the inheritance of the Soul Refining Sect on his shoulders, Dun Tian closed his eyes, smiling… Situ Nan had given up the chance to take away the Heaven Defying Bead and had accompanied Wang Lin for hundreds of years. He had taught Wang Lin cultivation from Wang Lin’s youth. A teacher, a father, a brother, and also a friend… If there was no Situ, there would be no Wang Lin! Wang Lin once said something about Situ that represented all the gratitude he felt toward Situ!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I, Wang Lin, would never kneel to the heavens, only in respect for Situ!”</span></p>

He had given Wang Lin a fortune that had allowed Wang Lin to avoid death! Zhou Yi was obsessed with Qing Shuang. If Wang Lin chose to follow the Sovereign, there would surely be a tragic battle between them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I, Zhou Yi, only want to do one thing in my life: to accompany Qing Shuang until the end of time…”</span></p>

Once he decided that Wang Lin was a cross generation disciple of Bai Fang, he was willing to do anything to make sure no one harmed Wang Lin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since he is my junior brother, no one can harm him. If you hurt one of his fingers, I will seek your life!”</span></p>

If he found out that the junior brother he once protected had become the slave of the cause of his sorrow, how would he feel… There was also the fifth generation Vermillion Bird. He was clearly at the end of his lifespan, but he was still willing to help Wang Lin recover. He had even handed the Vermillion Bird Divine Sect to Wang Lin. His kind gaze would forever linger in Wang Lin’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This old man, Lu Yun, has lived his entire life for the Vermillion Bird Divine Sect… Even though &nbsp;I will soon die, I can now die with a smile… You’re excellent, take care of the Vermillion Bird Divine Sect for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old Vermillion Bird Divine Emperor’s dying wish was for Wang Lin to take care of the sect. Facing the kindness Wang Lin had received, he couldn’t face the dead Divine Emperor’s anger and disappointed gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second generation Vermillion Bird had only known Wang Lin for a few days. His hearty laughter, gratified expression, look of admiration, and kindness toward Wang Lin came to mind. He had fished up the dragon to gift its blood to Wang Lin and had tried to save him many times during moments of danger in the trials. He had even roared at the first generation Vermillion Bird in the Heaven Trial!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second generation Vermillion Bird had gifted him the method to control the dragon and the Ancient Soul Restriction. Also, before Wang Lin left, the second generation Vermillion Bird had clearly disobey the first generation Vermillion Bird’s order and had to bear an unknown price to teach Wang Lin the Vermillion Bird Clan’s strongest spell, the Realm Burning Ancient Umbrella!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little fellow, don’t forget that the next time we meet, you have to choose the seventh generation for this old man. Be sure to select a child with determination! You look rather cold, but even you were naughty at some point. Unfortunate, unfortunate. Ah, what’s so good about duo cultivation, this old man really doesn’t understand…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were still a lot of people, a lot of people… How could Wang Lin cut them all off with one choice… Master Simo’s memory filled Wang Lin’s mind. When he saw Master Simo’s life, he felt like he was watching his own memories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Master Simo today was Wang Lin’s future!</span></p>
