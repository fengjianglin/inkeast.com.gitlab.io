There were faint lines on his body, but they were not obvious. An extremely powerful aura was coming from his body and filling the stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As this aura spread out, it set off a huge wave on the rank 6 cultivation planet. Countless cultivators awakened from their cultivation and felt their souls shake.</span></p>

Earlier, when he saw the ripples under Wang Lin’s feet, his pupils shrank and he was greatly shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spatial Bending!</span></p>

It has to be said that very few cultivators he knew could use this spell. It was even more rare for people at the same cultivation level as him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could this not surprise him?

Even when he completely distorted the origin energy in the area, he still couldn’t find Xu Mu.</span></p>

All his killing intent and rage were now redirected to the big-headed boy. He quickly charged toward the big-headed boy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You master has fled, so let’s start with you then!” Yu Fei was extremely angry in his heart, and this angry was very depressing. He was a mid stage Nirvana Scryer cultivator who let an early stage Nirvana Scryer cultivator escape, and he couldn’t even pursue. He hadn’t experienced this kind of thing in a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The big-headed boy was fighting Yu Fen’s avatar when his scalp felt numb and he almost lost his wits. He couldn’t help but scold Wang Lin as he retreated and attempted to escape.</span></p>

Using his overwhelming mid stage Nirvana Scryer cultivation, he pointed with his finger. The five blood swords immediately shot toward the big-headed boy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die for me!” As Yu Fei shouted, the five blood swords charge forward like five early stage Nirvana Scryer cultivators. Adding the one from before, it was like six Nirvana Scryer cultivators attacking the big-headed boy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could the big-headed boy resist with his current cultivation?</span></p>

He was about to explode his origin soul. No matter what, he had to destroy an avatar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just at this moment of life and death, a cold voice came from behind the big-headed boy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is my miracle!” As the cold voice echoed, the big-headed boy felt his body being grabbed and tossed back by someone, allowing him to escape danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin walked out from the void. His expression was cold as he faced the six blood swords, and he threw a punch. The power behind this punch was even stronger than Ta Shan’s punches. The roar that came from the fist felt like it was going to shatter space!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This caused a series of sonic booms, and the space before Wang Lin fragmented. Cold air came out from the countless cracks, but they had no effect on Wang Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If space was like this, then there was no need to talk about the six blood swords. Wang Lin’s fist landed directly on one of the flying swords. The sword trembled and immediately collapsed with a bang. The fragments were pushed back and then they turned into an avatar that coughed out blood. His eyes were filled with terror and he retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Lin’s expression was cold and gave off endless coldness, as if he was a piece of never-melting ice. This Yu Fei’s avatars were at the early stage of Nirvana Scryer, and Yu Fei’s real body was at the mid stage of Nirvana Scryer. With them together, it would be very difficult for Wang Lin to kill Yu Fei, and even if he won, the price would be very high. Thus, the best choice was for Wang Lin to fuse with his original body. He took a step and arrived next to the avatar that coughed out blood before the other five could even react. Without any hesitation, Wang Lin threw a punch!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a loud bang; it was as if space itself was trembling. The avatar coughed out more blood and numerous clouds of blood mist exploded from its body. After the avatar retreated 10 steps, it collapsed and was completely destroyed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Absolute slaughter!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After killing one avatar, Wang Lin turned around and walked toward the incoming five blood swords. All of this was done in an instant. Wang Lin was so fast that he left behind many afterimages. This time, his fist landed in the void. Cracking sounds could be heard while a huge crack appeared and tore through space like a dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of the blood swords flashed and shot toward Wang Lin. Wang Lin didn’t even look at it while his right hand reached out. The blood sword trembled and wanted to struggle, but it was caught by Wang Lin. He mercilessly crushed it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second blood sword collapsed with a bang and was about to escape, but countless lightning bolts gathered under Wang Lin’s gaze. Countless bolts of thunder smashed into the avatar and popping sounds came from its body. The avatar collapsed and died!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the remaining four blood swords closed in and suddenly landed on Wang Lin. There were sound of metals colliding as the swords hit Wang Lin’s body. A powerful rebound force came from Wang Lin, knocking the four swords back, and they trembled violently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene stunned the big-headed boy. When he looked at the both familiar and unfamiliar Wang Lin, there was only terror in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This… The flying swords couldn’t hurt his body!”</span></p>

For the first time, his expression changed, and it was a big change! Everything that happened was too fast and caught him unprepared. In almost the blink of an eye, two of his avatars had collapsed, and this set off a monstrous wave in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was about to charge out when Wang Lin suddenly turned around and let out a roar!</span></p>

It had been a very long time since the voice of the ancient god had existed in this world. Now that it suddenly appeared, it was as if the true voice that could split the heavens had appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before this roar of an ancient god, even the heavens’ thunder had to tremble, and the starry sky itself had to bow because he was an ancient god! Countless years ago, this world was filled with ancient gods!</span></p>

What is thunder before this roar!? This roar was filled with endless force, and it created a storm that swept the area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Fei had just lifted his feet when the ancient god roar hit him. A power that made his mind tremble suddenly charged at him. His mind was in shocked and he quickly retreated. It was as if he would be torn apart if he didn’t retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His face was pale. In his eyes, Wang Lin was like an angry ancient beast that gave off such a powerful aura that he had to retreat. The origin energy inside his body cycled rapidly without his control; it was as if it would immediately collapsed and he would die if it stopped!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, his ears buzzed and he was isolated from the world. He could only hear his own heartbeat rapidly accelerating in his ears.</span></p>

His eyes were filled with fear. This fear came from the soul, the fear toward the ancient gods!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the first time, Yu Fei felt fear. At the start, there was only a sliver of fear, but a moment later, it filled his mind.</span></p>

His mind trembled under the roar of the ancient god. He now had a celestial origin, so he was a celestial, but at this moment, he had the illusion that he was merely an ant.</span></p>

There was a will that roared in Lei Ji’s heart. It was like a servant that had met his true master. He couldn’t help but kneel and obediently listen to Wang Lin’s orders.</span></p>

The indescribable impact of the roar caused the world to change colors and space itself to collapse. Those four flying swords all exploded!</span></p>

Each of those four avatars had Nirvana Scryer cultivation, but the moment they appeared, they were hit by the impact of the roar of the ancient god once more.</span></p>

Ripples appeared under his feet and he disappeared. When he reappeared, he was next to Ta Shan, who was facing Yu Fei’s last avatar. The last avatar was also so shocked that it stopped attacking and was retreating, but how could it compare to Wang Lin? The moment Wang Lin appeared, his two fingers formed a sword and pressed down. Endless thunder came from all directions and the Yin and Yang fishes appeared as well. When his fingers landed, the last avatar exploded.</span></p>

Are you satisfied!?”</span></p>
