 <p><strong>AST 1402 - The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's Breakthrough, Qing Shui's Paragon Tribulation, Strength Increased Explosively</strong></p>
 <p>That ferocious aura was really astonishing. Qing Shui could still feel his heart palpitating even now.</p>
 <p>This aura was definitely one that only Immortal Demons at the False God realm could have. It made one gasp for breath. Qing Shui felt both astonished and excited.</p>
 <p>It had attained a breakthrough. He didn't need to think to know that. He had been hoping for such a long period of time that it would attain a breakthrough but it had shown no signs at all. However, it had unexpectedly attained a breakthrough today, miraculously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the huge Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant that was still flashing with blue lightning in the sky, occasionally letting out a domineering roar that was like a dragon's and also that of an elephant.</p>
 <p>At the same time, many people in the area of the continent's capital had felt this terrifying aura. This ancient aura made their souls tremble anxiously.</p>
 <p>It wasn't just Dancing Phoenix Continent's capital. There were even many experts from the Soaring Dragon Continent's capital and the Haohan Continent that had sensed this aura as well. However, with the exception of some people in the Dancing Phoenix Continent, the rest of the people from the different places all thought that another powerful demonic beast had successfully evolved. The feeling they experienced wasn't very strong and the aura only lasted for a short amount of time, disappearing very quickly. Most of the people just felt a little bit more worried.</p>
 <p>Humans had always been fighting against demonic beasts. When demonic beasts grew more powerful, it would spell disaster for humans. Therefore, when they encountered the birth of a powerful demonic beast, they would instinctively felt irritable.</p>
 <p>Gradually, the blue lightning on the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant dissipated, revealing its original huge gold body. Right now, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was even bigger than before and its aura was so terrifying that one's hair would stand up.</p>
 <p>It had a mammoth body, a long and thick dragon neck and a huge savage looking dragon head. When Qing Shui saw its huge dragon head, he was stunned once again.</p>
 <p>Dragon horns!</p>
 <p>The two huge shiny golden dragon horns were like antlers and stood out a lot. It had horns in the past as well, but they were very small and didn't look like this. Only now was it really considered to have matured. These could now truly be called dragon horns.</p>
 <p>This was a tremendous breakthrough. Qing Shui had yet to be able to sense the benefits he had gained from the False God Tribulation this time around, but he couldn't wait to look at the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant with his Heavenly Vision Technique!</p>
 <p>Right now, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's physical strength had reached a terrifying 300 sun and it was now even more powerful than Fire Bird. Even though the Fire Bird's strength had also increased by a lot, after it had attained a breakthrough and reached the False God realm, its physical strength wasn't as powerful as the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant which had attained a breakthrough.</p>
 <p>Dragon Elephant Force, passive battle technique, permanently increases physical strength by 100 times!</p>
 <p>100 times... It was the same as it was for the Fire Bird. Qing Shui felt that this 100 times seemed to be a juncture. They could even just stop here permanently.</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness: Increases random attacks by ten times for a maximum of 50 targets.</p>
 <p>There was no change to the attack numbers but the attacking prowess had increased by a lot. Qing Shui was already very satisfied. He didn't have high expectations for this battle technique...</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp, at the great perfection stage. It increases physical attacks to be 20 times as strong and there was a certain chance for the surrounding targets to experience numbing in their limbs, giddiness and being rendered immobile.</p>
 <p>Its prowess had increased once again... It had just doubled.</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion: Instantly leap across a distance within 3,000 meters!</p>
 <p>Diamond Sword Qi: Instantly spew out Core Qi to attack the opponent and harbors powerful killing prowess. It can decrease the target's speed by 20% for a period of 2 hours.</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demons: After technique is performed, multiple targets within a 1,000 meter range would have their strength reduced by 10%. The number of targets cannot exceed 50 and the duration of the effects could last for 2 hours!</p>
 <p>There were still no changes to these three battle techniques.</p>
 <p>Ferocious Dragon Elephant Attack: Launches an attack at one target in an instant with a thirty fold offensive power!</p>
 <p>From the initial fifteen fold to the current thirty fold... Qing Shui felt a little numb. It was too powerful!</p>
 <p>Dark Infernal Flames: Dark Infernal Flames under the feet allows the Dragon Elephant’s attack to possess a 20% armor breaking offensive power. At the same time, it increases the Dragon Elephant’s speed in the skies by twofold.</p>
 <p>Dragon Scale Armor: Passive battle technique, allows the Dragon Elephant’s defense to increase by nine fold. Having a powerful physical body and attacks were the foundation to the Dragon Elephant's greatest abilities.</p>
 <p>The Dragon Scale Armor's prowess had also increased by a lot. Having reached the False God level, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant had also gained two powerful abilities.</p>
 <p>Dragon Elephant Might: Absolute suppression over all demonic beasts, with the exception of dragon-typed beasts, suppressing their abilities by at least 10%. At most, it could cause the target to lose its battle prowess but it was unable to cause a suppression in other areas. Zero depletion, passive battle technique!</p>
 <p>Demonic Dragon Heart: The powerful Dragon elephant could let its abilities be doubled once again, fending off the majority of negative statuses.</p>
 <p>It didn't take long for the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant to be next to Qing Shui. He could sense the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's happy emotions and felt very satisfied. Right now, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's strongest attack could be close to 30 million sun...</p>
 <p>Heaven and Earth Battle Beast... The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was an all-rounded battle beast. If lucky, it alone could suppress at least 20% if not more of the opponent's strength. It could also reduce the opponent's speed, induce dizziness and it had both attacks intended to hit a large area or to target a single opponent.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was satisfied. He looked at Yehuang Guwu who was going through the False God Tribulation next to him. This lady really brought him good fortune. Her appearance had made his life a lot happier and it even increased his progress by over ten years.</p>
 <p>"How are you feeling?" Qing Shui looked toward Yehuang Guwu and asked as he called back the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. This wasn't a place they could stay for long. There would probably be people checking out this place very soon.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took Yehuang Guwu's hand and flew toward the Imperial Cuisine Hall.</p>
 <p>In less than an hour after their departure, people slowly appeared in the area but many of them returned, disappointed.</p>
 <p>As it was the aura of a demonic beast, they didn't dare to appear directly but chose to move carefully. It was also because of this that they only appeared so much later.</p>
 <p>They returned to the Imperial Cuisine Hall. The place was very lively now. After knowing that Yehuang Guwu had successfully made it through the False God Tribulation, everyone felt very happy. The power of the experts in Qing Clan had grown by a lot now. It was because Yehuang Guwu still had the White Tigers.</p>
 <p>The two old men didn't find it strange but merely looked at Yehuang Guwu in praise. They seemed to be very happy as well. After such a long period of time, they had already treated this place as their home and felt that this place was very heartwarming.</p>
 <p>The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant had attained a breakthrough. Qing Shui felt that he would be leaving very soon. Yehuang Guwu and the others were gathered together, chatting very happily, while Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>The power Qing Shui received from the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's breakthrough needed to be refined. The power this time around was very strong as well and he didn't dare to let down his guard. After adjusting his condition to the best state, he started to refine the power from the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</p>
 <p>A loud sound that was like a rubber ball exploding, rang out. In that instant, a violent energy rose in Qing Shui's body. At almost the same time, a piece of seven-colored cloud quickly appeared in the sky of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui didn't open his eyes, he could see with his spiritual sense. His heart skipped a beat. What was this? A False God Tribulation? Or was it a Divine Tribulation?</p>
 <p>This wasn't the time to be thinking about this. The small golden armored man in his Dantian seemed to have come alive. Holding the Nine Continents Mountain with one hand and the Big Dipper Sword in another, it stepped on the Five Elements Divine Flag!</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>A bolt of seven-colored lightning bolt struck on Qing Shui's body and then disappeared immediately. At the same time, the small golden armored man in his Dantian waved the sword and absorbed that bolt of lightning.</p>
 <p>The small golden armored man now seemed to appear a little more material. This was the increase in the paragon vessel's power.</p>
 <p>The seven-colored lightning gradually landed from the air. Thankfully, the entire episode passed by without much danger. The power from the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was also absorbed. This was the first time that Qing Shui had absorbed such great power with so much ease.</p>
 <p>The moment Qing Shui sensed his raw strength, he was astonished. Earlier on, the progress he had experienced didn't exceed 2.4 million sun. Even after he absorbed the power from the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, he had only reached three million sun or even less.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui's raw strength had now reached five million sun... It had doubled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought of the lightning bolts from when Yehuang Guwu had experienced the False God Tribulation and that seven-colored lightning that came from the seven-colored cloud earlier.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly sensed his seven-colored pellet and the paragon vessel. He was once again struck with dizziness from the surprise.</p>
 <p>The seven-colored pellet increased his physical strength by 40 times, the paragon vessel increased his strength by 60 times and the Nine-Nine Divine Nebula Formation doubled his strength.</p>
 <p>His spirit energy, under the effect of the Arhat Rosary Beads, seven-colored pellet, paragon vessel, Nine-Nine Divine Nebula Formation and the Seal of Roc, now reached 20 million sun...</p>
 <p>Compared to before, his strength had multiplied by four. Qing Shui knew that the primary reason lay in that seven-colored cloud. Earlier, a message had appeared in his consciousness as well.</p>
 <p>Paragon Tribulation！</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s ordinary strength should only have doubled but after having gone through the Paragon Tribulation once, it doubled once again.</p>
 <p>The Paragon Tribulation was about the same as the False God Tribulation but there were also some differences. After reaching the eighth heavenly layer, as long as his strength were to increase too fast, the Paragon Tribulation would appear. It was similar to the False God Tribulation's effect on the tempering of the body. If he couldn't get past it, what that await him would only be death.</p>
 <p>After having gone through the Paragon Tribulation once, not only had his abilities stabilized, the seven-colored pellet and the paragon vessel had also become more powerful. Right now, Qing Shui couldn't help but wish to experience the Paragon Tribulation a few more times. It was a pity that this was something like a chance encounter and if his strength couldn't increase tremendously once again, he wouldn't encounter the Paragon Tribulation again. The power of the Paragon Tribulation was related to how much one's strength increased. The greater the increase in one's strength, the stronger the Paragon Tribulation.</p>
 <p>Putting this aside, Qing Shui looked toward the Paragon Heavenly Technique.</p>
 <p>Elementary Paragon Heavenly Technique!</p>
 <p>Paragon Golden Armor: Allows Qing Shui to bring up all of his defenses to be three times his actual strength and he can fend off a fatal attack each time.</p>
 <p>Paragon Strike: Can be used once a day. The attacking prowess would be three times of Qing Shui's actual strength.</p>
 <p>Shadowless Paragon: Increase speed by three times. Can be used once a day, lasting for 15 minutes each time.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, there's another Heavenly Technique." Qing Shui noticed that there was one more at the bottom.</p>
 <p>Paragon Reversal: Duration for using battle techniques would be reduced to one-third. Attacking speed increased three times.</p>
 <p>Thinking about this made Qing Shui want to smile. The seething power in his body gave him the feeling of being able to do things that others couldn't achieve. If he were to face the Phoenix Dance's Left Custodian again, the latter would be killed directly with a Paragon Strike. The only thing he wasn't happy about was that the Paragon Strike could only be used once.</p>
 <p>However, it was an attack that could reach a terrifying 60 million sun...</p>
 <p>It was too heaven-defying. Even Qing Shui felt this way.</p>
 <p>Even if he didn't use the Paragon Strike, with his current strength, the killing techniques of the Left Custodian's Heavenly Technique would be useless against him. It would probably not be able to break through his defense.</p>
