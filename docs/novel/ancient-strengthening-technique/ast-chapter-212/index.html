 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 212 Yueyue, It’s About Time to Feed the Baby</strong></p>
  <p>“Right, how does one go about refining the gemstones…?” Qing Shui rubbed his nose as he smiled and said. He realized that he really did seem like a kid who was keen on learning.</p>
  <p>“My dear Divine grade Smelting Master, Sir Qing Shui, please listen well…” </p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue seemed to feel as if her words were a bit inappropriate as she hurried to continue. “The process of refining gemstones is a skill which can be done by anyone. Of course, it would still require the person to know some simple techniques. Actually, most people would think that it relies mostly on one’s luck. Those who are lucky would be able to succeed in one try, but those who aren’t lucky may not be able to succeed even once out of one hundred tries. Once the creator fails, the two consumed gemstones used for refinement would be destroyed.”</p>
  <p>“Isn’t the penalty too harsh? To think that they’d be completely destroyed. The price to pay is really too high.” Qing Shui could not help but mumbled. </p>
  <p>“Haha, the penalty is not only harsh, but even the success rate is extremely low. The success rate of raising the grade of 3rd grade gemstones is only 1%. Haha, the higher the grade, the lower the success rate.” Canghai Mingyue laughed and said, as if she was very pleased to see how stunned Qing Shui was.</p>
  <p>“Have you seen the process of refining gemstones before?” The three of them continued to walked slowly. There were many people who passed by them and quite a number who were focused on them. After all, there were two ladies whose beauties were sufficient to bring trouble and sufferings to a country and its people.</p>
  <p>“I’ve seen it a few times, but they were all attempts to refine 2nd grade gemstones into 3rd grade ones. All of them ended as failures. While the process itself seemed very simple, the refining cauldron requires the same flame as when one does alchemy. It’s even better if one can cultivate their own cultivating flames before refining the gemstones. Most people would say that it all goes down to one’s luck as no one was ever able to grasp the method to increase the success rate of refining gemstones.” Canghai Mingyue explained.</p>
  <p>Once channeling of Qi was mentioned, everything seemed incredulous. It was just like the memories from Qing Shui’s past life. If one did not pick up gemstone workmanship, the success rate would be extremely low. However, once one picked up the relevant skills, the success rate would be amazingly high and could even reach 100%.</p>
  <p>However, it was a pity that amongst Qing Shui’s supporting techniques, gemstone workmanship was not one of them. Qing Shui did not know if there would be a day when he could acquire such amazing skills. Even if there was such a day, he was not sure if the success rate would be high. He had never thought that gemstone workmanship could be so strong that it was perverse.</p>
  <p>He suddenly recalled the moonstone given to him by his goddess-like master and took it off. Holding it in his hands, he could see that it was full of cracks. He could not help but think of Skysword Sect’s Yiye Jiange.</p>
  <p>“Is this 1st grade or 2nd grade?” Qing Shui asked Canghai Mingyue. Based on its glow, it did not seem like a 3rd grade gemstone and its effects were not at 10%. That was why he asked this.</p>
  <p>“This is a 2nd grade moonstone.” Canghai Mingyue did not think much before she said after she took a glance.</p>
  <p>“Are there a lot of these mysterious gemstones in the world of the nine continents?” Qing Shui thought that these should all be ores, but he was not sure if there were a lot of them.</p>
  <p>“There’s no need to care about how many there are, as long as you are willing to pay the high price for them. You’d be able to get as many as you wish. If a 1st grade gemstone costs 100 taels of silver, 1000 taels of silver would not even be able to fetch you a 2nd grade gemstone. Even if you have a million taels of silver, it would also be hard for you to buy a 3rd grade gemstone. This is because to create a gemstone of a grade higher, there would be thousands or even ten thousand gemstones of lower grades that were put to waste. So how would you measure the worth of this item? Actually, 1st grade gemstones are actually quite cheap.” Canghai Mingyue smiled and continued walking as she said this. One of her hands was holding onto Huoyun Liu-Li’s.</p>
  <p>“Aren’t there better Smelting Masters? For example, those who have a higher success rate at refining the gemstones? Who can I look for if I wish to find someone to help me refine gemstones?” The first thing Qing Shui thought of was the blacksmith shop. However, he was not sure if it was the same here.</p>
  <p>“Smelting Masters? That is merely a name. Most people would use this name to snide those who don’t have proper jobs since this job doesn’t even exist. If you wish to refine gemstones, you can head to the “????”. There are many varieties of cauldrons there available for use at different prices. The cost is charged by per usage and one would need to bring along their own gemstones to refine. All successes and failures are dependent on one’s luck.”</p>
  <p>“There’s actually no one who does this for a living?” Qing Shui said in disbelief.</p>
  <p>“It’s not that there aren’t any. There are some major sects and reputable clans who have people who deal specifically in this craft, but the effect is not that big. Moreover, who would be able to do this? The success rate is just too low and most people would just refine 2nd grade gemstones with 1st grade gemstones, or refine up to 3rd grade gemstones. Most people would not be able to afford to refine gemstones of higher grades.” Canghai Mingyue threw a glance at Qing Shui and smiled as she moved on forward.</p>
  <p>“See, there’s the Southern Ancient Pass.” After the three of them quietly walked on for a distance, Canghai Mingyue pointed to the front and said.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-Li looked towards the direction Canghai Mingyue pointed to. It felt especially nice, beautiful, and grand!</p>
  <p>The Southern Ancient Pass was not an independent path, but was formed from a combination of various intersecting roads that looked ancient, wide and had a profound feeling to it. Although the intersecting roads were from different directions, they did not give the feeling that the pass was messy but had a forlorn beauty to it.</p>
  <p>The buildings on the side were mostly pavilion-styled with 4, 8 or even 12 corners. Moreover, there were also large courtyards and tall buildings like ancient palaces. With one look, Qing Shui had already liked the presence and atmosphere of this place. Compared to those lavishly decorated buildings, it was not only comparable, but also it even had a dignified feel. These seemed to be of a higher standard and made those lavishly decorated buildings appear in poor taste.</p>
  <p>Actually, the buildings here were still considered very beautiful, just that it was not a lavish beauty. Instead, it was a beauty like Canghai Mingyue’s, which was dignified and shocking that one would not be able to find any fault.</p>
  <p>The area of the Southern Ancient Pass was very wide and close to the southern gates. The numerous buildings stretched endlessly down the road. It was the first time Qing Shui saw such a generous and spacious structure. It had an indescribable feeling to it.</p>
  <p>There were many people and carts passing by the road, but everything was very orderly. One could even see large groups of people equipped with various weapons. There were also many women of all shapes and sizes, some with thick layers of makeup while others seemed like a classic beauty without any makeup at all. The continent’s capital had plenty of people and did not lack beauties. It might also be because most people in the world of nine continents practiced martial arts and lived in a world with much spiritual energy, so there were plenty of beauties. Of course, Qing Shui felt that the only person who could be on par with Canghai Mingyue’s beauty was his goddess-like Master, Yiye Jiange. </p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li, on the other hand, was stronger in terms of the way she carried herself. That charm and disposition was incomparable and one would be able to appreciate it more the longer one came into contact with her. She was not like Canghai Mingyue or Yiye Jiange who would be able to astonish others with their beauty on the first meeting. Her beauty was one that would leak out more casually, and laid in the finer details.</p>
  <p>In the crowd, Qing Shui did come across a few beautiful ladies, but they were not comparable to Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li. Qing Shui’s eyes still lit upon seeing them. After all, Huoyun Liu-Li and Canghai Mingyue were on a different level altogether.</p>
  <p>“Did you see those people who are wearing white and carrying longswords are from ???. They are the sect with the largest number of disciples in the Southern Ancient Pass. Those beautiful ladies wearing bright and colorful clothes are mostly from Joyous Sect.”</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue told them as they walked. The three of them had already entered the most prosperous area in the Southern Ancient Pass.<br></p>
  <p>Qing Shui silently registered all this information. Canghai Mingyue had told him before to not offend Immortal Sword Sect, Joyous Sect, and Imperial Beast Aristocrat in the Southern Ancient Pass.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>However, he did not think that they would be able to come across them so easily. Qing Shui did not know how strong they were nor did he ask Canghai Mingyue as he felt that it was meaningless.</p>
  <p>As for the Imperial Beast Aristocrat, Qing Shui did not hear Canghai Mingyue pointing them out. Reputable clans tended to have smaller headcounts compared to sects, and some of them may even have very small numbers. Power might not be fully reliant on numbers.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui and his company attracted quite a lot of attention on the way. After all, there were two ladies who were eye-catching wherever they went. It would be hard not to notice them.</p>
  <p>“Brother, did you see the two beauties over there? They’re really beautiful. It’s suitable to describe them as angels from the heavens. Should we try to seize the beauties?” An ugly young man who was rat-eyed and buck-headed asked the tallest and sturdiest looking man amongst the group of ten beside him.</p>
  <p>“Slap!”</p>
  <p>The young man received a slap on his head.</p>
  <p>“To hell with you. Seize the beauties? Didn’t you see how many men were hankering for them? Do you know why no one had taken any action?‘ The tall and sturdy man said harshly.</p>
  <p>“Why?” The lean and small young man with a wretched looked asked, grieved.</p>
  <p>“To hell with you. It goes to say that they are very strong or come from very strong backgrounds. Even if neither were true, do you think we would be able to succeed?” The tall and sturdy man said as if he had much experience.</p>
  <p>“If it weren’t for these two factors, why would we not succeed?”</p>
  <p>“Think about it. There are so many people hankering for those two ladies. The one who’s more beautiful even exudes an aura that keeps people away. If we were to go up and seize them, what do you think they will do?” The tall and sturdy man said mysteriously. Qing Shui just happened to land his gaze on that man. He could not help but hear what they were saying thanks to his keen hearing and the man’s loud voice.</p>
  <p>“What would they do? Do you think they would fight us?” The wretched looking lean young man asked in surprise.</p>
  <p>“They’ll play the hero to save the beauties.” The tall and sturdy looking man said intelligently.</p>
  <p>“Ahhh, our boss is the cleverest. Then, do we wait to play the hero to save the beauties?” The lean young man asked lewdly.</p>
  <p>“To hell with you. We are nothing in this area. Let’s go!”</p>
  <p>“Did you hear that? You two ladies are the most beautiful around here and so many people are thinking of kidnapping you.” Qing Shui laughed and said. He knew that they should have heard the conversation. After all, they had gradually closed in to that group from earlier.</p>
  <p>“There are many of these kinds of people around in the southern gate, but many of them know their place. If they don’t, they would have long been dead. Therefore, those who are left know where they stand and would only bully the commoners who are weaker than them.” Canghai Mingyue did not blame Qing Shui would took the opportunity to tease them.</p>
  <p>“Are there not many people in this area who recognize our Young Miss Mingyue?” Qing Shui asked curiously.</p>
  <p>“Haha, I’m not well known in this area since I spend most of my time in other cities and seldomly stay around here. Though, when I was young, my parents did bring me around here often.” Canghai Mingyue laughed and replied.</p>
  <p>“Sh*t.” Qing Shui said bitterly. </p>
  <p>“What’s wrong?” Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li asked concurrently.</p>
  <p>“I dare say that within 15 minutes, there’ll be someone who will try to hijack you or strike a conversation. There will be a conflict.” Qing Shui rubbed his nose as he smiled and said.</p>
  <p>“Are you serious? You must be thinking too much.” Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Shui with a weird look.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, Canghai Mingyue turned her head to look at a few young men who were walking over from a short distance away.</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li was also surprised when she saw this before she turned to glare at Qing Shui angrily. Her expression was indescribably moving, carrying a tinge of blame in her charm.</p>
  <p>“Miss, would you be interested in joining us for a drink?”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked speechlessly at the most flirtatious fellow amongst the three young men. He looked quite handsome, but his head was inclined at an angle, even when he was staring straight at Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p>The three young men were all around 25-26 years old, appearing with a tinge of elegance in their pure white clothes. As the saying goes, a tailor makes a fine man. Qing Shui believed that as long as the person was not very ugly, they would look quite presentable if they wore the same clothes. Of course, if they were to have a better disposition, they would appear even more outstanding enough that people may ignore their looks. It was too bad that this fellow before him had a bit of arrogance and no disposition. Thankfully enough, he had good skin.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue did not say anything but turned to look gently at Qing Shui. She quietly held onto Qing Shui’s hand and said, “Qing Shui, I’m tired. Let’s find a place to rest.”</p>
  <p>Her voice was so gentle that Qing Shui could not believe his ears. His hand was grasped tightly and he nodded his head almost subconsciously.</p>
  <p>“Great demoness, definitely a great demoness. She’s a great demoness who has cultivated for a thousand years…” Qing Shui thought to himself.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui knew that this was Canghai Mingyue’s choice of handling things. She had zero interest in the guy in front of her and wanted Qing Shui to get rid of them.</p>
  <p>“Forget it, since I’ve enjoyed myself, I’ve got to do some work.” Qing Shui thought to himself helplessly.</p>
  <p>“Yueyue, let’s go home. It’s about time to feed the baby.” Qing Shui grabbed onto Canghai Mingyue’s hand. He closed in with his head to bump his nose gently against Canghai Mingyue’s sexy nose and said with deep emotions.</p>
  <p>His one sentence toppled everyone present. Even Huoyun Liu-Li almost believed that it was the truth…</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue suddenly felt so embarrassed that she wanted to drop the show. She silently blamed this fellow for going overboard and also herself for starting it. But the show must go on. If not, what would people think of her…</p>
  <p>“Mmm!”</p>
  <p>Thereafter, Qing Shui grabbed Canghai Mingyue while she pulled Huoyun Liu-Li who was in a stupor. They were prepared to take their leave.</p>
  <p>“Thinking of leaving? Did our Young Master Feng agree to let you guys leave?” One of the young man standing behind snided and said.</p>
  <p>“Don’t you know that our Young Master Feng loves young married women, especially those who are breastfeeding? Don’t you know that our Young Master Feng must drink a cup of fresh human milk every morning?” The other young man grinned and said.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, Qing Shui saw that the young man who was addressed as Young Master Feng had his eyes fixed on Canghai Mingyue’s soft breasts. His lips were even trembling…</p>
  <p>Qing Shui saw the infuriated Canghai Mingyue and smiled bitterly before he turned to shoot a small stone towards the noisiest fellow. Qing Shui did not exert too much force as he did not want to kill him, so the small stone only smashed his mouth.</p>
  <p>The young man could only let out a whine!</p>
  <p>“Can we leave now?” Qing Shui grinned and asked. </p>
  <p>“You’re thinking of leaving after beating up someone else? Our Young Master Feng is the grandson of Immortal Sword Sect’s Elder Feng.”</p>
  <p>“Pfft!”</p>
  <p>There went another fellow whose mouth was smashed and could only whine.</p>
  <p>“This time around, can we leave?” Qing Shui continued smiling as he looked at the young man who was addressed as Young Master Feng.</p>
  <p>“No!” A low voice sounded.</p>
  <p>A middle-aged man suddenly appeared. He was also dressed in a snow white suit with his stern eyes looked towards Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>Seeing that Qing Shui wanted to fight again, Canghai Mingyue quickly grabbed onto his hand and shook her head.</p>
  <p>“I trust that you’ve also seen the whole situation. I don’t want to kill anyone. At the very least, killing you is a piece of cake to me, but I shall not keep you company today. It’s very easy to look for me as you can just come to Canghai Residence.” After a short moment of hesitation, Canghai Mingyue said. She threw a sharp gaze towards the middle-aged man before pulling Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-Li and leaving the place.</p>
  <p>“Canghai Residence?”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui did not say a single word and neither did Huoyun Liu-Li. Canghai Mingyue continued to walk for a distance before she let out a sigh.</p>
  <p>“Did I get you into trouble?”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui said calmly.</p>
  <p>“The Immortal Sword Sect is very influential in this area, and thus I’ve told you to try not to offend them. Even if you did not do anything, I would have taken action. Moreover, I would kill him, despite knowing that he is from Immortal Sword Sect.</p>
  <p>“Will it bring trouble for you and Senior?”</p>
  <p>“No it won’t, don’t worry. I forgot to mention that my parents are quite powerful in this area. Let’s go, I’ve lost the mood to walk around. Let’s find a place to have some food and get some rest before we carry on.” Canghai Mingyue said softly.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui gave a sigh to himself!</p>
  <p>“Hmph, you were really too much earlier.” There was a weird look in Canghai Mingyue’s profound and beautiful eyes as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Cough, cough. That.. wasn’t I trying to make it seem more realistic?” Qing Shui recalled the contact he had with her beautiful nose. It was a fine and soul-stirring feeling, and the “impudence” in her words was also an excitement.</p>
  <p>“You’re the first person who dared to treat me like this. Aren’t you afraid that I may lose control and kill you?” Canghai Mingyue said in a strange tone.</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“I’m actually really not scared at all.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
  <p>“Why?” Huoyun Liu-Li smiled and asked.</p>
  <p>“Let’s go, the baby is still waiting to be fed milk.”</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li: “…”</p>

 <p><strong>AST 212 Yueyue, It’s About Time to Feed the Baby</strong></p>
 <p>“Right, how does one go about refining the gemstones…?” Qing Shui rubbed his nose as he smiled and said. He realized that he really did seem like a kid who was keen on learning.</p>
 <p>“My dear Divine grade Smelting Master, Sir Qing Shui, please listen well…” </p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue seemed to feel as if her words were a bit inappropriate as she hurried to continue. “The process of refining gemstones is a skill which can be done by anyone. Of course, it would still require the person to know some simple techniques. Actually, most people would think that it relies mostly on one’s luck. Those who are lucky would be able to succeed in one try, but those who aren’t lucky may not be able to succeed even once out of one hundred tries. Once the creator fails, the two consumed gemstones used for refinement would be destroyed.”</p>
 <p>“Isn’t the penalty too harsh? To think that they’d be completely destroyed. The price to pay is really too high.” Qing Shui could not help but mumbled. </p>
 <p>“Haha, the penalty is not only harsh, but even the success rate is extremely low. The success rate of raising the grade of 3rd grade gemstones is only 1%. Haha, the higher the grade, the lower the success rate.” Canghai Mingyue laughed and said, as if she was very pleased to see how stunned Qing Shui was.</p>
 <p>“Have you seen the process of refining gemstones before?” The three of them continued to walked slowly. There were many people who passed by them and quite a number who were focused on them. After all, there were two ladies whose beauties were sufficient to bring trouble and sufferings to a country and its people.</p>
 <p>“I’ve seen it a few times, but they were all attempts to refine 2nd grade gemstones into 3rd grade ones. All of them ended as failures. While the process itself seemed very simple, the refining cauldron requires the same flame as when one does alchemy. It’s even better if one can cultivate their own cultivating flames before refining the gemstones. Most people would say that it all goes down to one’s luck as no one was ever able to grasp the method to increase the success rate of refining gemstones.” Canghai Mingyue explained.</p>
 <p>Once channeling of Qi was mentioned, everything seemed incredulous. It was just like the memories from Qing Shui’s past life. If one did not pick up gemstone workmanship, the success rate would be extremely low. However, once one picked up the relevant skills, the success rate would be amazingly high and could even reach 100%.</p>
 <p>However, it was a pity that amongst Qing Shui’s supporting techniques, gemstone workmanship was not one of them. Qing Shui did not know if there would be a day when he could acquire such amazing skills. Even if there was such a day, he was not sure if the success rate would be high. He had never thought that gemstone workmanship could be so strong that it was perverse.</p>
 <p>He suddenly recalled the moonstone given to him by his goddess-like master and took it off. Holding it in his hands, he could see that it was full of cracks. He could not help but think of Skysword Sect’s Yiye Jiange.</p>
 <p>“Is this 1st grade or 2nd grade?” Qing Shui asked Canghai Mingyue. Based on its glow, it did not seem like a 3rd grade gemstone and its effects were not at 10%. That was why he asked this.</p>
 <p>“This is a 2nd grade moonstone.” Canghai Mingyue did not think much before she said after she took a glance.</p>
 <p>“Are there a lot of these mysterious gemstones in the world of the nine continents?” Qing Shui thought that these should all be ores, but he was not sure if there were a lot of them.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need to care about how many there are, as long as you are willing to pay the high price for them. You’d be able to get as many as you wish. If a 1st grade gemstone costs 100 taels of silver, 1000 taels of silver would not even be able to fetch you a 2nd grade gemstone. Even if you have a million taels of silver, it would also be hard for you to buy a 3rd grade gemstone. This is because to create a gemstone of a grade higher, there would be thousands or even ten thousand gemstones of lower grades that were put to waste. So how would you measure the worth of this item? Actually, 1st grade gemstones are actually quite cheap.” Canghai Mingyue smiled and continued walking as she said this. One of her hands was holding onto Huoyun Liu-Li’s.</p>
 <p>“Aren’t there better Smelting Masters? For example, those who have a higher success rate at refining the gemstones? Who can I look for if I wish to find someone to help me refine gemstones?” The first thing Qing Shui thought of was the blacksmith shop. However, he was not sure if it was the same here.</p>
 <p>“Smelting Masters? That is merely a name. Most people would use this name to snide those who don’t have proper jobs since this job doesn’t even exist. If you wish to refine gemstones, you can head to the “????”. There are many varieties of cauldrons there available for use at different prices. The cost is charged by per usage and one would need to bring along their own gemstones to refine. All successes and failures are dependent on one’s luck.”</p>
 <p>“There’s actually no one who does this for a living?” Qing Shui said in disbelief.</p>
 <p>“It’s not that there aren’t any. There are some major sects and reputable clans who have people who deal specifically in this craft, but the effect is not that big. Moreover, who would be able to do this? The success rate is just too low and most people would just refine 2nd grade gemstones with 1st grade gemstones, or refine up to 3rd grade gemstones. Most people would not be able to afford to refine gemstones of higher grades.” Canghai Mingyue threw a glance at Qing Shui and smiled as she moved on forward.</p>
 <p>“See, there’s the Southern Ancient Pass.” After the three of them quietly walked on for a distance, Canghai Mingyue pointed to the front and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-Li looked towards the direction Canghai Mingyue pointed to. It felt especially nice, beautiful, and grand!</p>
 <p>The Southern Ancient Pass was not an independent path, but was formed from a combination of various intersecting roads that looked ancient, wide and had a profound feeling to it. Although the intersecting roads were from different directions, they did not give the feeling that the pass was messy but had a forlorn beauty to it.</p>
 <p>The buildings on the side were mostly pavilion-styled with 4, 8 or even 12 corners. Moreover, there were also large courtyards and tall buildings like ancient palaces. With one look, Qing Shui had already liked the presence and atmosphere of this place. Compared to those lavishly decorated buildings, it was not only comparable, but also it even had a dignified feel. These seemed to be of a higher standard and made those lavishly decorated buildings appear in poor taste.</p>
 <p>Actually, the buildings here were still considered very beautiful, just that it was not a lavish beauty. Instead, it was a beauty like Canghai Mingyue’s, which was dignified and shocking that one would not be able to find any fault.</p>
 <p>The area of the Southern Ancient Pass was very wide and close to the southern gates. The numerous buildings stretched endlessly down the road. It was the first time Qing Shui saw such a generous and spacious structure. It had an indescribable feeling to it.</p>
 <p>There were many people and carts passing by the road, but everything was very orderly. One could even see large groups of people equipped with various weapons. There were also many women of all shapes and sizes, some with thick layers of makeup while others seemed like a classic beauty without any makeup at all. The continent’s capital had plenty of people and did not lack beauties. It might also be because most people in the world of nine continents practiced martial arts and lived in a world with much spiritual energy, so there were plenty of beauties. Of course, Qing Shui felt that the only person who could be on par with Canghai Mingyue’s beauty was his goddess-like Master, Yiye Jiange. </p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li, on the other hand, was stronger in terms of the way she carried herself. That charm and disposition was incomparable and one would be able to appreciate it more the longer one came into contact with her. She was not like Canghai Mingyue or Yiye Jiange who would be able to astonish others with their beauty on the first meeting. Her beauty was one that would leak out more casually, and laid in the finer details.</p>
 <p>In the crowd, Qing Shui did come across a few beautiful ladies, but they were not comparable to Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li. Qing Shui’s eyes still lit upon seeing them. After all, Huoyun Liu-Li and Canghai Mingyue were on a different level altogether.</p>
 <p>“Did you see those people who are wearing white and carrying longswords are from ???. They are the sect with the largest number of disciples in the Southern Ancient Pass. Those beautiful ladies wearing bright and colorful clothes are mostly from Joyous Sect.”</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue told them as they walked. The three of them had already entered the most prosperous area in the Southern Ancient Pass.<br></p>
 <p>Qing Shui silently registered all this information. Canghai Mingyue had told him before to not offend Immortal Sword Sect, Joyous Sect, and Imperial Beast Aristocrat in the Southern Ancient Pass.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>However, he did not think that they would be able to come across them so easily. Qing Shui did not know how strong they were nor did he ask Canghai Mingyue as he felt that it was meaningless.</p>
 <p>As for the Imperial Beast Aristocrat, Qing Shui did not hear Canghai Mingyue pointing them out. Reputable clans tended to have smaller headcounts compared to sects, and some of them may even have very small numbers. Power might not be fully reliant on numbers.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and his company attracted quite a lot of attention on the way. After all, there were two ladies who were eye-catching wherever they went. It would be hard not to notice them.</p>
 <p>“Brother, did you see the two beauties over there? They’re really beautiful. It’s suitable to describe them as angels from the heavens. Should we try to seize the beauties?” An ugly young man who was rat-eyed and buck-headed asked the tallest and sturdiest looking man amongst the group of ten beside him.</p>
 <p>“Slap!”</p>
 <p>The young man received a slap on his head.</p>
 <p>“To hell with you. Seize the beauties? Didn’t you see how many men were hankering for them? Do you know why no one had taken any action?‘ The tall and sturdy man said harshly.</p>
 <p>“Why?” The lean and small young man with a wretched looked asked, grieved.</p>
 <p>“To hell with you. It goes to say that they are very strong or come from very strong backgrounds. Even if neither were true, do you think we would be able to succeed?” The tall and sturdy man said as if he had much experience.</p>
 <p>“If it weren’t for these two factors, why would we not succeed?”</p>
 <p>“Think about it. There are so many people hankering for those two ladies. The one who’s more beautiful even exudes an aura that keeps people away. If we were to go up and seize them, what do you think they will do?” The tall and sturdy man said mysteriously. Qing Shui just happened to land his gaze on that man. He could not help but hear what they were saying thanks to his keen hearing and the man’s loud voice.</p>
 <p>“What would they do? Do you think they would fight us?” The wretched looking lean young man asked in surprise.</p>
 <p>“They’ll play the hero to save the beauties.” The tall and sturdy looking man said intelligently.</p>
 <p>“Ahhh, our boss is the cleverest. Then, do we wait to play the hero to save the beauties?” The lean young man asked lewdly.</p>
 <p>“To hell with you. We are nothing in this area. Let’s go!”</p>
 <p>“Did you hear that? You two ladies are the most beautiful around here and so many people are thinking of kidnapping you.” Qing Shui laughed and said. He knew that they should have heard the conversation. After all, they had gradually closed in to that group from earlier.</p>
 <p>“There are many of these kinds of people around in the southern gate, but many of them know their place. If they don’t, they would have long been dead. Therefore, those who are left know where they stand and would only bully the commoners who are weaker than them.” Canghai Mingyue did not blame Qing Shui would took the opportunity to tease them.</p>
 <p>“Are there not many people in this area who recognize our Young Miss Mingyue?” Qing Shui asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“Haha, I’m not well known in this area since I spend most of my time in other cities and seldomly stay around here. Though, when I was young, my parents did bring me around here often.” Canghai Mingyue laughed and replied.</p>
 <p>“Sh*t.” Qing Shui said bitterly. </p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li asked concurrently.</p>
 <p>“I dare say that within 15 minutes, there’ll be someone who will try to hijack you or strike a conversation. There will be a conflict.” Qing Shui rubbed his nose as he smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“Are you serious? You must be thinking too much.” Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Shui with a weird look.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Canghai Mingyue turned her head to look at a few young men who were walking over from a short distance away.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li was also surprised when she saw this before she turned to glare at Qing Shui angrily. Her expression was indescribably moving, carrying a tinge of blame in her charm.</p>
 <p>“Miss, would you be interested in joining us for a drink?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked speechlessly at the most flirtatious fellow amongst the three young men. He looked quite handsome, but his head was inclined at an angle, even when he was staring straight at Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p>The three young men were all around 25-26 years old, appearing with a tinge of elegance in their pure white clothes. As the saying goes, a tailor makes a fine man. Qing Shui believed that as long as the person was not very ugly, they would look quite presentable if they wore the same clothes. Of course, if they were to have a better disposition, they would appear even more outstanding enough that people may ignore their looks. It was too bad that this fellow before him had a bit of arrogance and no disposition. Thankfully enough, he had good skin.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue did not say anything but turned to look gently at Qing Shui. She quietly held onto Qing Shui’s hand and said, “Qing Shui, I’m tired. Let’s find a place to rest.”</p>
 <p>Her voice was so gentle that Qing Shui could not believe his ears. His hand was grasped tightly and he nodded his head almost subconsciously.</p>
 <p>“Great demoness, definitely a great demoness. She’s a great demoness who has cultivated for a thousand years…” Qing Shui thought to himself.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that this was Canghai Mingyue’s choice of handling things. She had zero interest in the guy in front of her and wanted Qing Shui to get rid of them.</p>
 <p>“Forget it, since I’ve enjoyed myself, I’ve got to do some work.” Qing Shui thought to himself helplessly.</p>
 <p>“Yueyue, let’s go home. It’s about time to feed the baby.” Qing Shui grabbed onto Canghai Mingyue’s hand. He closed in with his head to bump his nose gently against Canghai Mingyue’s sexy nose and said with deep emotions.</p>
 <p>His one sentence toppled everyone present. Even Huoyun Liu-Li almost believed that it was the truth…</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue suddenly felt so embarrassed that she wanted to drop the show. She silently blamed this fellow for going overboard and also herself for starting it. But the show must go on. If not, what would people think of her…</p>
 <p>“Mmm!”</p>
 <p>Thereafter, Qing Shui grabbed Canghai Mingyue while she pulled Huoyun Liu-Li who was in a stupor. They were prepared to take their leave.</p>
 <p>“Thinking of leaving? Did our Young Master Feng agree to let you guys leave?” One of the young man standing behind snided and said.</p>
 <p>“Don’t you know that our Young Master Feng loves young married women, especially those who are breastfeeding? Don’t you know that our Young Master Feng must drink a cup of fresh human milk every morning?” The other young man grinned and said.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Qing Shui saw that the young man who was addressed as Young Master Feng had his eyes fixed on Canghai Mingyue’s soft breasts. His lips were even trembling…</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw the infuriated Canghai Mingyue and smiled bitterly before he turned to shoot a small stone towards the noisiest fellow. Qing Shui did not exert too much force as he did not want to kill him, so the small stone only smashed his mouth.</p>
 <p>The young man could only let out a whine!</p>
 <p>“Can we leave now?” Qing Shui grinned and asked. </p>
 <p>“You’re thinking of leaving after beating up someone else? Our Young Master Feng is the grandson of Immortal Sword Sect’s Elder Feng.”</p>
 <p>“Pfft!”</p>
 <p>There went another fellow whose mouth was smashed and could only whine.</p>
 <p>“This time around, can we leave?” Qing Shui continued smiling as he looked at the young man who was addressed as Young Master Feng.</p>
 <p>“No!” A low voice sounded.</p>
 <p>A middle-aged man suddenly appeared. He was also dressed in a snow white suit with his stern eyes looked towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Qing Shui wanted to fight again, Canghai Mingyue quickly grabbed onto his hand and shook her head.</p>
 <p>“I trust that you’ve also seen the whole situation. I don’t want to kill anyone. At the very least, killing you is a piece of cake to me, but I shall not keep you company today. It’s very easy to look for me as you can just come to Canghai Residence.” After a short moment of hesitation, Canghai Mingyue said. She threw a sharp gaze towards the middle-aged man before pulling Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-Li and leaving the place.</p>
 <p>“Canghai Residence?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not say a single word and neither did Huoyun Liu-Li. Canghai Mingyue continued to walk for a distance before she let out a sigh.</p>
 <p>“Did I get you into trouble?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui said calmly.</p>
 <p>“The Immortal Sword Sect is very influential in this area, and thus I’ve told you to try not to offend them. Even if you did not do anything, I would have taken action. Moreover, I would kill him, despite knowing that he is from Immortal Sword Sect.</p>
 <p>“Will it bring trouble for you and Senior?”</p>
 <p>“No it won’t, don’t worry. I forgot to mention that my parents are quite powerful in this area. Let’s go, I’ve lost the mood to walk around. Let’s find a place to have some food and get some rest before we carry on.” Canghai Mingyue said softly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gave a sigh to himself!</p>
 <p>“Hmph, you were really too much earlier.” There was a weird look in Canghai Mingyue’s profound and beautiful eyes as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Cough, cough. That.. wasn’t I trying to make it seem more realistic?” Qing Shui recalled the contact he had with her beautiful nose. It was a fine and soul-stirring feeling, and the “impudence” in her words was also an excitement.</p>
 <p>“You’re the first person who dared to treat me like this. Aren’t you afraid that I may lose control and kill you?” Canghai Mingyue said in a strange tone.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“I’m actually really not scared at all.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“Why?” Huoyun Liu-Li smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go, the baby is still waiting to be fed milk.”</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li: “…”</p>
