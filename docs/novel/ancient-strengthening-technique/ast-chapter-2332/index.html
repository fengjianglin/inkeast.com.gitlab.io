 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Him?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lady looked at Qing Shui with doubt. After all, the old man from before was a well-known miraculous physician, and he was old. On the other hand, this person before her looked far too young.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Custodian Yuchi was someone under Young Miss, a person who wished for Miss to be safe the most, and this was his sentiments. At this point, there was no other way out. As long as there was some hope, then this young guy should give it a try.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Is it that I don't look like it?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's not the case. Miraculous Physician, please come with me!" the lady said softly and turned to head for the bamboo building.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was Qing Shui's second time coming here. Everything remained the same as before. After entering the room, he didn't smell any scent of medicinal herbs. The smell was still refreshing and elegant. Walking over, Qing Shui looked at the woman on the bed. Right now, she was seated and resting against the wall of the bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scar-filled face was in a greenish black color. The black color gleamed. It was an extremely eerie color, a sign of skin having been invaded by lethal poison. If this were to continue, her flesh would likely start to rot soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman looked at Qing Shui and was stunned. "Why are you here?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Didn't I say that if you were to have any trouble, come and look for me. Could it be that you really don't believe that I'll be able to cure you?" Qing Shui walked to the bed, and the woman signaled for the lady to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There's no way to cure my face. This poison is too complicated and no one can cure it, not even the person who poisoned me," said the woman in a very pleasant-sounding voice. It sounded both mature and beautiful, but there was a hint of bitterness in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who is that? What feud does that person have against you to be so vicious," Qing Shui asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's someone who used to like me, but I don't like him back. He said that a woman he can't get his hands on shouldn't exist, and then my face ended up like this." The woman smiled as she said this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was surprised. "How is this liking someone? If a person likes someone, they won't act like this."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He is a proud and selfish Poison Master and is also my martial senior. There are only a few people in this world who can surpass him in the field of poison. He's really a genius, but it's a pity," the woman said slowly as if she was trying to find someone to confide her thoughts to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"A person like this really deserves to die. This isn't just being selfish; it's wiping out a person's whole world. If I were to come across him one day, I'll help you take revenge," Qing Shui said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He's in the Upper Three Regions. If you can really cure me, he'll definitely go and look for you." The woman didn't say anything about Qing Shui not being a match for that guy but merely mentioned that he was in the Upper Three Regions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui didn't feel anything special even after she mentioned that the guy was in the Upper Three Regions. Not everyone there was an expert, and there were only a couple of them who could be considered to be top-notch. Therefore, he only smiled and continued, "Let me treat you; I have confidence in my abilities. Moreover, I can also help you to regain your original appearance."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman was stunned. "There's no need to console me. I'm already used to it. Don't let me experience disappointment after giving me hope."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't worry. I shan't say anything more and treat you first. I'll help you to detoxify today." When Qing Shui was speaking earlier, he had already used the Heavenly Vision Technique to assessed the poison on the woman's face. He was taken by surprise. Her martial senior was really an expert in the field of poison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were a total of 81 types of poisonous elements, each being extremely vicious. But even then, with all of them mixed together, the target won't die immediately. Slowly but surely these poisonous elements would release their toxins. The body that had been affected by this deathly mix of poison for a prolonged period of time would have developed a very strong resistance to poison, and the person would experience greater agony. They would eventually die a torturous death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Your martial senior is out to kill you!" Qing Shui sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He said that I can live for ten years, and then I'll eventually die a torturous death." The woman could only smile bitterly once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"From what I see, you still have a lifespan of 1.5 years. I know you feel that you're capable of withstanding the torture. However, if your condition isn't cured, you'll feel increased pain over this 1.5 years before dying in agony," said Qing Shui</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm not afraid. I just don't want to see my disgusting appearance at the very end." The woman shook her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't worry, your poison isn't an issue. I can neutralize it. However, it'll take three months for you to regain your appearance. Even in the fastest scenario, it would still take one month." Qing Shui gave it some thought before giving a conservative timeframe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're really able to recover my appearance and cure me?" The woman looked at Qing Shui, feeling obviously surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It turned out that she hadn't believed in Qing Shui all this while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui rubbed his nose. "Alright, I shan't say anymore. Let's start."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui took out the gold needles and put out his hands. His pair of hands became translucent like jade, appearing to be even more beautiful than a woman's hand. However, it looked unnatural and would only make one feel surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui used a few of the gold needles to seal up her pain receptor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm really very curious. Why do you say that even your martial senior won't be able to cure you?" Qing Shui inserted a needle as he asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's because he has never planned on letting me recover," said the woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Why?" Qing Shui felt very curious. If he liked a woman, he wouldn't dare to destroy her face completely even if the other party didn't like him back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's very simple. It's because he suffered a backlash while concocting poison and has become impotent."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With this reply, Qing Shui understood everything. By this time, he had already inserted 36 gold needles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wisp of coolness went through the woman's face, and her heart started to throb. This guy might really be able to cure her. However, she soon felt that this thought was preposterous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, she seemed to have realized that she had said a lot to this guy. Could it be because her life was reaching its end? It didn't feel that way to her. Previously, she had seen quite a few physicians yet she hadn't said anything to them. She couldn't help but assess him seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was very young, probably younger than she was. He looked very nice as well. He wasn't considered a super handsome guy, but his gaze was clear and warm, having an indescribable feeling of affection. He emitted a natural aura and was a man whom others could get close to the most easily. He gave off a very attractive feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Am I nice to look at?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman replied calmly, "Mmm, it's acceptable. You're the man who makes one feel the most comfortable out of everyone I've met."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then do you want to marry me?" Qing Shui teased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You dare to marry me?" The woman had to hand it over to Qing Shui. There were many people who would tease beautiful ladies, but he was definitely the first who would dare to ask her to marry him despite her appearance. He was likely to be the last person as well. It was because even she herself didn't dare to see her reflection in the mirror. She would scare herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Of course I dare to!" Qing Shui smiled and replied. This woman had a great figure and a pair of wonderful eyes. If one were to take a closer look, they would be able to realize that her eyes were very beautiful. It was just that the scars all over her face had covered up 90% of her beauty and thus not many people could tell that her eyes were beautiful.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui had actually wanted to give this woman hope, or rather, some kind of consolation.</span></p>

At this moment, pitch black venom started to drip out from the tip of the gold needles, releasing a piercing stench.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui's expression didn't change at all, and he kept fiddling with those gold needles with one hand while gently massaging her face with the other. His touch felt warm and very comfortable. The woman was very surprised. He really didn't mind how terrifying her face looked, or rather, how disgusting it was. Moreover, there was even poison on it, and her scars were twisted together. Some of the scars had unordinary colors and appeared both terrifying and disgusting.</span></p>
