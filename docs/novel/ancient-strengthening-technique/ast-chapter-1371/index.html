 <p><strong>AST 1371 - Excellent Situation, The Future Path Lit Up</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned for very long. His Dantian had once again gone through a tremendous transformation. His Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation and Big Dipper Sword had both merged into one with the paragon vessel. The Nine Continents Mountain could be used like before, and it had become extremely powerful due to the increase in Qing Shui's abilities.</p>
 <p>When he had just reached the Heavenly Dao the other time, the things that Qing Shui could see had materialized. The golden pellet turned into a paragon vessel. In the past, it was in the form of Qi, and then a liquid state, before eventually forming a pellet. Right now, it could be considered to have taken form!</p>
 <p>Right now, if he were to use the Seal of Roc, he could increase his powers to be at the strength of five million sun. Even if he were to use the Snake Elephant's Movement instead, he would be able to reach a strength of over two million sun. If he were up against the False Gods from Yehuang Clan right now, Qing Shui would be able to eradicate them with ease all by himself.</p>
 <p>He was quite satisfied with the strength of over five million sun. At this level, it was impossible to continue to grow stronger by multiple folds. When a Martial Emperor reached False God, the individual's power would increase by three times, but these three folds did not imply that three Peak Martial Emperors would be able to defeat an Early False God. Even if there were 30 of them, it would be impossible for them to defeat a single False God.</p>
 <p>This was the gap between False Gods and Martial Emperors. Yehuang Guwu didn't have the Heavenly Technique and neither did Puyang Qing. They seemed to need to reach a higher realm before they would be able to comprehend the Heavenly Technique.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui had reached the eighth heavenly layer and had attained the elementary Heavenly Technique. The Paragon Heavenly Technique could definitely provide a fatal blow, but it could only be used once a day. However, this was something that one should already feel happy about. The Elementary Heavenly Technique was already so amazing. Once used, it wouldn't be something that Martial Emperors and Early False Gods could withstand.</p>
 <p>The Golden Armor was passive, allowing Qing Shui to have a defense that was so powerful that others could only only cry helplessly when facing it. It had zero depletion and allowed one to permanently have defense that was three times stronger than their own base defense. It could fend off a fatal blow once a day.</p>
 <p>Even if Qing Shui stood still and didn't move an inch, Early False Gods were no match for him. It was because they wouldn't be able to break through Qing Shui's Golden Armor.</p>
 <p>The Paragon Strike was sufficient to let Qing Shui wipe out Grade One and Grade Two False Gods instantly!</p>
 <p>The moment Shadowless Paragon was utilized, it could change many things within 15 minutes.</p>
 <p>The powerful Ancient Strengthening Technique now displayed absolute power. Qing Shui was able to stand up against 100 people around his level single handedly. If they weren't strong enough, numbers alone wouldn't be able to defeat Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was satisfied. He had finally reached the eighth heavenly layer. He could be considered to have reached False God level. However, he had no idea what grade he was at, but did he give it much thought. He was only concerned with his own Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu left. She was not considered an outsider anyway. Qing Shui just got some water and then added in some of the Five Elements Spring of Life. Qing Shui needed to stabilize his power. This act wasn't one which could increase one's strength directly, but was much more effective in increasing one's abilities.</p>
 <p>This was akin to turning a cup into a bucket. One way was to increase the water in the cup. While the water in the bucket might not be as much as the water in the cup at first, the cup would be filled to the brim very quickly while the bucket would be able to hold more water than the cup in the long run.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hadn't expected that he had also caused the water in his bathtub to become so cloudy. It was even more turbid than usual, as Yehuang Guwu had used some as well.</p>
 <p>After changing into a new set of clothes, Qing Shui felt that his body had never felt so refreshed. This was how it really felt like to be glowing in health. His entire body felt very refreshed, as if all the pores on his body were opened up and the Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth was entering his body.</p>
 <p>Reaching the eighth heavenly layer changed a lot of things. He might be able to do a lot of things he couldn't before.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui came out from the room, Yehuang Guwu, Soulsearch, Yuan Su, and Li Ji were all around. When they saw Qing Shui coming out, they smiled and greeted him. They knew that Qing Shui was fine. Only Qing Shui and Yehuang Guwu knew of the danger from earlier.</p>
 <p>Therefore, to others, everything seemed to be very peaceful.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, Brother, you seem to be different from usual." Soulsearch looked at Qing Shui and said. However, he couldn't really tell what was different.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu looked at Qing Shui. This man was a little bewitching, but that didn't affect his manliness. His body was very proportionate as well. Yehuang Guwu knew well that Qing Shui's body was very strong. Thinking of this, she blushed. She had spent a very long time with him earlier on.</p>
 <p>Right now, the Imperial Cuisine Hall had grown very powerful. Yehuang Guwu was now also considered a member of the Imperial Cuisine Hall. She wasn't a physician, but had 10% ownership of the place. This was because Qing Shui felt that he should be leaving soon and there had to be someone to watch over the Imperial Cuisine Hall's development. There were no problems with Soulsearch's and Yuan Su's medical skills. With Yehuang Guwu here, this place would definitely be safe.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu had attained a breakthrough to False God. Right now, she was practically able to hold her weight against the entire Yehuang Clan. Right now, if Yehuang Guwu called out six White Tigers, even Qing Shui would find it a little hard to manage. Of course, this was unless he activated the Paragon Heavenly Technique.</p>
 <p>Since he went into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal in the day, there wasn't a need for him to head there at night. Moreover, he had crossed the last line with Yehuang Guwu. Usually, Qing Shui had to hold it in and suppress his occasional desires through cultivation. However, Yehuang Guwu had just gotten a taste of sex and could be said to have been given a brand new lease on life. She kept on asking for more.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, let's not go on. The sun is going to come up soon." Yehuang Guwu curled up in Qing Shui's arms. This mature lady was like a demoness who would make one crave for her no matter what pose she took.</p>
 <p>"Then is our little demoness full now?" Qing Shui smiled and nibbled on her earlobe.</p>
 <p>"I'm full, very full."</p>
 <p>Earlier on, whenever she said that she wasn't full, what came for her would be Qing Shui going on a rampage. RIght now, her entire body felt limp, and she had not even a single ounce of energy left in her. "Qing Shui, do you know that Sister Su likes you?" Yehuang Guwu asked softly. She didn't look at Qing Shui, but as they were in each other's embrace, she could sense that his body moved a little unnaturally.</p>
 <p>"I don't. Does Little Wuwu know about what has happened between us?" Qing Shui smiled and asked. To be honest, Qing Shui did have some feelings for her back then, but in the end, it seemed as if they had gone on their separate ways on a sour note. If they hadn't met here, they would probably never have met each other again in this entire lifetime.</p>
 <p>And for them to have met each other now... Could it be that their affinity with each other wasn't over yet?</p>
 <p>"I know. She told me all about it. Back then, she did what she did because she was afraid of falling in love with you. Even though the two of you hadn't met each other for so many years, she didn’t forget about you. However, she's also a person with great pride and thus didn't go to look for you. When she met you here, everything seemed to make sense to her now. She said that if time could go back, even if the same thing were to happen, she would look for you again." Yehuang Guwu smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Aren't you angry that someone is snatching your man from you?"</p>
 <p>"I am. Of course I am. There's no woman who would be willing to share a man with others. It's the same as a man being unwilling to share a woman with other men. However, this is how society is. Which man with some abilities isn't with multiple wives and concubines? I like you, I love you, and thus I'll accept everything about you. As long as there's a woman you like, I'll be willing to bring the two of you together." Yehuang Guwu spoke in a soft voice, but Qing Shui could sense that what she said was true...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hugged her tightly, feeling very thankful toward her. It wasn't because he was thankful that she could be his wingwoman, but rather he was grateful towards the love she had for him.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, Sister Su is a good lady. I have spoken with her before and can feel that her love for you is very deep. If she isn't able to be together with you, she'll probably find it very hard to feel happy in the future. She might even live the rest of her life alone." Yehuang Guwu lifted her head and said, looking at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui lowered his head and looked at this woman whose charms could cause the fall of cities. He could also see the deep trench between the twin peaks.</p>
 <p>"We've already waited for so many years. There's no need for us to be anxious right now. Since we meet each other often, let's just take things as they come. What do you think?" Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</p>
 <p>"Alright, but won't you feel that it's a pity to leave such a great beauty?" Yehuang Guwu blinked her sexy and sacred looking beautiful eyes.</p>
 <p>"A demonic, mature elder sister like you is the type that I love the most. For you, I'm willing to be sucked dry to death." Qing Shui then turned over and intoxicating cries rang out in the room once again.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Three days later, Qing Shui used the Five Elements Divine Flag to head back to the Qing Clan. As for the Dancing Phoenix Continent, he could wait a little more. There was no hurry.</p>
 <p>This was the first time he had gone back after reaching the eighth heavenly layer.</p>
 <p>No matter how busy he was, Qing Shui would always return once a month. Since he had told his family that he would return once a month, they would worry if he didn't. Since he had kept to his words and returned monthly, anyone would assume that Qing Shui had gotten into trouble and wasn't able to leave if he were to suddenly not return one month. What if something had happened to him and he would never be able to return?</p>
 <p>Therefore, Qing Shui would always try his best to return. However, this time around, Qing Shui would tell them some things so that in the future, even if he couldn't come back, they wouldn't have to worry. He had also said something similar in the past. However, if he could let his family know of his abilities this time around, they wouldn't feel too worried even if he didn't come back.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui would come back once a month. Although he felt very happy each time he did, he also felt that this chance wasn't something that had come easily. If he didn't have the Five Elements Divine Flag, he would have no means of coming back every month. Then, the development of his clan would have slowed down by several decades or even longer.</p>
 <p>However, right now, that wouldn't happen. Whenever Qing Shui got his hands on something good, he would be able to share it with the people at home, thereby increasing the rate of their cultivation. He could also help to strengthen the foundations of the clan's younger generation. If it was in the past, moving across the continents would have taken over ten, or even up to twenty years. The impact was tremendous.</p>
 <p>Very soon, Qing Shui arrived at the Qing Clan. Although everyone felt very happy to see him back, as time passed, everything became habitual. Despite this, they still felt very happy to see him. After all, the ladies were only able to meet their husband once a month. For a loving couple, one would always feel great yearning and anticipation if they were only to meet once a month.</p>
 <p>The Qing Clan's development was very rapid. This time around, Qing Shui was primarily planning to help them strengthen their foundations using the Five Elements Spring of Life.</p>
 <p>There was still no news of Yiye Jiange. The two young kids were the ones who changed the most each time he came back. Right now, Qing Shui's branch alone had quite a number of people. However, the entire Qing Clan stayed in a big manor and were on very good terms.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was the pillar of the entire clan. There wasn't even a clan head amongst them. Qing Luo had long washed his hands of things and although Qing Yi was Qing Shui's mother, she would always let Canghai Mingyue and the others discuss first to see what should be done. Right now, it was the time for Qing Shui and his generation to lead. She was happy to be free from dealing with all the troubles. Qing Yi would spend her time playing with her grandchildren and was very happy. Qing Yi was good with educating the kids and the children were all very close with their young and beautiful grandmother. Even Qing Ming, who was the hardest to manage, would rarely go against Qing Yi.</p>
 <p>Qing Ming knew that his grandmother had the greatest say in Qing Clan. As long as she gave the word, there was no one who wouldn't listen to her. Moreover, their grandmother had always treated them the best.</p>
