 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">AST 1913 - What Will Come Would Eventually Come </span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unconsciously, three days had passed. It was peaceful during this period of time, which surprised Qing Shui quite a bit. Even though the news of the Grand State Master’s death would not travel to the Great Confucian Empire that quickly, it wouldn’t take more than three days for the news to spread to their ears―that was if the other party had not taken any action yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qing Shui did not believe that they would not take action in regards to the current incident. The more likely situation was that they hadn’t taken any action yet. Perhaps the Great Confucian Empire wasn't that affected by the loss of one Grand State Master. Despite that, dignity was extremely important to the Great Confucian Empire. Furthermore, they still had the Five Poison Immortal Palace despite the death of the Grand State Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within these three days, Qing Shui would cultivate whenever he had nothing to do. He did not have to familiarize himself with this sort of power after going through the breakthrough this time, as if he was born with it. Because of that, Qing Shui was in disbelief that he had a terrifying resistance to the damage received.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">200 Million Dao Force!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stood there motionlessly and thought about how both the Grand State Master and the Poison Dragon King weren’t able to cause any damage to him. Because of &nbsp;these thoughts, he developed an impulse to look for the Great Confucian Empire and the Five Poison Celestial Sect for a fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he was to fight based on his current power, his prowess should have crossed several thresholds as compared to before. Even so, his wives would have to train themselves harder. Their power had been growing increasingly fast, but still much slower than Qing Shui’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Lingfeng and Yi Tong, on the other hand, had fallen behind in terms of their strength. Most of the ladies had already preceded the two of them, which included Yiye Jiange, Qing Hanye, Tantai Lingyan, Muyun Qingge, and Qin Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite the fact that their powers were inferior to the others, the rate of their progress had always been steadily increasing over time. The speed of improvement was decent, which was why Qing Shui decided not to hasten their growth for the time being. There were advantages and disadvantages to that. Normally, he would only employ such method when it became impossible for one to increase their power, or that they had not been improving for a very long period of time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Qing Shui was to use such method, their power would increase within half a year to a year or so, but they would never be able to enhance their strength by themselves, unless they were able to receive an enlightenment or some sort of Heavenly and Earthly Treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to the fact that their powers had been increasing, Qing Shui decided that he would not use this method on them, unless they found themselves unable to break through the bottleneck of their cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt relieved when he thought about his fortuitous encounter. It would be impossible for everyone to be like him as everything would require time to bear fruit. A watched pot never boils and he was the one being impatient anyway. They were already considered exceptionally lucky. He was the problem—he whose heart wasn’t content was like a snake that tried to swallow an elephant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had been spending days being precarious, but now he felt like there was nothing to be worried about. Even so, the others remained on edge. Despite the trepidation, they knew that Qing Shui was their rock and backbone. Upon seeing that Qing Shui was fine, they knew that his strength had grown, but to what extent, they had no idea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had been living like a fish in a water for the past few days. Qing Hanye was now yearning for more after her first time having sex with him. After getting her first taste in sex, she would leave the door unlocked so that they would be able to linger until midnight. Both of them were in possession of Nine Yang and Nine Yin body respectively. Not only was it perfectly safe on their bodies, their powers would become more refined as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Qing Shui's nameless technique would have a profound growth in the beginning, there would still be an obvious growth following the subsequent period of time. Normally, it would be the same as the ladies after half a month—there would be a boost but it would be more of a slight change to the body, including nerves, bones, blood vessels, as well as vital organs. This type of boost was considered insignificant, and the benefit wasn't that obvious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon becoming closer in their relationship, Qing Shui discovered how charming this obsequious woman was. If it wasn't for his strong physique, he might not be able to keep up with her. Beautiful women would definitely bring calamity to the country and its people. Men would lose their lives because of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those who did not possess special vitality were definitely incompatible with women who could bring disaster to a country. Otherwise, they would have lost their lives fairly quickly. This was also the reason why a myriad of beautiful women became a widow, and perhaps the most important reason why women often met with tragic end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dongfang State Master seemed to have become part of the community within the Imperial Cuisine Hall by forging closer bonds with the other ladies. Their relationship had grown better with each passing day. This sometimes perplexed Qing Shui. Women were indeed strange creatures, didn't they say beautiful women were natural enemies to one another?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange did not plan on returning to the Sunset Sea King Palace for now; Qing Hanye did not even think of going back to Dragonwolf Palace either. It seemed like they were outnumbered should they wish to contend against the Great Confucian Empire. Truly, they had lost in terms of quantity. Of course, this was the same for their strength as well. But in this case, Qing Shui would be the only exception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If his opponent was at the strength of the previous Grand State Master, then he had nothing to worry about because it would be easy for him to kill the enemy based on his current strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Xiu would now spend most of the time staying with Qing Shui. The little kid had already begun hobbling and walking by himself. Due to Yiye Jiange’s cultivation, Qing Shui took up the responsibility in taking care of Qing Xiu. Of course, he had some help from the ladies too. Whenever they were free, they would take care of the kid with Qing Shui together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The little kid would not cry easily and he could play all by himself. He was quite gluttonous too, and because of that, Qing Shui felt at ease. Besides eating, the kid would spend much of his time sleeping. Over the course of time, Qing Shui realized that taking care of kids wasn’t that difficult after all. Moreover, he was a doctor, which meant that it would be more convenient as the most difficult part of raising kids during his past life was that they would become ill easily. Furthermore, they couldn’t exactly talk, so they would not be able to cooperate with him on the appropriate treatment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything was alright now. Qing Xiu’s body constitution was excellent as he had never been sick before. On top of that, Qing Shui would always be there for him, so there was really nothing to be concerned of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Yi Tong realized that Qing Shui had been taking good care of Qing Xiu, he would sometimes hand over his son for Qing Shui to look after as well. Qing Shui wasn’t playing around when it came to his role as a godfather.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In actuality, Yi Tong and Ling Fei would only allow Qing Shui to look after their son when they were focusing on their cultivation, which wasn’t a frequent occurrence. Due to the existence of the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui wouldn’t need to cultivate during the day most of the time. Aside from spending some time to guide them, he would make time for Yiye Jiange as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before this, Yu Niang had always been the one looking after their children and Yiye Jiange would be the one to look after his child at the Sunset Sea King Palace. The nannies could never receive Yiye Jiange’s approval for nursing the child. She had everything planned out to the tee. During these few years, she would focus on taking care of her son and nothing else.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now Qing Shui was there to look after their son, so Yiye Jiange was ecstatic about it. Whenever she saw the happy expression on Qing Shui’s face as he held his son in his arms, an extremely warm feeling would envelop her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The days of respite ended in just one week. This morning, Qing Shui continued to cultivate his Taichi fists in the Imperial Cuisine Hall as usual. He faced the east, but there was no sun. The sun in Linhai City could only be seen once in dozen days after all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Qing Shui had stopped his cultivation, he noticed a group of black dots flying toward his direction rapidly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Qing Shui’s eyesight was exceptional, he still couldn’t see the entities clearly. After all, the black dots were still far away. Despite the ambiguity of the dots, he had a feeling that the moment had finally arrived. What would come would eventually come.</span></p>

Qing Shui was also preparing the formation just in case something might happen as formations were considered to be Qing Shui’s greatest life-saving ability. Although some formations were highly lethal, Qing Shui felt that he could rely most on his Guardian, Trap Formation, and a few other formations that the enemies would have a hard time to break once they had been set up. Meanwhile, Qing Shui could utilize the formation to seek chances to retreat or counterattack.</span></p>

Qing Shui could see those black dots at the distance much clearer. The distance between Qing Shui and the black dots were less than 10 li away.</span></p>
