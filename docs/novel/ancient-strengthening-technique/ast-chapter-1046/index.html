 <p><strong>AST 1046 - Grade Three Nine Continents Boots, Powerful, Nine Continents Steps</strong></p>
 <p>Celebrations for the new year passed by very quickly. During this time, Qing Shui used the best formation flags to set up several Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formations around Qing Clan’s manor. It was because they were heading for Northern Sacred Lu Continent.</p>
 <p>In the end, there was Qing Shui, Yiye Jiange, Luan Luan, Di Qing, Hai Dongqing, Lin Zhanhan, and Little Fatty. Yu Ruyan was joining them as well since Qing Shui had informed her.</p>
 <p>There were many people who came to send them off, including Demon Gate, Buddha Sect, and Tang Manor. However, there were also many of them who would be heading for Northern Sacred Lu Continent since they had also received news about the Ancient Ruins.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and the seven others rode the huge Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and went on their way. This time around, they were heading for Northern Sacred Lu Continent’s Ancient Ruins. Qing Shui had originally wanted make the trip with Yiye Jiange, Luan Luan, and Lin Zhanhan only. However, he couldn’t win against the other ladies and he felt that it would be good for them to go train themselves too and thus he had agreed. With their cultivation level, they’ll definitely be able to enter.</p>
 <p>However, as Mingyue Gelou and Canghai Mingyue needed to take care of the children, they stayed behind. With them around, Qing Shui would feel assured as well. Moreover, he was only going to head for Northern Sacred Lu Continent.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui waved as they sent him off and only turned away until they were no longer in sight. Thinking of how the next time they met might be ten years or even several decades later, he couldn’t help but feel a little sad.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had left almost all of his stocked items in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal behind in Qing Clan. Canghai Mingyue, Mingyue Gelou, and the other members of Qing Clan also had a heavy heart. They knew what the situation was. In the past, when Qing Shui went off, they hadn’t felt like this before.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t say anything. When the matter with the Lion King’s Ridge was over, he would tell the ladies who were with him and let them inform the other members of Qing Clan. This time around, he had decided to head to the other Four Continents alone. Of course, this was on the condition that the matter with the Lion King’s Ridge was handled successfully. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be a need for him to head for the other Four Continents.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>The Northern Sacred Lu Continent was situated in the North and it was about the same size as Central Continent. The temperatures here were relatively lower and many places were all extremely cold. There would be ice-cold tornadoes which could frost up iron and have them shatter into pieces. This showed how terrifying the cold was.</p>
 <p>On the way, everyone was very quiet, even Luan Luan. Everyone knew what was going on, especially Yiye Jiange, Lin Zhanhan, and Luan Luan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui currently didn’t know much about the Lion King’s Ridge, but he had the confidence to deal with them. He headed for the Ancient Ruins first, hoping to come into contact with some amazing encounter. Maybe he could get his hands on a treasure or have a certain martial technique leveling up. It would be best if he could attain a breakthrough to the 8th Heavenly Layer.</p>
 <p>However, everything was basically possible except attaining the 8th Heavenly Layer. He didn’t hold onto any wishful hope and it was just a fleeting thought.</p>
 <p>At the thought of the Ancient Ruins, Qing Shui thought of Yu He. He might encounter her somewhere. If his guess wasn’t wrong, she would definitely be there. Moreover, when they parted last time, she was heading for the Northern Sacred Lu Continent.</p>
 <p>A day passed by and the sky was just starting to turn dark. They managed to reach Tongjiang City and decided to stay for the night. Qing Shui already had everything planned out. They would travel in the day and the night, then he would enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal for his training.</p>
 <p>Before entering the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui performed the Nine Continent Steps as usual. However, after he used it once, Qing Shui was stunned. He like a person who had made a hole through the paper on the windows. He was used to traveling with the Nine Continents Steps and advancing 200,000 li before using it to travel back. This time around, he did the same but there was great joy surging in his heart.</p>
 <p>He could feel that his Nine Continents Steps had leveled up.</p>
 <p>Excited, Qing Shui quickly entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, then he entered his consciousness to sense the Nine Continents Boots’ abilities.</p>
 <p>Refined from the star fragments and strange beasts in the World of the Nine Continents. Has a mysterious and unfathomable ability.</p>
 <p>Increases speed by two folds; reduces depletion by two folds; hard for even a Martial Emperor to harm it in the slightest. Comes with the battle technique Nine Continents Steps.</p>
 <p>Mmm, Qing Shui noticed that it has changed. In the past, its speed had increased by one fold; reduced depletion by one fold. Additionally, those below the Martial Emperor level wouldn’t be able to inflict any damage. Right now, it could actually increase his speed by two folds and reduced depletion by two folds. Furthermore, even a Martial Emperor would find it hard to inflict any damage onto it. It seemed that this upgrade was very powerful. Just the additional one fold increment to his speed would let Qing Shui become terrifyingly strong.</p>
 <p>Nine Continent Steps: Activating the Nine Continent Boots and the Nine Continent Steps allows the user to instantly travel 400,000 li in a straight line. Currently at the third level, Realm of Subduing Dragon and Tiger, can be used four times in a day.</p>
 <p>The user of the Nine Continents Steps could concurrently bring along with him all living things within a ten-meter radius from him, including humans, demonic beasts and others.</p>
 <p>Prerequisite: Martial Emperor level!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was completely stunned from this tremendous surprise. This was simply as if someone had given him a pillow when he dozed off. The Nine Continents Boots was too powerful. This was truly a Divine Artifact. Although it couldn’t be considered one yet, to Qing Shui, it was already one.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui left his consciousness. In the past, he would need to look at the Nine Continents Boots directly but now he could sense it even from his consciousness. He liked this feeling. This gave him the feeling as if he was one with the Nine Continents Boots.</p>
 <p>Mmm, it recognizes its owner!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was suddenly stunned by this strange thought. He had a spiritual connection with the Nine Continents Boots. He had gotten hurt on multiple occasions, causing it to be dyed in his blood on multiple occasions. It was already imprinted by him.</p>
 <p>He didn't know when it had started and when he gained this connection with it. It was a very warm feeling. It might have started to recognize its owner since a very long time ago but since the Nine Continents Boots wasn't strong enough, the connection was very weak. When it leveled up the other time, it should have become slightly stronger and now that it had upgraded again, the connection was even stronger than before.</p>
 <p>Going through one round of tempering!</p>
 <p>Each time he tempered his magic treasures, he would also temper the Nine Continents Boots. Moreover, he would use the Nine Continents Steps daily and thus the leveling up of the Nine Continents Boots should be related to both its usage and its tempering.</p>
 <p>Next, Qing Shui left the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and headed back using the Nine Continents Steps. He then used the Nine Continents Steps once again. This time around, it was 400,000 li. He then went in the opposite direction again.</p>
 <p>He arrived above Tongjiang City's Cloudway Inn When he tried to use the Nine Continents Steps once again, there were no more reactions. A total of four times. It could already be considered quite powerful. With each usage allowing him to travel for 400,000 li, four times would equal 1.6 million li in total. It was four times stronger than before. In this vast World of the Nine Continents, the Nine Continents Steps could undoubtedly be called a paragon. A paragon which could allow one to kill and rob another, chase a target over long distances and also escape.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui once again entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and was even more motivated to got through his cultivation. The changes to the Nine Continents Boots had filled him with a strong determination. All the living things that were within a ten-meter radius away from him could be brought along with his Nine Continents Steps alone. Non-living things could just be stored in his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>It was about a circle with an area of over 60 square meters. He could bring along a lot of people but it was a pity that he would need to recall his Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, it was just too big. However, Qing Shui was already satisfied. With that, not only would he be able to save some time on his travel to the Northern Sacred Lu Continent, it also made their journey a lot safer.</p>
 <p>They could just skip over the dangerous areas and when they encountered danger, he could just use the Nine Continents Steps and escape with the others. Right now, to Qing Shui, dangers would usually mean a powerful group of demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation!</p>
 <p>Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm!</p>
 <p>These two were the skills which Qing Shui had prioritized. Of course, he wouldn't forget about the Primordial Flame Whip either. The battle technique which he had created was also extremely powerful, especially the Primordial Flame Drill.</p>
 <p>Once Qing Shui started his cultivation, he would be completely engrossed and intoxicated, not bothering about any worries. Here, there was no one who would disturb him. He left a Jade Emperor Bee in the room to constantly keep a lookout and alert him if a commotion occurred outside.</p>
 <p>Hundred Forms of the Tiger. Qing Shui repeatedly tried to draw out each form of the tiger. The more he progressed, the more he found it hard to bring out its charm. However, right now, he did his drawing very leisurely and was very relaxed. He felt that this method greatly suited his current situation and his progress was much better than before.</p>
 <p>The next day, they continued on their journey and after Qing Shui explained the situation, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant which was flying in mid-air suddenly disappeared.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Steps!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was only trying it out since this was the first use. Even if he were to fail, he could still head back.</p>
 <p>When he tried this previously, he could travel immediately and a faint glowing energy circle had formed around his body. This time around, it was the same, except the glowing circle was bigger than before, big enough to encompass the group.</p>
 <p>So this was how it worked!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui let out a sigh of relief. It could finally be done. Right now, it would be easier for him to bring the people around with him. The Grade Three Nine Continents Boots and the Nine Continents Steps had such great power already. If given time, would he really be able to travel across the Southern Sea just like that...</p>
 <p>Once they stopped, Qing Shui performed the Nine Continents Steps once again!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used it three consecutive times and left the last one for when they were ready to stop and find a place to stay for the night. Alternatively, Qing Shui could also use it after he came out from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. That would be the last little bit of time in a day.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Right now, the speed at which they were traveling could only be described as monstrous. Compared to the past, this was too exhilarating. In the end, he only used the Nine Continents Steps four times and left the remaining time for the ladies to train.</p>
 <p>This would save a lot of traveling time in the future and increases one's cultivation time. Moreover, if the journey wasn't urgent, he could just travel using this method and stop by at places he was interested in.</p>
 <p>In the day, they would cultivate and Qing Shui would enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. In the end, the five-colored cane was still eventually returned to the old man. A cultivator's weapon was his second life and although it might be a bit of an exaggeration, a weapon was truly very important to a cultivator. It was one's pride. Therefore, Qing Shui returned it. However, in exchange, the old man gave him a very large piece of Five-Colored Stone.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui decided to reforge the Big Dipper Sword in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He wanted to merge in some of the Five-Colored Stone into the Big Dipper Sword and see if it could increase the prowess of its spirit energy attacks.</p>
 <p>This led Qing Shui to think of his previous life. When priests went about conducting rituals, many of them would use the ‘Big Dipper Sword’ or swords made from the wood of peach trees. Thinking of this, Qing Shui smiled. It was because he felt that his Big Dipper Sword was definitely stronger compared to those counterfeits.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui enjoyed forging. Everyone would actually have desires to create and desires to destroy. When he thought of this he thought of those nurturing plans or programs, as well as the people who had strong wishes to live a flirtatious life. In a sense, this was embodied the idea of creation and destruction.</p>
 <p>There was a five-colored glow on the Five-Colored Stone and it had very strong Spiritual Qi. Even ordinary people would be able to sense that the Five-Colored Stone was very precious, just like how gold would shine.</p>
 <p>He smelted and heated up the Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p>He then set fire to the Five-Colored Stone, letting it turn into liquid and slowly drip onto the Big Dipper Sword. Qing Shui's spiritual sense encompassed the Big Dipper Sword, and just like a formless hand, he used his spiritual sense to slowly guide the process, spreading out the liquefied Five-Colored Stone!</p>
