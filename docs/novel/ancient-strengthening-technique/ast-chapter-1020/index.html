 <p><strong>AST 1020 - Mo Hongluo, Demon Gate’s Plain Sailing</strong></p>
 <p>As soon as Qing Shui finished his sentence, his spirit energy bore down upon the woman. But just then, the old man spoke up.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, you don’t have to probe any further. She is indeed my daughter, Hongluo!” The old man shook his head and stopped Qing Shui’s probing with his spirit energy. The woman started sobbing right at that instant.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt relieved in his heart too after knowing that this woman was indeed Mo Hongluo. Things would be easier if he had found the woman. Tears were cascading down the woman’s cheeks like small streams right now. Qing Shui was surprised by how much tears a woman could hold.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, has Liu-Li been well?” Mo Hongluo asked Qing Shui while quivering.</p>
 <p>“Liu-Li has been very well. The family that you had given Liu-Li to treated her as their own daughter. They didn’t have any children either, only Liu-Li alone and she is like the pearl on their palms.” Qing Shui told the woman with a smile.</p>
 <p>“And you are Liu-Li’s husband?” Mo Hongluo looked at Qing Shui with her reddened eyes.</p>
 <p>“Yes. We already have an adorable daughter of our own.” Qing Shui had a blissful look on his face when he was talking about Qing Yu too.</p>
 <p>When the woman saw Qing Shui’s expression, she felt warm in her heart too. After all, she was a woman and she knew what was most important to a woman. So when she saw the look on Qing Shui’s face when he talked about Liu-Li’s daughter, she calmed down a little too. However, the eagerness of wanting to see her daughter in her heart grew more intense. So much that she felt ill at ease. She wished to see her daughter right away.</p>
 <p>Back then, she had no choice but to give the little lass away to someone else. The grief she felt in her heart was still as fresh as yesterday. She had been trying her best to not think about her all these years. But now that she had caught wind of her daughter, she was suddenly losing her control.</p>
 <p>The old man stayed silent at one side. He hadn’t spoken a word ever since he revealed that the woman was indeed Mo Hongluo. He had a very conflicted look on his face. He was the head of Demon Gate, but he believed that he was a good father. He would accept whoever his daughter loved, even if she was really going to marry someone from the Buddha Sect. He wouldn’t mind as long as his daughter was happy.</p>
 <p>However, his daughter really loved someone from the Buddha Sect. There was no way the Buddha Sect would approve of this, even if he was going to try his best to make it happen. So he could only bear the pain and reluctantly ground his daughter at home.</p>
 <p>The Demon Gate’s impression on the others was slightly more negative, or perhaps it was better to say that the Buddha Sect had a better impression on the others. In the World of the Nine Continents, the powerful figures were honored as the leader of a region. There was nothing such as good or bad. However, the Buddha Sect was still very influential. There was no way they would relate themselves with a sect like the Demon Gate through marriage. After all, the Buddha Sect’s reputation exceeded the Demon Gate by far on the surface.</p>
 <p>The old man couldn’t do anything in this situation either, so he could only let his daughter suffer. Qing Shui glanced at the old man then at the woman. He felt that this woman had suffered a lot. She was experiencing the same thing that his own mother did back then.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, I wish to see the lass.” Mo Hongluo looked at the old man apprehensively after a long while.</p>
 <p>Mo Hongluo had considered escaping with Huoyun Peng, but that was more than 30 years ago. They were now aware of the wide gap that existed between them. Unless one of them could rise above the two powerful existences, the situation would remain hopeless.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui actually wasn’t confident in coming here. That was because even the deepest affection couldn’t withstand the ordeal of time. It might be lost in history. Not only that, they had also left Huoyun Liu-Li behind.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn’t certain if both Huoyun Peng and Mo Hongluo had been wedded. From the look of things right now, it seemed like Mo Hongluo hadn’t. It was just Qing Shui’s hunch. He wasn’t entirely sure. However, her yearning towards her daughter right at this moment was real.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, it has been more than 30 years. I didn’t know Hongluo have a daughter out there. To be honest, I have also been wishing for Hongluo to be able to find a man that she loves to marry all these years and forget about the past. After all, it’s hopeless between her and Huoyun Peng. But then again this lass would rather stay alone until old age and refuse to marry anyone.” The old man sighed at Qing Shui while looking at his apprehensive daughter.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui thought about how Mo Hongluo had never married anyone else and had persevered more than 30 years, he wasn’t sure if her perseverance was for Liu-Li’s sake or for Huoyun Peng’s sake. Regardless of who it was, Qing Shui was very impressed.</p>
 <p>“Aunt, your emotions, and perseverance have greatly moved me. Do you have any wish?” Qing Shui asked Mo Hongluo earnestly.</p>
 <p>“I miss my daughter very much and also him. I really wish that all of us can be together. I’d be content even if it’s only for a day.” Mo Hongluo sighed. But she smiled wryly and shook her head as soon as she finished speaking.</p>
 <p>The old man let out a sigh once again. “Qing Shui. Although I don’t see myself as a good or kind person, I love my children and family dearly. I have my own friends too and I empathize with them too. Demon Gate isn’t any inferior to those sects with a good reputation and we don’t commit as many sins as they do, at least during the time when Demon Gate’s clan was the senior I knew. But I know that the chances of this lass’ wish coming true are zero. No matter how much the Buddha Sect emphasized on benevolence, I know that Huoyun old fellow’s heart is harder than mine, at least when it comes to dealing with his children. Perhaps that’s because he has many children or because he doesn’t have the freedom to act as how he wants to.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui understood what the old man was trying to convey. He was saying that it was futile, even if Demon Gate gave their blessing to his daughter and Huoyun Peng. So Qing Shui now knew that the greatest stopping force wasn't Demon Gate, but rather the Buddha Sect.</p>
 <p>This was a great surprise to him. But this was a good thing too, as he had saved quite a lot of troubles. Things would be easier if Demon Gate could help him when the time had come.</p>
 <p>“Aunt, Liu-Li is my wife. I will fulfill your wish. I am going to fulfill any wishes you have.” Qing Shui stated firmly at Mo Hongluo.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, do not be hasty. The Buddha Sect isn’t as simple as you think. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have let Hongluo end up in such situation. It isn’t easy for me to see her going through this as a father either.” The old man didn’t want Qing Shui to rekindle the heart of his daughter that had finally dulled with much difficulty, because if he couldn’t do this it would only add up to his daughter’s pain.</p>
 <p>After Mo Hongluo heard her father’s words, her face that was scarlet in excitement cooled down. She gave Qing Shui an agonized smile. “Thank you, Qing Shui. I wish for you to treat Liu-Li well. It has been so many years, I have already grown used to this.”</p>
 <p>“Aunt, how about I bring Liu-Li to visit you next time?” Qing Shui offered with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Really? Where is Liu-Li now?” Mo Hongluo looked at Qing Shui in surprise and anticipation.</p>
 <p>"If you were to depart now, you’ll be able to meet Liu-Li in half a day.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>“She has come to the Central Continent too?” Mo Hongluo was so worked up that her body trembled in excitement.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded his head while smiling.</p>
 <p>Mo Hongluo turned around to look at the old man. “Daddy, can I go see her? It has been so many years. I really miss her. Very, very much. I have failed her back then and made her suffer.”</p>
 <p>“I will return as soon as I see Liu-Li. Don’t worry Daddy, your daughter is a grown-up. I know how difficult this is for Daddy too and know what I should do. It’s been so many years, do you still worry about your daughter?” Mo Hongluo looked at the old man with tears streaming down her face.</p>
 <p>The corners of the old man’s eyes were a little moist too. He nodded and looked at Qing Shui. “Qing Shui, this is a reminder from me. Liu-Li will be in danger if the Buddha Sect discovered her identity. Do you understand that? They won’t allow Liu-Li to live.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was startled. The Qi aura in his entire body suddenly surged. “No one is allowed to harm Liu-Li. Not even the Buddha Sect. If they dared to do anything, I shall personally exterminate the Buddha Sect with my own hands.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s tone of voice was very calm. The Qi aura in his body was fleeting, yet it stunned the old man. Just what was his strength? It was so powerful that it was sinister. Even Zitong, the number one expert among the younger generation of Demon Gate, was nothing compared to him. The strength that he exuded after injuring the two elders had shocked him. But the aura that Qing Shui had exuded this time was terrifying, even for him.</p>
 <p>Mo Hongluo was also stunned, but a happy smile appeared on her face.</p>
 <p>“Aunt, I’m going to bring Liu-Li here tomorrow!” Qing Shui told Mo Hongluo with a smile.</p>
 <p>“I’m going there today. I can’t wait any longer.” Mo Hongluo believed Qing Shui the moment he mentioned Huoyun Liu-Li’s name. That was because this was the name that she had named her daughter with Huoyun Peng together.</p>
 <p>“Go then!”</p>
 <p>The old man told Mo Hongluo with a smile when he saw the anticipation in her.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, please wait for a moment while I prepare!”</p>
 <p>“Sure!”</p>
 <p>Mo Hongluo left quickly, leaving Qing Shui and the old man behind. Qing Shui paused for a moment before speaking. “Old man, are there many people from your Demon Gate in the other four continents?”</p>
 <p>The old man lifted his head up to look at Qing Shui. “Not many. The ones in the other four continents didn’t amount to much, but they are not willing to return either.” He replied slowly after a moment had passed.</p>
 <p>“What about the Buddha Sect? How are they in the other four continents?” Qing Shui continued asking in great interest.</p>
 <p>“It’s the same for them too. The Buddha Sect is about the same as Demon Gate. Otherwise, such situations where one couldn’t do anything about the other wouldn’t happen in the first place. The waters of the other four continents are profound. Qing Shui, the strength of Buddha Sect among the five continents must not be underestimated. Do not be reckless.” The old man seemed to have seen through Qing Shui’s intention.</p>
 <p>“I understand, Old Man. I wish to know the strength that can be exhibited by the most powerful person in the Buddha Sect of the five continents.” Qing Shui inquired after hesitating for a moment.</p>
 <p>When the old man heard Qing Shui’s question, he looked at Qing Shui pensively and shook his head. “To be honest, I am not too sure either. Many years ago, the strongest from the Buddha Sect could unleash the strength of 8,000 stars. I’m not too sure about now.”</p>
 <p>So it was 8,000 stars of strength back in many years ago. He wondered if that person had gone to the other four continents or was still around in the five continents. However, Qing Shui wasn’t too worried about this 8,000 stars of strength. It would be exceptionally difficult for a cultivator with 8,000 stars to remain here and improve. There must’ve been some reasons if there was anyone with the strength of 8,000 stars who still stayed in the five continents. Perhaps it was because their strength could no longer be improved, or because they had commitments here. Otherwise, they would have definitely gone to the other four continents.</p>
 <p>Just then, Mo Hongluo came out. She had changed her clothes. “Daddy, then I shall leave with Qing Shui now.” She informed the old man with a smile.</p>
 <p>The old man nodded his head. “Be safe on your journey!”</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, Old Man. Liu-Li and I shall visit you again later.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Sure. You better remember your own words.” The old man laughed happily.</p>
 <p>……...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rode on the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and made their way towards Fair Wind City. He didn’t expect things to go this smoothly this time. Not only did he settle the matter with Demon Gate, they were also willing to lend him a hand when necessary. However, he had decided to rely on himself in the end. He couldn’t rely on anyone else on this matter. Otherwise, Mo Hongluo wouldn’t have been in such pain.</p>
 <p>Mo Hongluo stared at the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant then turned around to look at Qing Shui. She was also a cultivator, a quite decent one too. She was a Peak Martial Saint. In a sect like Demon Gate and as the daughter of Demon Gate’s head, her strength was only considered as normal and nothing too special.</p>
