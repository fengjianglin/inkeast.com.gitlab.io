 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had been here for half a year and as he observed, Qing Ci's improvement was the greatest. Not only had she grasped Meridians Knocking Soul Pulling, but her understanding of medicinal herbs had also become highly proficient. Qing Shui used medicinal pills and other methods to raise her cultivation by a lot, especially her Yin-Yang Finger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui helped her to increase the prowess of her Yin-Yang Finger a little. He had also taught Qing Ci some martial arts and some more vicious means of striking acupuncture points and meridian channels. If she hit the right spot, the enemy could either suffer from serious injuries or even lose his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Attacks like these required a person to have a good understanding of acupuncture points, as well as adequate mastery of technique to perform the skill. There were many acupuncture points which other people were unaware of. The acupuncture points that people knew in Qing Shui's previous life, was just a very small portion of them. It was only now that Qing Shui knew about the hidden acupuncture points on the human body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Barbarian Emperor, Lan Lingfeng, Yin Tong, and the few ladies were all learning as well. Qing Shui's future development path was to strike acupuncture points, along with continuous combos of massacring techniques. If he was to excel in one of them, he would be able to kill stronger opponents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Learning all of these required the use of Hidden Force, Transformation Force, as well as the Hitting A Cow Through A Mountain. He could even attain the legendary level of being able to ignore defenses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Qing Shui's previous life, one could only master Hidden Force and Transformation Force after attaining a certain level in their fist arts. In fact, there were many levels one could achieve in this world, but most people weren't proficient in them. This world pursued pure power and as a comparison, that was a simple thing which people managed to master without spending the extra effort to intentionally learn it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Hidden Force and Transformation Force in this world were very rough, but their prowess was amazing. This was what Qing Shui felt. Therefore, this was the type of power he was trying to teach those young men.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't know about martial arts in his previous life, but he enjoyed watching them and also liked to read on some descriptions regarding martial arts. After arriving in this world, he managed to learn a lot of things by himself. Moreover, there was also the Ancient Strengthening Technique which he had with him. There were detailed descriptions inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Qing Shui knew that the Hidden Force and Transformation Force in this world were of a much higher level than his previous one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For example, the prowess of a martial technique which a kindergartener child could display, couldn't be compared with that of a strong man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Maybe it was the difference in starting point and environment that made this obvious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't consider this as a problem. After half a year, these people only managed to grasp an inkling of it. Despite so, the improvement was still significant and their battle prowess had increased by over a notch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui decided to head to the Linhai City to take a look at the few ladies. Considering the time, Qing Hanye should be giving birth soon. It was very convenient for him to head over there from where he was. He looked for Yu Xixuan and got her help to take care of the Imperial Cuisine Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew about this lady’s strength; she was already at the seventh level of Divinity. Therefore, he didn't find it strange when Zhang Miaoyun mentioned Yu Xixuan's exceptional background and that she had come from the True Nine Continents World.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Xixuan naturally didn't have any problems with his request and agreed immediately. Qing Shui knew that the Imperial Cuisine Hall was basically very safe now. Ordinary people wouldn't be able to harm them. The Barbarian Emperor, Lan Lingfeng, Yu Xixuan, Qing Ci, and the others were considered top-notch experts now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He used the Five Elements Divine Flags directly to arrived in the Divine Cave. Qing Shui first headed to the Imperial Cuisine Hall. The Linhai City was the same as it had been. Also, as long as the Great Confucian Empire was here, no one would dare to lay their hands on the Imperial Cuisine Hall. Moreover, the Lan Clan was also getting increasingly prominent and their strength wasn't far from the Imperial Cuisine Hall. There was also the Ziche Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, there was only Tianyi, Yu Niang, and their children in the Imperial Cuisine Hall. Back then, this was Qing Shui's Imperial Cuisine Hall, but now, it had become Yu Niang's and Tianyi's.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Previously, this place had belonged to the Hua Clan. Qing Shui then thought about it. He recalled that the Imperial Cuisine Hall in the Great Shang City also belonged to the Lang Clan previously. It seemed that they had all been "gifted" by others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Niang and the others were naturally very happy to see Qing Shui. Yu Niang saw Qing Shui as if he was her real brother, one who was closer than a blood kin. He was also Tianyi's benefactor, who had given him a new lease of life. Right now, Tianyi was also the most famous miraculous physician here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui always had a goal, which was to set up an Imperial Cuisine Hall in every place he headed to. He wanted the Imperial Cuisine Hall to grow and become strong in this world. However, while it was easy to set up more Imperial Cuisine Halls, it required fate and effort, to get people who could provide medical treatments. Thankfully, things went well in the Great Shang City with Qing Ci around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stayed in the Imperial Cuisine Hall for about half a day before he left. It was sufficient to know that everything was going well. He then made a trip to the Great Confucian Empire's palace, met the Great Confucian Empire's Old man and Wen Jian, giving them quite a lot of good stuff including delicacies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the two old men still had a few decades in their lives, Qing Shui helped to increase their lifespan a little more. It was less than 100 years, but was over 50 years. To these two old men, their cultivation level was no longer important. They were strong enough, but they didn't have any hopes to attain a breakthrough anymore. Therefore, they rarely cultivated now and would spend their time drinking tea, enjoying good food, or playing chess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A day passed by just like this. Qing Shui got to know from Xia Clan's Old Ancestor that nothing had happened at the Sunset Sea King Palace. Although that place was in the ocean domain, the Great Confucian Empire could still take care of them a little. They could still manage to find out if there were any major events happening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui rushed over to the Sunset Sea King Palace, he sensed the throbbing of a life, an invisible force that was tugging at him. Qing Shui's mind swirled and he rapidly rushed toward the Sunset Sea King Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mmm, Qing Shui!" Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui and blocked his way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the entrance to the room. Qing Shui knew that Qing Hanye was giving birth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How're things?" Qing Shui asked, concerned. Muyun Qingge and the others were around as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There's no need to worry. We've found the best physician who handles childbirth." Luo Qingcheng quickly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wa!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A loud baby's cry rang out at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui heaved a sigh of relief. With him around, nothing would happen. However, he would still feel worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long later, a female physician came out and told them that they could now enter. She then shared with them on how they should take care of Qing Hanye and the child before leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing the child's cry, Qing Shui headed to the kitchen to make a bowl of All Aspect Nourishment Soup before entering the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye didn't rest but was looking at the child, while leaning against the bed. The few ladies had all gathered around. At this moment, Qing Shui entered, carrying the bowl of piping hot nourishment soup. When Qing Hanye saw Qing Shui, she was clearly stunned for a moment. From her expression, Qing Shui knew that the ladies didn't tell her about his arrival.</span></p>

Qing Shui looked at the kid, it was a boy. Although it was a newborn, it looked very exquisite. He opened his big pair of black eyes that seemed to be filled with curiosity about this world. Qing Shui carried him for a while before putting him down and then started to feed Qing Hanye the soup.</span></p>

He and Qing Hanye had Nine Yang Physique and Nine Yin Physique respectively. This child was a boy and would basically have a Nine Yang Physique. However, his Nine Yang Physique wasn't as strong as Qing Shui's. This was because of the offset from Qing Hanye's physique.&nbsp;</span></p>
