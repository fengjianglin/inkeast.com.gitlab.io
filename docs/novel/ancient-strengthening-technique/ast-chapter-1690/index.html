 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">AST 1690 - Women are Trouble?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The things here gradually settled down. Qing Shui initially assumed that the Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace would soon find their way over. What surprised him was that even though half a month had passed, there were no signs of any commotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made him somewhat shocked. After all, the third Palace master died here. If he assumed that his opponent was scared because of the strength he displayed, it would be somewhat ridiculous. But right now, Qing Shui also truly had no wish to go and antagonize the Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If this was in the past, Qing Shui would definitely have hunted them down in their nest. But right now, he discovered that his strength was still not sufficient to be successful in every endeavor. Although there was no doubt he was very powerful, and that there weren’t many who could defeat him in a one-on-one situation, it didn’t mean that he was invincible. In addition, there were too many people he was close to around him. There were certainly some enemies who would stoop to any methods to deal with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After this matter, many powers in the surroundings felt great respect for the Sunset Palace. Before this, the North Sea Dragon King Palace was the strongest power here, and everyone also followed them blindly, taking them as their only guide. Now that the Sunset Palace replaced the North Sea Dragon King Palace as the leading power, there were many who came by to profess their determination to stand with them during this period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With regards to this, Qing Shui didn’t feel anything. He thought of what these people did when the North Sea Dragon King Palace was vanquished. Since they could do this to a fallen leading power, would they do the same in the future to the Sunset Sea King Palace if it fell as well?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sharing calamity.. these words were easily said, but not so easily done. It was too precious. Only in times of calamity would one’s true feelings appear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was also a sentence, “A person of great moral stature does not remember, forgive, and forget the offences committed by a person of low moral stature.” The Sunset Palace Mistress wasn’t so polite to those who came to profess their determination to stand together, but she didn’t do anything to deliberately make things difficult for them either. This was a normal social phenomenon. Right now, what needed to be done was to let the Sunset Sea King Palace continue growing stronger. If not, they may end up like the North Sea Dragon King Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Victors were kings, as it was all the survival of the fittest. There wasn’t going to be sympathy among the cultivators of this strength-oriented world. Being merciful to one’s enemies was equivalent to being cruel to oneself. Sometimes, things would become like this because of the bit by bit accumulation of one’s past experiences. This was a kind of rule. With no strength to change it, one could only follow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very swiftly, the vast majority of the minor and major powers of this region all decided to stand with the Sunset Sea King Palace. This was also a kind of rule. They needed protection, while the Sunset Sea King Palace needed these people for expansion. There was strength in numbers. No matter what, one could not neglect the gathered cohesiveness and energy that came from the soul when so many people gathered for a common cause.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a force was similar to faith power. It was formless but it no doubt existed. Those who stood at the pinnacle, either of a small region or a continent, would receive the respect and even belief of many people. This was the power of faith.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unknowingly, another month passed. Right now, Yiye Jiange was about three months pregnant, although nobody could tell anything from the surface yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were no commotions from the Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace, but it didn’t mean that Qing Shui wouldn’t take the initiative to do something. The injury the Sunset Palace Mistress suffered had already been fully healed. Her strength wasn’t affected and even seemed higher than before for some reason. This should probably be because she revived after she had almost died, sparking all her will and fighting spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She seemed no different from the past, and behaved very naturally when interacting with Qing Shui. She seemed to be much more relaxed now, able to see past everything, but everyone could tell the emotions she had for Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If one counted, Qing Shui had already saved her twice. A man she loved appearing twice at her most dangerous situations and saving her. How could the emotions she had for him not be deepened? As long as she could still see him like this, even if she couldn’t become his woman, it was also a kind of happiness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Emotions were very strange. It wasn’t necessary to become husband and wife nor was it necessary to have intimate relations. However, humans who could truly be tranquil and see past everything were a scarcity. After all, humans had the six desires and seven emotions and the lust of humans was sometimes unsuppressable. The more they tried to suppress it, the easier it would erupt.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could naturally see this. He knew this woman was very smart and mature. It was said that men were creatures who thought using their ‘little head’. If he didn’t have Yiye Jiange here, he truly didn’t know if he could withstand the beauty of the Palace Mistress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his past life, for both men or women, it was always easier for a third party to appear when the relationship was a long-distance one. Such happenings had happened so much that they were basically uncountable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All women would eventually fall to the persistence of men. A beautiful woman would enjoy all the different fancy types of wooing techniques guys had and as for guys, they would think of a myriad of methods until one succeeded. Men couldn’t withstand the temptation of women. Qing Shui felt that he had done moderately well in this aspect but when he thought back again, he had actually fallen prey to temptation on a number of occasions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange didn’t say anything. She wasn’t suited to comment much on these methods. She understood this man before her very much. He had plenty of women but he truly loved each and every one of his harem using all his heart. If things between him and the Palace Mistress really reached that extent, he himself would never let her leave. Right now, he didn’t accept her, and although there might be other reasons, the major reason was still that his love for her had yet to reach that state of complete and utter devotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge always had a tranquil expression on her face, which made her very similar to Yiye Jiange. Truly, birds of a feather flock together. Qing Shui dared to guess that no matter if this woman loved him or not, she would never take the initiative to admit it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head and thought about all these matters which couldn’t be explained by logic. Humans were creatures of emotions and living in this world naturally would cause one to experience friendship, kinship, love, and all other emotions. It was true that constant interaction would cause feelings to develop. This was something both males and females were susceptible to. Naturally, the feelings invoked during frequent interaction between men referred to friends who were so close that they were like brothers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also the difference between humans and demonic beasts. Humans had too many richly colorful emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you thinking about? Let me guess.” Yiye Jiange smiled at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, take a guess then.” Qing Shui laughed. Right now, much time had already passed but there was still no upheaval from the Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace. On the surface, it seemed that the Sunset Sea King Palace had already relaxed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I think you must be missing home, right?” Yiye Jiange’s eyes glittered with a kind of transcendent beauty, so beautiful that it could cause men to be breathless. She was currently smiling sweetly as she spoke to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that Yiye Jiange was doing this on purpose. Whenever someone thought about something, one could tell hints of it from his eyes. He lifted his head and smiled, “I’m fine. You don’t need to think too much. You can say whatever you want to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange also laughed as she added in a teasing manner, “Are you longing for sister Qingcheng? I won’t object to this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was speechless. He stared at the serious-looking Yiye Jiange and shook his head, “Do you women only think about such things? Didn’t we just do&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">that</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;last night? Didn’t I already say that the lust of women is at its peak during this period…?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rascal, are you asking for a beating?” Yiye Jiange hurriedly raised her hand and covered Qing Shui’s hand as a shy look flashed on her face.</span></p>
