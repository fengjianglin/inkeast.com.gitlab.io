 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Fang never expected that this brat could even relate a simple question which she asked into something which was totally irrelevant from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am sure that deep down, everyone will have a place in their heart where they wish to be. It is one of the most precious things one could have in their life. For instance, there are people who would put their life at stake to protect the person they loved most; there are those who treasure family love deeply. The reason why they continue moving forward is all so that they could protect the things they treasured in life. So, Mistress Fan, what is it that you care the most in your heart?” Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My family does not need my protection. It makes no difference with or without them. Thus, this isn’t the thing which I am concerned about. But, what am I cultivating so hard for?” Beihuang Fan asked an irrelevant question after a moment of thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well then, do you have any dreams? Or some things which you have always wanted, but has never done before? It’s said that deep down in every girl’s heart, there live their own princess’s dreams. In your case, you are a real princess, but what’s your dream as a princess?” For a woman like Beihuang Fan, who had such a simple and plain nature, Qing Shui wasn’t sure if she still had the dream which a normal girl was supposed to have.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know. I may have looked forward to something many years ago. But now, I realized that I have nothing, nor do I have anything which can excite me. It’s precisely because of this that I don’t know why I am working so hard for.” Beihuang Fan shook her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was no psychologist. Naturally, he wouldn’t know of any good ways to open up her mind about it. Instead, he shamelessly grabbed her hand, “</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mistress Fan, seeing that you are so upset, why not have a taste of how it feels to be a woman? It’s said that a great change would occur to the woman who experienced it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Please die!” This was the first time Beihuang Fan got upset and cussed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I really mean it. Don’t you feel curious about how it feels? Those feelings, it will make you feel like you are in the seventh heaven.” Qing Shui continued to seduce her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, forget it. Get ready, we are going to continue our search of the Sun Phoenix.” Beihuang Fan went into the tent after she finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Qing Shui stayed motionless as he looked at the woman who was seemingly trying to get away from the situations. She was also slowly changing. Though the changes were minor, she seemed to be able to express herself more than before. In fact, Qing Shui was the first person who could act so shamelessly in front of her. He stood out from any other men before him. Needless to say, she had only ever interacted with very few men, let alone teenagers. At most, she would only greet them. Even for those who shared a decent clan relationship, they would still act cautiously and politely while in front of her to display their most perfect side for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, all of these looked like the acts of clowns in Beihuang Fan’s eyes. But then, she also found the way Qing Shui interacted with her a bit uncomfortable. Not only so, but he even went so much as to daringly grab her breasts, which caused her to be in shock for quite a while on the first time he had done it. This didn’t just stop there, later on, he had continued to do it multiple times. On a few occasions, she had been even one step from killing this man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely for this reason that she made up her mind to fall in love with this man. After all, she will still need to get married to someone and attempt to pass through her trial eventually. Moreover, this man was also strongly recommended by her father, and she had never doubted her father’s eyes. The person, who loved her the most, wouldn’t in any way try to harm her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In terms of taking advantages of different situations, Qing Shui could be said to be a master of it. Which was also why he dared to say things that were beyond Beihuang Fan’s knowledge before this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One after the other, they slaughtered a number of beasts. Usually, Beihuang Fan would be the one doing it while Qing Shui watched from the side. Bei Huang Fan’s Taiyi Divine Sword was at another level compared to Beihuang Yu’s. At his peak condition, even with his godly defensive prowess, Qing Shui might not be able to withstand a hit from her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment when they advanced once again, Qing Shui sensed a fiery aura with his Spiritual Sense. There was a bright spot located northwest of him. Given that he had unique and powerful Spiritual Sense, he was able to sense formidable existences clearly within a certain amount of distance. He was even capable of detecting the elements which the opponent’s possessed and roughly the form which the opponent took.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was quite contradicting. The figure of the being, on a whole, was quite clear, meaning that it was visible. But at the same time, it also had a blurry silhouette. A good way to describe it would be, they were able to feel a man</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And now, Qing Shui finally saw the Sun Phoenix. The reason why he felt that it should be the Sun Phoenix was because of its silhouette. This light represented the strength of a being. And now, the being’s silhouette seemed to be a bit stronger than Beihuang Fan’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui let out his arm and grabbed Beihuang Fan’s hand. By now, he had lost count on the number of times he grabbed her hand. Thus, Beihuang Fad has also become accustomed to it and had stopped resisting ever since, so long as he didn’t do anything that was too excessive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Have you felt it, the Sun Phoenix is most likely there.” Qing Shui pointed into one direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can feel the aura there. It contains intense fire elements.” Beihuang Fan said in a serious tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Sun Phoenix is slightly stronger than yourself. Do you have any moves up your sleeves? If the Sun Phoenix is to use killer moves of its own, will we get roasted by it?” Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can you please stop saying that? It sounds disgusting,” Beihuang Fan shot a glare at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She realized that it was almost like her instinct. Ever since she met this man, she had learned to glare at people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright then, tell me if we will get barbecued by it.” Qing Shui said, in response to what she just said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright then, we will just stick with getting roasted.” Beihuang Fan said a bit helplessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great. For once, you are finally starting to show some sense of humor. Mistress Fan, have you realized that actually, you are growing to be more and more like a woman?” Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have always been a woman. What do you mean by that?” Beihuang Fan shot a glare at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are not yet a woman. At most, you are just a virgin.” Qing Shui said with a serious tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If it wasn’t because the situation this time is a bit special, you would have long been beaten up by me.” Beihuang Fan tried to remain calm and proceeded to reply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“For every single time you hit me, I will grab your breasts. Are you feeling the urge to let me touch them?” Qing Shui revealed a look which seemed as if he had understood her intentions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You pervert! scoundrel! bastard!” By now, Beihuang Fan’s breasts could be seen restlessly moving up and down. Seeing that, even Qing Shui couldn’t help himself from feeling nervous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, young lassie, these words are actually compliments to a man. Stop wasting your energy. When we get married in the future, I won’t just want to grab it, but I will also want to nip on it and taste every single part of your body.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Surprisingly, a slight blush could be seen on Beihuang Fan’s face. She broke free from Qing Shui’s grasp and ran away immediately. This caused Qing Shui to feel shocked. But at the same time, he also smirked, “This woman is finally starting to become smarter.”</span></p>

In terms of its appearance, it shared a strong resemblance to the Hellfire Phoenix. Their only difference was that this one was fiery red in color. Its entire body was burning with fire, and its figure was big enough to cover the entire sky. When it opened both of its wings, they were nearly a thousand meters wide. At the moment, it had its eyes fixed on both Qing Shui and Beihuang Fan.</span></p>

Its flame didn’t seem to have the tendency to put the forest around it on fire. However, this didn’t mean that its fire wasn’t dangerous, it only meant it had mastered perfect control over its own flame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Humans, why have you come?” A melodious voice came through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the voice of a mature woman. Though it didn’t sound as dominant as Beihuang Fan’s voice, it still sounded great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I would like to make you follow me.” Beihuang Fan was straightforward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You want to tame me?” The melodious voice now sounded a bit unhappy. She was the Sun Phoenix! a proud existence! Yet now, someone actually dared to not only intrude her place, but also intend to tame her. To her, this was an utmost insult. Though there had also been Sun Phoenixes who got tamed before, they were all mostly tamed by some incomparably formidable existences. Even for those that were tamed, it was under the condition that they could gain a lot out of it. However, the two people currently in front of her were not only weaker than herself, they actually even dared to say that they wanted to tame her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!” Just like before, Beihuang Fan was straightforward with her words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, Qing Shui had already activated most of the necessary abilities needed for this battle, including the Battle God Halo. Qing Shui put more emphasis on defensive prowess on himself while assisting Beihuang Fan in boosting her offensive prowess and speed. This gave Beihuang Fan quite a shock. Nevertheless, she was able to figure out that this was Qing Shui’s abilities.</span></p>
