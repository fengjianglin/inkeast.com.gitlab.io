 <p><strong>Chapter 546 Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, Heavenly Talisman’s Body Securing Talisman.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>546 - Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, Heavenly Talisman’s Body Securing Talisman</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was his second time holding Yiye Jiange’s hands. He did not know how to feel about it, but he did not brood on it too much.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui would not allow himself to blaspheme the goddess in his heart…..</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although it was not late when they got back, Yiye Jiange and Luan Luan went back to their room to rest. When Qing Shui went past Mingyue Gelou’s room, he remembered what had happened earlier in the day; he pushed the door and realized that it was not locked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui entered and heard some voices coming from the inner room. He knew that Mingyue Gelou and Yuchang had not slept yet, thus he slowly made his way in.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui intentionally did not soften his footsteps!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yuchang, guess who is here.” Mingyue Gelou’s pleasing voice came from the room.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Daddy’s here!” Yuchang cried out happily, and then there was the sound of running. Yuchang ran out barefooted.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Daddy!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled as he replied. He picked up the young lass and headed towards the room. Tan Yang was dead, and everyone of the Tan Clan was dead as well. He was now their only pillar of support. Yuchang was his daughter, closer than even blood relatives. With regards to her and Luan Luan, Qing Shui wanted to love them even more……&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mingyue Gelou was sitting at the side of the bed, dressed in a nightgown. She looked at Qing Shui, smiled, and said: “Coming!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui found her statement quite bizarre, but he realized after careful thought that he hadn’t stepped into a woman’s room for quite a while now.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui removed his shoes and carried Yuchang to bed. Little Yuchang was in the middle, while Qing Shui and Mingyue Gelou each took a side of the bed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Daddy, I want a bear like sister Luan Luan’s, too.” Little Yuchang was now about six or seven years old. Maybe she understood some things – a child had the most energy of all, after all</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Wait till you grow as big as sister Luan Luan. Daddy will catch one for you then, alright?” Qing Shui rubbed his nose, feeling guilty for lying to a child.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Following that, Qing Shui quickly took out some fun trinkets and tasty food before the young lass could get serious about it, lest he end up in an awkward position as a result.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was no way to reason things with her!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Has it been tough?” Qing Shui embraced Little Yuchang, who had fallen asleep, his other hand tightly holding Mingyue Gelou’s soft and supple hands.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It is not tough, not tough at all. I feel very fortunate!” Mingyue Gelou said seriously with a dignified expression; the fiery red cinnabar between her brows was very enchanting.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui finished up circulating the Ancient Strengthening Technique, injuring his body following that to practice the Taichi Fist and Back Connecting Fist. In these three years, Qing Shui had injured his body to its utmost limits, which made for a training that yielded twice the results for half the effort.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now Qing Shui could clearly feel the benefits of injuring his body, such as the Qi Force in his body feeling more solidified.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This way it would increase the lethality, destructiveness, and explosiveness of his attacks greatly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The bottleneck of the Fifth Wave caused Qing Shui to not know what to do. Injuring his body and practising his past techniques was his way at grasping at straws.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cloudmist Steps!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Having cleared the acupoints, Qing Shui’s speed improved significantly, which was something eligible to be called a large breakthrough in speed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui was in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he would typically brew a large amount of Plum Blossom Wine and Vermillion Fruit Wine. He also would use a period of time every day to meditate. This way, when his body was relaxed, he might have some unexpected gains.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was a technique that Qing Shui had been recently training. Qing Shui had a hunch that the Buddha image that appeared was not simple, but he did not know if it was a result of the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint or the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After carefully thinking he understood it. The and were related. The training of the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint was the crux of the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Many complicated palm imprints struck out one after another. Their patterns looked messy and disorderly, but each had an indescribable harmony.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could now practice to the 399th palm in one breath. But in this period, regardless of what he tried, he could not breakthrough to the 400th palm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bottleneck!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that this was a bottleneck. Furthermore, his Fifth Wave had already reached the peak. In this period, even though he did not breakthrough to the 400th palm or the 6th Wave, Qing Shui was still very happy, because his skill and strength had risen by a significant amount.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As for the Blue Lotus Art, Qing Shui was still only proficient at controlling three Golden Lotus Flowers. The Basic Sword Techniques, Cloudmist Steps, and Thousand Hammer Technique had achieved an acceptable standard.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Only the Heavenly Thunder Slash was lingering at the Truth Realm, exhibiting virtually no progress. Qing Shui really wanted to breakthrough to the Obscure Realm, so that there would be a chance to paralyze the target for a split second.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After resting for a little, Qing Shui took out that thin Heavenly Talisman book, spurred on by an urgent need to learn the Body Securing Talisman.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The effects of the Body Securing Talisman could cause the target to be stuck at the original spot and not be able to move for 1 to 3 breaths of time; albeit the target would be able to move his hands to attack or defend.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If the talisman did not meet the requirements, then it would be ineffective!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Such as the Grade 1 Body Securing Talisman, Grade 2 Body Securing Talisman, Grade 3 Body Securing Talisman…… Within them exists a kind of talismanic power. This was the soul of the Heavenly Talisman and also the source by which to determine its success and might.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Aside from proficiency and talent, talisman drawing was related to personal strength. For example, even if a Xiantian cultivator was able to reach a legendary realm, he would not be able to make the talisman go beyond the 3rd grade. This was the limitation of personal strength, especially the control type of talisman.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although the drawing of talismans was limited by his strength, there were some items that could assist, such as the Golden Calligraphy Brush and the Moonstone Ink Slab that Qing Shui used.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were also some precious and valuable beast blood and beast skins that could raise the strength of the Heavenly Talisman’s effects.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was already very familiar with the usage of the Body Securing Talisman; not only could it cause the target to be stuck for 1 to 3 breaths of time, it could lower the target’s defense.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui realized the perverse usefulness of the Body Securing Talisman after he saw the Diamond Gigantic Elephant exhibit the terrifying Mighty Elephant Stomp. He thought of that 30 meters long Diamond Gigantic Elephant in his sea of consciousness; one stomp from it would tear the heavens and earth apart, and many large legendary demonic beasts would be torn apart.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui found it hard to imagine such a Mighty Elephant Stomp. If the Mighty Elephant Stomp of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant reached the Grand Perfection Stage, one stomp would be a frightening strength of 80 countries…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If he used the Body Securing Talisman to bind the opponent first and then let the Diamond Gigantic Elephant rush up and use the Mighty Elephant Stomp, with the addition effect of ignoring defense, it would prove to be the most ideal situation possible.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Body Securing Talisman's ignore armor effect applied to everything, not just equipment or the body but even the organs and bones.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A Grade 1 talisman would ignore 10 percent, and the duration was 1 to 3 breath of time! A Grade 2 talisman would ignore 20 percent, but there so no change in time, save for a higher probability of it lasting for 3 breaths of time. Meanwhile, the higher grade ones would pretty much be 3 breaths of time almost every time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">No wonder the Heavenly Talisman was an expensive trinket – a single breath’s of time was a steep price to pay, easily becoming the death certificates of experts the higher up in grade the talismans are!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Practice!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui only drew the first stroke because he realized that this Body Securing Talisman was different from the previous talismans. Just like the first time, it was difficult to draw.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He immersed himself in drawing till he had counted the hundred, only to continue arduously shortly after. The more he drew, the smoother it got. However, what caused Qing Shui to feel disheartened was that he could only draw a fifth of it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If Lin Zhanhan knew that Qing Shui only took so long to draw the Body Securing Talisman to this extent, he would not know how to describe Qing Shui’s abilities.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Among the Heavenly Talismans, the Godly Force Talisman, Divine Shield Talisman, Binding Talisman and Armor Break Talisman that Qing Shui drew previously were direct type talismans. They were the most basics of the entry-level talismans.They were easy to learn but had a steep learning curve, becoming unimaginably difficult towards the 3rd grade.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, the Body Securing Talisman was the second type of talisman. Its biggest effect was in controlling the target, such as preventing him from moving for 1 to 3 breaths of time, in which they are rendered inert for the duration it lasts.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was also the 3rd type, known as Five Elements Talismans, which used the energy from heaven and earth to make direct attacks. It was the talisman type with the most might as well as the hardest difficulty in drawing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Descending Thunder Talisman was a Five Elements Talismans of the lightning and fire attribute!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Up until he exited the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui realized that the Body Securing Talisman’s progress was only 50%. Using this to calculate when he would complete the Body Securing Talisman, he deduced would be half a month later!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the morning, he practised the Taichi Fist as usual and gave pointers to the three generations of the Qing Clan; he was overall satisfied with the progress of the three generations of the Qing Clan at this point.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The last time he left, he knew that Luan Luan and Qing Bei would break through to Xiantian, especially Luan Luan. Qing Shui knew she would break through to Xiantian before 10 years old.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After breakfast, Qing Shui would ride on the Fire Bird alone and go to the Qing Village. With the Fire Bird’s quick flying speed, he would arrive in Qing Village within an hour.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He descended on a hill not far away from the Qing Clan doors!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Once he entered, Qing Shui saw two old men fishing by the Qing Clan pond. Maybe because they broke through to Xiantian, Qing Shui felt that grandpa Qing Luo’s complexion looked better than before.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa, grandpa Lin!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui saw these two old men, he happily cried out!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, when did you come back?” Qing Luo happily stood up.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Lin Zhanhan also stood up happily; he looked extremely happy to see Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I arrived at the Hundred Miles City yesterday.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The three of them chatted as they walked into a room. Since their last encounter, Qing Shui had left in a hurry, being briefly gone for half a year as opposed to his previous track record of disappearing for years at a time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took out the wine from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. This kind of pure fermented wine would not harm the body and was in fact good for it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa, grandpa Lin!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, is there any issue? Spit it out! Why are you still being so courteous to us.” Lin Zhanhan smiled as he said.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">The bottleneck of the Fifth Wave caused Qing Shui to not know what to do. Injuring his body and practising his past techniques was his way at grasping at straws.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cloudmist Steps!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Having cleared the acupoints, Qing Shui’s speed improved significantly, which was something eligible to be called a large breakthrough in speed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui was in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he would typically brew a large amount of Plum Blossom Wine and Vermillion Fruit Wine. He also would use a period of time every day to meditate. This way, when his body was relaxed, he might have some unexpected gains.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was a technique that Qing Shui had been recently training. Qing Shui had a hunch that the Buddha image that appeared was not simple, but he did not know if it was a result of the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint or the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After carefully thinking he understood it. The and were related. The training of the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint was the crux of the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Many complicated palm imprints struck out one after another. Their patterns looked messy and disorderly, but each had an indescribable harmony.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could now practice to the 399th palm in one breath. But in this period, regardless of what he tried, he could not breakthrough to the 400th palm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Bottleneck!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that this was a bottleneck. Furthermore, his Fifth Wave had already reached the peak. In this period, even though he did not breakthrough to the 400th palm or the 6th Wave, Qing Shui was still very happy, because his skill and strength had risen by a significant amount.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As for the Blue Lotus Art, Qing Shui was still only proficient at controlling three Golden Lotus Flowers. The Basic Sword Techniques, Cloudmist Steps, and Thousand Hammer Technique had achieved an acceptable standard.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Only the Heavenly Thunder Slash was lingering at the Truth Realm, exhibiting virtually no progress. Qing Shui really wanted to breakthrough to the Obscure Realm, so that there would be a chance to paralyze the target for a split second.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After resting for a little, Qing Shui took out that thin Heavenly Talisman book, spurred on by an urgent need to learn the Body Securing Talisman.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The effects of the Body Securing Talisman could cause the target to be stuck at the original spot and not be able to move for 1 to 3 breaths of time; albeit the target would be able to move his hands to attack or defend.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If the talisman did not meet the requirements, then it would be ineffective!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Such as the Grade 1 Body Securing Talisman, Grade 2 Body Securing Talisman, Grade 3 Body Securing Talisman…… Within them exists a kind of talismanic power. This was the soul of the Heavenly Talisman and also the source by which to determine its success and might.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Aside from proficiency and talent, talisman drawing was related to personal strength. For example, even if a Xiantian cultivator was able to reach a legendary realm, he would not be able to make the talisman go beyond the 3rd grade. This was the limitation of personal strength, especially the control type of talisman.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although the drawing of talismans was limited by his strength, there were some items that could assist, such as the Golden Calligraphy Brush and the Moonstone Ink Slab that Qing Shui used.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There were also some precious and valuable beast blood and beast skins that could raise the strength of the Heavenly Talisman’s effects.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was already very familiar with the usage of the Body Securing Talisman; not only could it cause the target to be stuck for 1 to 3 breaths of time, it could lower the target’s defense.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui realized the perverse usefulness of the Body Securing Talisman after he saw the Diamond Gigantic Elephant exhibit the terrifying Mighty Elephant Stomp. He thought of that 30 meters long Diamond Gigantic Elephant in his sea of consciousness; one stomp from it would tear the heavens and earth apart, and many large legendary demonic beasts would be torn apart.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui found it hard to imagine such a Mighty Elephant Stomp. If the Mighty Elephant Stomp of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant reached the Grand Perfection Stage, one stomp would be a frightening strength of 80 countries…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If he used the Body Securing Talisman to bind the opponent first and then let the Diamond Gigantic Elephant rush up and use the Mighty Elephant Stomp, with the addition effect of ignoring defense, it would prove to be the most ideal situation possible.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Body Securing Talisman's ignore armor effect applied to everything, not just equipment or the body but even the organs and bones.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A Grade 1 talisman would ignore 10 percent, and the duration was 1 to 3 breath of time! A Grade 2 talisman would ignore 20 percent, but there so no change in time, save for a higher probability of it lasting for 3 breaths of time. Meanwhile, the higher grade ones would pretty much be 3 breaths of time almost every time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">No wonder the Heavenly Talisman was an expensive trinket – a single breath’s of time was a steep price to pay, easily becoming the death certificates of experts the higher up in grade the talismans are!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Practice!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui only drew the first stroke because he realized that this Body Securing Talisman was different from the previous talismans. Just like the first time, it was difficult to draw.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He immersed himself in drawing till he had counted the hundred, only to continue arduously shortly after. The more he drew, the smoother it got. However, what caused Qing Shui to feel disheartened was that he could only draw a fifth of it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If Lin Zhanhan knew that Qing Shui only took so long to draw the Body Securing Talisman to this extent, he would not know how to describe Qing Shui’s abilities.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Among the Heavenly Talismans, the Godly Force Talisman, Divine Shield Talisman, Binding Talisman and Armor Break Talisman that Qing Shui drew previously were direct type talismans. They were the most basics of the entry-level talismans.They were easy to learn but had a steep learning curve, becoming unimaginably difficult towards the 3rd grade.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, the Body Securing Talisman was the second type of talisman. Its biggest effect was in controlling the target, such as preventing him from moving for 1 to 3 breaths of time, in which they are rendered inert for the duration it lasts.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was also the 3rd type, known as Five Elements Talismans, which used the energy from heaven and earth to make direct attacks. It was the talisman type with the most might as well as the hardest difficulty in drawing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Descending Thunder Talisman was a Five Elements Talismans of the lightning and fire attribute!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Up until he exited the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui realized that the Body Securing Talisman’s progress was only 50%. Using this to calculate when he would complete the Body Securing Talisman, he deduced would be half a month later!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the morning, he practised the Taichi Fist as usual and gave pointers to the three generations of the Qing Clan; he was overall satisfied with the progress of the three generations of the Qing Clan at this point.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The last time he left, he knew that Luan Luan and Qing Bei would break through to Xiantian, especially Luan Luan. Qing Shui knew she would break through to Xiantian before 10 years old.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After breakfast, Qing Shui would ride on the Fire Bird alone and go to the Qing Village. With the Fire Bird’s quick flying speed, he would arrive in Qing Village within an hour.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He descended on a hill not far away from the Qing Clan doors!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Once he entered, Qing Shui saw two old men fishing by the Qing Clan pond. Maybe because they broke through to Xiantian, Qing Shui felt that grandpa Qing Luo’s complexion looked better than before.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa, grandpa Lin!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui saw these two old men, he happily cried out!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, when did you come back?” Qing Luo happily stood up.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Lin Zhanhan also stood up happily; he looked extremely happy to see Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I arrived at the Hundred Miles City yesterday.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The three of them chatted as they walked into a room. Since their last encounter, Qing Shui had left in a hurry, being briefly gone for half a year as opposed to his previous track record of disappearing for years at a time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took out the wine from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. This kind of pure fermented wine would not harm the body and was in fact good for it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa, grandpa Lin!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, is there any issue? Spit it out! Why are you still being so courteous to us.” Lin Zhanhan smiled as he said.</p>
