 <p><strong>AST 1170 - Fated Encounter, She Is Demon Lord, the Owner of Demon Lord Palace</strong></p>
 <p>Of course, part of the reason was also because Yan Jinyu was strong. The stronger one was, the stronger the prowess of the Four Elements Greencloud Sword that could be unleashed. However, the powers unleashed by Yan Jinyu were still beyond his expectations. However, when he thought of how powerful the Four Elements Greencloud Sword was, he didn't find it strange anymore.</p>
 <p>It might be because the old man thought highly of himself that he had actually come alone. He must not have expected to be killed by Yan Jinyu just like that. Everything was because of a single weapon. Without the Four Elements Greencloud Sword, they would probably have a problem escaping, let alone there being the possibility that Yan Jinyu would be able to kill the elder.</p>
 <p>"Sister, let's get out of this place. It's not safe to stay here!" Qing Shui saw that Yan Jinyu seemed to still be in a slight daze and quickly said.</p>
 <p>"Mmmm!"</p>
 <p>Both Yan Jinyu and Qing Shui disappeared instantly, blending into the crowd. This wasn't the first time she had encountered such situations but this was the first time she was up against such a powerful opponent. If she hadn't met Qing Shui, without Uncle Zong by her side, it would probably be hard for her to get out of this fix.</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, she grew to like Qing Shui more and more. This was a like one had for their family and nothing else. It was just pure feelings of like.</p>
 <p>In fact, Qing Shui was feeling the same. Although he had helped her, he felt that he had actually gained. Very soon, he would be able to take part in battles like these and wouldn't have to be so passive.</p>
 <p>If he were to have to fight against that elder today, if the elder used only spirit energy, then Qing Shui would have been able to protect himself. However, he didn't know about anything else. After all, it was hard to tell if he could actually destroy those two earth dragons.</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu seemed to be very happy at the moment. She put on her bamboo hat. There were actually many people along the streets wearing face veils or bamboo hats, regardless of their genders.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wore a bamboo hat as well and looked around as he sensed the surroundings with his spiritual sense. Whenever he noticed powerful cultivators, he would take extra effort to sense them. However, it was good that powerful cultivators were hard to come by and thus it wasn't easy to encounter them.</p>
 <p>And amongst the people in the crowd, no one seemed to know that Qing Shui and Yan Jinyu were powerful cultivators. It was because they hadn't reached that level, so even if they had crossed paths with powerful cultivators, they wouldn't have known. It was like how, in the past, Qing Shui didn't encounter any powerful cultivators before he had gotten strong. It wasn't because he didn't manage to meet any but it was more him not realizing even if he had passed by one.</p>
 <p>They had initially planned on continuing to be on their way but then felt that it was a good idea. After all, they would be able to arrive at the inner city the next day. They should be safe there then. Yan Clan was still quite powerful and influential.</p>
 <p>Right now, they could only worry and could only draw their own inferences. It was worrying because that old man from earlier had appeared. That old man's cultivation was close to that of a Grade Two State Master. A Grade Two State Master would have a very respected position but earlier, one such person had died.</p>
 <p>In the world of cultivators, one could only continue to get stronger. There would always be stronger people out there. Although a cultivator's life was seen to be very strong, their lives were actually very brittle.</p>
 <p>The top person in a circle might be just the weakest one in another circle. There was always someone better outside. The path of martial arts was endless.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui continued to think as he walked on. Some of the things he heard as well as his own comprehensions continued to increase his understanding of this world and he was increasingly able to find his own position.</p>
 <p>They didn't travel at a very fast speed nor did they have a fixed destination. They just followed the flow of the crowd, walking around and taking a look along this wide street. The place was very lively. In the middle section of the streets, there would be some carriages passing by, including beast carriages and horse carriages of various sizes. Some of them were luxurious while others were simple. The two sides were the pavement for pedestrians and then there were the stalls and stores.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui had a strange feeling. It was a very familiar one, but he couldn't really grasp it. He suddenly lifted his head and looked at the sky. The feeling came from above, but he wasn't able to see anything from the ground. However, that feeling really did exist and it seemed to be getting increasingly clearer. The feeling that the source was above him grew stronger.</p>
 <p>"Sister, wait for me here and be careful. I'll be back soon!" Qing Shui used the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring to dash toward the sky.</p>
 <p>He shot up 200 li directly. Even though he was 200 li up the air, which was the equivalent of 100,000 meters, it didn't seem to be enough. However, that feeling was getting clearer. Moreover, Qing Shui felt that the target seemed to have came to a stop. The other party must have sensed Qing Shui as well.</p>
 <p>When he disappeared with a flash, Yan Jinyu had dashed over as well. She happened to see Qing Shui's disappearing silhouette and she quickly headed over as well.</p>
 <p>Ten times. At the height of one million meters in the sky, the air seemed to be even clearer. There was still plenty of fresh air around, unless how in his previously life, oxygen would be thin in high altitudes. And by now, Qing Shui had also finally saw the source the familiar feeling was coming from.</p>
 <p>There was a huge divine turtle and a lady standing next to it. This scene was very familiar. He had seen it through an exchange of his consciousness.</p>
 <p>The lady's hair was done up high, she had soft brows and her beautiful face without makeup on was like the morning sun reflected on snow. She had the beauty of a goddess but her eyes were as cold as winter.</p>
 <p>She had a pair of cold and beautiful eyes which seemed to pierce into one's bones. They were beautiful and pure like ice and snow but the chill penetrated deep into one's bones.</p>
 <p>She was divine. Her snow-white plain clothes couldn't hide her curves. Her shoulders were sharp, her chest curved into a beautiful arch and the curves at her waist flowed beautifully. Her slender figure made her appear as if she was a jade carving created by the gods.</p>
 <p>She stood there, exuding an aura which made it feel as if she mustn't be tainted. Amongst the ladies Qing Shui had seen, this was one whom he mustn't get near. It wasn't cold but more of an arrogance coming from her soul.</p>
 <p>That lady from the crystal coffin!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hadn't expected to meet her under such circumstances. It was really such a coincidence. It was like fate. He knew that it was because of the portrait of beauty he had in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Otherwise, it would be very hard for him to sense her. It could also be because of the skinship they had before. No matter what the reason was, he was finally able to see her again.</p>
 <p>He had already seen that huge turtle behind her from the previous time they had interacted through their consciousness. It was too big, like a mountain. The aura it exuded caused Qing Shui to be stunned...</p>
 <p>This old turtle was in no way weaker than the green dragon from the interaction of their consciousness. It had a strong vitality as well. Back then, when they were in the crystal palace, it didn’t seem to be so strong. When Qing Shui sensed the lady again, he understood everything. He was just too weak.</p>
 <p>It was so in the past and it continued to be so right now. He still didn't know this lady's cultivation. He had thought that the current him shouldn't be weaker than her now but now he knew that his guess was very far off the mark.</p>
 <p>He didn't know if she had concealed her abilities back then, if she had suddenly gone through rapid progress or her body had awakened. All this was no longer important. What was important that it seemed that he was still unable to catch up to her.</p>
 <p>He had previously decided that when he met her again, he'd give her warmth. But looking at the current situation, who was he to be doing that? Qing Shui looked at this lady for whom he didn't understand his feelings. The lady was very cool but was also looking at him. Her eyes were still as cold and piercing, but they were very beautiful and pure like snow. However, they gave off a cold all the way down to his bones. She was cool but yet very natural. Everything seemed to be very normal, as if she was born with such a disposition.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the lady, not knowing what to say. It was only after very long did he then say softly, "Hello!"</p>
 <p>After saying that, Qing Shui felt more relaxed. He wasn't expecting the lady to reply her, but she did. This astonished him.</p>
 <p>"Hello. I didn't expect to be able to meet you again."</p>
 <p>Her voice was still cold as ever but it wasn't unpleasant. There was a cool arrogance behind the tone.</p>
 <p>"I initially thought that I'd be able to help you... I don't know why but I felt that I'd like to help you. I hope to get you to stay..." This was the first time Qing Shui was completely empty of any confidence he had. Not even one bit of it was level.</p>
 <p>The words he said didn't match and he wasn't able to say sensible stuff now.</p>
 <p>By this time, Yan Jinyu had appeared as well and she went up next to Qing Shui. She heard what Qing Shui said as well but a huge tsunami formed in her heart. It was because she saw the divine turtle and the cool lady.</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu did her best to not say anything as she looked at this scene in a daze.</p>
 <p>The lady wasn't infuriated, nor were there any changes to her expression. “I had also sensed your aura earlier and knew that you'd come. I just didn't expect you to come here. But so what if you've come? There's no way that our paths will cross. Alright, I'm going to leave. You're on your own now!"</p>
 <p>With that, the lady turned to leave, doing so with much grace. Qing Shui wanted to say something and after much effort, said, "Take care! We'll meet again!"</p>
 <p>The lady left. Her silhouette disappeared together with that huge turtle. It was only after a very long time had passed that Qing Shui looked toward Yan Jinyu, "Why did you come?"</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, do you know who she is?" When Yan Jinyu was saying this, her voice seemed to be trembling.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sensed that something wasn't right, but he still asked in surprise, "You know her?"</p>
 <p>"I just happened to get to know about her. How did you get to know her?" Yan Jinyu was astonished as well.</p>
 <p>"Sister, tell me who she is first." Qing Shui urged.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Qing Shui didn't know who that lady was, Yan Jinyu guessed that they shouldn't have any connections. She gave it some thought and felt that even if Qing Shui wanted to have a connection with that lady, it would be very difficult!</p>
 <p>"She isn't from Western Oxhe Continent but her name is well-known. She is Demon Lord, a lady who is like a demon. Many people want her dead," Yan Jinyu looked at Qing Shui and said slowly.</p>
 <p>Hearing Yan Jinyu's words, Qing Shui's fist clenched up.</p>
 <p>"Why?" Qing Shui looked at Yan Jinyu.</p>
 <p>"It was said that many years ago, she disappeared. A few years ago, she eradicated a powerful aristocratic clan but no one knew the reason. The influence of that clan was very big and thus, many other factions wanted to kill her. However, she's very strong. It's said that right now, she is Demon Lord Palace's Demon Lord and has inherited the legacy from the previous Demon Lord. In the first place, there are many people who were up against Demon Lord Palace." Although Yan Jinyu spoke very briefly, Qing Shui could still grasp some points.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui was still in a muddled state. However, he felt that if he hadn’t guessed wrongly, she had probably fallen victim to the intense aphrodisiac when the Demon Lord Palace was fighting against some other factions. It should be the reason why she was sealed by the old turtle and brought away from the four continents. This time around, she must have returned to kill the person who did that to her. As for the inheritance of the Demon Lord’s legacy, it must have been why her cultivation had soared tremendously.</p>
 <p>The reason she said that they wouldn’t cross paths must be because he was too weak while she was Demon Lord Palace’s Demon Lord. Or it could be that she didn't take a liking to him and hadn't remembered him.</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu said that she had a lot of enemies and those people were some powerful righteous people, at least, that was what it was in name. And she and Demon Lord Palace should be similar to those people form the Scarlet Flame Region!</p>
 <p>Therefore, the battle between them would never come to an end. Neither party would give up until their lives had been expended!</p>
