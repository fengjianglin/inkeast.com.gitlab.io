 <p><strong>AST 1124 - Bringing Only One Person To The Other Four Continents</strong></p>
 <p>Wood Vines could be used to whip, coil, and act as a barb due to its insane growth rate. Qing Shui took great pleasure in using the Wood Vines and he felt that he needed to cultivate this skill properly in the future because the usability of the Wood Vines was too great to pass on. He ultimately decided to let his loved ones choose one type of skill to focus on each, allowing them to further strengthen their foundation skills and fully grasp the quintessence of their own elements.</p>
 <p>Water Ripples!</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui demonstrated the Water Ripples, he was shocked. His body became surrounded with nourishing water and ripples spread across the surface. He felt that his movements were a bit restricted like a person entering a muddy pond. Those ripples that traveled on the water surface contained a strange power, as if they resonated with his presence. The ripples seemed uninteresting at first glance, yet contained a power beyond his expectation.</p>
 <p>This was the beginner level of the Water Ripples. Such a level of power had already surpassed Qing Shui’s expectation, thus leaving him with a satisfied feeling. The Five Elements Divine Refining Technique had reached to such an unbelievable level, causing him to realize how outstanding this technique had become.</p>
 <p>Fire Explosion!</p>
 <p>Because Qing Shui already had the Primordial Flames, he wasn’t as amazed with the Fire Explosion as the Water Ripples. Despite this, he would still continue cultivating this skill, he hoped that he could integrate it with his Primordial Flames. Fire Explosion could be regarded as a form that one could incorporate into their attacks, increasing the spiritual power of their killing blow by a certain percentage. If the killing blow was based on their spiritual power, then the chances of succeeding in that attack would increase exponentially. Despite the buffs, the chance of a killing blow was still considered small.</p>
 <p>However, as long as a killing blow was possible, he would have no problem with the skill. Nevertheless, Qing Shui decided that he would continue the cultivation of this skill with delight.</p>
 <p>Earth Mountain!</p>
 <p>This was the least technical skill in his opinion. He only needed to wave his hand to summon rocky mountains to crush his foes with heaviness. The power of this skill would be as formidable as the weight of a mountain—the pressure would be extreme beyond words.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that the strength of the Earth Mountain would be terrifying should he manage to cultivate it to its peak level. At that stage, it would become as horrifying as the laws of the heavens. He could suppress anything in his way with the weight of the limitless mountains. He could even suppress the sea and the land…. Perhaps in the future, he might be able to incorporate this skill with the Nine Continents Mountain.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stopped and took a brief rest. He was able to acquire something valuable this time—three treasure maps that had their own significance. These treasure maps were truly more precious than all of the rare treasures he had ever seen—they were simply priceless.</p>
 <p>……...</p>
 <p>Most of their time was spent cultivating their skills and they did not cover a lot of distance. Amidst their journey, Qing Shui had managed to seal numerous powerful demonic beasts on behalf of the elders in his family as he feared that they wouldn’t be strong enough to do so themselves.</p>
 <p>Like this, half a month had passed. The Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring was able to extend their traveling mileage by about 20,000 li. They flew past the Northern Sea and reached the Deity’s Abode in an instant. Naturally, they had decided to stay here for the night.</p>
 <p>Qiu Feng held Qing Shui back gleefully when he saw him arrive and said, “Brother Qing Shui, when you said your matters were important, you weren’t joking.”</p>
 <p>“Brother Qiu, I have finally settled my problems. I’m planning to stay for a night before going home tomorrow. After that, we shall go to the other Four Continents together. What do you think?”</p>
 <p>“That’s for certain. Come, dear brother. Let’s drink until we are wasted.” Qiu Feng didn’t press for further information on the matters. He was quite elated when he heard the news regarding the Lion King’s Ridge earlier. Because of that, his opinion of Qing Shui had become more positive.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, the ladies and others went back to their old manor to rest. The interior was still the same as always and the rooms were clean and tidy. It seemed that cleaning was done regularly despite the great condition of the World of the Nine Continents—little dust would be found in the air. Most rooms would maintain their usual state without a speck of dust even if no one came to clean them for ten days or half a month.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Qiu Feng had an interesting conversation but never touched on the topic of the other Four Continents. When the time to go to the other Four Continents came, Qing Shui would be able to gather more information from there onwards—either from Qiu Feng himself or Tantai Xuan.</p>
 <p>Even though Qiu Feng said that they would drink until they were wasted, Qing Shui went back to the manor after drinking for an hour. He had spent most of the past few days traveling, resting, or cultivating. Having the Nine Continents Steps to hasten their journey was already considered an amazing feat.</p>
 <p>When he managed to reach home, the ladies had already finished cooking. He only drank wine with Qiu Feng before he went back, so he decided to have a meal with everyone together. It was a lively atmosphere since there weren’t any strangers or visitors in their home.</p>
 <p>After the latest incident, everyone had changed. They were reborn as different people by simply bathing in the Dragon’s Qi. They also had experienced participating in battles between great sects, which could be considered an unprecedented matter that could hardly come by easily in their lifetime.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had the greatest change among all of them all. Everyone felt that their horizons were broadened further as Qing Shui stood on a higher realm. Those who stood at the higher realm would always see better things beyond their own level, which was why they would become increasingly mature as they reached another peak. Only those with a pinch of power and superficial knowledge would regard themselves as the champion and the gods as something lower than them. These were the people that everyone would regard as arrogant and conceited.</p>
 <p>After having a long meal and spending the day in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui had a lot of time to spend for the remaining hours. He decided to spend them on writing a few copies of the Five Elements Divine Refining Technique for the others so that they could choose one of the skills they would like to cultivate.</p>
 <p>He had already told them about the Gale Scroll but he had not mentioned the Five Elements Divine Refining Technique until today. Qing Shui carefully considered the constitutions of their bodies and how much time they had before he decided to allow them to choose one type of skill to learn. If they had both sufficient time and energy on their hands, he would allow them to learn more than one skill as it would always be better to acquire additional skills in their arsenal.</p>
 <p>After the ladies had chosen their respective skills, everyone gathered together and had a discussion. It was mostly Qing Shui doing the talking and the rest listening. Qing Shui had already practiced all five elements, so he demonstrated all of them as the ladies considered their choices. He would like them to observe which skill they would prefer or which one suited their taste. It would be important that they choose a skill they had interest in as that would boost their morale during the cultivation process. In the end, most of the ladies chose Wood Vines as their preference.</p>
 <p>For example, cultivating Wood Vines would render their constitution flexible yet invulnerable to swords and blades. Moreover, if they could reach a certain level of cultivation, the Wood Vines would become sturdy like some sort of demonic vine dragons. Additionally, the barbs around the vines would contain a poison. The vines could grow insanely long, split into multiple lengths and become extremely disruptive….</p>
 <p>All of those abilities actually required a considerable amount of spiritual energy to sustain. Without the appropriate amount of spiritual energy to release the attack, any offensive moves would prove to be harmless. Additionally, it would be possible for the five elements to clash with another element—water with fire, earth with fire, fire with wood, earth with wood….</p>
 <p>These restrictions were actually based on their own power as well. Like how water could extinguish fire, fire could also evaporate water. Of course, whether that was possible or not would have to depend on the user’s current power. However, under the circumstance where both parties were at the same level, whoever could triumph over the other would be able to extinguish their flames first.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, are you planning to go to the other Four Continents after we go back this time?” Yu He asked Qing Shui abruptly.</p>
 <p>He lifted his head to look at Yu He and noticed that the other ladies, Little Fattie, Yiye Tian, and Lin Zhanhan were all looking at him as well. Even though they knew about his plan, no one would dare to talk about it—until Yu He brought up the question. They were planning to talk about it when Qing Shui had decided to go. Sooner or later, someone has to ask him about it.</p>
 <p>“Mm, I can rest at home for a little longer.” Qing Shui smiled, pretending to be at ease as he replied Yu He.</p>
 <p>“I want to go with daddy.” Luan Luan immediately spoke her mind.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had been hesitating as he thought about his upcoming journey to the other Four Continents. Initially, the ladies were insufficient in terms of power, so bringing them along would be impossible. However, they had become strong enough to go after they absorbed the Dragon’s Qi. Nonetheless, Qing Shui still thought that they weren’t strong enough to go as the other Four Continents as it could prove to be extremely dangerous to their well being. He might be unable to cope even with his current power, unlike how it was in the Five Continents. Qing Shui wanted to discuss it with them and tell them about his opinion on the current matter.</p>
 <p>“I have a better grasp of the situation in the other Four Continents now. I know it’s not much but it is still a vital piece of information. You are all still lacking in power, so I cannot bring you all with me,” said Qing Shui after pondering for a while.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, I want to go!” Luan Luan pouted.</p>
 <p>“Don’t you want to accompany your parents a bit longer? Didn’t you say you would teach them about martial cultivation? Five years will pass by quickly, you know.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan went quiet. Qing Shui was reluctant to part with his mother too. He wasn’t ready to leave them just yet.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui lifted his head to look at Hai Dongqing and said, “Dongqing, try to settle the matters with Hai Clan for the next few years first.”</p>
 <p>“Alright!” Hai Dongqing smiled and nodded her head. Despite her cheerful appearance, he could see a slight disappointment in her expression. He hadn’t seen her for a few years last time too but it was different this time. In spite of that, he knew that she was a considerate woman, so she would know what to do next.</p>
 <p>“Wushuang and Qing`er, both of you will continue your cultivation for the next five years!” Qing Shui pondered for a while before he finally turned to look at the two ladies.</p>
 <p>Both of them were reluctant, yet they could do nothing but nod at Qing Shui’s words.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, let me stay and accompany them!” Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui and said with determination.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded his head and agreed, “That’s a good plan. Bring Yiye Clan to stay with the members of Qing Clan. This manor is huge. If there aren’t any rooms to accommodate everyone, you can decide on how to renovate the residence.”</p>
 <p>“Mm mm, I will listen to you.” Yiye Jiange said gleefully.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I still need to take care of the Hundred Flowers Valley.” Yu He smiled.</p>
 <p>“Five years. After five years, come to the other Four Continents with the others. I will come and pick you all up. Also, you have to go to Qing Clan and stay there often.” Qing Shui gave Yu He a reminder.</p>
 <p>“I will listen to you!” Yu He said cheerfully. Her mature demeanor in this situation got Qing Shui’s big approval….. Yiye Jiange, on the other hand, blushed when she heard Yu He’s words. Yu He was copying her exact words…...</p>
 <p>Little Fattie, Lin Zhanhan, and Yiye Tian would naturally remain in the Five Continents. Little Fattie would join Qing Shui at the other Four Continents in the future but now wasn’t the best time to do so.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned around to look at Yu Ruyan who was sitting beside him silently. He smiled to her and said, “Let’s go to the other Four Continents—you and me together!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s words shocked Yu Ruyan for a moment. Everyone knew about their unusual relationship, yet no one took the initiative to talk about it because the pair hadn’t explained their relationship to everyone properly. Yu Ruyan was also feeling slightly excluded even though her daughter had expressed her support towards their relationship. In the end, she still felt unnatural about announcing their relationship to everyone openly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had told her once before that he would take her to the other Four Continents and start a new life. Duanmu Linshuang would be happier living in the Five Continents. This time, he would help Duanmu Lingshuang and her husband in taming powerful demonic beasts with the use of the low grade Sacred Beast Pills. Furthermore, he would introduce them to the members of Qing Clan so that they could come in contact with each other more often.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan gazed at Qing Shui dumbfoundedly. She didn’t have a great outlook on her relationship with Qing Shui as she always felt that he would forget about her eventually after he had overcome his endeavor.</p>
 <p>However, no one had expected that he would call everyone to stay put in the Five Continents while he would travel to the other Four Continents with her alone.</p>
 <p>As she continued to gaze at Qing Shui, her heart was filled with a sudden sensation of grief that she couldn’t quite describe with words. Nonetheless, she was happy about it as she hadn’t felt like this in a long time. She realized at this moment that Qing Shui had already imprinted his presence in her heart—it was as clear as day. His presence was the only thing that lingered in her mind. Upon realizing this fact, her eyes glistened, so she ducked her head slightly to hide away from everyone’s gazes.</p>
 <p>“I will go with you!” Yu Ruyan said softly.</p>
 <p>“I’ve made arrangements for Lingshuang and Yanlin, so there’s no need to worry about them.” Qing Shui held her hand tightly under the table as he flashed a smile at her. The others were smiling as well, yet they hadn’t expected that the one who would follow Qing Shui to the other Four Continents would be Yu Ruyan herself.</p>
