 <p><strong>Chapter 329 4th Level of Soulshake Bell, Challenge from Sword Tower.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 329 - 4th Level of Soulshake Bell, Challenge from Sword Tower</strong></p>
  <p><span>New Years quickly passed. Last time Feng Wuji allowed a lot of people to </span><span>exploit an opportunity</span><span>, so when they saw Qing Shui performing his morning exercise at the public square a few days before the new year, they went up and challenged him in a bold and dignified manner. Some even challenged him without a weapon for the sake of fairness.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui naturally accepted their challenges. He used his weapon and with one move, cut off one person’s arm. Qing Shui cut it off from the person’s shoulder. The second person was unwilling to give up and came forward. One of his legs was cut off.</span></p>
  <p><span>The rest of them did not dare to come forward as no one could counter Qing Shui’s moves. It was a ridiculous concept since Qing Shui had a higher level of strength and power than the rest of them. Most importantly though, his sword skill was exceptional.</span></p>
  <p><span>A simple and concise sword movement, the most direct yet unbelievable to everyone else. Most people could see the source of that technique. In essence, those who use swords and those who don’t will be able to tell that it is a move from &lt;Basic Sword Techniques - Intermediate&gt;. Although the move looks a bit sharper, it was still a basic sword move.</span></p>
  <p><span>But what most people could not believe was how those basic sword techniques were able to create such effects. How a simple move was able to give out an incredible result, and turn the ordinary into extraordinary.</span></p>
  <p><span>This time, Qing Shui’s reputation had officially laid a foundation in the position of the young generation of disciples in the Heavenly Palace. Last time, even though Qing Shui once fought without a weapon against multiple opponents at the same time, he still came out victorious.</span></p>
  <p><span>A lot of people initially thought that Qing Shui’s kung fu was based on his fists, since he would practice sparring with his fists in the public square everyday. Although some people once saw Qing Shui practice his Heavenly Palace Sword Art, they still thought that Qing Shui’s main practice was with his fists.</span></p>
  <p><span>But now everyone knew Qing Shui seemed to have achieved a deeper mastery with his sword. In actuality, Qing Shui has mastered his &lt;Basic Sword Techniques - Intermediate&gt; to reach the Obscure Realm. Besides, it also became swift and fierce after his body revealed a waft of not-so strong awe-inspiring righteousness.</span></p>
  <p><span>With that comparison, no matter what, Feng Wuji was obviously much stronger than these crippled men. Although Qing Shui managed to frighten his opponents, they had also caused him a lot of trouble. </span></p>
  <p><span>Feng Wuji got his wish and became the disciple of Starmoon Hall’s Chief. When he heard the news, Qing Shui knew that he had already repaid that woman’s deal in a way.</span></p>
  <p><span>Time was always rushing and did not wait for anyone. Today was already the fifth day of the lunar new year. Qing Shui was still living his monotonous life, practicing intently every single day.</span></p>
  <p><span>Inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui refined the Soulshake Bell. No matter how busy he was, he would persist in his refinement of the bell. This may be his essential foothold in the Greencloud Continent in the future. After all, he who had a flying beast only needed to posses a Soulshake Bell, and he would not need to fear those who were below the Martial Saint level.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui had already gone numb, like he just wanted to finish an exhausting mission. It was a habit to persist on refining the Soulshake Bell every day, but as the time passed, he still could not upgrade it. In the end, Qing Shui might as well not think about it anymore. When the time comes, it will come.</span></p>
  <p><span>However, when Qing Shui lost count on how many times he refined the bell, that familiar violet light abruptly shone, which made him rejoice with excitement. The exquisite purple colored Soulshake Bell suddenly became brighter, the brightness became stronger, and stronger...</span></p>
  <p><span>“Has it upgraded?”</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui blindly looked at the Soulshake Bell which radiated in his hand and could not believe it. This was the upgraded bell. His mind went blank for a moment.</span></p>
  <p><span>He used the Heaven Vision Technique on the violet Soulshake Bell!</span></p>
  <p><span>Soulshake Bell, 4th Level, a chance of driving targeted beasts within five hundred metres into madness and whether friend or foe, they will attack everything near them in frenzy. There was a chance of making beasts frightened and die instantaneously.</span></p>
  <p><span>As Qing Shui looked at the attributes, he noticed that the distance had increased. But there was one confusing part; there was no success rate whatsoever. Although he had tested the approximate success rate last time, it wasn’t quite accurate. But there was a certain chance that the beasts were frightened and died instantly.</span></p>
  <p><span>However, Qing Shui felt that if the level increased, the success rate would also increase. The number of refining chances increased up to forty times a day. But he knew that if the bell upgraded to the 5th Level, it would at least require a year’s worth of time in the violet realm.</span></p>
  <p><span>That was his original guess. But the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal had already upgraded to the 5th Level. So the time taken to upgrade the bell was shortened, but it will definitely not be less than half a year.</span></p>
  <p><span>The accumulated snow could be seen on top of some mountains from the last snowfall. Even though the snow was under sunlight, it didn’t melt. Instead, it made the pure snow-white mountains look extremely beautiful. </span></p>
  <p><span>“Quickly go to Lingxiao Treasure Hall, I heard the people from Sword Tower came to learn and exchange with our people in the Heavenly Hall. This is a chance not to miss. I wasn’t in time for the last few times.”</span></p>
  <p><span>A voice rang out in Qing Shui’s ears, which made him pause. Qing Shui is said to be the last man to hear the news in the Heavenly Palace. No wonder there were not many people this morning.</span></p>
  <p><span>New years had just passed. A lot of disciples had not come back yet. Could it be that Sword Tower had come to seize the opportunity?</span></p>
  <p><span>S</span><span>word Tower, Qing Shui heard of it many times before. For example, because the old blind man from Immortal Sword Sect joined the ‘Heavy Sword Tower’</span> <span>of the Sword Tower, he was able to abandon his apprenticeship in the Heavenly Palace and challenge Canghai. And because of this, Canghai Mingyue wanted to exterminate the Heavy Sword House in the Sword Tower.</span></p>
  <p><span>The person who was talking just now had already left. Qing Shui could not understand the interactions between the Sword Tower and the Heavenly Palace, but he was bored and had nothing to do, so he simply went towards to Lingxiao Treasure Hall.</span></p>
  <p><span>After he walked out from Starmoon Hall, Qing Shui could see that people were rushing one-by-one towards Lingxiao Treasure Hall. Looks like the news spread fast.</span></p>
  <p><span>As he reached the public square in Lingxiao Treasure Hall, he saw quite a number of people moving around. There was already a huge crowd, and they were everywhere. A lot of people felt that Qing Shui was not an ordinary person when they saw him. But most of them only heard rumors about him, so no one said anything about him.</span></p>
  <p><span>However, Qing Shui could see a few of the dazzling people, and they could be counted as the part of the young generation! Because they too were eye-catching, and they were surrounded by people like the myriad of stars surrounding the moon.</span></p>
  <p><span>“Wow, that’s Jin Changzheng from the </span><span>Emperor’s Audience Hall</span><span>, so cool!” A pretty woman who wore clothes from Constellation Hall looked from afar while she muttered.</span></p>
  <p><span>Of all places, this woman had to be beside Qing Shui. Her figure was not bad, and her appearance was not bad as well. Qing Shui traced her gaze towards a man who had a full body of golden armor. He was a young adult, and gave off a feeling of masculinity. He had a smile as bright as the sun, which made people feel good. No one would hate this kind of man, whether they were a man or a woman.</span></p>
  <p><span>The size of his eyes was just right. He had a faint smile, which revealed half of his neat and white teeth. Moreover, his golden battle armor looked outstanding, like a deity descended from the immortal world.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui looked at the man called Jin Changzheng, then he glanced at his own flimsy and ordinary Starmoon Hall clothing.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shu’s aura still dominated, but this attire felt less imposing and powerful compared to Jin Changzheng’s armor.</span></p>
  <p><span>“Who is Jin Changzheng? Is he famous?” Qing Shui asked the woman with pretty good aptitude beside him.</span></p>
  <p><span>The woman turned her head and looked at Qing Shui with surprise, from the initial disdain and then bewilderment. But very quickly, she looked at the dazzling man from afar.</span></p>
  <p><span>“Jin Changzheng is the young master of the Jin Family from the Emperor’s Audience Hall. He is also the future headmaster of the Jin family and future </span><span>successor</span><span> of the Emperor’s Audience Hall,” said the woman softly. She didn’t look at Qing Shui after that, and continued to place all her gaze on Jin Changzheng.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui rubbed his nose. So, this was how it felt to be ignored. Qing Shui shrugged and focused his gaze at the far end.</span></p>
  <p><span>There was also a young man being surrounded by a crowd of people. Qing Shui was not interested in this one though. He had a very sharp manner, just like a drawn sword, swift and fierce.</span></p>
  <p><span>Although Qing Shui did not particularly discriminate against these showy people, he was not interested in them. He shifted his gaze elsewhere.</span></p>
  <p><span>These men were easy to spot, and just too eye-catching.</span></p>
  <p><span>Very quickly, Qing Shui found another one. He still did not like this one. He had a courteous appearance, a pair of profound eyes which always carried an intoxicating smile, but he had an unusually soft characteristic, which gave off an illusionary feeling to people around him. The two beautiful women who stood beside him had wavy delicate bodies, clear silky eyes, and charming faces.</span></p>
  <p><span>After he looked at young man for a while, Qing Shui laughed, because he could tell that this was actually a man with insufficient Yang energy, and he could also tell that the reason for that was his excessive indulgence in sexual pleasures.</span></p>
  <p><span>“No wonder what he lacks he claims he has, and what he couldn’t do, he would do it persistently.”</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui smiled as he looked at that man. It was incredible that this guy could manage to do those things between a man and a woman, and he also needed to consume some medicines to do it. For example, the Diamond Pellets he acquired from killing people, without it, he could only watch even if he was given a woman as pretty as a flower. The most he could do is to move his mouth and hands. That thing down there would not have any reaction.</span></p>
  <p><span>There were people everywhere. Qing Shui saw the Starday Hall where Feng Wuji was currently at. He swept his glance around and did not notice that unforgettable scene. Although Qing Shui told himself that he did not owe her anything else, he told himself that it was just a deal, and he must forget about it completely.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui did not see any people from Sword Tower. After all, all the people here wore their respective hall attire from the Heavenly Palace. If there were people from the Sword Tower, he would find them.</span></p>
  <p><span>“The people from Sword Tower have arrived!” someone randomly yelled just now.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui also followed the crowd’s gaze and looked at a group of hundreds of people wearing white warrior attire with long swords on them. After he saw their clothes, Qing Shui felt like they looked similar to the attire from the Immortal Sword Sect. </span></p>
  <p><span>In front of the group were two men in their seventies. Their heads were full of white hair down to their waists. At the back, there were four similar old men, and they looked aged and elderly, but they were evidently less charming than the two men in front.</span></p>
  <p><span>Further back, there were a dozen men who were young, at least they looked like they belong to the young category. &nbsp;But all of them looked like they were full of energy. The crowd from the Heavenly Palace rushed &nbsp;about.</span></p>
  <p><span>The Heavenly Palace also had two supreme elders and a few elders who walked out. Qing Shui saw Fei Wuji among the elder group.</span></p>
  <p><span>“Brother Ying Kong, Brother Xue Guo, welcome welcome!” One of the front line elders spoke with an imposing voice. It looked like he was familiar with the other party. </span></p>

 <p><span>“Has it upgraded?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui blindly looked at the Soulshake Bell which radiated in his hand and could not believe it. This was the upgraded bell. His mind went blank for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span>He used the Heaven Vision Technique on the violet Soulshake Bell!</span></p>
 <p><span>Soulshake Bell, 4th Level, a chance of driving targeted beasts within five hundred metres into madness and whether friend or foe, they will attack everything near them in frenzy. There was a chance of making beasts frightened and die instantaneously.</span></p>
 <p><span>As Qing Shui looked at the attributes, he noticed that the distance had increased. But there was one confusing part; there was no success rate whatsoever. Although he had tested the approximate success rate last time, it wasn’t quite accurate. But there was a certain chance that the beasts were frightened and died instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, Qing Shui felt that if the level increased, the success rate would also increase. The number of refining chances increased up to forty times a day. But he knew that if the bell upgraded to the 5th Level, it would at least require a year’s worth of time in the violet realm.</span></p>
 <p><span>That was his original guess. But the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal had already upgraded to the 5th Level. So the time taken to upgrade the bell was shortened, but it will definitely not be less than half a year.</span></p>
 <p><span>The accumulated snow could be seen on top of some mountains from the last snowfall. Even though the snow was under sunlight, it didn’t melt. Instead, it made the pure snow-white mountains look extremely beautiful. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Quickly go to Lingxiao Treasure Hall, I heard the people from Sword Tower came to learn and exchange with our people in the Heavenly Hall. This is a chance not to miss. I wasn’t in time for the last few times.”</span></p>
 <p><span>A voice rang out in Qing Shui’s ears, which made him pause. Qing Shui is said to be the last man to hear the news in the Heavenly Palace. No wonder there were not many people this morning.</span></p>
 <p><span>New years had just passed. A lot of disciples had not come back yet. Could it be that Sword Tower had come to seize the opportunity?</span></p>
 <p><span>S</span><span>word Tower, Qing Shui heard of it many times before. For example, because the old blind man from Immortal Sword Sect joined the ‘Heavy Sword Tower’</span> <span>of the Sword Tower, he was able to abandon his apprenticeship in the Heavenly Palace and challenge Canghai. And because of this, Canghai Mingyue wanted to exterminate the Heavy Sword House in the Sword Tower.</span></p>
 <p><span>The person who was talking just now had already left. Qing Shui could not understand the interactions between the Sword Tower and the Heavenly Palace, but he was bored and had nothing to do, so he simply went towards to Lingxiao Treasure Hall.</span></p>
 <p><span>After he walked out from Starmoon Hall, Qing Shui could see that people were rushing one-by-one towards Lingxiao Treasure Hall. Looks like the news spread fast.</span></p>
 <p><span>As he reached the public square in Lingxiao Treasure Hall, he saw quite a number of people moving around. There was already a huge crowd, and they were everywhere. A lot of people felt that Qing Shui was not an ordinary person when they saw him. But most of them only heard rumors about him, so no one said anything about him.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, Qing Shui could see a few of the dazzling people, and they could be counted as the part of the young generation! Because they too were eye-catching, and they were surrounded by people like the myriad of stars surrounding the moon.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Wow, that’s Jin Changzheng from the </span><span>Emperor’s Audience Hall</span><span>, so cool!” A pretty woman who wore clothes from Constellation Hall looked from afar while she muttered.</span></p>
 <p><span>Of all places, this woman had to be beside Qing Shui. Her figure was not bad, and her appearance was not bad as well. Qing Shui traced her gaze towards a man who had a full body of golden armor. He was a young adult, and gave off a feeling of masculinity. He had a smile as bright as the sun, which made people feel good. No one would hate this kind of man, whether they were a man or a woman.</span></p>
 <p><span>The size of his eyes was just right. He had a faint smile, which revealed half of his neat and white teeth. Moreover, his golden battle armor looked outstanding, like a deity descended from the immortal world.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui looked at the man called Jin Changzheng, then he glanced at his own flimsy and ordinary Starmoon Hall clothing.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shu’s aura still dominated, but this attire felt less imposing and powerful compared to Jin Changzheng’s armor.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Who is Jin Changzheng? Is he famous?” Qing Shui asked the woman with pretty good aptitude beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span>The woman turned her head and looked at Qing Shui with surprise, from the initial disdain and then bewilderment. But very quickly, she looked at the dazzling man from afar.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Jin Changzheng is the young master of the Jin Family from the Emperor’s Audience Hall. He is also the future headmaster of the Jin family and future </span><span>successor</span><span> of the Emperor’s Audience Hall,” said the woman softly. She didn’t look at Qing Shui after that, and continued to place all her gaze on Jin Changzheng.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui rubbed his nose. So, this was how it felt to be ignored. Qing Shui shrugged and focused his gaze at the far end.</span></p>
 <p><span>There was also a young man being surrounded by a crowd of people. Qing Shui was not interested in this one though. He had a very sharp manner, just like a drawn sword, swift and fierce.</span></p>
 <p><span>Although Qing Shui did not particularly discriminate against these showy people, he was not interested in them. He shifted his gaze elsewhere.</span></p>
 <p><span>These men were easy to spot, and just too eye-catching.</span></p>
 <p><span>Very quickly, Qing Shui found another one. He still did not like this one. He had a courteous appearance, a pair of profound eyes which always carried an intoxicating smile, but he had an unusually soft characteristic, which gave off an illusionary feeling to people around him. The two beautiful women who stood beside him had wavy delicate bodies, clear silky eyes, and charming faces.</span></p>
 <p><span>After he looked at young man for a while, Qing Shui laughed, because he could tell that this was actually a man with insufficient Yang energy, and he could also tell that the reason for that was his excessive indulgence in sexual pleasures.</span></p>
 <p><span>“No wonder what he lacks he claims he has, and what he couldn’t do, he would do it persistently.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui smiled as he looked at that man. It was incredible that this guy could manage to do those things between a man and a woman, and he also needed to consume some medicines to do it. For example, the Diamond Pellets he acquired from killing people, without it, he could only watch even if he was given a woman as pretty as a flower. The most he could do is to move his mouth and hands. That thing down there would not have any reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span>There were people everywhere. Qing Shui saw the Starday Hall where Feng Wuji was currently at. He swept his glance around and did not notice that unforgettable scene. Although Qing Shui told himself that he did not owe her anything else, he told himself that it was just a deal, and he must forget about it completely.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui did not see any people from Sword Tower. After all, all the people here wore their respective hall attire from the Heavenly Palace. If there were people from the Sword Tower, he would find them.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The people from Sword Tower have arrived!” someone randomly yelled just now.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui also followed the crowd’s gaze and looked at a group of hundreds of people wearing white warrior attire with long swords on them. After he saw their clothes, Qing Shui felt like they looked similar to the attire from the Immortal Sword Sect. </span></p>
 <p><span>In front of the group were two men in their seventies. Their heads were full of white hair down to their waists. At the back, there were four similar old men, and they looked aged and elderly, but they were evidently less charming than the two men in front.</span></p>
 <p><span>Further back, there were a dozen men who were young, at least they looked like they belong to the young category. &nbsp;But all of them looked like they were full of energy. The crowd from the Heavenly Palace rushed &nbsp;about.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Heavenly Palace also had two supreme elders and a few elders who walked out. Qing Shui saw Fei Wuji among the elder group.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Brother Ying Kong, Brother Xue Guo, welcome welcome!” One of the front line elders spoke with an imposing voice. It looked like he was familiar with the other party. </span></p>
