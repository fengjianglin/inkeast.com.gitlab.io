 <p><strong>AST 1096 - Heading to Lion King's Ridge, Northern Sea City</strong></p>
 <p>They spent a lot of time to finish this meal. Since it was still early after they finished their meal, Yiye Jiange got Qing Shui to go out for a walk with her as well as discuss some stuff.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui followed Yiye Jiange out of the courtyard and into the village. He was very calm now. With his great power, there weren't many people who could cause him to feel troubled in the Five Continents.</p>
 <p>With a fairy-like lady like her next to him, he felt very at peace. Qing Shui had long since treated her as an existence which he would never allow others to taint. Although they haven’t had any physical progress, they both knew what their future was going to be like.</p>
 <p>The Lion King's Ridge was going to be their challenge. Only after the matter with Lion King's Ridge was settled would Yiye Jiange be able to walk out of her trauma. Or rather, it could be said that only after eliminating Lion King's Ridge would she truly be able to feel happy. Then the burden in her heart would also be released.</p>
 <p>"Wife, you must be in a good mood!" Qing Shui looked at Yiye Jiange who was smiling and couldn't help but tease her a little.</p>
 <p>"You're not allowed to call me that. Be serious." Yiye Jiange smiled and said calmly. She even gave Qing Shui a chiding glance. However, her expression held a hint of seduction due to the smile on her face.</p>
 <p>"This is not being serious? Shall I call you Jiange baby?" Qing Shui teased and said with a grin.</p>
 <p>"You're so disgusting..." Yiye Jiange pretended as if she couldn't take this anymore. Her rare submissive expression made even Qing Shui fall into a daze.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui grinned and picked up Yiye Jiange's soft hands, filtering what she had just said and asked, "Then what should I call you? Master?"</p>
 <p>"You're on this again. You're not allowed to call me that." Yiye Jiange said angrily, her face flushed red. This was something she had always been concerned about, the matter of a Master becoming man and wife with her own disciple. Although she had never really admitted to their master-disciple relationship and had never taught Qing Shui any martial arts, this was still something she was very concerned about.</p>
 <p>"Alright, alright. Since my wife says that I'm not allowed to call her that, I won't." Qing Shui quickly said.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange smiled helplessly and didn't insist. Even she had no way of dealing with him when he was being a rascal. She didn't even know when she had started to get used to him taking her hand.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took Yiye Jiange's hand, feeling satisfied. They walked on as the sun gradually set. Qing Shui's heart was calm like water and everything was progressing well.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, I've already told elder brother and sister-in-law that we're going to Lion King's Ridge. They want to come with us, even Little Tong. Brother didn't stop him either." When Yiye Jiange said this, her heart felt very heavy.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew what she was worried about. He smiled and looked at her, "What are your plans? Are you confident in your husband?"</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui's smiling expression which didn't seem like he was joking and sighed. "If I didn't have confidence in you, I wouldn't allow you to head to Lion King's Ridge. However, I'm still a bit uneasy. It might be because I'm agitated or because I'm afraid to lose everything that I have now. It's no wonder that the more people gained, the more afraid they are of losing things."</p>
 <p>"Jiange, with my abilities now, I have absolute confidence in wiping out Lion King's Ridge. It probably won't work even if you were to say that you won't let your elder brother go. However, I still hope that sister-in-law and Little Tong can remain behind." Qing Shui was afraid that accidents might happen.</p>
 <p>Moreover, the few ladies with Qing Shui also insisted on going with him, refusing to stay behind. This gave Qing Shui a headache. His earlier plan was only to bring Yiye Jiange, Luan Luan, as well as Lin Zhanhan, to head toward Lion King's Ridge. He hadn't expected to encounter Yiye Tian and his family. This could be considered a huge surprise for Luan Luan, since she was reunited with her family. This also took a lot of stress off Yiye Jiange. After all, she now had an elder brother to share the burden with her.</p>
 <p>"Alright, I'll do my best to persuade brother to let sister-in-law and Little Tong stay behind." Yiye Jiange smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"I've originally only planned for myself, you, Luan Luan, and Grandfather Lin to head there. However, your brother should go. Sister Yu, Sister Qing and the others want to go as well." Qing Shui said calmly. Even he wasn't sure what he was trying to say.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange fell silent. She had stayed with Qing Clan for very long and knew their relationships with Qing Shui. Thinking of this, she looked at Qing Shui with a weird expression.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui suddenly felt very uneasy, as if he wasn't wearing any clothes at all. There seemed to be a tint of embarrassment on his face, "Jiange, don't look at me like that. I told you that I'll get you to undress me and take the initiative on the night of our wedding. If you can't wait till then, I'll give you what you wish for tonight..."</p>
 <p>"We were indebted to you in our previous lives and we continue to be indebted to you in this life. However, we have to start repaying our debt from this life." Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui's uneasy expression and said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui calmed down and said, "I'm the one who’s indebted to you guys. There are some things which can never be fully repaid. Therefore, the Heaven has kept you next to me, so that I can continue to repay you in this life, in my next life, and in my life after the next."</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange's eyes lit up and smiled as she looked at Qing Shui, "To think that you know how to say something so nice. Did you manage to get your hands on them with the same method?"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose, "This is the first time I've said this. Even I find it a little mushy. It's just that I didn't feel anything when I was saying it previously..."</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange was very happy to see Qing Shui having this expression but she didn't show it on her face. Earlier, she felt that Qing Shui had said those words from the bottom of his heart and it wasn't just some mushy words.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, will they be in any danger if they were to go?" Yiye Jiange was in fact very happy. Other than being related to Qing Shui, they were as close to her as if they were sisters related by blood.</p>
 <p>"There's no danger. The Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring is sufficient for you guys to protect yourselves. Oh, right. I've also prepared one for elder brother. You can pass it to him later. This will allow him to keep his life if something were to happen." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Thank you!"</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange spoke with great sincerity. She knew well how precious this Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring was, he had treated everything she loved as well as he had loved her. The reason he was treating her brother so well was all for her sake.</p>
 <p>"Jiange baby, you seemed to have forgotten what your husband had said before."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's other hand grabbed her well-developed bosom, causing her to be unable to hold back a tremble. He said, "Should I just touch, or should I hit it?"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and held back his urges as he looked at the flushed red lady.</p>
 <p>"Let me off this once!" Yiye Jiange said, slightly stiffly. Her soft voice was stiff but seductive. Her expression was equally so.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that half of it was her trying to play along with him.</p>
 <p>He felt very happy and said, "Then call me husband!"</p>
 <p>"You must keep to your words and not hit me after I've called you that." Yiye Jiange lowered her head slightly and said. Qing Shui's hand hadn't left that spot which made her heart leap.</p>
 <p>"Husband, Jiange likes you!"</p>
 <p>That unearthly voice caused Qing Shui to fall into a daze. Looking at this beautiful lady, he knew that she really exists here. Earlier, he was still planning to hit her butt once no matter if she had called him or not. He felt that her well-developed butt must feel very good to the touch. However, he hadn't expected that Yiye Jiange would really call him that and even added on another line at the back.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's mind blanked out and he hugged her tightly, as if he was hugging the most precious gift in the world.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange smiled, reaching out her arms around Qing Shui's back.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hugged Yiye Jiange and only lifted his head to look at this intelligent and graceful lady after a long time. Although she was right before his eyes, he felt as if he couldn't do anything. She was like a holy and pure existence that couldn't be tainted.</p>
 <p>When they returned, it was already dark. Qing Shui handed Yiye Jiange a Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring and told her to pass it to Yiye Tian. He also told her to persuade Yiye Tian to let his wife and Yiye Tong stay behind.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, on the other hand, stayed in the hall together with the ladies, Little Fatty, and Lin Zhanhan. Qing Shui didn't wish to bring the ladies along with him and wanted to have another discussion.</p>
 <p>However, after discussing for very long, not a single one of them agreed. They smiled and looked at Qing Shui. In the end, Qing Shui could only nod and agree for everyone to head there together. Only then did the ladies feel happy.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that it would come to this. They had already talked about this once. He understood their feelings, and the reason he didn't wish for them to come along was for their good. However, it would only make them feel sad. Moreover, they already had the abilities to protect themselves and also provide quite a lot of help.</p>
 <p>If they would be a burden to Qing Shui, even if he were to let them join him, they wouldn't do so.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange had finished her discussion. Yiye Tian's wife and Yiye Tong agreed to stay behind. This beautiful lady also understood that if she were to go, she would only be a burden and caused the others to be distracted. This was why she had agreed to stay behind.</p>
 <p>Two days later, they continued on their way. This time, they headed north, where Lion King's Ridge was located. It was said that the place was sealed in ice for 10,000 years and even the cities there were like snow cities.</p>
 <p>They continued to only travel using the Nine Continents Steps. They would occasionally travel on demonic beasts for half a day as well but they rarely did so. It was only during these few days did Yiye Tian understood that Qing Shui was the mainstay here and how terrifyingly powerful he was. Even these few ladies of unparalleled beauties were his women. Although Yu Ruyan wasn't introduced as such, Yiye Tian could still tell that there was something going on between them.</p>
 <p>The few ladies continued to put in hard work when cultivating. The same went for Yiye Tian. Only Lin Zhanhan and Qing Shui acted leisurely, drinking wine or even going around the vicinity on demonic beast to see if there were any treasures. If they were to come across any rivers or lakes, they would also do some fishing with the Pure Gold Fishing Rod.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was very free and thus he would cook as well. He did this so that they could have more time with their cultivation. After all, cooking was not a big deal to Qing Shui and it was even faster with Lin Zhanhan helping him.</p>
 <p>Traveling was something very boring but the few ladies, Yiye Tian, and Little Fatty were focused on their cultivation while Qing Shui and Lin Zhanhan would check out the vicinity as if they were on a tour. For most of the time, Qing Shui would also be cultivating or giving guidance on the others' cultivation.</p>
 <p>Northern Sea City!</p>
 <p>They passed by many cities on the way but they didn't stay for long. Neither did the cities leave any impression on Qing Shui's mind. However, this city which they had just arrived in gave him a very strong impression and he planned to stay here for a few days.</p>
 <p>The Northern Sea City was truly a sea city, facing the huge Northern Sea. If one wished to head to Lion King's Ridge, they must travel across the Northern Sea City. The Northern Sea City was already considered the arctic region. There were many hidden influences there and even the Ancient Great Formation that was linked to the other Four Continents was also in this arctic region.</p>
