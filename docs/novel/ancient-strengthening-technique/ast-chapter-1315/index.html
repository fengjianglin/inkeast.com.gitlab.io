 <p><strong>AST 1315 - Yehuang Guwu, Dancing Phoenix Continent's Yehuang Country, What Secret Did She Have</strong></p>
 <p>"Divine Beast Sect?"</p>
 <p>The lady looked at Qing Shui for a while before saying. "The Divine Beast Sect is an ancient sect in the Dancing Phoenix Continent. Their primarily ability is in taming beasts and they are a powerful existence. They also enjoy a very high status."</p>
 <p>The lady said this simply, however, this time around, Qing Shui was very sure that the Divine Beast Sect was truly very powerful. The pair of geniuses who had the Heart of Demonic Beast, would definitely receive the best path for their development there.</p>
 <p>His feud with the Desolate Sect was set in stone. With the Desolate Sect's style of seeking revenge for the smallest grievance, they would definitely come seek him out for revenge. He wasn't worried about himself. He was only worried that they would lay their hands on the people around him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took a seat next to the lady, took off his shoes and dipped his legs into the water. The seawater was slightly cold but it was very comfortable.</p>
 <p>The lady's snow-white and beautiful feet touched Qing Shui's causing his heart to feel a little itch. Seeing the lady's relaxed smile make him feel at peace. Their feet kept touching each other underwater, as if they were two kids playing around. Occasionally, the lady would break into happy laughter when Qing Shui rubbed his feet against her soles.</p>
 <p>"What's your name?" Qing Shui lifted his head and asked the lady.</p>
 <p>"You want to know my name now?" The lady didn't seem to be surprised.</p>
 <p>"I know you as a person. Names can be fake. Moreover, they are just an address. However, now that our relationship isn't the same as before, I want to know your name." Qing Shui took out a pair of earrings he had forged and spoke as he put them on for her.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui's hands touched her earlobes, she trembled. Seeing Qing Shui's actions made her feel that there was an indescribable feeling. She had also dreamed of there being a man who could take her hand and walk down the rest of their remaining lives together. She had also wanted a shoulder to rest on, a man to help her put on a hairpin, to put on a bride's headgear, to put on a necklace...</p>
 <p>She looked at Qing Shui's calm expression. She could sense that his gentleness was very sincere. She only managed to regained her senses after Qing Shui had put on the earrings for her. She smiled and looked at him.</p>
 <p>It was then that Qing Shui had an illusion that this lady was very close to him at this very moment. It wasn't because they sat next to each other. In the past, even when the lady was in his arms, he hadn't felt that she was this close. This was a spiritual distance between them, one which was transmitted through gaze and feelings.</p>
 <p>"I'm Yehuang Guwu!" the lady said happily.</p>
 <p>"Great name. You're just like your name." Qing Shui was stunned. This name made him think of some things, because there was some relation with the name of the Dancing Phoenix Continent. It was a pity that Qing Shui was unaware of the situation in the Dancing Phoenix Continent. He didn't know that her surname itself was a legendary existence.</p>
 <p>"Are you complimenting me?" The lady smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"This isn't a compliment. It's a fact. I'll be heading to the Dancing Phoenix Continent tomorrow. Are you coming?"</p>
 <p>"Yes. It's been a very long time since I've been back to the Dancing Phoenix Continent." The lady seemed to not want to hide some things anymore.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had long guessed that this lady was from the other three continents. Moreover, Headmaster Sui and Cao had said that the leader of the Putuo Mountain was from the other continents. It seemed that this lady was from the Dancing Phoenix Continent.</p>
 <p>"Martial Aunt, tell me about the situation in the Dancing Phoenix Continent. The other three continents should be next to each other."</p>
 <p>"Yes, they are. You should have already seen in the space in the Five Elements Divine Flag that the Dancing Phoenix Continent and the Soaring Dragon Continent are both ten times that of the Western Oxhe Continent and their land is vast and boundless. There are also many mysterious and secretive places such as ancient battlefields. The other three continents are very complicated. There are dynasties, aristocratic clans, sects, alliances and tribes. There are also many independent cities which don't belong to any powers and are terrifying existences. The Immortal Island, Devil City..."</p>
 <p>The lady didn't say a lot but one problem was highlighted. The land area of the other three continents was far too big and there were countless powerful existences. There were also many concealed powerful cultivators.</p>
 <p>"Are there False God level cultivators in the Dancing Phoenix Continent?" This was something which Qing Shui had been very curious about all along. He was very close to the False God level but it was a pity that it seemed to be very, very difficult for one to become a False God level cultivator.</p>
 <p>"Yes and there are quite a number of them. Of course, when compared to the population there are relatively few. Only those who are at the False God level would be able to stand in significant positions in the other three continents." When Yehuang Guwu mentioned the False God cultivators, her tone seemed to be one of yearning.</p>
 <p>"Tell me your story." Seeing that the lady seemed to have been a little more relaxed, Qing Shui said.</p>
 <p>"There's nothing much. If you really want to know, I'll tell you about it after you've become a False God level cultivator," Yehuang Guwu smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Since she wasn't willing, Qing Shui didn't force her either. He knew that the lady had a mind of her own.</p>
 <p>"Oh, right, Qing Shui. I might not be staying for long in the Dancing Phoenix Continent, nor will I be able to go around the place with you. I'll wait for a few more years before I head back to the Dancing Phoenix Continent. When the time comes, Martial Aunt will always be by your side, is that alright?" The lady brought this up to Qing Shui in advance. After all, he would be heading there tomorrow.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. "Is it because you have any problems? Do you need help?"</p>
 <p>"No need. I have the Five Elements Divine Flag. If I were to encounter any danger, you'll be able to sense it. Moreover, I'll be able to teleport to where you are anytime. There's no need to worry about me. The same goes for you, use the teleportation if you encounter danger." The lady reached out her hand and touched Qing Shui's head.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. To have a lady patting him on the head...</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>That night, Qing Shui managed to achieve something he had always been hoping for in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The Heaven Shaking Drum had leveled up to grade six and the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's attacking abilities had been doubled. At the same time, all of his demonic beasts' physical attacks had also been doubled.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui's Spirit Gathering Lamp, Coiled Dragon Statue and the Heaven Shaking Drum were now all at grade six. It would be sufficient for now. It was quite good for him to have achieved this the night before he headed to the Dancing Phoenix Continent.</p>
 <p>The Dancing Phoenix Continent, the Soaring Dragon Continent and the Haohan Continent were very powerful but it wasn't as if False Gods could be found everywhere. It wasn't as if people with a strength of 10,000 sun were filling up the streets either. It was hard to even find people with a strength of 10,000 sun. They were still mostly ordinary people and cultivators who were Xiantian or lower. However, there were more powerful cultivators there when compared to the Western Oxhe Continent and the five continents. After all, the population over there was far too big and the Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth were also bountiful.</p>
 <p>Therefore, with Qing Shui's current abilities, he could still be considered to be relatively powerful after he went over. Of course, if he were to be unlucky and offended some powerful cultivators, then he could only blame it on his bad luck. Such things were unpredictable.</p>
 <p>The next day, in the late morning, Qing Shui and Yehuang Guwu stood on the water of the Southern Sea.</p>
 <p>"I'll head over first. Will you be coming over immediately?"</p>
 <p>"Mmm. You go over first. I'll follow after."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had set the location to be in the center of the Dancing Phoenix Continent. He had initially wanted to set it in the position which where the Dancing Phoenix Continent was closest to the Soaring Dragon Continent and the Haohan Continent. However, upon thinking that the Five Elements Divine Flag could still be upgraded, he eventually still went ahead to set the position in the center.</p>
 <p>Waving his hand, Qing Shui used the Five Elements Divine Flag. His silhouette became increasingly blurry and as Yehuang Guwu watched Qing Shui's disappearing figure, she revealed a faint smile.</p>
 <p>This feeling was very strange. It felt like just a short moment but yet also felt as if a very, very long time had passed. When Qing Shui regained his senses, he had already arrived at the Dancing Phoenix Continent.</p>
 <p>If it was in his previous life, Qing Shui would definitely think that this place was heaven. It was because the air here was extremely fresh. Upon breathing in, he felt a great comfort running through his body. That feeling was as if a person who was about to die in a stifling place was suddenly given fresh air to breath.</p>
 <p>The environment was even better as compared to the western oxhe continent and the Spiritual Qi was more bountiful as well. Qing Shui was high up in the air. Suddenly, he felt an extremely violent aura gushing toward him from the clouds.</p>
 <p>He subconsciously stretched out his palm, slapping out with a tremendous force.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>With an agonizing cry, that aura was sent flying from Qing Shui's attack. It was only then did he see that the thing which he had sent flying was a snow-white demonic beast. It looked like both a lion and a cow and had a huge body. It was snow-white all over, including its eyes. It looked very beautiful and if it were to hide in the clouds, one wouldn't be able to notice it. Furthermore, these kinds of demonic beasts were skillful in concealing their auras and moved with very great speeds.</p>
 <p>Snow Cloud Beast！</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did know about this beast. They would conceal themselves amongst the clouds and loved to attack demonic beasts and humans who had gotten near to the clouds.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui's earlier attack hadn't taken its life, it was seriously injured.</p>
 <p>Just then, Qing Shui felt some ripples and knew that the lady would be arriving soon.</p>
 <p>"How do we deal with this injured Snow Cloud Beast?" Qing Shui looked toward the lady and asked.</p>
 <p>"Let it go. These demonic beasts are very intelligent creatures and cultivate amongst the clouds, absorbing the Spiritual Qi from the clouds. They can also move while stepping on the clouds. The Snow Cloud Beasts are also known as the Cloud Stepping Beasts. It's said that there are also Cloud Stepping Beasts which can become Immortal Demons," the lady smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Alright, then let's go down."</p>
 <p>The lady nodded and descended with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Most of the time, the most prosperous place in a continent would be in the center but of course, there were exceptions as well. However, even in the case of the exceptions, the central location would also be considered one of the most prosperous region.</p>
 <p>The most prosperous place in the Dancing Phoenix Continent' wasn't in the center but was in a location close to the Soaring Dragon Continent and the Haohan Continent. This was normal as well. Although there was a great distance between the continents, compared to the other continents, the traveling time between these three continents were a lot less.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Country, capital city！</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had set the location to be in the most central spot in the Dancing Phoenix Continent in the beginning and just got to know that the lady was called Yehuang Guwu. Right now, he realized that they had teleported to the capital city of the Dancing Phoenix Continent's Yehuang Country. He looked toward Yehuang Guwu with great curiosity.</p>
 <p>The country was named after Yehuang and the Dancing Phoenix Continent also had 81 countries. A single country here is even bigger than a single continent in the five continents. Therefore, one who could control an entire country here would definitely be a great expert.</p>
 <p>Were there any connections between Yehuang Country and Yehuang Guwu? She had said that she would tell him her story after he had reached the False God level. This time around, she wouldn't be staying here for long. Why did she come? Were there any connections between the strongest existence in the Yehuang Country and the Yehuang surname? This surname was very rare and Qing Shui felt that it wasn't a coincidence.</p>
 <p>Even though the lady wasn't willing to say, Qing Shui felt that he could try to ask around. It should be easy to get to know this in the Yehuang Country.</p>
 <p>This was the capital and the level of its prosperity far surpassed that of Qing Shui's imagination. There were no way the five continents and the Western Oxhe Continent could compare with this. This place had greater wealth. In this world, there was no lack of resources. Be it food, drinks, clothing or the things used... they flourished in their own way.</p>
 <p>In Qing Shui's previous life, mechanism flourished. In this place, they could use manpower to far surpass the mechanisms from Qing Shui's previous life. However, the feeling exuded would be more rustic. Therefore, the two could not be compared.</p>
 <p>The cars, trains, planes and other forms of transportation which were even that fast couldn't be compared with the people here. The storage tools from his previous life couldn't compare with the interspatial silk sachets here. Therefore, all the knowledge from his previous life could be overthrown.</p>
 <p>After they descended, they walked for a while along the smooth stone road. Then, Yehuang Guwu bade Qing Shui goodbye, "Qing Shui, I have some things to handle. After I'm done with that, I'll head back to the Western Oxhe Continent directly. Be careful on your own. Remember what I said previously."</p>
 <p>"Mmm, you must be careful as well. Before you head back, you must come to look for me first. It won't take much time," Qing Shui said domineeringly.</p>
 <p>"Sire, I'll listen to everything you say!" With that, the lady planted a kiss on Qing Shui's face and disappeared from where she was with a flash.</p>
