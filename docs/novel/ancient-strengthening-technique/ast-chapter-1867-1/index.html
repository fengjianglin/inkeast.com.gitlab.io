 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Xiu had grown a lot since the time he left. Although he hadn’t reached a year old yet, he was still growing every day. The changes that he had gone through would be very obvious even if it had only been ten days or half a month not seeing him, not to mention half a year worth of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luckily, the little brat was still unable to recognize people. Or perhaps, it might be because he had met very few people every day or perhaps he had already gotten familiar with Qing Shui’s aura that he didn’t repel Qing Shui. In fact, he really liked it when Qing Shui was carrying him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did everything go smoothly?” Yiye Jiange asked Qing Shui after everyone sat down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As of now, Qing Shui was feeling a bit ridiculous. His visit this time was originally to be by the Vampiric Empress’s side when she was giving birth to his daughter. They had established a husband and wife relationship with each other as a result. But in between, he also ran into incidents concerning the Sacred Mountain. Hence, he was very honest with his words and told them that everything went as planned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, it all went well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s good then. Also, there is one thing which I haven’t told you about.” Yiye Jiange remembered and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“DO NOT mention it!” Before Yiye Jiange could continue, Qing Hanye had interrupted Yiye Jiange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at them confused, “What’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let Sister Hanye tell you about it. She doesn’t want me to tell you.” Yiye Jiange smiled as she pushed the responsibility to Qing Hanye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and looked at Qing Hanye, “Judging by your expression, you must have found a man whom you like.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye was surprised by Qing Shui’s words. After that, she revealed a sad look, “Do you really want me to see another man so badly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had never expected for Qing Hanye to overthink so much. He was actually just teasing her before. But now, it seemed that it didn’t work as well as he planned. Besides, it was absolutely false to say that he would want to see her falling for another man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, I am just confirming it. If there is really someone you are seeing then I must get myself prepared to turn him into a palace eunuch.” Qing Shui said in a serious tone after a moment of thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All you do is to spout nonsense. It’s not much. It’s just that the third prince of the Golden Sacred Palace had once come here to declare marriage only to be refused by me. He seemed to be unwilling to give up. But so far, he hasn’t done anything too excessive. He would just come here every few days. I didn’t even allow him to enter the Sunset Ocean King Palace.” Qing Hanye said anxiously while looking at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Golden Sacred Palace? What is that?” Qing Shui realized that there seemed to be many things which he didn’t know about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s located deep within the Northern Ocean. Even around the area where we are located at, there are still many powerful forces in hiding. The Golden Sacred Palace is just one of them. It is located slightly further away from us compared to the Watermoon Cavern and the Wavemoon Cavern. The Golden Sacred Palace is also slightly more powerful than them. It is also called the Five-headed Lobster King Tribe. Inside their body flowed the blood of Ancient Bloodline Warriors.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui originally planned to criticize the person as nothing but just a demon but then he remembered that Luo Qingcheng and Muyun Qingge were beside him. Besides, this concept had been long gone from his ideology. So long as a person had the consciousness of a human, their look as well as their culture, they would be considered humans. Many centuries ago, humans also used to be merely apes and monkeys. They were humans’ original nature.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Talking up to this point, something seemed to be going on outside. After that, a guard appeared at the entrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My dearest Palace Lords, the guy has come again. He insists on coming in.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let him come in.” Qing Shui quickly said. He wanted to see just what kind of a person he was to be so stubborn. It was very unusually for him to still be unwilling to give up even when he was facing Qing Hanye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The guard quickly went outside. Qing Shui on the other hand was calm and looked at the girls. Qing Hanye seemed a bit uneasy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye’s Nine Yin Body was also one of the most seducing kinds. It wasn’t the kind of pretty and flirtatious seductions but a kind of seduction which came from deep within her body. It was already present she was born. This was due to her having the Nine Yin Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t unusual for men to like this kind of women. This kind of women was seductive to the core. Unless the man was a millionaire, he would have to suffer the fate of having his life shortened being with this woman. In some extreme cases, he might even die because of it. If the third prince of Golden Sacred Palace had known that Qing Hanye possessed the Nine Yin Body and that he would die if he didn’t have the Extreme Yang Body, what would be his thought?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the saying went ‘The man should be a merry person if he died for a beautiful girl’. If he somehow managed to have an enjoyable moment with this woman, it would be worth it even if it costed him his life. Furthermore, there would definitely be a lot of people who shared similar thoughts about it. She possessed exactly this kind of charm to get men to think this way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But speaking of which, though beauty might be important, so was one’s life, particularly the life of people with high social status. They didn’t lack beautiful women around them. Although they might not be able to achieve the kind of beauty Qing Hanye had, they could still at the very least accomplish the goal of looking very beautiful. Hence, there would still be many people who would instead choose to live.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though Yiye Jiange might give people the feeling that she was untainted by even a speck of dust, she was already a mother. Tantai Lingyan was very cold. It would require a man to be very confident in order to have any sorts of thoughts about her. Luo Qingcheng was very mature while Qin Qing looked noble. As for Muyun Qingge, pure and holy would be used to describe her. Qing Shui had no idea what reason the little prawn of Golden Sacred Palace had that would end up making him see Qing Hanye. However, from this point, he could already tell that this guy wasn’t just any sort of good birds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an instant, there was already a young man walking toward here. He could be seen through the entrance of the main hall. At the moment when Qing Shui saw the man, he also couldn’t help but unconsciously praise him in this mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This man seemed about 30 years old. The 30 years old here was using the look from his previous incarnation as a standard. However, the man had the face of a king and eyes that were as bright as stars. His nose hooked and aquiline with the corner of his mouth curved upwards just at the appropriate angle, making himself look quite confident. He was a man brimming with charisma.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though he might seem casual when he walked, he retained his elegance while at the same time, didn’t give people the impression that he was faking it. Around his body emitted a sort of aura that was elegant, splendid and mature. Qing Shui smiled and moved his sight onto Qing Hanye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Does this man look more handsome than me?” Qing Shui asked with a slight teasing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This man looked very cheerful. He had a look which suited the public’s eyes. Though Qing Shui might have the Nine Yang Golden Body, he somewhat gave people the feeling that he was more of a gentle and reserved person. This could be a change resulted from being too overwhelmingly manly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though gentle and reserved, he possessed a very natural aura capable of gaining others trust. His main feature was the mark in between his brows. It was the seal left behind by the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. It was precisely because of this that he looked so gentle and reserved. Without it, he would have looked more manly and cheerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Greetings, fellow Palace Lords. I am here once again.” The man walked into the hall and said with a simper. He looked very calm. Even Qing Shui was a bit surprised by him. To be able to act so casually in front of these women, it only came to say that he had a very strong heart.</span></p>

It’s not that I don’t respect you but I still have my freedom to like someone. I won’t interfere with your normal life. Is that not good enough for you?”</span></p>

By now, he was certain that this man was a fake person. Until now, this man had never bothered to bat an eye on him. Under normal circumstances, it would be impossible for him to not notice him. It was very obvious that he was trying to ignore him on purpose.</span></p>

He had never bothered to pay attention at Qing Shui and also thought that Qing Shui was inferior when compared to him. Perhaps, it might be because he was too occupied to actually show concern for other things.</span></p>

He saw Qing Shui carrying Qing Xiu and was also aware that that was Yiye Jiange’s baby. Seeing that, he felt something very intense raging on in his heart.</span></p>
