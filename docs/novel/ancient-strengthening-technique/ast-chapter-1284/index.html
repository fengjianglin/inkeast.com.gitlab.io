 <p><strong>AST 1284 - You Can't Touch Me, Only I Can Touch You</strong></p>
 <p>"Erm... Can I still pursue you?" Qing Shui asked, a little hesitant.</p>
 <p>This was something which Qing Shui asked after careful consideration. It made Tantai Xuan shiver before she looked at Qing Shui in disbelief. She wondered if she had heard wrongly and looked at Qing Shui, puzzled.</p>
 <p>"You didn't hear wrongly. It's as you've heard. You're a beautiful lady and have a good heart as well. Therefore, it's very easy for people to take a liking to you. I just wonder if I have the right to," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Uh, this is the first time that you've praised me for my beauty, right?" After looking at Qing Shui for a moment, Tantai Xuan said something which caught Qing Shui by surprise. He wondered if it was because Tantai Xuan didn't wish to face this problem.</p>
 <p>He had first met Tantai Xuan when he first went to the Southern Sea but on their second encounter, he was sad to find that Tantai Xuan didn't recognize him and could only be said to have a low impression of him. Back then, it did deal him a setback.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui could understand it. Back then, he was probably nobody to her. However, that old person from Tantai Clan had a good eye and recognized him. Thereafter, he came with Tantai Xuan to the Western Oxhe Continent and they gradually and unknowingly, became friends.</p>
 <p>If something like that hadn't happened, there would probably just be some ambiguous feelings between them. Qing Shui had unintentionally hugged her and took her hand when performing the Nine Continents Steps. Although cultivators were not too particular about small interactions between men and women, it wasn't the case for some women.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan belonged to the latter and was a person who sought to be flawless. She didn't wish to have even the tiniest bit of flaw in her life and thus had not come into contact with relationships before now.</p>
 <p>However, things were sometimes unexpected and beyond one's control. If she was asked if she liked Qing Shui now, she could give an immediate reply that she didn't. Of course, she didn't hate him either. However, if she was asked which man was unforgettable to her, it would definitely be Qing Shui. He was a person she would never forget.</p>
 <p>They say that if you like a person, if you can't get the person to love you, then get the person to hate you. It's because if the person hates you, at least he or she remembers you. Furthermore, sometimes love and hate can be reversed unknowingly.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui also knew that Tantai Xuan didn't like him but he felt that she didn't detest him either. Or maybe she did. Another thing was that he wasn't sure if she planned to get married or if she liked a man who had other women. Therefore, when Qing Shui encountered something like this, he would lack a little confidence. He always felt that because he had other women, he was in no position to talk about love and relationships with her.</p>
 <p>In that instant, Qing Shui's emotions were conflicted. He didn't know what he was thinking and felt that his character was a little conflicted. Sometimes, there were also instances that he would consider from the perspective of his previous life.</p>
 <p>"There's no need to praise beauty. If a person isn't beautiful, no matter how many praises she is showered with, she won't become beautiful," Qing Shui said. He didn't know if Tantai Xuan would answer his earlier question. If she didn't, then Qing Shui won't put her in a spot either.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan thought of her own Master. Back when her Master had first seen Qing Shui from afar, her Master had given Qing Shui a good appraisal and had kept on encouraging her to go out with this man.</p>
 <p>She wouldn't feel that her Master had evil intentions in doing this. In this world, her Master was definitely the person who wanted the best for her. One reason she could meet Qing Shui so often was partially also due to her Master.</p>
 <p>"You really want to pursue me?" Tantai Xuan smiled and looked at Qing Shui. Her gaze also gradually recovered to normal.</p>
 <p>"Mmm! That's right, I want to pursue you." Qing Shui quickly nodded and said seriously.</p>
 <p>"Why do you want to pursue me?" Tantai Xuan had now completely let down her guard.</p>
 <p>"You've already seen me naked, so of course I'm yours now." After giving it some thought, Qing Shui spoke seriously, giving a reason which almost made Tantai Xuan go crazy with anger.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan blushed but was unable to calm her heart down. She threw Qing Shui an annoyed glance and said, "Alright, in the future, you're mine. I'll take up responsibility for you. In the future, you must listen to me, otherwise, I won't want to keep you."</p>
 <p>"Alright, alright. If you wish to make use of me, please be gentle." Qing Shui immediately took the opportunity to retort.</p>
 <p>"B*stard, hooligan..."</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan looked at Qing Shui, her eyes red.</p>
 <p>"I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way. This time around, I'm going to say it seriously. I want to pursue you." Qing Shui knew that Tantai Xuan was angry earlier and it was nothing to make her angry a little bit more. However, he would shave to pacify her later and he must also provide serious assurance. With regard to relationship, one must definitely be serious.</p>
 <p>"Do you think that it feels good to be teasing me?" Tantai Xuan frowned and met Qing Shui's gaze. How could this pure and transcendente lady be a match for Qing Shui? Qing Shui had his own theories and had put them into practice after he came to the world of the nine continents. Regardless if his way of thinking was correct, it was still effective.</p>
 <p>"I'm serious. Actually, after something like that happened, I have been thinking about how I can pursue you. Look, I've been drawing your portraits all this time." Qing Shui quickly took out a stack of portraits that were all of her.</p>
 <p>He had used the portrait of beauty she was on as a reference. Moreover, Qing Shui's drawing skills were quite good and he had drawn her to perfection. At the very least, his drawing was much better than even photographs from his previous life.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan was stunned. Looking at the stack of portraits which really existed and she couldn't even pick out any problems with the drawings. It was said that for one to be able to draw another person to this level, one must first have the target deeply imprinted in his bones and soul. Otherwise, it wouldn't be possible for him to draw something like this.</p>
 <p>She had not spent a lot of time together with him. Although he would also look at her occasionally, his gaze was clear and thus she didn't reproach him either. Looking at these portraits, she was stunned.</p>
 <p>She then lifted her head to look at Qing Shui. She noticed that his gaze was very clear and he also exuded a feeling that would make one quietly trust his words, even if they had only met for the first time. She realized that her good impression of his hadn't been lost and hadn't been affected in the least.</p>
 <p>At the very start, she thought that it was because of Yu Ruyan but she now realized that it wasn't completely so. She gradually realized that when a person remembers another and did so deeply, it was a start of some sort of emotions. The emotions would then slowly change as things happened. When one event or multiple events struck one deeply, then there would be an intrinsic change.</p>
 <p>These portraits could be seen as something like that!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Tantai Xuan. He could sense a hint of the changes she was going through but he didn't feel embarrassed. It was very fast for a man to like a woman. Actually, when that scene had happened, Qing Shui had already thought that he wanted to chase Tantai Xuan. However, he had not had the chance to do so.</p>
 <p>Men like beautiful women, women with character, women with good disposition, dignified women and also women who were like demonesses. It would be best if the woman were to act like a demoness before themselves only.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that he was fickle as well. It was very simple to like a lady but he had a sense of responsibility which made him draw back almost all of his fickle attitude. However, there would still be oversight. These oversights must be destined and Tantai Xuan was one of them.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan paused for a moment before saying softly, "You aren't allowed to touch me, only I can touch you, unless I've agreed to it."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wanted to say more but hadn't expected Tantai Xuan to give such a powerful reply. Qing Shui sensed that Tantai Xuan's words seemed to be a little similar to what her Master seem had said.</p>
 <p>"Then are we considered husband and wife now?" Qing Shui quickly asked.</p>
 <p>"Dream on. We aren't."</p>
 <p>"Then are we considered to be engaged?" Qing Shui asked again.</p>
 <p>"Don't be hoping to save yourself trouble. You said that you'll be pursuing me. Why, are you thinking of carrying me straight to the bed now?" Right now, Tantai Xuan's gaze was a little cold.</p>
 <p>"That's true. Whatever you say. I knew that would be a little too fast and it wouldn't be fair to you. However, even if you were to touch me, I'll have to give you a reminder." Qing Shui once again demonstrated how shameless he could be.</p>
 <p>Seeing Qing Shui acting this way, Tantai Xuan was helpless as well. With a blink, she took two steps forward, summoned her courage and wrapped her arms around Qing Shui's neck and looked at him, blushing.</p>
 <p>Agitated, Qing Shui wrapped his arms around Tantai Xuan's slender waist.</p>
 <p>"You're not allowed to touch me, only I can touch you. You've already forgotten what you said earlier?" Tantai Xuan looked at Qing Shui, her face flushed.</p>
 <p>With her beautiful face in such close proximity that he could sense her breathing on his face, Qing Shui found it very hard for him to sit still.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly removed his hands but soon hugged her lightly again. He knew that since Tantai Xuan could say that earlier, she had basically already agreed. It could even be said that it was a done deal and she was his woman. However, due to the reservations she had as a woman, she was doing this.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hadn't expected that a few portraits could have such a big effect. What he didn't know was that Tantai Xuan also excelled in drawing but just did not have the same mastery as Qing Shui. Therefore, she knew what those drawings Qing Shui drew represented. Something at this level couldn't be drawn just by imitating. A drawing can only be done well when the artist likes the object drawn. For him to be able to draw her so well, to be able to even bring out her charms and aura... This was why she believed in Qing Shui. She was suddenly struck with realization.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hugged Tantai Xuan, feeling satisfied. It was because she was one of the ladies on the Portraits of Beauty and he liked her as well. It was natural for men to like beautiful women. Another thing was about the twelve heavenly meridians. Qing Shui was also wondering if he would be able to clear all of his twelve heavenly meridians in the future.</p>
 <p>He didn't know if others could clear up their twelve heavenly meridians but at the very least, what he knew now was that other people didn't have their twelve heavenly meridians cleared up. However, the ladies he had a relationship which would have one of the twelve heavenly meridians cleared up and thus have some increment to their spirit energy and abilities.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, I feel weird!"</p>
 <p>"What's wrong?" Qing Shui asked softly.</p>
 <p>"I realized that there are some additional things in my heart now."</p>
 <p>"Is the additional thing me, some concern, as well as some things which are indescribable?"</p>
 <p>"Mmm! How did you know?!" Tantai Xuan lifted her head in astonishment.</p>
 <p>"It's because it's the same for me. Another thing is, Xuan`er, you're in love!" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Hearing the way Qing Shui addressed her, Tantai Xuan also felt a strange feeling appearing in her heart.</p>
 <p>Not long later, Yu Ruyan came out. She smiled and looked at the two who were locked in an embrace. When Tantai Xuan saw Yu Ruyan, she quickly pushed away Qing Shui, feeling embarrassed as her face turned flushed red.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan smiled and went up to take Tantai Xuan's hands, saying "I knew that such a day would happen. Sister Xuan, what you embarrassed about? This is something happy. I was more afraid that you wouldn't like him."</p>
