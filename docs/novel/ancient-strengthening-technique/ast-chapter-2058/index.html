 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eldest Mistress, you know that I possess the Nine Yang Body, but how much do you actually know about it?” Qing Shui asked casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang was stunned. She blushed and shot a glare at Qing Shui, “No, I don’t!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s face turned red. He could tell that she obviously knew what he was thinking just by looking at her expression. Besides, she also had the ability to read people’s mind. He had gotten careless yet again. She would immediately know it the moment he started thinking about things like that. He rubbed his nose awkwardly, “Don’t worry about it. I will definitely find the Blaze Moth for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang trembled. Her body had started to feel cold once again. Even though she was at the Blazing Fire Domain and right above the place with high air temperature, it still didn't stop her from feeling cold. Furthermore, this kind of coldness passed through her body very quickly. It was just like an ordinary man who was rolling on the frozen ground naked in a world of ice and snow. Just the thoughts of it were already unbearable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment, Qing Shui was like a bonfire to her. She would only feel a bit better once she got closer to him. The kind of cold she was experiencing caused the internal part of her body to go through excruciating pain and even numbed her body. The beautiful face of hers had also started to turn pale. She was very cold, but yet a layer of thin, cold sweat could be seen dripping off her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She looked at Qing Shui, “I am feeling so cold… Please let me hug you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui quickly embraced her in his arms and revolved his Nine Yang Golden Body. As he looked at the woman who was in pain, there was some pity in his eyes. Reluctant to see the attractive face which would make him depressed, he lifted his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang only lifted her head after a while. The Ice Poison had been suppressed for the time being. She slowly moved away from Qing Shui’s arms and straightened her back, “Thank you!” said Shen Huang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head, “Is this a proper way of thanking someone? We must enter the Blazing Fire Domain as soon as possible. I hope that we will be lucky and find the Blaze Moth as soon as possible.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t have your hopes up. It has been many years since a person run into a Blaze Moth.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Think positive! There is always another way even if we don’t manage to find the Blaze Moth.” Qing Shui suggested after thinking for a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t you dare to even think about that…” said Shen Huang in a grumpy tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, Qing Shui didn’t really mean it that way. He wasn’t trying to tell her that he would use his Nine Yang Physiques against her, it was her who was overthinking it. While looking at her blushing face, he went blank for a moment and forgot to correct himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her beauty was enough to topple over cities. It was magnanimous and extraordinary, but yet it also looked exquisite and fine. Her kind of beauty was solitary. It wasn’t Qing Shui’s first time seeing her. Even though they hadn’t seen each other that many times, each time they met, quite a lot of things would happen between them. Thus, he could sense a familiar feeling from her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you done looking?” Shen Huang called Qing Shui, seeing as he was looking at her and didn’t seem like he would come to his senses anytime soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You look great. There is not a single part of you which doesn’t look good.” Qing Shui came back to his senses and said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little by little, you are starting to cross the line.” Shen Huang said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Am I? Do you really want me to be like an idiot and not pay any attention to you like you are nothing? Besides, it’s because of my instinct that I am looking at you like that. To be honest with you, I think that I have been doing a great job so far.” Qing Shui flaunted himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang knew that Qing Shui was right. Even though a gangster might not be good, being an idiot was even worse. There were two scenarios which could lead to this circumstance, and the first one was acting. People tend to hate hypocrites like these. The other one was a genuine idiot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, for someone like Qing Shui who might seem really bad at times, but yet didn’t actually do anything evil, she felt that he was at the perfect level. It was only now when she realized that this man was an emotional person and also had a good personality. It was no wonder that so many women would fall for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It would have been great if I could meet you a bit earlier.” Shen Huang smiled and suddenly said something which made Qing Shui very confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui was about to ask her what she meant, a few huge flying beasts appeared in front of them. They were the Blazing Fire Dragon Eagles. Each of them had a huge dragon’s head and a body as small as a fly. When they spread both of their wings, they seemed to have the size of at least a hundred meters. The jet-black dragon’s head of theirs was the head of a poisonous dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were four people standing on the Blazing Fire Dragon Eagle that was leading the group. All four of them were men. Behind them were three huge demonic beasts which looked like the Fire Birds. As for what exactly they were, Qing Shui wasn’t interested. The gap between them and the Blazing Fire Dragon Eagle was too big.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It required a bit of luck for a person to choose a decent demonic beast mount. Some people might not be strong, but the mounts and demonic beasts which they had with them might be a lot stronger than themselves. Thus, Qing Shui briefly probed the people on top of the beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was one person on each of the Fire Birds. Out of the three people, one of them was a woman. The woman had a tall and sexy figure. She also had a decent look and she was dressed in a fiery-red dress. She had a very hot body but when it came to her look, she was naturally unable to compare to Shen Huang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui intended to avoid the people, but he wasn’t sure if they were intentionally standing in his path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strength of the Blazing Fire Dragon Eagle was almost equal to Little Rin. Both of them also had fire attributes. At the moment, it seemed like both demonic beasts had their eyes fixed on each other. If it wasn’t because Qing Shui stopped Little Rin from acting, it was likely that it would have leaped forward by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was here for the Blaze Moth. He didn’t intend to fight anyone and thus, he tried his best to not look for any troubles. When both parties came to a stop, Qing Shui let Little Rin turned around to take a different path. However, at this moment, the Blazing Fire Dragon Eagle stood in his path yet again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Friends, What do you mean by this?” Qing Shui looked at the four men opposite him and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, Qing Shui could already confirm that these people were looking for troubles. They had all their eyes fixed on Shen Huang. Shen Huang was standing beside Qing Shui. Thus, she lacked her usual aura which gave people the impression that she was not that sociable. Added on the fact that the people opposite of them were also quite strong, it was a given that they wanted to hit on Shen Huang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This caused Qing Shui to be upset. He instinctively knitted his brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, all four of us are from the Fire Manor. You can call me Huo Lei. I would like to become friends with the two of you. Young lass, how shall I address you? Your beauty is enough to topple over cities. I almost mistook you as a fairy who came down from heaven. I hope that you won’t mind becoming friends with me.” The man thought that he looked handsome and said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that this man had taken a liking on Shen Huang. As for himself, he had already been totally thrown off at the side. The only time when their eyes met was during the first time they started talking to each other. After that, the person had his eyes fixed only on Shen Huang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are still some things that we need to do. This is my husband.” Shen Huang didn’t even bother to lift her head. She let out her arm and immediately held Qing Shui’s hand.</span></p>

He was an experienced playboy. Thus, he was naturally able to tell that Shen Huang was a virgin. However, when he saw Qing Shui holding her hand, he felt intense jealousy. The Fire Manor was one of the top ranking existences in Blazing Fire Domain. Everyone would give faces to him while they were here. There was no way a woman, whom he, Huo Lei, had taken a liking on, could ever run away from him.</span></p>

What’s the purpose of your visit to the Blazing Fire Domain?” The man looked at Qing Shui and Shen Huang while asking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can save your effort. I don’t think there is a need for you guys to know about this.” Qing Shui opened his mouth and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, as long as you are in the Blazing Fire Domain, I have enough privileges to know about what you are doing. It is all for the safety of our land.” The man said in a calm tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knitted his brows upon hearing what he said. This person was purposely looking for troubles. Furthermore, this person must have quite a high status in the Blazing Fire Domain. If Qing Shui was to face off against him now, it would mean that he was making enemies with a lot of forces across the entire Blazing Fire Domain. What a sinister man this guy was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a high chance that the person wouldn’t have cared about Qing Shui if it wasn’t for Shen Huang. At the moment, he was precisely demanding Qing Shui to do as he told.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey you, you don’t seem to have any sense of shame at all. We are all adults here. I don’t feel that there is any need for further discussions. She is my woman. If you ever dare to hit on her again, I can assure you that I will give you a good beating.” Qing Shui knitted his brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Give me a good beating? Is that really what you just said? Haha, did you guys hear it? He actually said that he wanted to hurt me! As if I, Huo Lei, is someone who will be bullied by the likes of you!” The man laughed. He was laughing very loudly.</span></p>
