 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2375 - My Father is the Forsaken Heaven Region's Dominator</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Why is there a need for you to emphasize that? Are you suspecting that your Alchemist has deceived you?" Qing Shui smiled and provoked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Quite casual of you to keep smiling in this situation. Not bad. Don't be crying later." The Peach Blossom City's City Lord suddenly realized that his emotions were unstable and he didn't understand why.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Mmm. The medicine is definitely real." Qing Shui could sense that his strength, as well as the two ladies', were disappearing very rapidly. The leaking of their Origin Qi was something that even the people around them could sense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Kid, what's so important about women? To think that you would eat the medicinal pill that I've given you for the sake of two ladies. You must be a fool. If you are strong, you can get all the women you want. This isn't devotion. It is just foolishness." The City Lord laughed out loud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, many people didn't disapprove of what the City Lord said. At Qing Shui's level, it was really a foolish act to sacrifice himself for two ladies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"However, your medicinal pill might not have the effects you wanted." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After saying this, all ten of his caves appeared behind him and their golden glow dyed this part of the world in a golden color.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What?! Ten caves?!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Old Wang, my eyes aren't playing tricks on me, right? Are those really ten caves?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Your eyes are fine. Not only are there ten caves, but all of them are golden caves as well."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Legend has it that the tenth cave has a mysterious effect. Could it be that it can negate the God Killing Pill's medicinal effect?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A strong gush of vitality rose from Qing Shui's body, connecting with the powers of the ten caves that were outside. Qing Shui's Nature Energy also moved around in his body intensely and the Yin-Yang Image kept on spinning non-stop. With that, Qing Shui's cultivation that was plunging before started to recover gradually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The City Lord's countenance was extremely grim. To think Qing Shui had ten caves and that he had encountered such a heaven-defying existence. If he didn't escape now, the consequences would be dire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Open!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The nine caves behind the Peach Blossom City's City Lord Manor appeared. A person with nine caves was already considered to be a great genius, an existence that countless people would be jealous of. However, with Qing Shui's ten caves, his nine caves became dull in comparison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, eight of the nine caves were foggy, appearing to be very mysterious. People who knew their stuff would be able to tell that this was the special characteristics of the Nurture God Realm. The Peach Blossom City's City Lord was already at the eighth level of the Nurture God Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the Nurture God Realm, the primary goal was to nurture the caves. The existences in the caves could be changed. For example, if one were to encounter suitable demonic beasts or battle techniques, they could change them at will. However, it would take about a year for the process to take place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three of the caves were empty while there were some mysterious existences in the remaining five caves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui called out his Golden Primordial Bear as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he wasn't at the Nurture God Realm, he had ten caves and they were all golden. However, the duration for the tenth cave was still very short and therefore, the Golden Primordial Bear hadn't received any tremendous improvement after being in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Peach blossom filled the air！</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Densely packed and brilliantly colored peach blossoms flew around the Peach Blossom City's City Lord, making Qing Shui extremely speechless. Why was this guy pulling this trick? If it were a beautiful lady performing this instead, it would definitely look dazzling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui and the others were also amidst the peach blossoms. Both his vision and Spiritual Sense were obstructed. Moreover, these peach blossoms seemed to contain poisonous elements. As time passed, one would start to feel drowsy. This wasn't all. One's body, reaction, and speed were all affected.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui put out his hand and pushed the two ladies out of the reach of the peach blossoms; at the same time, he struck out a punch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The City Lord's figure appeared not far away from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a crisp sound rang out, Qing Shui was attacked by something that was like a water streak. The surroundings were sealed by ice. Though Qing Shui wasn't sealed in one, it felt as if he had sunken into a swamp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Icemoon Bird！</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui noticed this huge ice-blue colored bird. It was a phoenix's descendant and legend had it that it was a type of Blue Luan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui struck out a Stellar Transposition. It was because he discovered that the City Lord had disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui wasn't very worried, but he had to remain on his guard. With a single thought, the Divine Battle Puppet appeared and guarded the two ladies along with the people from the Divine Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment this huge fellow appeared, it gathered many people's attention. A hint of Spiritual Sense was within it and it was like Qing Shui's clone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Stellar Transposition struck the Icemoon Bird, causing it to disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Icemoon Birds were very dangerous. Their main skill was their control abilities. Right now, the Golden Primordial Bear was fighting the two giants. Although it was being overshadowed, it wasn't in any real danger at the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ones fighting the Golden Primordial Bear were an Ancient Earth Dragon and an Ancient Hellhound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, Qing Shui suddenly realized that the number of ancient beasts had increased. Would there be even more ancient beasts in the Forsaken Heaven Region or even at the Upper Three Regions?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Peach Blossom City's City Lord Manor primarily used his powerful Nurture God Realm abilities to fight against Qing Shui's Golden Primordial Bear. In fact, Qing Shui was only one step away from reaching the Nurture God Realm, but this one step had a huge difference. The reason his cave's Golden Primordial Bear could take on two opponents at the same time wasn't only because of its blood lineage, but also because of the cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Qing Shui reached the same level as the City Lord then the Golden Primordial Bear's great prowess would be inestimable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui commanded the Dragon Slaying Beast to work together with his Buddha Bright Seal and Dragon-capturing Hands. The Stellar Transposition could only be used about once every five minutes. However, Qing Shui's attacking prowess was enough and it didn't take very long to deal with these demonic beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui saw the City Lord through his Heavenly Vision Technique. He seemed to be hesitating about what he should do. He was being overly careful and had made arrangements with the others to get ready to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately for him, Qing Shui had already used the Nine Palace Laws to seal up the place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The last demonic beast was struck by Qing Shui in the neck. It would at least suffer from serious injuries even if it didn't die. Most importantly, it couldn't get back on its feet after very long.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having attained a breakthrough, Qing Shui was able to crush the Peach Blossom City's City Lord. However, if it wasn't because he had ten caves, it would probably be hard to tell who would end up victorious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There's no way to escape," Qing Shui appeared not far away from the City Lord and said, smiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I admit my loss today. I won't find trouble for you in the future. Should we just go about our own ways?" The City Lord suffered too many losses today, but he didn't care about it now. With his life being threatened, other things were no longer important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Are you a fool or an idiot? Don't you think that the things you are saying are very amusing?" Qing Shui really had no idea why the City Lord had the confidence of saying such stuff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I’ll ask you in return. Do you really think that you can kill me? My father is the dominator over the Forsaken Heaven Region. If you were to kill me, you'll incur his wrath." The City Lord seemed to be afraid that Qing Shui would take action and kill him immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dominator over the Forsaken Heaven Region was the ruler of a region, the strongest expert in the area. He could also be said to be the dominator over the Middle Three Regions and even if he were to head to the Upper Three Regions, he would still be an existence worthy of being in it. Qing Shui knew that he wouldn't be able to take on such an existence at the current moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Peach Blossom City was a strong city within the Forsaken Heaven City and could be ranked in the top ten. However, at his current strength, he was still quite away from people in the regional cities, let alone the fact that the Forsaken Heaven Region's dominator would be even more powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Is your father the Forsaken Heaven Region's dominator just because you say that he is? Do you still remember what I asked you earlier?" Qing Shui was very happy now. He was in no mood to consider the mentioned dominator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What... what did you ask?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If a person who is weaker than you were to snatch your women, what would you do?" Qing Shui's sharp gaze looked toward the Peach Blossom City's City Lord.</span></p>
