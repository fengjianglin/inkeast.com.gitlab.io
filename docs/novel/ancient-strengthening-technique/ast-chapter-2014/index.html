 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stared at the cave entrance and felt the aura of a beast nearing them. This aura was very powerful and fierce. However, Qing Shui wasn’t worried. He felt that he should be able to deal with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But no matter what, this was still the internal part of the Spiritual land. He wouldn’t know what kind of dangers awaited him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Houu!!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A heaven-shaking roar came through. A figure appeared at the entrance of the cave. Qing Shui was stunned at the moment he saw that thing; it was a demonic beast. It didn’t look that big and was only bigger than the Dragon Slaying Beast by about two times. However, it was much thicker than the Dragon Slaying Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its entire body was fiery red. Its head resembled a lion, but at the same time, it also looked a bit like a dragon’s head. There was a horn on its head. Overall, it looked a bit cute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its body was emitting powerful dragon aura. After glancing at it for a while, Qing Shui began to think strongly that it looked like an existence which existed in legends from his previous incarnation, the auspicious beast, Kirin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his previous incarnation, the Kirin was God’s mount. People from ancient times treated Kirins as generous and auspicious animals. The male beast was known as Ki, whereas its female counterpart was known as Rin. Kirins were different from Pixius. A Kirin was a divine beast which brought prosperity, peace, and longevity. There was a myth which said that Kirins blessed people with children. Kirins had the head of a dragon, the body of a horse and scales of a fish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kirins were fire attributed Divine Beasts. Certainly, Qing Shui wasn’t sure if the beast he was seeing in front of him was a Kirin. However, he was still a bit agitated. After all, people from China had always been very fond of things like real Divine Dragons, the four divine beasts and the vicious beasts as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kirin was a beast which brought prosperity. It was said to bestow people with children and good luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite its only average size, a powerful aura could be felt emitting from its body. Even though Qing Shui was unsure of its exact strength, he could confirm that it was definitely more powerful than Beiming Xue and Yu Xixuan. Its strength should be roughly around twenty billion Dao Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was currently unknown if one could break through to the Eighth Divine Grade with this strength, but it was confirmed that this was definitely beyond what the two girls were capable of. After all, human warriors were usually unable to defeat beasts that were at the same level as them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This demonic beast was very alert when it looked at Qing Shui. Similarly, Qing Shui was also looking back at it. Without a doubt, this was definitely a Spiritual Beast. Furthermore, it didn’t seem to have reached its adulthood. To think that it already possessed such fearsome powers before it even fully matured…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What kind of existence was this? It was likely that even those warriors of true Dragon Tribes, who ranked ahead in their tribe, might not be more powerful than this demonic beast when it came to their innate talents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Qing Shui came up with the thought to tame this beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Usually, people would go for the rough way when it came to taming beasts. Another way was to spend time with a demonic beast which just hatched out from an egg. The last alternative was by taming a baby beast. It was a lot easier to tame a beast before it became mature. However, certainly, none of the methods could compare to taming a beast as soon as it hatched, as it was the easiest method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Particularly in the case of Spiritual Beasts. The more mature they were, the harder it was to tame them. Unless they decided to recognize their owner on their own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui slowly got close to it. He didn’t know if he could block the enemy’s attack with his current defensive prowess, but he felt that it shouldn’t be a problem. Other than that, Qing Shui was also holding a medicinal pill in his hand. It was the Supreme Sacred Beast Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was the one who came up with that name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, the earliest pill he got was the Sacred Beast Pill. Later on, he managed to refine some High-Level Sacred Beast Pills. Until now, Qing Shui already had the Supreme Sacred Beast Pill. Without a doubt, their effect became more and more potent with every improvement. However, so far, Qing Shui had never once used the Supreme Sacred Beast Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sacred Beast Pill was precisely a medicinal pill used to tame demonic beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah, a Spiritual Beast… I have always wanted one to be mine……” Yu Xixuan looked at the demonic beast with eyes which seemed like she was craving to obtain it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I want it too…..” Beiming Xue was looking at the demonic beast. Deep down, she was really yearning for the beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, Qing Shui was able to hear them. Putting aside whether or not he was able to tame it for now, even if he had it, he couldn’t give it to other people; he also needed it for himself. For now, the Dragon Slaying Beast was the only beast which he could take out, let alone him not being related to the two women. If it had been his women who were here with him, he would have given it to them without any hesitations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Certainly, this thought didn’t mean that Qing Shui intended to make the two women his own. It was not that he didn’t like beautiful women, nor was it that Beiming Xue and Yu Xixuan weren’t beautiful enough. In his heart, he had always had a thought. Even though there might be a lot of beautiful women across the world, he shouldn’t expect to own every single one he came across. Could he possibly ask for every single one of them to be his? Let alone he already had a lot of women that were his wives. He had a feeling that increasing the number of wives he had, would be unfair to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hou!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time Qing Shui charged in once again, the demonic beast already unleashed its attack. It opened its mouth and shot out a fireball towards Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a bright and beautiful flame. The flame looked as if it was alive. Even though it wasn’t really big, it was giving out a violent elemental energy. Qing Shui’s expression became heavy. He lifted up his hand and countered the flame with his Primordial Flame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong-hong…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like before, Qing Shui was put in a difficult situation and could do nothing but step back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Primordial Flame wasn’t enough to fight against the opponent. If it wasn’t because of his ability to resist up to 70% flame attributed attacks, he would have immediately been at a disadvantage with just one clash. Qing Shui let out his hand and summoned the Dragon Slaying Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hou!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as the Dragon Slaying Beast showed up, it immediately reduced this demonic beast’s power by 20%. Indeed, it possessed the blood of the Dragon Tribes. Following on, Qing Shui formed a Diamond Seal with both of his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Buddha Seal shining with golden light immediately appeared in front of Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dignified golden Buddha Seal was giving out a magnificent aura. Even Qing Shui himself was amazed by it. The Buddha Ultimate Art didn’t let down its name as an ultimate technique. Qing Shui felt a sense of warmth upon unleashing the Diamond Seal. It felt as if he had put on an armor; he felt a sense of security which words couldn’t describe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of the young ladies were frozen in shock. It seemed that they might have underestimated this man. What else did he know? Before this, his unusual fighting technique back when he was on the platform already amazed a lot of people. He managed to beat them while keeping his aura from leaking out… And now, he demonstrated such kind of martial techniques…</span></p>

Qing Shui lifted up his hand and whipped the incoming flames with his Primordial Flame Dragon Whip.</span></p>

It was unavoidable. Despite his effort to avoid two of them, the last fire still managed to strike Qing Shui. However, Qing Shui felt a warm sensation across his body. He didn’t seem to be injured.</span></p>

After that, it charged towards Qing Shui like a bolt of lightning. Just as Qing Shui was about to react to it, the beast’s attack had already reached him.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was too fast! Qing Shui was really amazed by it. It would have been great if the Dragon Slaying Beast had speed like this. It would definitely turn out to be a human killing machine.</span></p>

However, he felt that he didn’t suffer any injuries, nor did the golden light appear. He let out a sigh of relief. If this was the case, he might just be able to deal with the demonic beast.</span></p>

It was Qing Shui whose defensive prowess was too powerful. Added on that the beast was fire attributed, it could be considered to have been totally suppressed by Qing Shui. However, Qing Shui felt that there were quite a lot of existences which he could manage to suppress. After all, this had to do with his abilities.</span></p>

A bright Buddha seal immediately struck on the demonic beast’s body. It surprised Qing Shui that the seal actually caused the demonic beast to stagger as it charged towards him.</span></p>

The Buddha Wisdom Seal was supposed to only reduce the enemies’ offensive prowess. He never expected for it to actually make the opponent to falter when the gap of strength was so huge. This was indeed a huge surprise to him. Could this ability be similar to the Dragon-capturing Hands?v</span></p>
