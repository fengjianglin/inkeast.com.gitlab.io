 <p><strong>AST 1395 - Fourth Grade Five Elements Divine Flag, Bring One Person Along, Trapped in a Dilemma </strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui was not afraid of massacres, but he did not want to massacre any more than he must. In his previous life, he had laughed when he heard that a man could not help but go with the tide. However, this was exactly how he felt in the current situation. There were so many things that were outside of his control, neither could he hide from these troublesome things. The only road was the one in front of him. It was a dark path that he must walk until the end.</p>
 <p>“The strongest in the Left Custodian’s clan is the Left Custodian. From the Left Custodian’s clan, there may not be anyone who comes to cause trouble but the Phoenix Dance Organization may not be so nice,” Yu Yijian said just now.</p>
 <p>“Oh, if that is the case, we don’t know if the Phoenix Dance Organization would like to continue to fight?” Qing Shui looked over at Yun Yijian and said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Phoenix Dance had been around for a very long time, normally they would not admit defeat so easily. After all, brother Qing Shui you dented the Phoenix Dance Organization by your lonesome to that degree, in addition to brother Qing’s age, Phoenix Dance Organization will have a hard time giving up on you.” Yun Yijian thought for a while before speaking seriously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought for a bit and agreed with her thinking. He had no renown. If he had renown, if he had annihilated several powers like that of Phoenix Dance Organization, then the Phoenix Dance Organization would have nothing to say about the death of the Left Custodian and Che Clan.</p>
 <p>If the need arose, Qing Shui would not hesitate to use Phoenix Dance Organization as a stepping stone. Annihilating the Phoenix Dance Organization would cause a drastic change of power in the Phoenix Dance Continent. Many countries would become independent. If there was anyone who wanted to control the Phoenix Dance Continent, then he would need the strength to do so.</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, more than two hours had passed by. The Yun couple and Tianhe Renmo temporarily returned to their respective rooms. Yuan Su, Yehuang Guwu and the young girl were together, they almost seemed like a family.</p>
 <p>Qing Jun and Qing Shui were already familiar, right now they were almost like a real father and daughter duo. If the young girl had no issues she would still stick close to Qing Shui. Qing Shui knew a few tricks that could make her happy. Moreover, the hand signs were all taught by Qing Shui, so her communication with Qing Shui was the best.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu had no signs of pregnancy so far, which made her feel lonely and depressed. Qing Shui, however, did not feel the same. What they had was time so giving birth to a child was only a matter of time.</p>
 <p>During these times, Qing Shui could be said to have used all his ‘essence’ on Yehuang Guwu. Every day, he would fatigue her to the point of almost collapsing. For the sake of a child, she cooperated to the best of her abilities. Moreover, Qing Shui could feel an unprecedented amount of enjoyment.</p>
 <p>However, the more they were like this, the more she lost hope. Qing Shui tried to comfort her, saying that he was a physician and that her body had no issues. It was just that the chance to conceive was less likely and it would take more time and more tries to succeed but there would always be a chance.</p>
 <p>These things could not be rushed. This was a slight drawback to having formidable strength, however the chance would not be lower than what it was, thus there was no need to rush. Just wait patiently!</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Entering the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal again, when Qing Shui was refining and tempering his treasures, he laughed because the Five Elements Divine Flag leveled up……</p>
 <p>Once Qing Shui saw the ability of the Five Elements Divine Flag, he was extremely happy.</p>
 <p>Five Elements Divine Flag (husband)!</p>
 <p>Current fourth grade, can set three locations within the Five Elements Space, each location can be traveled to once a month.</p>
 <p>It was still three locations, that had not changed. The first location was in Central Continent, the second was in Phoenix Dance Continent and the third was in the center of Haohan Continent.</p>
 <p>This time the grade increased by one but the positions that could be set remained at three, however there was an ability gained.</p>
 <p>Other than the husband and wife Five Elements Divine Flags being transferred, they could bring one other person along.</p>
 <p>To bring one person……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui became excited, even though it was just one person a month. It meant that he could bring twelve people every year, there and back. He could reunite with family, whoever he wanted to see, he could also bring back……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was excited, even ecstatic. For example, if Yuan Su wanted to head back, he could take her back right now.</p>
 <p>This was the fourth grade, the further it got in the grades, who knew how many people he could bring and how many locations could be set. Perhaps even a reduction in the cool down duration.</p>
 <p>After some thought, Qing Shui temporarily set aside his idea. He proceeded to refine and temper the rest of his treasures, however none of them had changes. Qing Shui could sense that several pieces were on the border of leveling up. Perhaps the next time he tempered them they would level up, perhaps it would take years before they would level up.</p>
 <p>No matter what, this time could be considered a huge breakthrough. Without thinking too far ahead, the state of the current Five Elements Divine Flag could already be considered a small Divine Artifact.</p>
 <p>As long as they decided to settle there in the future, he could bring the family over. He would consider the situation first, if there was a need, then he would bring over the family. Now his heart was getting unsettled. He felt it was safer to have his family settle on the five continents for now.</p>
 <p>He would wait for now, if the opportunity arose, he would temporarily bring his family over to the Dancing Phoenix Continent. That was because the cultivation speed here was faster than the five continents given the environmental factors.</p>
 <p>He would first wait for the situation in the Phoenix Dance Continent to stabilize and for his existence to be confirmed before thinking about it any further.</p>
 <p>The day passed by so peacefully. The Phoenix Dance Organization had taken no actions. There were many powers that were keeping a close eye on the progress of the current situation.</p>
 <p>Originally, no one had faith in Qing Shui but the scene with the enraged Hellfire Phoenix left everyone in suspense, now that many believed the Phoenix Dance Organization could not withstand this young man.</p>
 <p>The next day, Elder Yun Yang showed up. After seeing Qing Shui he let out a bitter smile. It was the first time the arrogant elder looked a bit embarrassed while glancing at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“I had previously underestimated Phoenix Dance’s strength, this was my carelessness. Fortunately, Mr. Qing’s strength is so formidable. I will admit to my mistakes, if mister has any use for Yun Yang, please let me know without hesitation. No matter what you ask of me, I will agree to it and complete it to the best of my abilities.”</p>
 <p>“Old man, you do not have to be overly courteous. Come, take a seat, I actually have something that I didn’t know what to do about.” Qing Shui smiled as he indicated for the old man to sit down.</p>
 <p>The others were also here, however Qing Jun had a specific maid looking after her.</p>
 <p>“Oh, let me hear it.” The elder was more courteous than before. Before he would view Qing Shui as a member of the younger generation, however, right now it was the complete opposite. In the world of martial artists, the strong were respected.</p>
 <p>“I’m not sure what Phoenix Dance’s plans are, I had originally thought they would seek me out immediately,” Qing Shui said directly to the elder.</p>
 <p>“Now that things have gone to this point, Phoenix Dance would not instigate and step first. Or to be clear, in the short term, they would not take this initial step. They would rather mister take action first, when the time comes and they could not defend, they could at least try to find another way,” the elder said after much thought.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Dance must carefully plan out their next steps due to Qing Shui’s frightening strength, otherwise they could be annihilated. If they suffered a loss unwillingly, then the name of Phoenix Dance Organization as the strongest force on the Phoenix Dance Continent would be weakened.</p>
 <p>To have done something wrong and still want to pretend to be the good guy. After hearing the elder’s words, Qing Shui thought that the Phoenix Dance Organization was the worst. When the time called for a decision to be made and yet they hesitated, they would only be dragged down by their inaction. If Phoenix Dance Organization was willing to suffer humiliation by admitting to their wrongdoings and apologized, Qing Shui really could not do anything more. Of course, if he really wanted to do it, he could but he would not have any moral grounds to do it.</p>
 <p>The problem was, Phoenix Dance Organization was not certain whether they could take down both Qing Shui and his beasts. They were also afraid that Qing Shui was going to run. Once they started the fight, there was no going back. Therefore, they did not want to take action first. They would rather Qing Shui force them to take action, then use the opportunity to kill Qing Shui. If they did not succeed, there could also be another way to salvage the situation.</p>
 <p>Would Qing Shui force them to take action?</p>
 <p>Yes!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s face had a desperate smile. If they wanted him to force their hand, then he could comply with their wish. However, he would not let them have their way.</p>
 <p>“Old man, if the Phoenix Dance Organization was annihilated, what would become of Phoenix Dance Continent?” Qing Shui asked hypothetically.</p>
 <p>The elder was stunned and thought for a while, “There would be a power that would inherit all that belonged to the Phoenix Dance Organization. On the surface nothing would change but the power that inherits all of Phoenix Dance Organization’s property would need to show their strength. For instance, whoever annihilated the Phoenix Dance Organization would undoubtedly have claim to take over everything belonging to the Phoenix Dance Organization.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought it over and agreed with the logic. If he wiped out the Phoenix Dance Organization, would he need to take over everything? He was not part of any organization. Southern Sea Putuo Mountain and Heaven Secrets Academy were not qualified.</p>
 <p>Though the mentioned organizations could not take over, Qing Shui thought that if there were people who wanted to take over, they would at least contact him first. If he did not agree to it, then they will end up fighting him. Unless, they were confident enough to be able to best him.</p>
 <p>Thinking to this point, Qing Shui thought he had gotten ahead of himself. He should be focusing on how to deal with the massacre between him and the Phoenix Dance Organization first. He could travel to the nest of the Phoenix Dance Organization and end things once and for all.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not know how large the Phoenix Dance Organization was. They were the strongest existence on the surface of Phoenix Dance Continent but they were made up of many large powers and clans combined. Usually one clan would only have one to several people enter the Organization but it represented the entire clan’s entry.</p>
 <p>The Che Clan had only two or three people enter but the entire Che Clan could have been said to be a part of the Phoenix Dance Organization. In totality, the Elders and Custodians of the Phoenix Dance Organization plus the members it had did not account for a large amount of people. However, each person was backed by many people, similar to that of the Che Clan. They only had two or three people within the Organization but the entire Che Clan and the dozens of False God martial artists all belonged to Phoenix Dance.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had already encountered the Left Custodian, if he went upwards it would be the Deputy Head and Head. There could also be several formidable old monsters, thus Qing Shui’s mind was not optimistic. The opposition did not make a move because they had much to lose, whereas Qing Shui had nothing to lose but much to gain.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was so young but the strength he displayed could only mean he had a bright future ahead. Phoenix Dance had no choice but to tread carefully, if they did not kill Qing Shui and let him run off, then only death awaited them. This was the reason why they did not take action yet. Otherwise, given Phoenix Dance Organization’s strength, they could easily slaughter Qing Shui. The main thing was not to allow him to escape.</p>
 <p>“I feel that mister should temporarily cease fire against the Phoenix Dance Organization instead of risking your life,” the elder suddenly said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was still analyzing whether to not go but since the elder gave him the advice, Qing Shui laughed and asked, “Old man, please call me Qing Shui. Could you tell me why I should not go?”</p>
 <p>“Phoenix Dance’s foundation is deeply rooted. Qing Shui your strength is formidable, your beasts are strong, however their foundation is rich with talent. I can be certain that if you rushed over now there would be no benefit, instead if you stayed still, you would end up with the upper hand.” The elder thought for a while before saying those words.</p>
