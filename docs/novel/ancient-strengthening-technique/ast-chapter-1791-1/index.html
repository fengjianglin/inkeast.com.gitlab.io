When the two women came out with their red faces, Qing Shui had already cleaned up. Watching the two happy faces of the women, that attractiveness tickled his heart a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An itching heart, the itching heart of a person wasn’t a very relaxing feeling. It was comparable to what a man felt after seeing a very beautiful woman, who was also very sexy. The well-rounded body made you want to massage her against your body, as though you wanted to eat her and bite her all over...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had that feeling now. Although he had just done it, Qing Shui hadn’t enjoyed himself to his limit back then. His body had no problem and the charm of the women had even less of a problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These were his women. Besides, what happened before had already been done, Qing Shui also hadn’t wronged anybody. He immediately hugged the two women and kissed each of them many times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the chaotic bed, the two women’s faces were still red. Di Qing went over shyly and tidied up the bed, the air still filled with a lewd smell that would make the heart jump.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui sat down with each of his hands in theirs and realized that they had only spoken a bit since they saw each other. Earlier, they went almost directly onto the bed, up until now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ehm Ehm!” Qing Shui embarrassedly coughed, the two women were also a little embarrassed. They also noticed this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You both must be doing well!” Qing Shui spoke. Actually, Qing Shui already knew the answer, he just wanted to start a topic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wonderful, but everyone’s worried about you,” Hai Dongqing said caringly. After she saw that Qing Shui was doing well, she was already very happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your man isn’t a short-lived person, just like unkillable cockroaches. Don’t worry, no one can threaten me, I also can’t afford to lose you two,” Qing Shui said with a grand and lofty feeling. He had this type of confidence at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His strength was powerful and his resistance was strong. He could also mitigate damage, lowering his enemy’s strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You should still be careful, if anything happens, we wouldn’t know how to continue living,” Di Qing said with a light smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that if something happened to him, it would spell the end of the Qing Clan, even being wiped out wouldn’t seem outlandish. Although the strength of the Qing Clan wasn’t bad, there were always stronger people somewhere. The few women had a status higher than treasures. If a few Demonic ranked Divine martial artists were to appear, then the result would be hard to determine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His heirs still didn’t have the power to protect the family themselves right now; the Qing Clan’s strength had to be improved further. The purpose of his visit this time was for his family and he would take the chance to come back whenever he could.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“For your sake, nothing will happen to me either.” Qing Shui declared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he finished saying this, Qing Shui stood up, “They’re back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two women and Qing Shui went out together and after a while, they finally saw Di Chen, Wenren Wu-shuang, Lan Lan, and Yu Chang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Father!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Lan was the first to see Qing Shui. Without stopping, she happily called him and ran right over to hug him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I want Father.” Lan Lan said to Qing Shui happily, her eyes were red because of happiness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Father also is thinking about you,” Qing Shui patted her forehead and extended his arm to hold Yu Chang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Father!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Chang was also very happy. Although she knew that a few years had passed, she didn’t feel that anything had changed. In her heart Qing Shui was always her precious father and he would always love her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was something that Qing Shui also knew and understood. After all, he had his own precious mother.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mingyue Gelou was his own woman and Qing Yan was the child of him and Mingyue Gelou’s, so they were tightly held together. Yu Chang had grown up in the Qing Clan and the first time Qing Shui saved her life was when they first met.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My girls are so beautiful,” Qing Shui rubbed Yu Chang’s head in the same way. The two girls in front of him weren’t his own, but they were his eldest children and they held a very important place in his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re just kidding, father,” Yu Chang muttered with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t know whether he should be worried about them. There was also Qing Bei, who was in the Hundred Flower Sect and the three of them weren’t very young now. Of course, they were still young in general, but in his previous life they would be too old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s it, when they found someone they liked, everything would be fine. Qing Shui didn’t really care about their marriage, he just wouldn’t interfere. In their relationship they had the absolute authority, no matter who they liked Qing Shui would still support them. Of course, if the suitors were wicked beyond redemption then he would have to intervene, but he didn’t think that his girls would have such a bad eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a while before Qing Shui finally smiled and hugged Di Chen and Wenren Wu-shuang. Wenren Wu-shuang blinked her eyes and said playfully, while looking at Di Qing and Hai Dongqing, “They suddenly became beautiful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui rubbed his nose: “You’ll be beautiful, too.”</span></p>

Only this time, it was near the children.</span></p>

Yu He, Mu Qing, and Qing Bei were there.</span></p>

The view was nice here; it was hidden and filled with fruit gardens, farmlands, rivers, creeks, and ravines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw the two women, Qing Shui saw them carefreely drinking tea on the mountaintop and were stunned when they saw Qing Shui.</span></p>
