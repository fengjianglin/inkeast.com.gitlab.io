  <p><strong>AST 266 – Black Champion Monarch Falcon, I’ll kill your wife and daughter first.</strong></p>
  <p>“Haha, it levelled up! It’s level 2 now!”</p>
  <p>For an instant, Qing Shui felt surreal, after all tomorrow was the most crucial day and Qing Shui never imagined that it would still be possible to level up his soulshake bell. He was extremely disappointed during the day but ended up very hopeful.</p>
  <p>In his hands, Qing Shui held the soulshake bell that glowed with an increasingly resplendent purple light. He then channelled his qi from the Ancient Strengthening Technique into it before lightly giving it a shake!</p>
  <p>“Leeeeeeeeeeeeeee” a ear-piercing sound akin to the sounds of metal slashing apart rocks rang out, capable of causing tremors in the hearts of people, losing themselves in panic and even feeling agony.</p>
  <p>Only the soulshake bell at the second level would possess such power…</p>
  <p>“Screech..screech..”</p>
  <p>The fire bird from afar screeched in panic, flapping its wings agitatedly. The fire bird originated from the spatial realm and was Qing Shui’s mount, it could be considered to be extremely powerful but yet at this moment, Qing Shui could clearly sense the intensity of the fire bird’s fear.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui glanced at the soulshake bell and to his shock, he discovered that despite the two tiny holes in the bell not being aimed at the fire bird, just the sound of the chimes was sufficient to cause such a high intensity of panic and fear from the fire bird.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui didn’t dare to test it again, if the fire bird really died, Qing Shui might as well go bang his head against a wall. He was extremely satisfied with the results however. He also realised that after evolving to level 2, the amount of qi needed to activate the bell was 5x more compared to previous uses. Not only that, he could sense that even though the amount of qi needed for activation was 5x more, the might unleashed by the level 2 soulshake bell was definitely stronger than a factor of 5x.</p>
  <p>He also discovered that the current soulshake bell which was at level 2, could be refined up to 20 times per day. After he completed the refinement, Qing Shui focused on his cultivation as well as his proficiency in his various techniques.</p>
  <p>Following that, he equipped himself with the golden-ringed armor, battle boots, helmet, bracelet as well as the coldsteel needles before exiting the realm.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui walked down and realised that the second day would soon be arriving. Despite so, the residence of the two girls was still filled with lights. When Qing Shui entered their residence, he also discovered that the Canghai couple was there, also fully decked out in their battle attire as well.</p>
  <p>“Senior!” Qing Shui greeted.</p>
  <p>“Hmm, Qing Shui, seems like the rest did you good.” Canghai’s wife smiled at him.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui also laughed in response. Canghai’s wife was equipped in a golden battle skirt as well as the jade green battle boots, exuding a sense of unmatched elegance. The golden battle skirt fitted her contours perfectly, further accentuating her figure. She really was a stunning mature woman.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui you look even more handsome compared to my husband Canghai, there will surely be many females that will be mesmerized with you.” Canghai’s wife laughed.</p>
  <p>Canghai laughed in agreement, after all Qing Shui could be considered his nephew, and he had long regarded Qing Shui as his son-in-law.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui could only smile awkwardly. At this moment, Canghai Mingyue walked out of her bedroom. She also equipped the golden battle skirt, and she also held onto a helmet in her hand. Her cloud-like flowing hair was tied up in a bun, her unmatched beauty was extraordinary and resplendent as a majestic sense of beauty emanated from her.</p>
  <p>Upon seeing Qing Shui, she frantically avoided his gaze. Qing Shui took out the inner armor he recently forged in the past two days. This armor was able to increase defense by 10% but had no enhancement to the other attributes. When faced against the might of heavy weapons, it’s severely lacking compared to the battle skirt.</p>
  <p>“Mingyue, pass this to Liu-Li, she can no longer equip the golden battle skirt.” Qing Shui passed the inner armor over.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue mumbled a response as she accepted the inner armor. She didn’t even glance at Qing Shui before she turned and walked into Huoyun Liu-Li’s room. She couldn’t understand why she felt an ambivalence of joy and sadness when Qing Shui said to pass this inner armor he recently forged to Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue silently hated herself for having so many weird thoughts!</p>
  <p>Time slowly flowed by, but all of them felt as though time passed exceptionally fast. Huoyun Liu-Li and Canghai Mingyue held hands as they came out from the room.</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li smiled at the Canghai couple as she greeted them.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, this is for you.” Liu-Li, tore the black gemstone dangling from her neck as she passed it to Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui hesitated after all this black gemstone was something Canghai Mingyue’s mom had given to Huoyun Liu-Li, and not only that, it was the gift signifying the acceptance of Huoyun Liu-Li as her adoptive daughter.</p>
  <p>“I don’t need it now, you can return it back to me in the future.” Huoyun Liu-Li smiled.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui rejected her kind intentions no longer as he slung the black gemstone over his neck. At the same time, he could feel a surge of energy flowing into his body, as his legs were infused with strength.</p>
  <p>3rd-level black gemstones were really effective, his speed had increased by 10%.</p>
  <p>The house went quiet, Qing Shui discovered that Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li would sneak glances at him occasionally.</p>
  <p>“He’s so good looking in this attire…”</p>
  <p>“Canghai Mingyue ah Canghai Mingyue… when have you ever even noticed how good a male would look…?”</p>
  <p>But as she saw the knowing glances of her parents, she could only shyly look away, but thinking of the incoming disaster that they would all be facing, she felt as though a cold bucket of ice rained down upon her. What should they do?</p>
  <p>Abruptly, Qing Shui sensed a immense flying beast flying over towards their direction!</p>
  <p>“They are coming.” Canghai bitterly laughed, as he stood up. Canghai Mingyue equipped the helmet, as she pulled Liu-Li along.</p>
  <p>“Let us go out.” Canghai lightly spoke, as they exited the residence. Other than Huoyun Liu-Li, the rest were all equipped in their full battle attire.</p>
  <p>An Instant later!</p>
  <p>“Canghai, hahaha!” A resounding voice without restraint drifted over!</p>
  <p>Shortly after, Qing Shui saw a flying demon beast of immense proportions!</p>
  <p>That gigantic body of the flying beast was even larger compared to the fire bird and golden-winged thunder hawk. It’s silver-colored frame was as tough as metal and it had a wingspan of over 100m. It’s thick and muscular leg in addition to its terrifyingly sharp claws caused people who saw it to feel terror in the depth of their hearts.</p>
  <p>The most imposing thing was the black-colored crown like mark on its head that resembled an eagle. Awe inspiring and incomparably mighty, emanating the aura of a monarch.</p>
  <p>Black Champion Monarch Falcon!</p>
  <p>There were two men mounted atop the black falcon, one of them was an old hunchback clad in white, with his silvery hair fluttering in the wind. His hands were also holding on to a golden-colored dragon head staff.</p>
  <p>Seeing the 2nd person on the falcon gave Qing Shui a bad shock, it was none other than the middle-aged man who went to look for him in his blacksmith store.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui couldn’t sense the actual strength of the old blindee, after all the disparity within their powers was too great. However not only that, he also couldn’t accurately get a grasp of the actual strength level of the purple robed middle aged man.</p>
  <p>“Old blindee, get down here. Since you are already here, shouldn’t we have a reckoning?” Canghai’s nonchalant laughter rang out as he spoke, facing towards the air.</p>
  <p>The old blind guy held on to the purple robed middle aged man by the arm as they jumped from the air. With their speeds akin to a fired arrow, landing on the ground soundlessly.</p>
  <p>“Canghai, you blinded one of my eye 30 year ago, did it feel good to kill my wife and son back then?” The hunchback old blindee chortled.</p>
  <p>“Your son brought calamity upon himself while your wife suicided. But regardless of everything, since you are here, and purposely targeting me, I’ll take on all the debts.” Canghai laughed.</p>
  <p>“Hahaha, targeting you, of course I’m targeting you. But first I will let you watch how your wife and daughter, and your son-in-law dies before letting you experience an agony that’s even worse than death.” The old blind guy laughed uproariously.</p>
  <p>Only now could Qing Shui clearly see the face of the old blindee, he was pretty average in looks, with a milky patch of whiteness in his right eye. His left eye glinted with a cruel. malevolent light that struck fear in the hearts of others.</p>
  <p>Just from that eye alone, Qing Shui could tell that the blind guy was an evil man reveling in bloody slaughters, and enjoyed the torment of others!</p>
  <p>“Picking on the young and women, are you not a man?” Canghai laughed again, his tone filled with disdain.</p>
  <p>“Hehe, there’s no need to infuriate me, it’s useless no matter what you say. When you killed my family, why didn’t you ask yourself the same thing? Nobody should be clearer than you regarding how many times have you killed the disciples from my Immortal Sword Sect in these past 30 years. The blind hunchback remarked coldly, as though he wanted to devour Canghai with his gaze alone.</p>
  <p>“Those that I killed, all deserved their death, why don’t you take a look at what your Immortal Sword Sect has become? I blame myself for the fact that I was softhearted, and that I didn’t wipe all of you out 30 years ago.”</p>
  <p>“Yup, what’s the use of regretting now? I’ll let you know what is true regret when you witness your family dying in my hands.” The old blind guy slowly straightened his back, as he stood upright, giving Qing Shui a strange feeling that it was as though that old man had grown younger by several years.</p>
  <p>“Me, Canghai, has never regretted the things I’ve done. Are you not afraid of the after-actions the Heavenly Palace will take against you?” Canghai coldly stated.</p>
  <p>Upon hearing the words of Canghai, the blind old man continued laughing, “Canghai, you are merely someone that got chased out of the Heavenly Palace, to think you still have the cheek to mention them. Not only that, do you think I made no preparations in these past 30 years? Since I dare to move against you, naturally I would have already factor in the actions of the Heavenly Palace in my calculations.”</p>
  <p>“You threw in your lot with the Sword Tower!” Canghai exclaimed in disbelief.</p>
  <p>“Smart. HAHAHA!”</p>
  <p>At this moment, Qing Shui could sense many powerful auras emerging from all directions around Canghai’s residence.</p>

 <p>“Canghai Mingyue ah Canghai Mingyue… when have you ever even noticed how good a male would look…?”</p>
 <p>But as she saw the knowing glances of her parents, she could only shyly look away, but thinking of the incoming disaster that they would all be facing, she felt as though a cold bucket of ice rained down upon her. What should they do?</p>
 <p>Abruptly, Qing Shui sensed a immense flying beast flying over towards their direction!</p>
 <p>“They are coming.” Canghai bitterly laughed, as he stood up. Canghai Mingyue equipped the helmet, as she pulled Liu-Li along.</p>
 <p>“Let us go out.” Canghai lightly spoke, as they exited the residence. Other than Huoyun Liu-Li, the rest were all equipped in their full battle attire.</p>
 <p>An Instant later!</p>
 <p>“Canghai, hahaha!” A resounding voice without restraint drifted over!</p>
 <p>Shortly after, Qing Shui saw a flying demon beast of immense proportions!</p>
 <p>That gigantic body of the flying beast was even larger compared to the fire bird and golden-winged thunder hawk. It’s silver-colored frame was as tough as metal and it had a wingspan of over 100m. It’s thick and muscular leg in addition to its terrifyingly sharp claws caused people who saw it to feel terror in the depth of their hearts.</p>
 <p>The most imposing thing was the black-colored crown like mark on its head that resembled an eagle. Awe inspiring and incomparably mighty, emanating the aura of a monarch.</p>
 <p>Black Champion Monarch Falcon!</p>
 <p>There were two men mounted atop the black falcon, one of them was an old hunchback clad in white, with his silvery hair fluttering in the wind. His hands were also holding on to a golden-colored dragon head staff.</p>
 <p>Seeing the 2nd person on the falcon gave Qing Shui a bad shock, it was none other than the middle-aged man who went to look for him in his blacksmith store.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn’t sense the actual strength of the old blindee, after all the disparity within their powers was too great. However not only that, he also couldn’t accurately get a grasp of the actual strength level of the purple robed middle aged man.</p>
 <p>“Old blindee, get down here. Since you are already here, shouldn’t we have a reckoning?” Canghai’s nonchalant laughter rang out as he spoke, facing towards the air.</p>
 <p>The old blind guy held on to the purple robed middle aged man by the arm as they jumped from the air. With their speeds akin to a fired arrow, landing on the ground soundlessly.</p>
 <p>“Canghai, you blinded one of my eye 30 year ago, did it feel good to kill my wife and son back then?” The hunchback old blindee chortled.</p>
 <p>“Your son brought calamity upon himself while your wife suicided. But regardless of everything, since you are here, and purposely targeting me, I’ll take on all the debts.” Canghai laughed.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, targeting you, of course I’m targeting you. But first I will let you watch how your wife and daughter, and your son-in-law dies before letting you experience an agony that’s even worse than death.” The old blind guy laughed uproariously.</p>
 <p>Only now could Qing Shui clearly see the face of the old blindee, he was pretty average in looks, with a milky patch of whiteness in his right eye. His left eye glinted with a cruel. malevolent light that struck fear in the hearts of others.</p>
 <p>Just from that eye alone, Qing Shui could tell that the blind guy was an evil man reveling in bloody slaughters, and enjoyed the torment of others!</p>
 <p>“Picking on the young and women, are you not a man?” Canghai laughed again, his tone filled with disdain.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, there’s no need to infuriate me, it’s useless no matter what you say. When you killed my family, why didn’t you ask yourself the same thing? Nobody should be clearer than you regarding how many times have you killed the disciples from my Immortal Sword Sect in these past 30 years. The blind hunchback remarked coldly, as though he wanted to devour Canghai with his gaze alone.</p>
 <p>“Those that I killed, all deserved their death, why don’t you take a look at what your Immortal Sword Sect has become? I blame myself for the fact that I was softhearted, and that I didn’t wipe all of you out 30 years ago.”</p>
 <p>“Yup, what’s the use of regretting now? I’ll let you know what is true regret when you witness your family dying in my hands.” The old blind guy slowly straightened his back, as he stood upright, giving Qing Shui a strange feeling that it was as though that old man had grown younger by several years.</p>
 <p>“Me, Canghai, has never regretted the things I’ve done. Are you not afraid of the after-actions the Heavenly Palace will take against you?” Canghai coldly stated.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing the words of Canghai, the blind old man continued laughing, “Canghai, you are merely someone that got chased out of the Heavenly Palace, to think you still have the cheek to mention them. Not only that, do you think I made no preparations in these past 30 years? Since I dare to move against you, naturally I would have already factor in the actions of the Heavenly Palace in my calculations.”</p>
 <p>“You threw in your lot with the Sword Tower!” Canghai exclaimed in disbelief.</p>
 <p>“Smart. HAHAHA!”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qing Shui could sense many powerful auras emerging from all directions around Canghai’s residence.</p>
