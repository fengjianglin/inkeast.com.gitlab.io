 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">AST 2062 - Flower Demon, The Flower of Desire, Area Dominance</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Flower Demonic Beast wasn’t really huge, but it wasn’t that small either. It was about a hundred meters in length and its entire body was fiery red like magma. Though it might be giving out a fragrant smell, the smell was actually its aroma of poison. It was psychedelic and was capable of quietly making a person feel dizzy and causing numbness in their neurons. Once a warrior’s senses were numbed, the consequences would be hard to imagine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Flower Demonic Beast got its name from the Flower Demon. By now, Qing Shui could already see the woman that was riding on the back of the Flower Demonic Beast. It should be safe to consider her a woman. The first impression one would get upon seeing the woman would be that she was a flower. She was dressed entirely in flowers. Furthermore, they were all real flower images.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a long dress made of fresh flowers. It was tender and beautiful. Qing Shui then looked towards the Flower Demon’s face. She had the face of a mature and attractive woman. The first thing that one would feel when they saw that face was a flower that bloomed. She was so beautiful, lovely and charming, and her mature look resembled a honey peach that seemed like water was going to drip down from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had a pair of thin and slender eyes. Every time she blinked, she would look charming like water, giving out a fatally attractive charm. She had a stunningly seductive figure. Her kind of sexy wasn't emphasized on her size. In fact, the term ‘sexy’ didn’t just stand for having a pair of huge boobs. The real definition of ‘sexy’ was one’s body being in proportion to each other. Of course, if a person’s boobs were too tiny, they wouldn’t be qualified enough to be called sexy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her boobs were perky and upright, pushing forward the long dress of hers that were filled with flowers, forming a perfect curve on her body. She had a slender waist and her buttocks were so well-rounded that one would be shocked upon looking at it. It was a kind of extreme, a body figure that was sculpted so proportionally to its extreme, forming a true, sexy figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From Qing Shui’s perspective, Shen Huang looked even more perfect than the Flower Demon. Shen Huang was an exceptional Goddess who was matchless in her generations. Meanwhile, the Flower Demon right in front of him was just an ordinary, beautiful fairy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The red phoenix eyes of the Flower Demon was showing a faint, smiling intention. However, Qing Shui had no idea what was her purpose of smiling. She gave people the feeling that she was a magnanimous woman. There were women who were enchanting just like her, but compared to this Flower Demon, it was like she was the boss within a mafia organization and they were just some hooligans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nice to meet you. We have no interest in making enemies with you. Can we part ways from here peacefully?” Qing Shui asked the Flower Demon that was on the Flower Demonic Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, it has been such a long time since I last saw a human. It feels like forever since I last tasted the blood of a human. This brings back so many memories!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her laugh sounded clear and lovely. Her charm was indescribable. She also gave people a feeling that she was an unrestrained woman. Despite that, she was undeniably elegant. However, Qing Shui was still aware that she was a monster. Furthermore, she viewed humans as preys and enjoyed sucking their blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This reminded Qing Shui of the gorgeous Vampiric Empress. She was the emperor of the Vampiric Tribes, and Qing Shui had even had a daughter with her. Throughout her entire lifetime, he was the only person whose blood she consumed. In Qing Shui’s opinion, the Vampiric Empress was a pure and holy woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Flower Demon currently in front of him was different. The gorgeous body of hers was slowly becoming less and less appealing to Qing Shui. He knitted his brows and said, “It seems you don’t plan to let us go just like that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You think? Darling, since you have a handsome face, as long as you do as I say, I will let you have a taste of how heaven is like before you die. If you do well, for all you know, I may end up letting you stay beside me instead. Don’t you think that it also sounds quite good for us to live together?” The charming voice was indescribably attractive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a very gentle yet alluring voice, rendering people unable to muster up any strength across their body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui trembled while Shen Huang looked at him nervously. Even though she might not be affected by it, men should have fallen for her immediately as soon as they heard the voice and saw the Flower Demon's figure. There was a saying ‘one night of romance with a gorgeous girl, a happy death you deserve’. It was likely that a lot of men would have chosen to die voluntarily even if they only got to spend one night with the Flower Demon. This was the power of a woman’s charm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, Qing Shui didn’t want things to turn out this way. He had seen way too many beautiful women. Among the women which he knew, the majority of them looked even prettier than the Flower Demon. The only thing about the Flower Demon was that she tended to remind people of beds whenever they saw her. This was one of the most ancient motivations one could ever feel. Thus, it was normal for him to feel uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why don’t you go and play with her?” Shen Huang gave Qing Shui a confused look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, eldest mistress, what do you mean by ‘go and play with her’? Each of the beautiful women around me is at least a thousand times more beautiful than that demon in front of us.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang blushed. She remained silent, but deep down, there was a kind of emotion which words couldn’t describe. She was a woman and realized that she too, wanted someone to care about her, love her, spoil her and even compliment her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn’t know why she would start to behave like this all of a sudden. She had never once felt like that in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You unappreciative brat! Die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Flower Demonic Beast carried up a whirlwind as it stormed its way towards them. By now, the entire sky was already filled with flowers. These flowers were spinning at high speed. Waves after waves of sweet flower aroma were spreading across the area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t breathe!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui warned Shen Huang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s useless. The flower aroma could penetrate through every part of a person’s body. It would destroy your Spiritual Sense and slow down your reaction time, causing you to feel numbness across your entire body. Soon, you would start to hallucinate things and you will slowly be consumed by your own desire.” The Flower Demon’s charming voice came through. She then shot out a fresh flower in her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: rgb(231, 244, 254); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(231, 244, 254); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">桃花煞</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: rgb(231, 244, 254); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">！</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Peach Flower Termination!</span></p>

The Pernicious Aura on top of it had materialized, forming a solid green smoke around the bright Peach Flower. It was thin like a cicada wing and also sparkling and translucent. With a sharp killing intent on it, it spun towards Qing Shui’s neck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Area Dominance</span></p>

The current Area Dominance was totally on a different level from the one before. Its most formidable ability blessed Qing Shui with the resistance against poisons and it could help to clear one’s mind and spirit. In addition to that, it was even able to remove negative status effects, such as a decrease in speed or one’s overall strength, on the user as well as the people on his side. It was also capable of dispelling the opponent’s status increase. However, for the time being, it was only able to dispel up to 50% of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, it could also either raise the target’s speed and strength by 20% or decreased both of them by the same amount.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had never used the Area Dominance. The Mystic Snake Turtle had also been living inside the realm peacefully. Its presence was the sole reason why the realm was able to be expanded by more than two times. This was one of the abilities of the Mystic Snake Turtle.</span></p>

Even though he was only feeling a bit of discomfort, Shen Huang was already at her limit. Her eyes were half-closed, and there were a few times when she almost kissed Qing Shui. Eventually, she bit her own tongue, causing her lips to be dyed red by her blood.</span></p>

The effect was unusually great; a faint holy light appeared and purified the area fifty meters within it. By now, not even the slightest fragrance could be smelled in the air.</span></p>

Similarly, Qing Shui was also looking at Shen Huang. Under the light of Area Dominance, Shen Huang was like a Goddess under the nine heavens. She looked beautiful and very distant. Even though she was within arm’s reach and was holding his hand, Qing Shui felt that he was unable to grab her, but could only look at her from far away.</span></p>

Shen Huang was right in front of her, but yet she still seemed so unpredictable. She then smiled and said, “It’s fine. It has been a long time since I last used this technique. Who would have thought that it would still have some uses? Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to imagine what could happen.”</span></p>

To think that you can actually withstand my Flowers of Desire.” The Flower Demon seemed surprised.&nbsp;</span></p>
