 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2403 - Divine Eye Stone, Divine Battle Puppet's Left Eye</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Qing Shui received this warm stone, he was stunned. He immediately knew what it was for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Divine Eye Stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Effect: Can be used to patch up some mysterious things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just that simple. Qing Shui thought of his own Divine Battle Puppet immediately. The Divine Battle Puppet was damaged. Although it could be used, it couldn't unleash all of its powers. Whether it could even unleash 10% of its actual prowess was something that even he wasn't sure of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, Qing Shui had considered how he could fix this Divine Battle Puppet, but he wasn't able to think of a way. There were Trap Masters in the Nine Continents but he hadn't come into contact with one that had extraordinary skills. He had thought that he would be forced to go and try his luck to look for a Trap Master in the Upper Three Regions in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He hadn't expected to come across this thing now. It made Qing Shui extremely happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Madam, this thing can fix some special things. I need it." Qing Shui didn't hide this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old woman smiled, "I'm very happy that you like it. This is good. I've always been using this to warm up my hands. In the winter when its cold, we warmed up from it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Madam, can I go to your house to take a look?" Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old woman was stunned for a moment before she nodded. "Alright, it isn't far, but it’s too rundown."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui smiled. He told the others to stay here and wait for him while the little boy followed them to the old woman's house.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although it was called their house, it was more like a sturdy large tent. The things in the house was very simple. It wasn't very messy. Since there weren't many things, it was hard for it to become messy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Madam, take this medicinal pill. It can increase your strength and let you not feel that cold in the winter." Qing Shui brought out a Xiantian Golden Pellet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old woman looked at Qing Shui, feeling a little perplexed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Madam, don't worry. I don't harbor any ill intent. How are you going to warm up your hands in the winter when you've given me that stone?" Qing Shui would never be selfish towards people who had helped him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old woman smiled, "I wouldn't believe you even if you were to tell me that you harbor ill intent towards me. I have nothing to my name."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old woman ate the Xiantian Golden Pellet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a round of impurities cleansing, the old woman seemed as if she had become ten years younger. More importantly, it felt as if she had endless energy. After reaching Xiantian, the old woman was also able to recognize some simple martial techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old woman knew that she had met a great master and wanted to kowtow to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, it wasn't that she wanted to become his disciple, but just that she wanted to offer her thanks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui quickly held her up and didn't let her drop to her knees. He smiled and said, "You mustn't. You'll shorten my lifespan if you do this."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Mister, I had no idea this medicinal pill was so precious. If I knew, I would have given it to my grandson," The old woman said regretfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Madam, you don't have to worry about this. Your grandson is still young. I'll be here for a while and will teach him some stuff. I'll be purchasing a manor later and the two of you can come over. It'll be easier for me to teach him." Qing Shui looked at the thin and frail boy. His aptitude was mediocre. Qing Shui didn't wish to change his life but only hoped that he could have some improvements to his current life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Thank you, thank you. Xuan`er, quickly kowtow to Mister." the old woman thanked Qing Shui before turning to say to the little boy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The little boy immediately knelt down, "Thank you Master!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We don't have the affinity to become master and disciple. How much you can learn during this period of time will depend on your own fate. If you wish to change your life, then you'll have to learn what I teach you seriously." Qing Shui smiled and patted the little boy on the head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Thank you Master. I know that I don't have the right to become your disciple, but in my heart, you're my Master," The little boy said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright, get up. I'll give you something that can change your life!" Qing Shui could tell that this little boy was very smart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He pressed down his hand on the boy's Baihui acupoint at the top of his head and proceeded with an entry level Strength Infusion. Some things were channeled into the boy's mind, including Taichi, Tiger Form, Ghostly Steps, Basic Sword Techniques, and other things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These things were the basics. Strength Infusion was like an experience, leaving a print into the other party's mind. It would be as if the person had practiced these things many times. It was definitely something that could change one's life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The requirements for Strength Infusion were very high and it had a tremendous depletion for the person performing it. Most people would infuse only the most basic things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You must work hard to cultivate these," Qing Shui removed his hand and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I will."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui then returned to the previous place together with the old woman and the little boy. The group found a manor in the vicinity. With sufficient money and conditions, anything could be purchased. Of course, the money concerned wasn't gold or silver, but everything. For example, it could be medicinal pills, or helping one to extend their lifespan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At night, Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He didn't cultivate but started to fiddle with that Divine Eye Stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui walked up to the Divine Battle Puppet and looked at the Divine Eye Stone in his hand. He then placed it into the Divine Battle Puppet's left eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A red glow flashed. What surprised Qing Shui was that after the Divine Eye Stone flashed with that hint of glow, it merged into the Divine Battle Puppet's left eye. He then realized that the Divine Battle Puppet's left eye had changed, as if the Divine Eye Stone had been embedded there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui then looked at the Divine Battle Puppet's right eye. Earlier on, there had been an eye there as well, but after the Divine Eye Stone was embedded in, he discovered that the current eye was very powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui had no idea why this would happen. He couldn't help but look at it with his Heavenly Vision Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Divine Battle Puppet!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Divine grade battle puppet. Damaged, can be fixed. Currently can reach a strength of ten trillion dao force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Requires owner recognition. Controlled by consciousness!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Method for owner recognition: Obtain ten drops of blood essence and insert them onto the Tiantu Acupoint, Shanzhong Acupoint, Lingtai Acupoint, Shenfu Acupoint...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Earlier on, the Divine Battle Puppet's strength was at six trillion dao force, but now, with a single Divine Eye Stone, its strength had reached ten trillion dao force directly. The Divine Battle Puppet wouldn't be affected by the Spirit Gathering Lamp and the Heaven Shaking Drum, but could receive support from formations and the Battle God Halo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[1 '0' makes a whole world of difference. This 100,000万万 has one zero more than what was mentioned earlier.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, in the Forsaken Heaven Region, its current strength had reached the peak of what one could reach in this area. Therefore, any other reinforcements were useless. However, if it was weakened, then the reinforcing effects could be applied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Qing Shui was also stunned. The Divine Battle Puppet had surpassed him by a lot now. If they weren't in the Forsaken Heaven Region, with his help, it could reach a strength of 20 trillion dao force. How terrifying was this...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Divine Eye Stone... Qing Shui looked at the other eye and then at the other parts of the Divine Battle Puppet. He had no idea what else was required to fully fix the Divine Battle Puppet. By then, how terrifying would it become?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It took just a hint of Qing Shui's consciousness to control the Divine Battle Puppet. It was like Qing Shui's hand, being a part of him and thus he wouldn't be distracted from controlling it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Qing Shui's strength was quite good. Therefore, he sparred with the Divine Battle Puppet in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. This sparring took Qing Shui by surprise. Putting aside how terrifyingly strong the Divine Battle Puppet was, it was also unafraid of poison, had a body that was tough as diamonds, and had endless violent strength. It was like an undying cockroach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A battle robot. This was the orientation Qing Shui gave to the Divine Battle Puppet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment it appeared, it could wipe out the entire Forsaken Heaven City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Qing Shui came out the next day, the old woman had already gone up to set up her stall. However, the little boy stood outside Qing Shui's door. When he saw Qing Shui, he said respectfully, "Master!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui smiled and patted his head. This boy was about eight or nine years old. After washing up and having changed into new clothes, he was considered quite a nice-looking kid with a pair of intelligent-looking eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Come along. We'll go and practice fist arts." Qing Shui led the way and headed to the spacious courtyard.</span></p>
