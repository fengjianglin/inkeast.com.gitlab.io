  <p><strong>AST 274 - Diamond Pellet, Jadedew Pellet, Goddess Peak? Flowerfruit Mountain.</strong></p>
  <p><span style>“Treasure Map!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was thunderstruck when he saw the words. There was actually such a thing!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui put the map away quickly, knowing that he shouldn’t stay too long in this place.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Let’s go!” Qing Shui soundlessly fired a needle at the balless guy, it was a critical strike!</span></p>
  <p><span style>After randomly buying some food, he summoned the fire bird and Golden Winged Condor as they left. Even after they were in the air, Qing Shui was still extremely excited. A true blue treasure map! If he found the location indicated in the map, he would surely strike it rich!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui, what is that?” Huoyun Liu-Li couldn’t bear it anymore as she asked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Everyone, come and take a look at the location indicated in this map.” Qing Shui chortled, as he retrieved the embroidered case. After opening it, two small porcelain bottle could be seen.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Since there was some time now, Qing Shui took one of the bottles out. The porcelain bottle was pure white, it was about two inch tall, and one inch thick.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Turning the bottle about, inspecting it from all angles he finally saw three golden miniscule words at the bottom of the porcelain bottle. “Diamond Pellet!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do you know what kind of medicine the Diamond Pellet is?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui realised that the two ladies didn’t even deign to reply to him at all. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“At least you guys can tell me you don’t know…” Qing Shui depressedly gazed at the two ladies, but there was still no reaction from them.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After opening the bottle, he saw there was about ten bean-size pellets, surrounded by an yellowish-orange hue that emitted a clear fragrance.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The smell is pretty good, and it shouldn’t be poisonous. Shall I taste one to test its effect?” Qing Shui mumbled to himself, and after which, he prepared to flick one pellets into his mouth.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are not allowed to eat that!” Huoyun Liu-Li and Canghai Mingyue cried out simultaneously.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui dumbly stared at the two ladies. After that outburst, they faded into silence. What was going on… ?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Under Qing Shui’s gaze, Canghai Mingyue averted her eyes, moving slightly in a fluster as her countenance turn bright red. That charming appearance of her almost caused Qing Shui to salivate, while Huoyun Liu-Li who was currently veiled, stared at him with misty eyes of water.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Why? According to the color and smell of the pellet, this shouldn’t be poisonous?” Qing Shui asked in puzzlement.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If you eat that, you need to think of a way to save yourself, I’m going to strangle you… ” Huoyun lowered her head as she mumbled incoherently. </span></p>
  <p><span style>If Canghai Mingyue wasn’t there, Qing Shui didn’t mind engaging in public s*x right now. The eyes of Huoyun Liu-Li were too mesmerising.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What’s wrong with the pellet? Qing Shui asked again, he prepared to keep it for his analyical alchemy experiments. If the pellets had inferior effects, he would chuck them away, but since they were placed together with the treasure map, their effects shouldn’t be too bad by right..</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What do you mean what’s wrong?” Huoyun Liu-Li ventured forth with a low-sounding voice, while Canghai Mingyue fixedly stared at some place in the distance.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What are the effects and value of this pellet?” Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ah! This pellet can be sold for quite a high price. The effects… it's said that it was very good to… ” Huoyun Liu-Li reddened, as she unconsciously glanced at the tool of Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What?? F*** his grandma, why is it that kind of medicine? ‘Diamond Pellet’, even if I don’t eat the diamond pellet, my thingy is already even more diamond than diamond! To think that old fellow’s tool couldn’t erect anymore… !” Qing Shui snickered.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After which, he lifted the second porcelain bottle. And because of the words “Diamond” earlier, the two ladies unconsciously took two steps backwards!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui directly looked at the bottom of the bottle, he thought that this bottle may be filled with Diamond Pellets as well.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Eh, Jadedew Pellets!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What?!” Qing Shui stared at the two ladies. The Golden Wind passes by, meeting the Jade Dewdrops. F***, it’s a King Kong(raws for KingKong and Diamond(Vajra) are the same)</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That great pervert only knows how to prepare such despicable stuff.” Huoyun Liu-Li stared blankly at Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui took the chance to glance at the impressive soft mounds of flesh on her blossom, further accentuated by her tight clothings. </span></p>
  <p><span style>The three of them were hanging out, but doing nothing. 3P? Qing Shui didn’t even dare to think about it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The Jadedew Pellets are able to turn the most strongwill, cold-blooded, passive woman into a sex kitten…” Huoyun Liu-Li averted her gaze as she explained the effects to Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui momentarily didn’t know what to reply with, that old fellow actually had such stuff in his possession… </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Perfect preparation, to be able to transform a virgin into a sl*t… heh heh” Qing Shui chortled before putting the bottles away.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui… ”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“En!” Qing Shui heard the strange tone of Huoyun Liu-Li as she called out to him, and he couldn’t help but turn his head to gaze at her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Are you planning to let sister Mingyue to eat a Jadedew Pellet?:</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui, “... ”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue blushed as she quickly retorted, “Damn lass, what are you saying? You must be influenced by some bad people.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui hurriedly took out the map as he shifted the topic away from dangerous waters, “Come, quickly let’s take a look at this map!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Are you a liar?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ai, Sister, quickly come and take a look, this is a true treasure map!” Huoyun Liu-Li beckoned Canghai Mingyue over.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui glanced at the map. There was a mountain indicated that had its ridges curved in a sinuous line, covered with vegetation with rivers flowing about.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do you know what place this is?” Qing Shui casually asked. After all, this world of the nine continents was too vast, and there were many similar places everywhere. The location the treasure map indicated was too small, appearing to be some sort of mountain range, it was too difficult to find it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui studied the treasure map with great detail. There was a unique looking precipice in the shape of a woman, while behind the ‘woman’, there was a blurry shadow of a great tree.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Is this the rumoured Goddess Peak?!” Canghai Mingyue exclaimed in wonder.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Goddess Peak?” Qing Shui immediately thought of the twin peaks of Canghai Mingyue, there could also be referred to as the Goddess Peak as well… After that, he turned his gaze to the gigantic stone precipice that was the shape of a woman.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“En, you see the legends of the stone precipice and the goddess peak was the same. But what a pity, no one knew that Goddess Peak was situated here.” Canghai Ming Yue sighed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Is it only famous here? Or throughout the world of the nine continents?” Qing Shui turned his head to stare at Canghai Mingyue and because the three of them were standing somewhat close to each other, he purposely enlarged his nostrils to sniff her fragrance.</span></p>
  <p><span style>There was now only two inches between the eyes of Canghai Mingyue and Qing Shui. Gazing into her beautiful eyes filled with depth, Qing Shui always felt that if he stared at them long enough, his soul would be drawn in.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue blinked, as she averted her gaze before replying, “It should only be a popular legend in the Southern City.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After hearing that, Qing Shui rubbed his nose and laughed, “Mingyue, do you know the actual reason why the Goddess Peak is so famous?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“There was a legend saying that a celestial beauty stood there every day, waiting for her beloved husband to come back. She would stand in that position, gazing far off in the horizons before transforming into stone… ”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“But what’s her husband doing?” Qing Shui felt as though he was onto something, yet he was still unable to grasp it exactly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Legends says that her husband was the ultimate hunter, one of the sovereign-level hunters.” Canghai Mingyue didn’t know why Qing Shui was asking that, but she still answered Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sovereign-level hunter?” Qing Shui murmured, before he lowered his head to study the treasure map. He felt that this treasure map was at least tens of years if not hundreds of years old, which also meant that the terrain outlined may not be as accurate. Maybe, the Goddess Peak didn’t even exist then.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Suddenly, Qing Shui took note of the tree shadow behind the woman-shaped precipice. The tree was slanted backwards, towards the west, which indicated that the clue was in the direction of the setting sun.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“En, the woman faced the west, her husband must be hunting in the western direction, she will wait like this daily for her husband to come back and he shouldn’t be too far away from here.” Qing Shui mused.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ah, I know where her husband hunts at!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Where?” Qing Shui asked joyfully.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Flowerfruit Mountains! [1]”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue’s almost made Qing Shui faint. After confirming three times that it was the Flowerfruit Mountains, he questioned Canghai Mingyue excessively and learnt that the Flowerfruit Mountains was a place where many miraculous herbs and flowers was birthed. Over there, there were many mystical fruits and the demonic beasts that were many times stronger than their peers. Not only that, the beasts are all extremely intelligent and it was precisely because of that, that the Flowerfruit Mountains were classified as one of the most dangerous places in the Greencloud Continent!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The Goddess Peak is in the Flowerfruit Mountains.” Qing Shui rubbed his nose as he bitterly exclaimed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>[1] Flowerfruit Mountains: The place where the Sun Wukong, the Monkey King (Great Sage Equals to Heaven) used to resides in before he wrecked havoc in the celestial court.</span></p>

 <p><span style>“That great pervert only knows how to prepare such despicable stuff.” Huoyun Liu-Li stared blankly at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui took the chance to glance at the impressive soft mounds of flesh on her blossom, further accentuated by her tight clothings. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The three of them were hanging out, but doing nothing. 3P? Qing Shui didn’t even dare to think about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Jadedew Pellets are able to turn the most strongwill, cold-blooded, passive woman into a sex kitten…” Huoyun Liu-Li averted her gaze as she explained the effects to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui momentarily didn’t know what to reply with, that old fellow actually had such stuff in his possession… </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Perfect preparation, to be able to transform a virgin into a sl*t… heh heh” Qing Shui chortled before putting the bottles away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Shui… ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“En!” Qing Shui heard the strange tone of Huoyun Liu-Li as she called out to him, and he couldn’t help but turn his head to gaze at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you planning to let sister Mingyue to eat a Jadedew Pellet?:</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui, “... ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue blushed as she quickly retorted, “Damn lass, what are you saying? You must be influenced by some bad people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui hurriedly took out the map as he shifted the topic away from dangerous waters, “Come, quickly let’s take a look at this map!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you a liar?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai, Sister, quickly come and take a look, this is a true treasure map!” Huoyun Liu-Li beckoned Canghai Mingyue over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui glanced at the map. There was a mountain indicated that had its ridges curved in a sinuous line, covered with vegetation with rivers flowing about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know what place this is?” Qing Shui casually asked. After all, this world of the nine continents was too vast, and there were many similar places everywhere. The location the treasure map indicated was too small, appearing to be some sort of mountain range, it was too difficult to find it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui studied the treasure map with great detail. There was a unique looking precipice in the shape of a woman, while behind the ‘woman’, there was a blurry shadow of a great tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this the rumoured Goddess Peak?!” Canghai Mingyue exclaimed in wonder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Goddess Peak?” Qing Shui immediately thought of the twin peaks of Canghai Mingyue, there could also be referred to as the Goddess Peak as well… After that, he turned his gaze to the gigantic stone precipice that was the shape of a woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“En, you see the legends of the stone precipice and the goddess peak was the same. But what a pity, no one knew that Goddess Peak was situated here.” Canghai Ming Yue sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it only famous here? Or throughout the world of the nine continents?” Qing Shui turned his head to stare at Canghai Mingyue and because the three of them were standing somewhat close to each other, he purposely enlarged his nostrils to sniff her fragrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was now only two inches between the eyes of Canghai Mingyue and Qing Shui. Gazing into her beautiful eyes filled with depth, Qing Shui always felt that if he stared at them long enough, his soul would be drawn in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue blinked, as she averted her gaze before replying, “It should only be a popular legend in the Southern City.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After hearing that, Qing Shui rubbed his nose and laughed, “Mingyue, do you know the actual reason why the Goddess Peak is so famous?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There was a legend saying that a celestial beauty stood there every day, waiting for her beloved husband to come back. She would stand in that position, gazing far off in the horizons before transforming into stone… ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But what’s her husband doing?” Qing Shui felt as though he was onto something, yet he was still unable to grasp it exactly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Legends says that her husband was the ultimate hunter, one of the sovereign-level hunters.” Canghai Mingyue didn’t know why Qing Shui was asking that, but she still answered Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sovereign-level hunter?” Qing Shui murmured, before he lowered his head to study the treasure map. He felt that this treasure map was at least tens of years if not hundreds of years old, which also meant that the terrain outlined may not be as accurate. Maybe, the Goddess Peak didn’t even exist then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Qing Shui took note of the tree shadow behind the woman-shaped precipice. The tree was slanted backwards, towards the west, which indicated that the clue was in the direction of the setting sun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“En, the woman faced the west, her husband must be hunting in the western direction, she will wait like this daily for her husband to come back and he shouldn’t be too far away from here.” Qing Shui mused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, I know where her husband hunts at!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where?” Qing Shui asked joyfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Flowerfruit Mountains! [1]”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue’s almost made Qing Shui faint. After confirming three times that it was the Flowerfruit Mountains, he questioned Canghai Mingyue excessively and learnt that the Flowerfruit Mountains was a place where many miraculous herbs and flowers was birthed. Over there, there were many mystical fruits and the demonic beasts that were many times stronger than their peers. Not only that, the beasts are all extremely intelligent and it was precisely because of that, that the Flowerfruit Mountains were classified as one of the most dangerous places in the Greencloud Continent!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Goddess Peak is in the Flowerfruit Mountains.” Qing Shui rubbed his nose as he bitterly exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[1] Flowerfruit Mountains: The place where the Sun Wukong, the Monkey King (Great Sage Equals to Heaven) used to resides in before he wrecked havoc in the celestial court.</span></p>
