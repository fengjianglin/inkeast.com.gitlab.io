 <p><strong>AST 1049 - He Who Is Pure, Tame</strong></p>
 <p>Roc's Might!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sent over an oppressing pressure. This would increase the pressure on the Crystal Guard which would then allow him to deal with this Six-Headed Crystal Beast. He had the confidence to deal with it since he still had a trick up his sleeves.</p>
 <p>Primarily, he wanted to tame this demonic beast. It would be good even if Luan Luan was the one to tame it since it would be a waste to kill it.</p>
 <p>It was time to give it a push!</p>
 <p>Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation!</p>
 <p>Golden light flashed across Qing Shui's body and a huge but faint image of a golden colored beast appeared on Qing Shui -- encompassing him.</p>
 <p>Great Earth Golden Beast Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation</p>
 <p>Although it was still in the adolescent stage, it increased his strength and spiritual energy by one fold. There wasn't much left due to the impact of the world's regulations, but it wasn't bad either. Qing Shui was most satisfied with the additional one fold of spiritual energy.</p>
 <p>This was something which wouldn't be restricted by the world's rules and was a full increment of one fold to his spiritual energy. This made Qing Shui's attack much stronger and the Crystal Guard tremored furiously. The Primordial Flame Dragon Drill was also gradually pushing in toward the Six-Headed Crystal Beast.</p>
 <p>Wuwu!</p>
 <p>Two of the smaller heads shot out a gush of mist toward the Crystal Guard, causing the trembling Crystal Guard to stabilize. The main head, on the other hand, shot out over ten azure blue colored ice bolts.</p>
 <p>The ice bolts were only the size of a fist and they shot out in a straight line toward Qing Shui. The azure blue ice bolts looked very beautiful and Qing Shui could sense its chill from afar. It was made of ice flames of an extreme yin nature.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps, Great Reversal!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately disappeared from his original position but his spiritual energy battle against the Six-Headed Crystal Beast didn't stop. This was the powerful aspect of the Nine Palace Steps' Great Reversal -- to be able to forcibly exchange positions with the opponent.</p>
 <p>Therefore, the ice bolts which were flying toward Qing Shui were now flying toward the Six-Headed Crystal Beast. In that moment, Qing Shui could see confusion and worry in its eyes.</p>
 <p>Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>In that instant, Qing Shui used his Emperor's Qi as well. That was his powerful trick.</p>
 <p>Boom boom boom...</p>
 <p>It was also painful to hit oneself. Moreover, things had happened very suddenly, causing the Six-Headed Crystal Beast to be unable to react in time. It all happened too quickly.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Pfft!</p>
 <p>The Crystal Guard broke. The earlier attack was the Six-Headed Crystal Beast's powerful attack and was carried out by the main head. Moreover, Qing Shui's Primordial Fire Snake was constantly corroding the Crystal Guard and Qing Shui had also suddenly used Emperor's Qi. With this combination, the Six-Headed Crystal Beast's Crystal Guard was completely crushed.</p>
 <p>The Primordial Flame Whip lashed the Six-Headed Crystal Beast, creating a crisp sound. The Six-Headed Crystal Beast let out a low howl, and spewed out clouds to block Qing Shui's attacks.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's Primordial Flame Whip lashed the Six-Headed Crystal Beast's body but it seemed that the damage inflicted wasn't much. It only left behind a mark on the crystal-like body. This showed how resistant the Six-Headed Crystal Beast was against attacks.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and the Six-Headed Crystal Beast were separated by an azure blue ice barrier. However, before he could break the barrier, he sensed a dangerous aura.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps, One Step to Heaven!</p>
 <p>The Nine Palace Steps was extremely complex and it comprised of countless steps!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui disappeared from an unbelievable angle and after he disappeared, he saw that the spot from which he had just vanished was being clawed by the Six-Headed Crystal Beast. His afterimage was still there.</p>
 <p>The claw had flaming azure blue colored clouds on it, and the moment it attacked, the flaming clouds became a flaming drill which held a terrifying destructive prowess.</p>
 <p>This time around, Qing Shui had managed to dodge it thanks to the Nine Palace Steps. If one were to think that the Six-Headed Crystal Beast was only powerful in terms of its spiritual energy, then he'd be in big trouble. This demonic beast was extremely fast and if Qing Shui didn't have his Nine Palace Steps to dodge that move from earlier, his head would have been crushed. It was a fatal blow and its huge claws were much bigger than Qing Shui himself.</p>
 <p>This speed was simply terrifying. Qing Shui's Nine Palace Steps had only leveled up not long ago and his speed had also increased by one fold. However, if he didn't have the Nine Palace Steps, there was no way for him to be able to dodge this attack. In the Nine Palace, he was the sovereign; in the Nine Palace, his speed was unrivalled. In a sense, it would make others seem slower or he would be seen as stronger.</p>
 <p>Great Golden Buddha Palm!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui waved his hand and performed the first wave of the Great Golden Buddha Palm on the Six-Headed Crystal Beast!</p>
 <p>Wuwu!</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>The Six-Headed Crystal Beast didn't think much of the attack and slapped Qing Shui's golden palm away!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't panic. Right now, the Six-Headed Crystal Beast was already in his grasp. When he progressively performed the fifth wave of the Great Golden Buddha Palm, he managed to confine it.</p>
 <p>Right now, he had used the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation to increase his spiritual energy attacks by one fold. Moreover, the Six-Headed Crystal Beast had also been weakened by Qing Shui's Emperor's Qi.</p>
 <p>The huge golden palm firmly held down the Six-Headed Crystal Beast and Qing Shui readied his Primordial Flame Whip.</p>
 <p>"Alright, now we can talk. Are you going to submit or continue to fight?" Qing Shui was very relaxed now.</p>
 <p>"Bastard, I'll never submit to anyone! Kill me!" a metallic female voice rang out. It wasn't melodious, but was still an interesting sound.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui lashed his Primordial Flame Whip upon the Six-Headed Crystal Beast!</p>
 <p>A clear mark appeared on it!</p>
 <p>"Submit to me. I can let you become even more powerful. If you follow me, you will definitely not regret it," Qing Shui tried to persuade it.</p>
 <p>"Dream on! You're not a pure person. I'll never submit to you."</p>
 <p>"What the... I'm not a pure person..." Qing Shui had a strange feeling and even put down his Primordial Flame Whip.</p>
 <p>"I promise that I'm a pure person. Submit to me!" Qing Shui said shamelessly.</p>
 <p>The Six-Headed Crystal Beast refused to look at Qing Shui anymore. Qing Shui was torn. It was a great pity to kill it, but he wasn't able to get it to stay with him willingly.</p>
 <p>"If you were to encounter a pure person, would you submit?" Qing Shui communicated with it through his consciousness.</p>
 <p>"I said that even if I were to submit, I'll only submit to someone pure. However, not every pure person will be able to get me to submit to them," said the Six-Headed Crystal Beast furiously.</p>
 <p>With no other option, Qing Shui called out for the others to come over. Qing Shui knew that Luan Luan had the Heart of Seven Orifices and he wanted to see if she was able to tame her.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't let the others get close even though the huge golden palm was still firmly securing the Six-Headed Crystal Beast.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan made a few sounds and Qing Shui saw a hint of a glow in the Six-Headed Crystal Beast's eyes, which relaxed him slightly. If Luan Luan could tame it, it would be of great benefit to them.</p>
 <p>In the end, Luan Luan opened her eyes in surprised and looked at Qing Shui, "Father, she refuses to follow me. She says that I'm a devil..."</p>
 <p>The Primordial Flame Whip once again formed in Qing Shui's hand and he lashed it down hard. Since even Luan Luan wasn't able to tame it, then he could only lash it to death.</p>
 <p>"Alright, lass, you can go tame those over there. There shouldn't be any problems and they are considered quite strong too," said Qing Shui as he pointed to the three Five-Headed Windfire Wolves.</p>
 <p>As expected, it didn't take Luan Luan long to tame the three Five-Headed Windfire Wolves. The Heart of Seven Orifices was very powerful. Cases such as the one with the Six-Headed Crystal Beast were a surprise. It had a powerful spiritual energy and intelligence, hence, it was most difficult for one to be able to tame a mutated demonic beast king like this. It required a chanced encounter.</p>
 <p>Pa pa pa...</p>
 <p>The Six-Headed Crystal Beast let out terrible cries; bloody trenches had formed on its body from Qing Shui's whipping. Even if it had a strong physique, it wasn't able to withstand such attacks.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, it wasn't easy for this Six-Headed Crystal Beast to grow to what it is today. Only one in every one billion WindFire Wolf is able to reach this level of achievement. It's very pitiful as well. Let it go this one time!"</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange thought of her own background. It might be because the Six-Headed Crystal Beast was very beautiful and its big crystal-like eyes had a lonely, persistent, and stubborn feel to them that she felt pity for it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned and looked at this fairy-like lady. In his heart, he had always felt that she was the purest. He stopped. "Jiange, why don't you try taming it? It's a pity to let it go. Don't you want to try taming it?"</p>
 <p>"Of course I'd like to, but this is something that cannot be forced. Let it go this once. It is a ruler and the chances of it being tamed are just too low." Yiye Jiange shook her head. After all, she came from a beast tamer clan and knew that the odds of being able to tame it were almost zero. Even Luan Luan had failed, so she really wasn’t holding out any hope. Even if a demonic beast like this was tamed, it would be like a friend. The level of taming and submission would be the lowest.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could refuse to listen to many people, but not her. Yiye Jiange held a very important place in his heart. He loved her from the bottom of his heart, and wanted to make her happy. Otherwise, he wouldn't have made the decision to head to the Lion King's Ridge a long time ago. Back then, it was still wishful thinking on his part.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui removed the Great Golden Buddha Palm and said: "Leave. If not for the fact that my woman has taken pity on you, I would have most certainly taken your hide. It'll definitely be good for making clothes."</p>
 <p>He continued to leave his guard on the highest level in case there were any accidents. Right now, he was still using the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation and other skills. Di Qing and the others were very astonished as well, but not overly so. They were already used to the various things that happened to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange didn't say anything after hearing Qing Shui's words but merely threw him an annoyed glance. The gaze from this fairy-like lady almost crushed Qing Shui's soul.</p>
 <p>Wuwu!</p>
 <p>Hearing Qing Shui's words, the Six-Headed Crystal Beast seemed to be letting out a cry of objection toward him. Its blood had already dried up. Its terrifying recovery abilities were really astonishing.</p>
 <p>Wuwu!</p>
 <p>The Six-Headed Crystal Beast let out a low howl toward Yiye Jiange. Yiye Jiange stood there and looked at it in a daze before looking at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Jiange, what's wrong? Is it threatening you? If so, I'll go skin it." Qing Shui put on an act as if he was going to go ahead with his threat.</p>
 <p>Wuwu!</p>
 <p>The Six-Headed Crystal Beast let out a furious cry.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange held Qing Shui back speechlessly. "It said that it wants to follow me and it'll continue to do so as long as I'm alive, unless I don't want it, then it'll leave."</p>
 <p>"Haha, Jiange is the purest person. Alright, you can keep it. Shall I also follow you as long as I'm alive?" Qing Shui laughed.</p>
 <p>"Rascal, are you asking for a beating?" Yiye Jiange blushed and gave Qing Shui a punch before she walked over to the Six-Headed Crystal Beast.</p>
 <p>This made Qing Shui a little worried, but he knew that there was nothing to be worried about. It was because demonic beasts were not scheming creatures and they tended to keep their word. The more powerful the demonic beast, the more this applied.</p>
 <p>The Six-Headed Crystal Beast lowered its head slowly and when Yiye Jiange's hand landed on the biggest head, Qing Shui was at ease. If it hadn't agreed to submit, it would definitely not allow a human touch its main head.</p>
