  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 448 Breakthrough for the Diamond Demonic Boar, The Prowess of the Mighty Elephant Stomp </strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui let the Diamond Demonic Boar charge towards Tan Yang in tandem with himself. But how could Tan Yang allow Qing Shui to get near him? He shot out an arrow to stop Qing Shui while he let one of the "Iron Spine Falcon" dive towards the Diamond Demonic Boar.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Screech!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Demonic Boar's speed could not rival that of a flying demonic beast’s. It was scratched by one of the claws of the Iron Spine Falcon, and a piercing sound that was like tearing metal rang out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Roar Roar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A deep roar escaped from the Diamond Demonic Boar's mouth. Qing Shui saw that scratches had appeared on the Diamond Demonic Boar's back, and light yellow-colored blood immediately dyed its whole body.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"These Iron Spine Falcons are truly powerful. Such small-sized flying beasts are not only fast, their sharp claws and beaks can also tear apart metal and jade. To think that it could even inflict scratches on the Diamond Demonic Boar despite its monstrous defence."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was pained, but there was nothing he could do now. Tan Yang's arrow was locked on to him, and they were all in a precarious situation in that moment.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not wish to take any risks at the moment. It was because he felt that that archery technique was different from the Cloud Piercing Arrow from earlier, and it was likely even more vicious. Qing Shui did not wish to try out that arrow, which had strong spiritual energy and was flickering with a black glow.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Firebird and the two Iron Spine Falcons were locked in a fierce battle with neither side gaining advantage over the other. Even the Firebird could not do anything after being tangled up by such small-scaled demonic beasts in a restricted area. If they were further apart, it might have a better advantage, but it had none of that at all now. Moreover, those two Iron Spine Falcon were not of a lower level that the Firebird.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Firebird was also just an elementary Martial King level demonic beast.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everyone's gaze gradually turned towards the Diamond Demonic Boar, which had been scratched with wounds all over and was shrieking in agony.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If anything were to happen to that Diamond Demonic Boar, then Qing Shui would really be in danger. When that time comes, the Iron Spine Falcon would come to interfere with Qing Shui, and Tan Yang's fatal arrow would shoot out at Qing Shui without any hesitation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could imagine that there was no way he would be capable of dodging the arrow in such close quarters. In the face of such a powerful arrow, this distance could be covered in just the blink of an eye, or even less.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If he was not disturbed, Qing Shui, who had a strong Spiritual Sense, would be able to use his Big Dipper Sword to block the arrow and reduce most of the damages.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Roar roar!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ning ning!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was in a panic, but there was nothing he could do to help. He was even grabbing onto a rock and wanted to throw it at that Iron Spine Falcon.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Wu wu!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's brows were tightly furrowed together. He planned to shoot down that Iron Spine Falcon even if he had to forcefully hold up against one of Tan Yang’s arrows with his powerful defences.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But just then!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Roar!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A loud, piercing bellow rang out!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Demonic Boar emitted a strong golden light all over!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It broke through...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tan Yang's face turned pale, and his arrow suddenly shot out towards Qing Shui!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Clank!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui blocked it with his Big Dipper Sword but was pushed backwards as a result. The strong impact caused Qing Shui to feel that his organs were turning topsy turvy, and blood trickled down from the corner of his lips.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was too fast and too fierce! To think that even with his strong defences, and with the Divine Arm Clearing at the large success stage, after blocking with his Big Dipper Sword, he had still suffered from injuries of such an extent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui flew out for over ten meters before landing on the arena and then slided towards the back.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">And at that moment, the Diamond Demonic Boar grew to the size of a calf from its original one-meter long body. It looked very powerful and domineering, and had a nose which was about half a foot long.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It let out another cry which pierced through the clouds, stomping down on the ground, and then pounced on the Iron Spine Falcon which had yet to take flight. With a shrill screech filling the air, the Diamond Demonic Boar attacked with its mouth and feet, as if it was unleashing the pent-up grievances from earlier. In just a short amount of time, the Iron Spine Falcon became a pile of torn up bird flesh.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Astonished. Everyone was astonished. To think that the Diamond Demonic Boar, which was struggling under the Iron Spine Falcon's claws earlier, had managed to tear it apart completely in mere moments.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">What level was it at to be able to have such strong teeth and claws...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled as he looked on at this scene from a distance. He made the right choice to use the Divine Marionette on it. The Diamond Demonic Boar's progress was truly too fast.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At that moment, Tan Yang shot out another arrow once again. But this time, it was towards the Diamond Demonic Boar – towards its eyes!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though the Diamond Demonic Boar's level had improved greatly, it was unable to fully dodge it. However, it could still dodge to reduce the damage received.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Clank!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Wu!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Demonic Boar was sent flying, and even the fences on the side of the arena were smashed. However, what amazed Qing Shui the most was that this Diamond Demonic Boar did not suffer much injury. The arrow could go no further than two inches into its skin.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"What a monstrous boar!" Seeing how the Diamond Demonic Boar stood up and appeared to be fine, many people shouted out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">And the Diamond Demonic Boar once again charged towards Tan Yang.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bang!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time around, it was sent flying again with Tan Yang's palm. However, what amazed everyone was that the Diamond Demonic Boar once again stood up with great tenacity.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that the Diamond Demonic Boar's strongest point was still its defences even after it had attained the breakthrough. While its strength and speed and other attributes had also improved tremendously, they were not comparable to its defences.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Misfortunes could be hidden blessings in disguise!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Earlier, when Qing Shui was just about to throw everything aside to save the Diamond Demonic Boar as it was being hurt badly by the Iron Spine Falcon, the Diamond Demonic Boar had attained a breakthrough.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui held onto the Big Dipper Sword. Just as the Diamond Demonic Boar once again pounced towards Tan Yang, the rock Qing Shui was holding shot out towards the other two Iron Spine Falcons in the air.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bang!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The rock shattered, but the two Iron Spine Falcons were unharmed. They continued to engage in battle with the Firebird. Loud screeches filled the air!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui saw that the Diamond Demonic Boar was still charging towards Tan Yang, appearing inexhaustible. He did the same, and when Tan Yang attacked to push back the Diamond Demonic Boar once again, Qing Shui attacked as well.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Swoosh swoosh!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Silver needles shot out from his left sleeve!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ding ding!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a pity that that flash of light was blocked by the silver-colored armor. However, Qing Shui had just about reached next to Tan Yang!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Big Dipper Sword he was holding slashed out!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">All of his strength was gathered to its limits!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was slightly more than the strength of a "country"!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was bent on killing Tan Yang with his sword, and thus used his full powers without any reservations.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This attack made the world lose its colors. The majestic ancient sword exuded an overwhelming aura, causing the blood to drain from the faces of everyone present, especially that seventy years old white-haired elder.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tan Yang's expression changed. He quickly drew out the three-feet Greenedge Sword on his back. It had the same flash as his armor before he swung it down hard and let out a loud bellow!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">So close yet so far!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In that moment, an invisible wall appeared around him. It was as thick as an ancient city wall, and although it was a transparent wall of light, it looked especially sturdy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Burst!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With a loud sound, the Big Dipper Sword clashed down hard onto that thick and sturdy wall of light!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After hanging on for a moment, the wall of light shattered. The Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique quickly circulated his Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique and slashed towards Tan Yang who was thrusting his sword towards him!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Fourth Wave of the sword!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui had used almost all his energy to smash the wall of light, Tan Yang, who was behind the wall, had launched his attack. This attack was sent out with the full power of a grade 10 Martial King. With the further enhancement from his armor, weapon, and maybe some mysterious items, his power had exceeded that of a grade 10 Martial King!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Sword Tower had invested heavily in Tan Yang. Firstly, it was for their own honor, and secondly, it was for Tan Yang's safety!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tan Yang had grabbed the right time to attack, but he had underestimated Qing Shui's abilities!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Clank clank clank clank!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Loud clashing sounds rang out and Qing Shui retreated two steps, his vital energy and blood swirling around furiously!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tan Yang was shaken off the ground and retreated backwards in a gliding manner!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Hahaha, I've underestimated you. To think that you're also barely at the pinnacle of the Martial King level. It's a pity that my "Starmoon Battle Armor" is just able to block off your attacks. You're not able to break through my defences. Today, I'll enjoy myself killing someone at the pinnacle of the Martial King level!" Tan Yang laughed out maniacally in mid-air.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cloudmist Steps!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stared at Tan Yang as he chased after him. His speed was fast like the surging river water, and what was most important was his aura!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Unmoving Like A Mountain!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Frenzied Bull's Strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui circulated each of them one by one, and also took out a Godly Force Talisman and slapped it onto himself! Everything was so that he could raise his aura to its limits!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He was getting closer to Tan Yang, and the latter was also about to land!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's loud tiger's roar cut through the clouds, and at the same time, he brought forth his Mighty Elephant Stomp, which was at the large success stage, at Tan Yang!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The strong tremors created a crater several tens of meters deep on the arena!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Since you're a tortoise with a hard shell, I'll shake up all your organs and Dan Tian!" Qing Shui looked at Tan Yang, whose face had turned as pale as paper and was spewing out fresh blood from his mouth. He felt a great sense of satisfaction.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that Tan Yang was done for, completely wasted. It was even hard to tell if he could still survive. Qing Shui lamented on how powerful the "Starmoon Battle Armor" was.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The vast field was now so quiet that one would even be able to hear the sound of a falling pin. The stomp Qing Shui executed earlier had already reached the level of two "countries" and had even created such a deep crater on this specially made arena.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Are my eyes playing tricks on me? Qing Shui has won against Tan Yang?!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Someone! Hit me!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Seems like it's true! You can feel the pain!" Someone spoke out with joyful tears.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Damn it, why didn't you hit yourself?"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"It's too awkward to hit myself. I'm used to hitting others."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Elder sister, Qing Shui won!" Huoyun Liu-Li tugged on Canghai Mingyue and said, smiling. The traces of tears on her face had not dried yet.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Mmm, won, he won. I knew that he'd win." Canghai Mingyue smiled and nodded.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Haha, to think that our Heavenly Palace has produced such a heaven-defying talent. Haha, Old Mo, Grand Ancestor must be so happy." A person who looked like a Supreme Elder turned towards another elderly and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Tonight let's look for Old Cang for a drink. He really has good fortune." The old man called Old Mo said happily.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">An elderly person at the back of the crowd from Sword Tower turned as pale as a piece of paper, and his hands clenched tightly, his whole body trembling as he stared daggers at Qing Shui with his eyes.</p>

Even the Firebird could not do anything after being tangled up by such small-scaled demonic beasts in a restricted area. If they were further apart, it might have a better advantage, but it had none of that at all now. Moreover, those two Iron Spine Falcon were not of a lower level that the Firebird.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Firebird was also just an elementary Martial King level demonic beast.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everyone's gaze gradually turned towards the Diamond Demonic Boar, which had been scratched with wounds all over and was shrieking in agony.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If anything were to happen to that Diamond Demonic Boar, then Qing Shui would really be in danger. When that time comes, the Iron Spine Falcon would come to interfere with Qing Shui, and Tan Yang's fatal arrow would shoot out at Qing Shui without any hesitation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could imagine that there was no way he would be capable of dodging the arrow in such close quarters. In the face of such a powerful arrow, this distance could be covered in just the blink of an eye, or even less.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If he was not disturbed, Qing Shui, who had a strong Spiritual Sense, would be able to use his Big Dipper Sword to block the arrow and reduce most of the damages.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Roar roar!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ning ning!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was in a panic, but there was nothing he could do to help. He was even grabbing onto a rock and wanted to throw it at that Iron Spine Falcon.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Wu wu!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's brows were tightly furrowed together. He planned to shoot down that Iron Spine Falcon even if he had to forcefully hold up against one of Tan Yang’s arrows with his powerful defences.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But just then!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Roar!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A loud, piercing bellow rang out!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Demonic Boar emitted a strong golden light all over!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It broke through...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tan Yang's face turned pale, and his arrow suddenly shot out towards Qing Shui!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Clank!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui blocked it with his Big Dipper Sword but was pushed backwards as a result. The strong impact caused Qing Shui to feel that his organs were turning topsy turvy, and blood trickled down from the corner of his lips.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was too fast and too fierce! To think that even with his strong defences, and with the Divine Arm Clearing at the large success stage, after blocking with his Big Dipper Sword, he had still suffered from injuries of such an extent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui flew out for over ten meters before landing on the arena and then slided towards the back.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">And at that moment, the Diamond Demonic Boar grew to the size of a calf from its original one-meter long body. It looked very powerful and domineering, and had a nose which was about half a foot long.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It let out another cry which pierced through the clouds, stomping down on the ground, and then pounced on the Iron Spine Falcon which had yet to take flight. With a shrill screech filling the air, the Diamond Demonic Boar attacked with its mouth and feet, as if it was unleashing the pent-up grievances from earlier. In just a short amount of time, the Iron Spine Falcon became a pile of torn up bird flesh.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Astonished. Everyone was astonished. To think that the Diamond Demonic Boar, which was struggling under the Iron Spine Falcon's claws earlier, had managed to tear it apart completely in mere moments.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">What level was it at to be able to have such strong teeth and claws...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled as he looked on at this scene from a distance. He made the right choice to use the Divine Marionette on it. The Diamond Demonic Boar's progress was truly too fast.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At that moment, Tan Yang shot out another arrow once again. But this time, it was towards the Diamond Demonic Boar – towards its eyes!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though the Diamond Demonic Boar's level had improved greatly, it was unable to fully dodge it. However, it could still dodge to reduce the damage received.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Clank!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Wu!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Demonic Boar was sent flying, and even the fences on the side of the arena were smashed. However, what amazed Qing Shui the most was that this Diamond Demonic Boar did not suffer much injury. The arrow could go no further than two inches into its skin.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"What a monstrous boar!" Seeing how the Diamond Demonic Boar stood up and appeared to be fine, many people shouted out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">And the Diamond Demonic Boar once again charged towards Tan Yang.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Bang!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time around, it was sent flying again with Tan Yang's palm. However, what amazed everyone was that the Diamond Demonic Boar once again stood up with great tenacity.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that the Diamond Demonic Boar's strongest point was still its defences even after it had attained the breakthrough. While its strength and speed and other attributes had also improved tremendously, they were not comparable to its defences.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Misfortunes could be hidden blessings in disguise!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Earlier, when Qing Shui was just about to throw everything aside to save the Diamond Demonic Boar as it was being hurt badly by the Iron Spine Falcon, the Diamond Demonic Boar had attained a breakthrough.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui held onto the Big Dipper Sword. Just as the Diamond Demonic Boar once again pounced towards Tan Yang, the rock Qing Shui was holding shot out towards the other two Iron Spine Falcons in the air.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Bang!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The rock shattered, but the two Iron Spine Falcons were unharmed. They continued to engage in battle with the Firebird. Loud screeches filled the air!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui saw that the Diamond Demonic Boar was still charging towards Tan Yang, appearing inexhaustible. He did the same, and when Tan Yang attacked to push back the Diamond Demonic Boar once again, Qing Shui attacked as well.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Swoosh swoosh!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Silver needles shot out from his left sleeve!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ding ding!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was a pity that that flash of light was blocked by the silver-colored armor. However, Qing Shui had just about reached next to Tan Yang!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Big Dipper Sword he was holding slashed out!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">All of his strength was gathered to its limits!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was slightly more than the strength of a "country"!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was bent on killing Tan Yang with his sword, and thus used his full powers without any reservations.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This attack made the world lose its colors. The majestic ancient sword exuded an overwhelming aura, causing the blood to drain from the faces of everyone present, especially that seventy years old white-haired elder.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tan Yang's expression changed. He quickly drew out the three-feet Greenedge Sword on his back. It had the same flash as his armor before he swung it down hard and let out a loud bellow!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">So close yet so far!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In that moment, an invisible wall appeared around him. It was as thick as an ancient city wall, and although it was a transparent wall of light, it looked especially sturdy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Burst!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With a loud sound, the Big Dipper Sword clashed down hard onto that thick and sturdy wall of light!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After hanging on for a moment, the wall of light shattered. The Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique quickly circulated his Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique and slashed towards Tan Yang who was thrusting his sword towards him!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Fourth Wave of the sword!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui had used almost all his energy to smash the wall of light, Tan Yang, who was behind the wall, had launched his attack. This attack was sent out with the full power of a grade 10 Martial King. With the further enhancement from his armor, weapon, and maybe some mysterious items, his power had exceeded that of a grade 10 Martial King!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Sword Tower had invested heavily in Tan Yang. Firstly, it was for their own honor, and secondly, it was for Tan Yang's safety!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tan Yang had grabbed the right time to attack, but he had underestimated Qing Shui's abilities!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Clank clank clank clank!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Loud clashing sounds rang out and Qing Shui retreated two steps, his vital energy and blood swirling around furiously!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tan Yang was shaken off the ground and retreated backwards in a gliding manner!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Hahaha, I've underestimated you. To think that you're also barely at the pinnacle of the Martial King level. It's a pity that my "Starmoon Battle Armor" is just able to block off your attacks. You're not able to break through my defences. Today, I'll enjoy myself killing someone at the pinnacle of the Martial King level!" Tan Yang laughed out maniacally in mid-air.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cloudmist Steps!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stared at Tan Yang as he chased after him. His speed was fast like the surging river water, and what was most important was his aura!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Unmoving Like A Mountain!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Frenzied Bull's Strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui circulated each of them one by one, and also took out a Godly Force Talisman and slapped it onto himself! Everything was so that he could raise his aura to its limits!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He was getting closer to Tan Yang, and the latter was also about to land!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's loud tiger's roar cut through the clouds, and at the same time, he brought forth his Mighty Elephant Stomp, which was at the large success stage, at Tan Yang!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The strong tremors created a crater several tens of meters deep on the arena!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Since you're a tortoise with a hard shell, I'll shake up all your organs and Dan Tian!" Qing Shui looked at Tan Yang, whose face had turned as pale as paper and was spewing out fresh blood from his mouth. He felt a great sense of satisfaction.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that Tan Yang was done for, completely wasted. It was even hard to tell if he could still survive. Qing Shui lamented on how powerful the "Starmoon Battle Armor" was.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The vast field was now so quiet that one would even be able to hear the sound of a falling pin. The stomp Qing Shui executed earlier had already reached the level of two "countries" and had even created such a deep crater on this specially made arena.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Are my eyes playing tricks on me? Qing Shui has won against Tan Yang?!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Someone! Hit me!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Seems like it's true! You can feel the pain!" Someone spoke out with joyful tears.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Damn it, why didn't you hit yourself?"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"It's too awkward to hit myself. I'm used to hitting others."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Elder sister, Qing Shui won!" Huoyun Liu-Li tugged on Canghai Mingyue and said, smiling. The traces of tears on her face had not dried yet.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Mmm, won, he won. I knew that he'd win." Canghai Mingyue smiled and nodded.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Haha, to think that our Heavenly Palace has produced such a heaven-defying talent. Haha, Old Mo, Grand Ancestor must be so happy." A person who looked like a Supreme Elder turned towards another elderly and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Tonight let's look for Old Cang for a drink. He really has good fortune." The old man called Old Mo said happily.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">An elderly person at the back of the crowd from Sword Tower turned as pale as a piece of paper, and his hands clenched tightly, his whole body trembling as he stared daggers at Qing Shui with his eyes.</p>
