 <p><strong>AST 800 - Hard To Guess What The Person Was Thinking, Three Days, Roc Spreading Wings At the Small Success Stage</strong></p>
 <p>Under such a situation, time passed by very quickly. Very soon, it was already time for Qing Shui to leave the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. However, he was very happy. Even though he had yet to reach a breakthrough to the small success stage for both the Roc Spreading Wings and the Heart of Roc, he was already extremely familiar with both of them. Qing Shui was quite satisfied with his progress.</p>
 <p>Before it was time to leave the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui had sufficient rest and thus would not rest after he had exited but would do some other things. When he left his room, he saw Yiye Jiange in the distance.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui!"</p>
 <p>When Yiye Jiange saw Qing Shui, she smiled and called out to him. Qing Shui smiled and walked over. Di Chen gave the feeling of one who transcended the human world, while Yiye Jiange gave one the feeling of spiritual secularism.</p>
 <p>"Jiange!" Qing Shui could now easily and casually call out her name but his respect for her had not changed, primarily because of Luan Luan. Now, she still needed to act the role of his wife.</p>
 <p>For Luan Luan, Qing Shui did not stop this but he felt that it was very unfair toward her. It was nothing to him to have her as a wife in name but for her...</p>
 <p>The thought of marrying Yiye Jiange had never crossed Qing Shui's mind, as he felt that it would be a form of blasphemy. It was because he was once her disciple and to Qing Shui, she was his master, even though she had not taught him much stuff.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange smiled and looked at Qing Shui, "You've come out? Come join me and let's go out for a walk."</p>
 <p>"I can't ask for anything better!" Qing Shui smiled and replied.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange smiled and her eyes squinted slightly. The charm of that gaze was unrivalled but it was good that Qing Shui's immunity toward beauties was now quite good. Moreover, this lady had been one he has been carefully caring for. However, he still fell into a momentary daze.</p>
 <p>"Jiange, erm... did you have any guy you liked before?" After asking this question, Qing Shui realized that this seemed to be the second time he has asked this.</p>
 <p>"No." Yiye Jiange said outright before looking at Qing Shui, with a shadow of her smile. Qing Shui was stunned to discover that there was a hint of cuteness in her gaze.</p>
 <p>"I feel that it was too unfair for you to be putting on an act with me as husband and wife. For Luan Luan, your sacrifice is too big." Qing Shui said.</p>
 <p>"I don't feel like I've made any sacrifice. I'm very happy." Yiye Jiange continued to reply calmly.</p>
 <p>"Jiange, you've never thought of getting married and having your own children? You seem to like kids a lot too. Haven't you thought of having kids of your own?" Qing Shui had no intentions of blasphemy, nor did he hold any evil thoughts. He just felt that if this were to continue, she would remain alone all her life. After all, they were just husband and wife in pretense.</p>
 <p>In the future, when he had even more kids, he might end up neglecting her at times. By that time, both Di Chen and Wenren Wu-shuang would be his women and she might not feel at ease to be here. However, he felt a little uncomfortable at the thought of her belonging to another man. He didn't know why he had that thought either.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui's sincere expression and didn't know what she was feeling. She liked children but that didn't mean that she needs to have kids of her own. In Qing Clan, she does play with Qing Zun and Qin Yin very often and also carried Qing Ming and Qing Yan very often. She felt very happy with her current life.</p>
 <p>But when Qing Shui brought up the point of her having her own children, she just realized this issue. The heavy burden of vengeance she had been carrying had made her lose any thoughts of her getting married and having her own children.</p>
 <p>She had never considered this before, nor did she consider that she wanted to fall in love with another man. Although everything was very normal for her, she had subconsciously neglected this issue.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange's silence made Qing Shui panic. However, not long later, she smiled, "Luan Luan is our daughter..."</p>
 <p>"Let's not talk about this first. Jiange, if you have a guy you like, you must tell me. Luan Luan has grown up and she'll always be our daughter." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange shook her head, "I won't have a guy I'll fall in love with. We can't separate either. Otherwise, Luan Luan will feel very upset."</p>
 <p>"Alright, then let's not split up, not ever. I'll care for your like a woman I love the most." Qing Shui said softly. His sincere gaze made Yiye Jiange's heart throb.</p>
 <p>This line was very flirty but she felt extremely touched. He had been treating her well for all these years but seeing how more and more ladies were appearing next to him, each of them so outstanding, she suddenly realized one thing: he did not like her.</p>
 <p>She recalled how there were heartwarming moments between them and there were even times when her heart would throb. However, he had never shown her any obvious signs.</p>
 <p>"What's wrong? Why would I be thinking of all this?" Yiye Jiange blushed and she lowered her head slightly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw Yiye Jiange's expression and thought that it was because of what he had said earlier. He quickly explained, "I didn't mean it that way... To me, you're still my master. I don't have that intention at all..."</p>
 <p>Hearing Qing Shui's explanation, Yiye Jiange sighed in her heart but she still kept up a smile, "It's fine. I understand."</p>
 <p>The two of them headed to the back of the mountain behind Heavenly Palace Mountain. Although Heavenly Palace had once been three feet into the ground, the mountain at the back was still the same as before. The familiar area that belonged to Gongsun Jianwu was no longer there. He wondered if that seductive looking lady was fine...</p>
 <p>The north wind blew, sending Yiye Jiange's dress fluttering slightly.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange were together, they didn't often share their thoughts. He didn't understand what Yiye Jiange was thinking, nor did he know what she wanted. The matter with heading to Lion King's Ridge as well, he had not gotten her to admit it herself. No matter how much he had powered up, she had never brought it up before. Qing Shui felt that it was because the gap he had with Lion King's Ridge was still too wide.</p>
 <p>"Jiange, just wait a while more. It'll be soon." Qing Shui chose to sound very vague with his words.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, promise me, don't think too much over my issues. The reason I told you was to let my heart feel at ease for a moment. I've never thought of realizing my own dreams. I've already buried it deep at the bottom of my heart." Yiye Jiange smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Haven't you seen Luan Luan's progress? Won't Luan Luan be able to do it in the future?" Qing Shui seemed to have caught onto something and he looked at Yiye Jiange.</p>
 <p>"Lion King's Ridge is a great sect in Westeria Continent. It's impossible to seek for justice to be done. And Luan Luan still need a very, very long time. Moreover, it's just a hope. With her lifespan, it's difficult..." Yiye Jiange shook her head. Although she was not that clear about the level of Lion King's Ridge, she had some idea of it. There were many powerful members in the sect and all of them were strong Beast Tamers. Lion King's Ridge might have the Heart of Seven Orifices but it's not possible for her to be able to reach the same level in just a day or two. She still need to come across a great opportunity.</p>
 <p>"How terrifying is Lion King's Ridge? Jiange, you know about it, right?" Qing Shui frowned and looked at Yiye Jiange.</p>
 <p>"I'm not sure and I can't say it clearly either. You'll know when you get stronger." Yiye Jiange seemed to have wanted to say more but she didn't.</p>
 <p>"Breakthrough, I must have a breakthrough..." Qing Shui told himself. In ten years, he must be able to reach a height he was satisfied with in ten years. He would then be able to know how deep the waters in the world of the nine continents were.</p>
 <p>"You're still carrying the moonstone I gave you." Yiye Jiange looked at the silver chain around Qing Shui's neck and that faint view of that stone. She could tell at one look that it was what she had given to him back then. With his abilities now, he could carry along stones that were of much higher quality than the one she had given him. But seeing how he was still carrying the one she had given him, she didn't know what she was feeling.</p>
 <p>"This stone had saved my life before, had given me a great encounter and this was also something you had given me." Qing Shui looked at the moonstone and said happily.</p>
 <p>"Am I that important?" Yiye Jiange smiled and looked at Qing Shui. She might not know why she had asked this question, nor did she know what kind of answer she would like to hear.</p>
 <p>She had once told him not to call her master and to have him treat her like a lady, a lady like any other around him. It was just that he seemed to have forgotten about it.</p>
 <p>To be honest, she was very lonely and had wanted a friend whom she could share her heartfelt thoughts with. She had even thought of forgetting her past to start a new life, find a suitable man to live with. However, this seemed to be very difficult. The things that had happened had forced her to where she was right now and she could not draw herself out of it.</p>
 <p>"Important, very important." Qing Shui was saying the truth but he didn't know how to reply. This was why he repeated his answer twice, in order to emphasize the importance of what he had said.</p>
 <p>"Compared to them?" Yiye Jiange smiled.</p>
 <p>"The same. You're the mother to my child. I've honestly treated you like the mother to my child." Qing Shui looked at Yiye Jiange and said gently.</p>
 <p>"Really?" Yiye Jiange smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>"Of course it's the truth." Qing Shui affirmed.</p>
 <p>"Then you must treat me better in the future, treat me like one of your women." Yiye Jiange smiled faintly and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded mechanically but didn't know the true meaning behind those words.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Two days passed by very quickly. Qing Shui was moving about non-stop in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. His eyes shut tight, his legs stepping about at rapid speed and his upright and long silhouette dashed about elusively. That speed seemed to be even faster than when he had taken the Gale Pellet.</p>
 <p>"Hahaha, to think that the Roc Spreading Wings at the small success stage could already bring me such effects." Qing Shui came to an abrupt stop and laughed out loud. He was too happy.</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui was at the stage of solidifying his progress. He had just made the breakthrough and thus needed more time to familiarize himself with it before continuing to work hard to cultivate the Heart of Roc. It was because the Heart of Roc was about to reach a breakthrough too. Qing Shui hoped that he would be able to attain it as soon as possible.</p>
 <p>It had been about five months. It was perfectly normal to be using this amount of time. The difficulty to reach the small success stage was the smallest and therefore he would be able to reach a breakthrough for most martial arts to this stage.</p>
 <p>It was different for the large success stage where the difficulty was higher. It was not something that one could attain just by working hard. However, even though the difficulty was higher, so was the prowess. The difference between the prowess of the large success stage and the small success stage was like the gap between that of heaven and earth.</p>
 <p>Sitting down, crossed legged, Qing Shui controlled the flames in his hands. The grey colored flames now were still flames that were one foot long. However, compared to before, there seemed to be a little more violence in its power. The Primordial flames continued to shrink slightly. While it was quiet, anyone would be able to sense that the flames held a terrifying power.</p>
 <p>This was the changes to the Primordial flames after cultivating the Heart of Roc!</p>
