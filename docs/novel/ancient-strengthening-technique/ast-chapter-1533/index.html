 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t regard Gu Yelong who was charging towards him as a threat. Though Qing Shui might have had his attention in the younger generations of warriors and that Gu Yelong might have been one of the outstanding warriors among the generations in the Gu Clan, he was only considered a decent one. There was still a huge gap between him and Qing Shui or Qin Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was standing still while Gu Yelong held his long sword in his hand. Somehow, Qing Shui kept feeling that Gu Yelong was holding the sword just to show off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Taichi Cloud Hands!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t move, yet he managed to avoid Gu Yelong’s sword. He immediately extended his hand and grabbed Gu Yelong’s neck. The longsword dropped out of his hand and down the arena, making a loud and clear noise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It only took one move and Qing Shui had already managed to choke the opponent. He held him up in mid-air as Gu Yelong was struggling. Everyone could tell that if Qing Shui had wanted it, he could have killed him with ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before this, Gu Yelong was really embarrassed already. And now, with just one move, he was being raised up in the air like a struggling chicken by a man younger than him. The humiliation which he received was more than enough to kill him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Answer me. Why do you want to dig your own grave so badly? Is it because you think that I am weak enough to bully? Why would the Gu Clan have a useless brat like you...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s voice was very loud and clear. Any smart person would know at whom his words were directed at. The faces of a lot of people from the Gu Clan looked totally red. News about Gu Yelong was passed around very quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Yelong was well-known in Qin King City for being a playboy. How could he possibly endure it when people found out that a playboy like him couldn’t perform the most basic sexual intercourse? The entire Gu Clan had completely lost its face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Assistant, he lost.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following that voice, Qing Shui saw a man standing at a spot not far away from him. Qing Shui didn’t bother looking at the man and said, “Why were you being so loud? That scared me and almost made me pinch him to death.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s words revealed how much he despised their Clan. Pinched to death… Gu Clan… Only small things like ants would be pinched to death. Everyone was able to figure out that Qing Shui was describing the Gu Clan as trash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… You… He already lost, let me fight on his behalf!” Another man looked really furious. However, he sounded calm by the time he finished his sentence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Qing Shui lifted up his head and moved his sight towards the man. At the same time, he tossed Gu Yelong out of the arena.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man looked middle-aged. He had a well-structured face. The only problem was that his nose and eyes seemed a bit sharp, making his entire face look a bit gloomy and fierce. Usually, people with this look weren’t easy to work with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t come out and humiliate yourself. You are not strong enough to face me.” Qing Shui claimed slowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, the man was incapable. However, the fact that Qing Shui said it out loud while adding his confidence made the man feel as if he was already admitting defeat before he even started fighting. This was what people would call dominance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You lost.” Qing Shui repeated once again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man moved his brows. After that, a silvery white long spear appeared in his hand. The tip of the spear was sharp and thin. It was giving out blue light. The first impression people would have from seeing it was that it contained poison.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, it contained poison. Qing Shui didn’t express any emotions from seeing the opponent’s poisonous weapon. However, deep down, he had already made up his mind that his opponent was done for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui would never go easy on the people who intended to kill him. He took out the Golden Battle Halberd. He didn’t feel like dragging on the fight because he wanted to crush the Gu Clan’s faith from the battles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Silver Spear Soul Annihilation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a silvery white long spear. Even during daytime, the blue colored tip could still be seen as being really bright. It was just like a smaller version of a sun, so eye-piercing. It charged its way towards Qing Shui very fiercely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui casually swung his Golden Battle Halberd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ding-ding-ding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the fifth strike, the man was run through. The man’s silver spear immediately broke in half. While the opponent was still frozen in shock, Qing Shui shot the Golden Battle Halberd towards his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man spurted out fresh blood and dropped down. Qing Shui had his limits. The man wouldn’t be able to live for more than three days. In Qing Shui’s view, he must never be soft with evil people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, the Gu Clan was incensed. Usually, this kind of challenges would last for a long time. The reason being that the warriors who represented their clan at the beginning would usually be the weak ones. This was a kind of culture and also a way of testing their opponents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, on Qin King Manor’s side, Qing Shui went up right away. Though he might be young, his strength wasn’t something which could be compared to those from his generation. Thus, they skipped through the entire process and it would seem just as if they had already entered the final stage of the challenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It appeared that no one was able to believe what they just saw. The Gu Clan was still testing Qing Shui. As of now, they felt that it was an embarrassment to send out the experts from their clan. The reason being that Qing Shui was a young man and that he had good relationships only with the juniors from Qin King Manor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like this, after Qing Shui battled for almost ten rounds, the Gu Clan finally realized the mistake they had made. Indeed, this young man couldn’t be compared to normal juniors. This time, one of the elders was sent out to the arena.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I heard that Qing Shui is Miss Qin Qing’s fiance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fairy Qin’s heart has also been moved. Before this, I used to think that she would stay single her whole life. I never thought for someone to be able to match up to her in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That trash, Gu Yelong. To think that he is still thinking of going after Fairy Qin… He used to always be so arrogant… Who would have expected him to be a person who couldn’t even get erect. Compared to him, I feel that even a beggar would live a happier life than him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person who went up the arena this time was an old man. There wasn’t even one wrinkle on his face. Both of his eyes looked very lively. However, his brows were already snow white in color. They were hanging all the way down to his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old man, what do you mean by that?” Qing Shui asked even though he knew full well what the old man was referring to.

You are too young, you have no sense of propriety.” The old man calmly looked at Qing Shui. Deep down, he actually really admired this young man. The only unfortunate thing was that he was an enemy of the Gu Clan.</span></p>

At times, when a person accuses another of being stupid, they are usually unaware that they, themselves, are the stupid ones.”</span></p>

To think that it was the combination of the earth and metal elements. Basically, this technique was no longer under the influence of the other five elements. However, it was able to counter against the rest of them.</span></p>

But very quickly, he calmed down. Naturally, for this young man to be so arrogant, he definitely had his own sure-kill move. Techniques which could reduce an opponent’s speed were indeed very fearsome. Speed meant everything. Without it, a warrior would simply be helpless. If a warrior failed to hurt his opponent, it would be useless no matter how much power his attack contained.</span></p>

As for his speed, it got reduced by 40%, which was very fatal. Originally, Qing Shui never expected to do it so fast. By now, he had managed to reduce almost half of the speed of his opponent. The winner had already been decided.</span></p>

If it was the things from before, he was still able to accept a 20% reduction in speed. He thought that this would be Qing Shui’s strongest sure-kill technique. But now, his overall ability dropped down by 20% as well. Furthermore, it stacked with the previous 20% drop in his speed as well.</span></p>

It’s not that he wasn’t strong enough, it’s just that he was unable to get a grasp on where his opponent was. He was not used to the sudden drop in speed. Against the Golden Battle Halberd, he got pierced twice. Luckily, he managed to avoid the fatal areas. Though his speed was greatly reduced, he was still able to withstand the attacks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, the old man’s speed was once again reduced by another 20%. This phenomenon immediately made him felt like surrendering. But he decided not to do so because he felt that he couldn’t afford to lose face in front of this man. Despite all that, he couldn’t even unleash his Sure-kill Heavenly Technique.</span></p>

Though his shoulder wasn’t penetrated, he had still been injured and spurted out fresh blood. The old man used his momentum and retreated quickly.</span></p>

As soon as Qing Shui spotted it, he already realized that his movement had been slowed down. He was already in the center of these energies. It felt just like when an ordinary person dropped down into a swamp, unable to move even a single step.</span></p>

The golden yellow and earthen yellow colors were twisting around each other and giving out water-like lusters. They were spinning constantly, condensing with each other and solidifying into a sphere.</span></p>

For a few times, she felt the urge to charge forward. However, rules were rules, and she mustn’t break them. Furthermore, it’s was already useless for him to forfeit the match now. At that instant, the only thing in her thought was for him to be alive. So long as he lived, she was willing to agree to any of his requests.</span></p>
