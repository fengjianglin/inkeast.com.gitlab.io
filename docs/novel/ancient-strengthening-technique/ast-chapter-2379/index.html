 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2379 - Nalan Qing's Kiss, Pouting</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui naturally understood the Water Emperor's feelings. After all, they were both men and Qing Shui was also a father. He couldn't clearly say if such things were right or wrong but back then, Nalan Qing's insistence was a decision made with the standpoint of a child. She had done this willingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The fact that Sister Qing did that shows you're a good father whom she deserves," Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"As a father, I should be holding up the world for her. I'm the emperor of a nation, but I ended up falling to that state." The Water Emperor smiled bitterly and shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's hard to anticipate things in life. Sister Qing is lucky. There are many people in this world and no one wishes to withstand pain. However, when pain comes, we must face it. I believe that senior doesn't have to mind it too much. We must learn to look forward. What do you think?" Qing Shui had experienced many things in life and had seen through many things clearly. It was inadvisable to act arrogantly when young, but one mustn't lose one’s guts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right, that's right. We must look forward. Qing`er and I are indebted to you. No matter what you need, as long as I can do it, I'll promise and support you unconditionally," The Water Emperor laughed and said, feeling especially happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nalan Qing stood at the side and noticed that whenever her father spoke, he would occasionally look toward her and then to Qing Shui. Anyone who wasn't an idiot would know what this gaze meant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui naturally could understand this gesture as well. He couldn't continue to act ignorant anymore. If he didn't like Nalan Qing then it was fine. He could continue to act ignorant and the Water Emperor would probably not say anything. After he left, things would just pass by as long as this thing wasn't mentioned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the reality was that Qing Shui liked Nalan Qing. He could sense that this lady liked him back as well. Amongst the many people in the world, there weren't many who liked each other. Even if there were some who could find their other half who liked them back, there were also many cases where they couldn't even become friends due to various reasons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since the opportunity was here, he didn't wish to miss it. Therefore, he rubbed his nose and said, "Senior, I like Sister Qing, but I still can't be sure if Sister Qing likes me back. Would you stop me from pursuing Sister Qing?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui gave the Water Emperor a huge leeway.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Qing Shui's words, the Water Emperor laughed out loud. The latter felt very happy and said outright, "I won't stop you. I definitely won't stop you. If you wish to find out anything about Qing`er, you can come and look for me as well. I'll tell you everything I know."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Father!" Nalan Qing blushed and said coyly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright, alright. Qing Shui, I hope that you can treat this lass well. She has become a lot happier than before after meeting you. I wish to express my heartfelt thanks. It's been very long since she has smiled," The Water Emperor said sincerely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Senior, don't worry. I'll treat Sister Qing as my dearest person and I'll make her happy." Qing Shui nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Water Emperor patted Nalan Qing's head and said that he had some things to take care of. The banquet was almost over and frankly, the Water Emperor just wanted to give the two youngsters some time to themselves. Everyone was aware of that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Water Emperor left, but Nalan Qing felt very shy and didn't dare to look at Qing Shui. A cool but mature woman like her was very charming when embarrassed. After making things clear, Qing Shui felt a lot more daring. After all, he previously didn't know if he should take this step forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing Qing Shui's footsteps getting increasingly closer, Nalan Qing felt that her heart was beating very fast. She then suddenly raised her head, "You aren't allowed to come over..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui sensed Nalan Qing's quick heartbeat and stopped. He looked at her shy but panicky expression and said, "Sister Qing, are you overthinking things?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're the one who is overthinking things," Nalan Qing chided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She became a lot calmer but she still continued to look at Qing Shui with a strange gaze, "Do you really like me?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Of course. There's no man who wouldn't like a beauty like you," Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You’re only aiming for my body," Nalan Qing said, feeling a little disappointed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Do you think I'm the same as other men? That I'm superficial? That I'm insincere...?" Qing Shui walked over slowly and took her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nalan Qing didn't know what to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"One loves everything associated with the person they love. If a person likes someone, they will slowly like everything about them. A lady's appearance itself is one of the most important parts. It's because one's appearance is what attracted the other person to like them in the first place. The first impression is very important. The guy will then slowly begin to like her interior and everything else. Why is it that no man would like the interior of an extremely ugly woman?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm a widow," Nalan Qing said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Putting aside the fact that you're still a virgin, even if you were really married and even had kids, I would still like you. My feelings for you wouldn't be affected at all," Qing Shui said sincerely, but this was really something he could really do, like how it had been for Mingyue Gelou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nalan Qing felt very happy inside, but she had no idea what she was feeling happy about. It was as if a window had been opened up in her heart and this world seemed to have suddenly become a lot brighter than before. Her shining eyes that were like stars looked at Qing Shui with a hint of a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui pulled Nalan Qing gently and she fell into his arms. She gasped, "You aren't allowed to bully me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How can I bear to do so? I can't wait to dote on you instead." Qing Shui grinned. However, he merely hugged her and didn't do anything more. For a woman like her, if he were to be too aggressive, it would just have the opposite effect from what he wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nalan Qing was very quiet. She hadn't expected that she would feel such an unprecedented sense of calmness, being embraced by the arms of a man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Qing Shui, thank you." Nalan Qing hugged Qing Shui gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I don't wish for you to be acting like this just because you feel thankful," Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I thought men would go through any means to get their hands on the woman they want?" Nalan Qing smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who said that? Come, tell your man that you like him." Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nalan Qing blushed a little and threw him a coy glance, "No!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Are you sure?" Qing Shui licked his lips and smiled lewdly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nalan Qing's face turned even redder but she didn't say anything. This made Qing Shui stunned for a moment and a strange thought rose up in his mind. Did she want him to kiss her?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This thought made Qing Shui a little excited. He wasn't a virgin and his understanding of women was a lot better than how it had been in the past. Therefore, when this thought rose up, Qing Shui inched in slowly. His speed wasn't fast, giving Nalan Qing the time to stop him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Qing Shui wasn't stopped even when his lips touched hers. Despite so, he sensed the figure in his arms shivering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was very gentle, kissing her lips thoroughly. They were fragrant, exquisite, and had a charming coolness as well. Nalan Qing's body stiffened up a little as she gritted her teeth tightly and had her eyes closed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui felt that the current Nalan Qing was especially cute.</span></p>
