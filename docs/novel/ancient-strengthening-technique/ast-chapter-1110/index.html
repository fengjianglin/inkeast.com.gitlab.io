 <p><strong>AST 1110 - Mighty and Mysterious Violet Bloodline, The Stone Woman</strong></p>
 <p>His breathing sounded a bit uneven, especially when his chest was being pressed with the sensation of her supple breasts. The smoothness of the hands behind his back caused him to feel a bit reluctant to let go.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui abruptly hugged Yiye Jiange, she panicked. She felt a bit stuffy and panicked being hugged by Qing Shui. However, it seemed like she wasn’t that surprised by it and did not struggle to break away from it. In fact, she slowly embraced Qing Shui’s neck with her arms, her neck and face turning pink as she did so.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t actually make any moves that were over the line. Men should always keep their promises, even if it were something which men and women should not be too serious about. He still knew that his relationship with her would only improve significantly once he destroys Beitang Clan. If he didn’t do it, it would be very hard for them to have a happy ending.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t that Qing Shui was unable to win her heart over unless he destroyed Beitang Clan. In fact, everything had basically already been decided by now. Yiye Jiange was already considered to be his wife. The only thing was, the burden in her heart would never disappear so long as the Beitang Clan existed. This being the case, she would never be able to experience true happiness.</p>
 <p>If one couldn’t gain true happiness and always had a heavy burden in their heart, they wouldn’t be their true selves. This was also why she had never been involved in any intimate feelings between men and women for so many years.</p>
 <p>This was also considered a punishment god gave her. She had an incomparably beautiful face and a clever mind on top of that. She came from an excellent background as well. Although she was met with difficulties halfway through her life, the most important thing was that the experience gave her a persevering heart.</p>
 <p>If it had been others, they would have to readjust their mindset and forget about vengeance if they still wanted to continue living, since they weren’t able to avenge their family. Only through this would they be able to live happily; only then would they be able to get themselves into a new lifestyle. With her physical appearance, it was just way too easy for her to become rich.</p>
 <p>However, she was unable to do it. At the time of her first encounter with Qing Shui, she never expected for the man whom she regarded as average to climb up to such great height one day. Most importantly, in regards to the vengeance that she had unintentionally told him, he actually managed to listen to all of them and kept it in his heart.</p>
 <p>Back then, she and the Skysword Sect had aided him once. But to her and the Skysword Sect, it was just a simple assistance that they had provided to a person. That time, however, her help for Qing Shui was prominent. Qing Shui was a person who would pay someone back a favor in full, even if they had only aided him in a small way.</p>
 <p>What surprised her was the fact that they would actually fall in love with each other. Even though their feelings were something that grew overtime, she herself could not place exactly when her heart had left a spot for him.</p>
 <p>“Jiange, even I, myself, feel like this is all a dream.” Qing Shui raised his head and smiled, looking at the gorgeous beauty in front of him.</p>
 <p>“Why?” Yiye Jiange glanced at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“The first time I saw you, you were as pure as an angel. This stopped me from having irreverent and disrespectful intentions against you. That was why I called you my master at that time. Back then, I was perfectly happy to be your disciple. Even if I had one day ended up being stronger than you, I would still protect you as your disciple.” Qing Shui suddenly remembered his time back in Hundred Miles City.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange smiled: “Damned brat, the way you compliment people is special. No wonder all of them were deceived by you.”</p>
 <p>“Why does no one believe me when I’m telling the truth? To be honest, at that time, I really did think that someone as beautiful as you would have belonged to someone else. I never thought that one day, I would be able to have you by my side.” Qing Shui was straightforward with his words.</p>
 <p>“So even you have times when you’re in doubt.” Yiye Jiange was blushing as she revealed a smile. Now, she looked more relaxed. She was calmly embracing the man and telling him things she never thought she would have said in the past.</p>
 <p>“Where can I possibly find my confidence at that time facing an extreme beauty like you? I believe at that time, you must have treated me as a child as well. Otherwise, how would you have ended up being my master?” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p>“Do not ever talk about this in the future……” Yiye Jiange extended her hand and pulled his ear.</p>
 <p>“Then is it ok if I start calling you younger sister Jiange from now on?” Qing Shui laughed and continued on speaking.</p>
 <p>“No!”</p>
 <p>“Alright, why were you looking for me? Don’t tell me, it’s just for……” Yiye Jiange didn’t really want to continue being entangled to that problem with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Of course not! Eat this!” Qing Shui took out an unadorned medicinal bottle and gave her a pill. He has tried it prior to this, nothing bad would happen.</p>
 <p>“What’s this?” Yiye Jiange looked at the purple pill in her palm and asked in a confused tone.</p>
 <p>“Violet Golden Bloodline Pearl. Try it. I have already taken in one and the effect is quite good.”</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange stopped questioning any further and ate the pill. After that, she sat on the carpet with her legs crossed while Qing Shui looked at her from the side to oversee her cultivation.</p>
 <p>A hundred stars worth of strength!</p>
 <p>What amazed Qing Shui was that it actually helped increase her strength as much as a hundred stars. It shared the same effect as the Hallow Pill. Even though the strength with which the Violet Golden Bloodline Pearl increased couldn’t exceed more than twenty percent of one’s raw strength, Qing Shui could feel that its effect would be more beneficial the stronger one was. Just like himself, even though it increased less than twenty percent of his strength, it still managed to help boost it as much as a thousand stars.</p>
 <p>Upon absorbing the Dragon’s Qi, the girls experienced a boost which was more than one time their raw strength. Not only so their strength has recently been increasing at an unusually fast pace. Twenty percent of their raw strength was worth more than a hundred stars. Nevertheless, Qing Shui was already quite satisfied with a hundred stars worth of strength. After all, it couldn’t exceed beyond twenty percent of their raw strength. It was already considered quite effective.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui in shock. This man has really given her quite a lot of surprises.</p>
 <p>With his spiritual sense, Qing Shui was also able to sense the purple colored droplets within her blood. These purple droplets were actually still her blood, and were just like blood essence, each drop equivalent to about hundred to thousands of normal blood. This was the difference about it. It helped raise the purity of one’s blood as well as the purity of their qi.</p>
 <p>Only after having experienced these purple droplets in his body himself did Qing Shui understand why people that possessed Golden Bloodline and Violet Golden Bloodline were so formidable. This was a kind of strength of bloodline and strength of bone structure.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui never thought thin, purple strands would start forming in his blood. These were all formed as a result of violet-colored blood droplets condensing together. Actually, they were still just small purple dots. His bones started to take on a faint, golden color. To him, these phenomenons were not considered too abnormal.</p>
 <p>He had checked out quite a few history books about the Violet Golden Bloodline. For example, when one got injured and started bleeding, people with Violet Golden Bloodline would not immediately bleed purple-colored blood. It would only begin to appear after their normal blood flowed to a certain extent. In fact, it would only show up towards the end, which also meant that bleeding purple blood would signal that one’s life was at stake. Additionally, people with Violet Golden Bloodline would not have a body full of purple-colored blood. Instead, their bodies would only condense purple-colored blood droplets within their bloodstream.</p>
 <p>Can the Violet Golden Bloodline Pearl be condensed into Violet Gold Blood Essence? Would it produce more and more violet-colored blood droplets alongside one’s increase in cultivation?</p>
 <p>After thinking for a while, Qing Shui decided that the Violet Golden Bloodline Pearl was a great help to everyone and everything was settled. He stopped thinking about other things. In any case, this was also considered one way of optimizing bloodlines.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui suddenly recalled that his mother and the others had swallowed the Crippling Divine Pill. However, they all eventually rose up to Xiantian Grade because of the Xiantian Golden Pill. It seemed that not all medicinal pills were absolute. Who knew if the Violet Golden Bloodline Pearl would be able to remove the side effects of the Xiantian Golden Pill.</p>
 <p>After leaving Yiye Jiange’s room, he continued moving on to other rooms and fed them the Violet Golden Bloodline Pearl. It would be beneficial if they could further raise their strength at this time.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had planned to do other things at first, but by the time he finished going through all the rooms, the sky had already turned bright. The last room that he went into was Wenren Wu-shuang’s room. As he watched Wenren Wu-shuang finish up her practice, he did not really feel any evil intentions. However, she seemed to have something on her mind that she found difficult to talk about. If not, she would not have stopped him after he had basically removed all of her upper clothing and kissed her soft breasts. He could feel that she has already fallen for him, and it was not that she was unable to accept him. So why would she stop him? He had been waiting for her to confess the reason.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Wenren Wu-shuang stood up and hugged Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Her action stunned Qing Shui. Looking at the gorgeous beauty who was tightly cuddling him, he could sense that her inner energy was incredibly unstable. It was as if her thoughts were undergoing a very intense struggle.</p>
 <p>“Wu-shuang, what do you want to say? Just be upfront. In any case, you are only allowed to be my woman in this lifetime of yours. What is there to hide from me?” Qing Shui hugged her and said gently. But he sounded really serious when he said it.</p>
 <p>Wenren Wu-shuang thought about all the things that they had gone through together. What was more, he had also let her tame the Golden Cauldron Spirit Crane not long ago. Ever since her sister passed away, there have been no one in this world who treated her as well as Qing Shui did, let alone the fact that she, herself, was in love with him. This was supposed to be one of the best things that could happen, yet she had her own difficulty, the difficulty of a woman.</p>
 <p>“I love you, but I can’t be your wife. I will forever be your wife in name. However,… and it’s not because I have fallen for other men...” As Wenren Wu-shuang spoke, she started crying.</p>
 <p>“Wu-shuang, is anything wrong? Tell me about it.” Qing Shui was certainly aware that it is not because she had fallen for other men. In fact, she had also made it clear herself. He, too, felt her feelings for him, but was unable to figure out what difficulty she had.</p>
 <p>“I’m a Stone Woman!” Wenren Wu-shuang lowered her head and said softly.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stunned. After that, he smiled: “And here I thought it was something really serious. Have you forgotten that I’m a doctor? Curing people is an easy job for me.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew a thing or two about Stone Women. There were a few differences between the Stone Women in this world and the Stone Women from his past incarnations. In this world, there were three kinds of Stone Women: the first kind being those that had no feelings involved. When a man and woman did not have intimate feelings for each other, they end up being ridiculously cold to each other. The second kind were those whose private parts were like stones. For this kind of women, no matter how fierce a man could be, they would just end up too deep in tears. As for the third kind, the third kind was known as the “Poisonous Corpse”. It meant that the women had too high a concentration of Yin Energy. Sometimes, it could be so concentrated to the point where it would faintly condense into Yin Energy Fire, capable of burning anything which entered it. That wasn’t all. The victim might even end up throwing their life away.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I’m serious. Will you be angry with me?” Wenren Wu-shuang asked Qing Shui while looking at him.</p>
 <p>“Angry with you? Why should I be angry with you?” Qing Shui hugged her tightly.</p>
 <p>“I can’t help you give birth to a child… I want a child……” Wenren Wu-shuang sounded very, very depressed.</p>
 <p>“Who said so? Do you not believe in what your husband can do? Are you the kind with Yin Energy Fire?” Qing Shui whispered by her ear.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was able to sense it. Her body physique belonged to the type superior to that of even the Nine Yin Body. Despite so, it would not cause any flaws in her life. In the World of the Nine Continents, both her condition as well as the Nine Yin Body were considered a type of “Stone Women”.</p>
 <p>For women with Nine Yin Bodies, their problem could be solved by running into men with Nine Yang bodies. As for a woman with the body of Yin Energy Fire, otherwise known as the Nine Yin Fiery Body, even Nine Yang Bodies seemed to be insufficient in matching their Yin Energy.</p>
 <p>But now, not only was Qing Shui a Nine Yang Body, he possessed the Nine Yang Golden Body at Small Success Stage. If his Nine Yang Golden Body could manage to reach Large Success Stage, it might end up being compatible with the Yin Energy within her body.</p>
 <p>“Yeah!” Wenren Wu-shuang lifted up her head and looked at Qing Shui. Maybe because the issue was related to her body, she could not care less about feeling shy.</p>
