 <p>AST 1862 - The old man from Heaven Star Immortal Sect, comprehension</p>
 <p>Sheng Jun’s words stunned Qing Shui. He didn’t know whether he should cry or laugh. He never thought that this woman would actually turn out to be so lost. To think that she would reach this point so soon. However, Qing Shui knew that she would snap out of this state very quickly. This tiny matter wasn’t enough to hold her back.</p>
 <p>However, speaking of which, she was a woman, and hence, it was perfectly normal for such thing to happen. She was already considered to be quite tough for a woman. No matter how tough a person might be, they would also have their own fragile spot.</p>
 <p>To be capable of taking control of an entire sect, normal people could never dream about taking such a role. Though the Sacred Mountain might not be considered an Immortal Sect, with Sheng Jun’s strength alone, it was already enough to put weaker immortal sects in helpless situations.</p>
 <p>After a while, Sheng Jun seemed to realize that she has lost control over her emotions. She smiled and shook her head, “What’s wrong? Do you think that I am weak?”</p>
 <p>“No, you are very tough. You are a woman who is capable of supporting both the heaven and earth alone.” Qing Shui smiled and said. Though he might not sound serious, he sounded a bit sincere when he was saying it. This made her felt very comfortable upon hearing it.</p>
 <p>“Supporting both the heaven and earth? Shouldn’t that be a man’s job?” Sheng Jun smiled.</p>
 <p>“Who told you so? Women are also capable of pulling off ‘supporting both the heaven and earth’.”</p>
 <p>“It’s not a good thing for a woman to be too aggressive or powerful. What you lose on the swing, you get back on the roundabouts. It’s very difficult to look for a man who meets my criteria.” Sheng Jun said in a helpless tone.</p>
 <p>By now, Qing Shui seemed to have understood something. The unforeseen events from before seemed to have caused a few changes to this woman’s heart. He didn’t know if his words would still be effective to her. This woman seemed to yearn for her own family. She seemed to want a man whom she could rely on.</p>
 <p>“Relationship has nothing to do with one’s strength.” Qing Shui shook his head and said.</p>
 <p>“But it is something which mustn’t be neglected on.”</p>
 <p>“Well, that is true. When a woman is too powerful, it will be very easy for the man to be henpecked.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“Such thing will never happen if the feeling is real.”</p>
 <p>Sheng Jun argued back. Across the continent, there was also a saying which described when a wife was very strict to her husband. Hence, Sheng Jun was able to understand what Qing Shui was saying.</p>
 <p>“You are just like a woman who has been longing for love now. What’s wrong? Have you finally make up your mind to start looking for a man to get married to?” Qing Shui said while looking at the beautiful woman.</p>
 <p>“Must you make me sound that awful?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. He just realized that the things which he just said contained a huge ambiguity. Even Sheng Jun had started to suspect whether this man was trying to take advantage of her.</p>
 <p>This time, Qing Shui was only casually saying it. He didn’t really mean anything much. He didn’t have any intention to take advantage of her.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Their peaceful days just started. Just like this, one week passed. Nothing major actually happened. Qing Shui continued to keep his cool. He hasn’t actually felt anything much. Sheng Jun also hadn’t expressed much reactions about it. But compared to before, she seemed to be working even harder in her cultivation.</p>
 <p>But what was meant to arrive would eventually still find its way here. After half a month, the people of Heaven Star Immortal Sect came. This time, like usual, not many people came. Even Liancheng Yang didn’t show up. The people who came were all men that were even older than Liancheng Yang.</p>
 <p>Sheng Yuanlong also didn’t show up. They didn’t enter the Sacred Mountain directly. Instead, stopped outside and transmitted the news of their arrival back to their sect.</p>
 <p>The time happened to be at exact noon.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could sense that these people arrived. Right now, he was practising his techniques while in the blazing sun. Each of his action was as solid and immovable as a mountain.</p>
 <p>Only when Sheng Jun appeared not far away from him did he turn around and said, “Someone’s here!”</p>
 <p>It’s unknown whether Qing Shui meant that Sheng Jun had arrived or rather the Heaven Star Immortal Sect had arrived. But in any case, both were already here.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go and take a look then.” Qing Shui took the lead and went outside.</p>
 <p>Sheng Jun’s mouth slightly quivered. But she didn’t say anything. Instead, she followed along Qing Shui and went outside.</p>
 <p>This time, both Qing Shui and Sheng Jun walked outside together. They didn’t harbor intense killing intent, nor were they too concerned about what was going to happen. They calmly stepped outside and looked at the old men opposite of them before revealing a smile at them.</p>
 <p>“Young man, what are you smiling about?” The old man who was supposed to be their leader asked softly. However, his voice could clearly be heard even from far away.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was probing the old man opposite him. He wore a darkish grey colored gown. It looked very noble being worn by him. The old man’s eyes looked very arrogant and brilliant. It was the kind of eyes which only a person of high status would have.</p>
 <p>The old man wasn’t really that tall. He had an upright figure. Obviously, they didn’t become hunched just because of his age. An old and unadorned aura could be felt being emitted off him. This kind of aura was something which could only be accumulated as one aged. Without the accumulation of age and experience, one would never be able to emit aura like this.</p>
 <p>“I am laughing at the fact that you are unable to hop out from one of the simplest realm despite your old age.” Qing Shui shook his head.</p>
 <p>The old man didn’t seem like he was feeling anxious. Instead, he responded back in a calm tone, “What realm? Could it be that it’s not an appropriate time for me to come here today?”</p>
 <p>“I suppose you have been stuck at your current level for quite a long time? If I am not mistaken, it is probably because you are unable to let go the control over your sect. Until now, you are still reluctant to hand it over to your descendants.” Qing Shui smiled and looked at the old man.</p>
 <p>The old man was stunned. After that, he looked at Qing Shui with a shocked expression. It had been a long time since he stopped having control over the Heaven Star Immortal Sect. Though from the outside, it might seem like he has handed over his position, but actually the current and even those past generations of Sect Lord have relied greatly on him. They would all listen to him and inquire him regarding every single matter they came across. In fact, he would also get involved in it. However, not many people from the outside were actually aware of it.</p>
 <p>Though Qing Shui was only going through it very briefly, the old man felt enlightened by his wisdom. A person would only gain something if they were willing to sacrifice another thing in return. There was a limit to the amount of things which a person could have. If they had more of something on one side, they would end up having less on the other. If they wanted to gain even more stuffs, they would have to throw away stuffs in return.</p>
 <p>This was also a kind of science. It was said that humans had limits on the amount of things that they could do. If they dedicated too much of their thought on one thing, they would end up neglecting the other one. It was just as simple as that.</p>
 <p>The reason why the old man was unable to break through his current cultivation was precisely because he was unable to let go. He worried about too many things which as a result, caused him a lot of distractions. Just as the saying went “younger generations will do all right on their own”. When it was time to let go, he must let go.</p>
 <p>At this moment, everything seemed to have become clear to the old man. Not only so, back then, he cared deeply about other people’s opinion. For example, if Sheng Jun failed to get married to Liancheng Clan, it would mean that she have ran away from her marriage, which was something disgraceful to the Heaven Star Immortal Sect. Or rather, it was his feeling which told him that many people would laugh at them and they would become a topic among the immortal sects.</p>
 <p>But now, the old man seemed to no longer care about these. This was just like the realm a person was at. Whether a person could be powerful or not, it was all depended on their state of mind. It was a fact. A person wasn’t powerful just because other people said so. A true expert wouldn’t care about the opinions of the weaklings. Showing too much concern about it would only reflect that the person wasn’t strong enough.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the old man’s mind went through a 360-degree change. Some of the things across his body were also going through changes. Just like when an old tree started germinating again. This was an alternate form of a rebirth.</p>
 <p>He didn’t know what devilish power this young man possessed to actually able to convince him about it. Before this, no one has ever said things like this to him, nor would they actually dare to do so.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, young man.”</p>
 <p>The old man suddenly said something silly which confused Sheng Jun and the other old men.</p>
 <p>Only Qing Shui knew the meaning behind his words. In fact, he was also shocked with the fact that the old man was enlightened by just listening to few words of his. Before this, it could be said that the old man’s mind has been blocked. Maybe it was because his juniors had yet to satisfy him which eventually led to this. He never thought that it was for this reason that he hasn’t been able to progress in his cultivations.</p>
