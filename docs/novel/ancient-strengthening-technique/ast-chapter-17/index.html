  <p><strong>Ancient Strengthening Technique: Chapter 17 – The Eldest Grandson of Qing Clan</strong></p>
  <p>Although he knew that the path he wanted to walk on was a long and arduous one, Qing Shui had the utmost confidence in himself.</p>
  <p>“15 years.. It has been 15 years since he was born in the Qing Village, maybe it was time to explore the world of Kyushu. Reaching the peak of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, Qing Shui could feel that the current might he was capable of exerting, was more than 10,000 jin just based on his bodily strength alone. In addition to that, with his hidden weapon techniques as well as the incredulous state of his body, he had no doubts that he was more than competent enough to protect himself!” Qing Shui deeply pondered. If he don’t experience the trials of the world, and face real danger through life and death situations, he would not be able to temper himself. The bottleneck of the peak of 3rd layer Ancient Strengthening Technique, would be only be more difficult to break through.</p>
  <p>“Mother should be back in a few days, I will say my goodbyes to her then,” Qing Shui decided, certain that his choice to explore the world outside the Qing Village was the right one.</p>
  <p>“Why do those people in the legends who transcended dimensions always have godly weapons or storage rings but I don’t even have a single thing (-_-). The main characters of those legends were always geniuses but here I am, a living example of one who had transcended dimensions, and yet I am only trash..” Despite the fact that Qing Shui had never acknowledged himself as a trash, he had no choice but to admit it now.</p>
  <p>“It is so inconvenient to carry things along without a storage ring, but at very least, I still possess the Ancient Strengthening Technique. Thanks to that, the toughness of my body has already reached an inconceivable state, capable of exerting a force of more than 10,000 jin. In addition, my strength is now roughly equivalent to the realm of Martial Warrior, 7th Grade, mwehehe. Through my observations for the past few years, I dare say that I could send most of the 3rd generation disciples sprawling on the ground with injuries that would take them 2 weeks to a month to recover with only a single punch!” Qing Shui self-assuredly stated.</p>
  <p>“In the face of absolute strength, all strategies are meaningless. Using strength to counter against the intricacies of techniques, and not to mention that the Solidary Rapid Fist most assuredly is a top tier martial technique, if I could execute the stances with my 10,000 jin level of force, attacking the weaknesses and acupoints of my opponents, I would undoubtedly leave them crippled with every move i make.” Qing Shui sneered.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was mumbling to himself after he departed from Qing Hu’s residence. He was extremely conceited as he thought of the many things he had learnt. However, Qing Shui had matured from before, and was able to control his ego.</p>
  <p>“I must not be arrogant and overestimate myself, the world is so large, the only way to move forward on the path of cultivation is constant improvement!” Qing Shui silently reminded himself.</p>
  <p>Attaining the peak of the 3rd layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique felt great, but being unable to breakthrough made Qing Shui feel helpless. In his heart, he longed for the might that he would be able to wield at the 4th layer. After all, the 4th layer represented the crossing into another realm. Entering the 4th layer meant crossing the threshold of the mid tier for the Ancient Strengthening Technique. By then his body and strength would probably be further refined by an insane margin. Qing Shui was also desirous of the skills he would unlock at the 4th layered heavens of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
  <p>“Ai, Qing Shui, it’s you!”. A voice called out his name just as he was in the middle of his self-reflection.</p>
  <p>Raising his head, Qing Shui realised that it was the eldest grandson of the Qing Clan, Qing Zi, who had called out to him. Qing Zi was very amiable by nature, although he rarely interacted with Qing Shui. However, each time they interacted, Qing Zi was quite friendly to him.</p>
  <p>Qing Zi was 25 this year, with a upright appearance, he was also extremely big sized, with the back of a tiger and the waist of a bear, giving the appearance of a dauntless behemoth..</p>
  <p>“Brother Qing Zi, how did you manage to find the time to come here today?” Qing Shui felt that it was a bit weird for Qing Zi to be out here today. After all for those disciples of the 3rd generation who had broken through to Martial Warrior, 6th Grade were all busily spending their time honing their martial techniques.</p>
  <p>“keke, can’t i just take a breather after making a breakthrough?” Qing Zi scratched his head and said somewhat straightforwardly. Looking at the comical actions of Qing Zi, Qing Shui felt the distance between them shortened. After all, their difference in age was not too big, there would still be topics of interest for discussion between them.</p>
  <p>“Ah, another breakthrough? Congratulations to brother Qing Zi!” Qing Shui happily congratulated Qing Zi. Qing Shui knew that if it was some other 3rd generation disciple making the same statement, there will bound to be hints of mockery hidden within, silently and sarcastically hinting to Qing Shui that he was nothing but trash. But Qing Zi was different. He was known for his forthrightness, he also found Qing Shui to be a straightforward person so they actually got along well together. If Qing Zi exists in Qing Shui’s previous world, he would be known as the fool that is easy to trick.</p>
  <p>Qing Zi smiled deprecatingly, as if the breakthrough occurred only through luck and not his own efforts..</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, you must work hard too! Let me know if you need any help, I would do my best to help you.” Qing Zi said simply. Just from these simple words, Qing Shui could feel the sincerity in Qing Zi’s heart.</p>
  <p>“I will, don’t worry about me, maybe in the future, I would be even more powerful than you, you won’t be upset right!” Qing Shui joked with Qing Zi. It sounded like a joke but at the same time, Qing Shui was partially serious about the question too.</p>
  <p>:I believe you would be able to achieve it. If you managed to surpass me, I will be happy for you. The stronger you are, the more happy I would be!” Qing Zi laughed as he patted Qing Shui on his shoulder.</p>
  <p>“Why? Why would you be happy if i’m stronger than you?” Qing Shui curiously asked. He knew that especially in the larger clans, the competition within the clan members was very intense. After all, the strongest disciple in that generation had the hope that they would become the clan head one day..</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, the tail of a phoenix cannot be comparable to the head of a chicken! One would rather be the head of a small clan as compared to being a retainer of a large clan.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui asking this was perfectly normal, Qing Zi, after his current breakthrough was the strongest within the Qing Clan’s 3rd generation disciples. At least, it appeared so on the surface. He was the one with the highest possibility to be the Clan Head! Furthermore, although Qing Zi was honest and straightforward by nature, he had the ability to see far and think ahead, and knowing the intelligence of Qing Luo, Qing Shui could deduce that it was just a matter of sooner or later, the position of the Clan Head would be given to Qing Zi.</p>
  <p>“Because simply.. we are one family, if one day, you managed to break into the Xian Tian Realm, you would be the pride of our family, how would i be upset by it? After all, the one breaking through to the Xian Tian realm is my very own cousin” Qing Zi said forthrightly.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui did not know if Qing Zi was saying this honestly or was it because he was an idiot. But still, he felt really happy to have Qing Zi as someone he could count on.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui and Qing Zi chatted as they walked alongside each other.</p>
  <p>“Brother Qing Zi, are you going outside the Qing Village?” Qing Shui asked nonchalantly.</p>
  <p>Qing Zi was not startled by Qing Shui’s question. He scratched his head and smiled, “The furthest I have ever been to was the Hundred Miles City, it was way more prosperous and developed than our Qing Village in this remote region.”</p>
  <p>“Brother Qing Zi, have you thought of leaving to see the world outside before? A world filled with colour and excitement, hopes and dreams of young men painting the skies with their radiance.” Qing Shui had always assiduously focus on his cultivation and had never stepped out of the Qing Village before. He had not even been to the Hundred Miles City; colours of pink tinged his cheeks as he thought ruefully. Although airplanes and cars don’t exist in this world, there were other means of transportation like horse riding. Travelling to Hundred Miles City would only need to take 2 hours by horseback.</p>
  <p>“I heard Grandpa state that the world outside is filled with danger, betrayal of your companions could come any moment, you can only trust yourself. If you had not achieved a certain level of strength, it would be better to stay in the Qing Clan, rather than going out to throw your life away.” Qing Zi stated sombrely, mistiness filling his eyes.</p>
  <p>From the misty look in Qing Zi eyes, it could be seen that he too, longed to make his standing in the world outside of Qing Village. Which youth was not filled with dreams? One day to become an expert, travelling through the continent with ease and possessing a name that would resound across generations!</p>
  <p>“There would definitely be a day, when we have a foothold in the world of cultivation, we would be like lords and kings looking down on this piece of land with disdain” Qing Shui resolutely said with hints of coldness flashing past his eyes.</p>
  <p>Qing Zi glanced at Qing Shui, shocked. He never thought that the trash Qing Shui would have the gall to utter such words.</p>
  <p>At this moment, Qing Shui gave Qing Zi an unfathomable sensation, emitting a deep and immeasurable feeling. Qing Zi actually felt inadequate in front of Qing Shui! Strange…..</p>

 <p>Qing Shui and Qing Zi chatted as they walked alongside each other.</p>
 <p>“Brother Qing Zi, are you going outside the Qing Village?” Qing Shui asked nonchalantly.</p>
 <p>Qing Zi was not startled by Qing Shui’s question. He scratched his head and smiled, “The furthest I have ever been to was the Hundred Miles City, it was way more prosperous and developed than our Qing Village in this remote region.”</p>
 <p>“Brother Qing Zi, have you thought of leaving to see the world outside before? A world filled with colour and excitement, hopes and dreams of young men painting the skies with their radiance.” Qing Shui had always assiduously focus on his cultivation and had never stepped out of the Qing Village before. He had not even been to the Hundred Miles City; colours of pink tinged his cheeks as he thought ruefully. Although airplanes and cars don’t exist in this world, there were other means of transportation like horse riding. Travelling to Hundred Miles City would only need to take 2 hours by horseback.</p>
 <p>“I heard Grandpa state that the world outside is filled with danger, betrayal of your companions could come any moment, you can only trust yourself. If you had not achieved a certain level of strength, it would be better to stay in the Qing Clan, rather than going out to throw your life away.” Qing Zi stated sombrely, mistiness filling his eyes.</p>
 <p>From the misty look in Qing Zi eyes, it could be seen that he too, longed to make his standing in the world outside of Qing Village. Which youth was not filled with dreams? One day to become an expert, travelling through the continent with ease and possessing a name that would resound across generations!</p>
 <p>“There would definitely be a day, when we have a foothold in the world of cultivation, we would be like lords and kings looking down on this piece of land with disdain” Qing Shui resolutely said with hints of coldness flashing past his eyes.</p>
 <p>Qing Zi glanced at Qing Shui, shocked. He never thought that the trash Qing Shui would have the gall to utter such words.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qing Shui gave Qing Zi an unfathomable sensation, emitting a deep and immeasurable feeling. Qing Zi actually felt inadequate in front of Qing Shui! Strange…..</p>
