 <p><strong>AST 1072 - Starts to KIll, Lion King's Imprint, Thunderous Beast's Two Consecutive Violet Lightning Strike</strong></p>
 <p><span>Roc's Might!</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui's powerful aura was sent out in all directions. The pressure in the area was strong to begin with and the three old men were more or less affected by the world's pressure. Therefore, his aura didn't affect the three old men in the least but it was still effective towards their demonic beasts.</span></p>
 <p><span>Dragon Transcends the Sky</span><span>!</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui's Big Dipper Sword pierced out fiercely. There was still a hundred meter distance but with a small leap, he managed to close in by several tens of meters. A silvery gray-colored flaming python dashed out from the tip of his sword and a soul-shaking cry rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span>Break!</span></p>
 <p><span>The primordial flames python was the thickness of a person's lower thigh. It shot out in a straight line. It was hard to tell if the twisted-looking head was that of a Jiao or python or the legendary dragon. It exuded an extremely sharp aura.</span></p>
 <p><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p><span>Pa pa...</span></p>
 <p><span>The Thunderous Beast's </span><span>Violet Thunder Chain Lightning</span><span> was very terrifying and although that ‘Old Fifth’ had done his best to avoid being struck in fatal spots, his paralyzed state heavily affected his movements. In a battle like this, a slight mistake could be fatal. He tried his hardest to avoid being hit in the vital spots but he was still struck on the shoulder and was sent flying backward.</span></p>
 <p><span>His right shoulder was crippled. The side effects of the numbing were still very great. Most importantly, his movements and senses had been seriously affected. Another thing was that when his body felt numb, his defenses, senses, and other aspects would all be affected.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui crippled one of Old Fifth's shoulder and his Primordial Flame Whip flashed repeatedly and whipped out toward the few demonic beasts. Most of these demonic beasts were very weak and could only attempt to fend off his whip but they quickly cried out terribly. One of them was even whipped until its head had exploded and it died. </span></p>
 <p><span>Violet Thunder Chain Lightning</span><span>!</span></p>
 <p><span>The Thunderous Beast's agile body escaped from being surrounded by the ‘Old Sixth’ and the few demonic beasts, landing consecutive Thunderbolts on the old man called Old Fifth. The tall old man with a strong build and the other demonic beasts were not far away. They were trying to protect Old Fifth, hoping that Old Sixth could join them and deal with the young man after he had dealt with the Thunderous Beast.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, what had caught them by surprise was that the demonic beast's speed was elusive like that of a ghost. Additionally, its resistance against damages was also very great. It was to the extent that when a demonic beast had attacked the Thunderous Beast, it was paralyzed and its head exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Thunderous Beast's speed was amazingly fast and the prowess of the </span><span>Violet Thunder Chain Lightning</span><span> was very powerful as well. Although Qing Shui didn't know for sure how powerful it was, there was still another terrifying reason, which was the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal's Spirit Gathering Lamp.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Spirit Gathering Lamp could increase the prowess of the Violet Lightning Strike, Thunderbolt, </span><span>Violet Thunder Chain Lightning</span><span>, and other attacks by one fold. This increase was considered extremely powerful and it seemed that it also provided a strong spirit energy resistance. </span></p>
 <p><span>When the three old men from the Lion King's Ridge were attacked by the Thunderous Beast, they had all activated their Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation. The tall and burly old man's Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation was a </span><span>Black Ember Lion</span><span> while the other two old men's were an </span><span>Ice Rat</span><span> and a </span><span>Giant Ox</span><span> respectively.</span></p>
 <p><span>Through Qing Shui's spiritual sense, he could tell that the tall and burly old man's </span><span>Black Ember Lion</span><span> was the best. However, that </span><span>Ice Rat</span><span> also had its amazing factors and it should be able to increase its resistance and speed by quite a lot.</span></p>
 <p><span>Mighty Dragon Elephant Stomp!</span></p>
 <p><span>The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant which had been close to Qing Shui all this time unleashed a stomp which covered a huge area, causing rocks to shatter and the whole world to turn into chaos. However, with the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's current damaging prowess, it wasn't sufficient to harm anyone. It would only provide some threat to the ten or more demonic beasts in the area.</span></p>
 <p><span>Dizziness!</span></p>
 <p><span>What surprised Qing Shui was that the Thunderous Beast had worked together and unleashed its </span><span>Violet Thunder Chain Lightning</span><span>, causing the dizzy </span><span>opponent</span><span>'s head to explode.</span></p>
 <p><span>As the Thunderous Beast had held down two out of the three old men, only Old Sixth was leading the demonic beasts to kill it. At this moment, Qing Shui calmed himself down and took out the Soulshake Bell.</span></p>
 <p><span>He needed to end this battle as soon as possible and also wanted to test out the Soulshake Bell. Therefore, he rapidly shook the Soulshake Bell in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span>The strange and piercing sound rang out strongly. One of the</span><span> Star Horn Devil</span><span>s tore apart the </span><span>Copper Ox King</span><span> next to it with its huge sharp horns. The entire scene was extremely chaotic.</span></p>
 <p><span>By then, Old Sixth was already very close to the Thunderous Beast. Suddenly, with a wave of the </span><span>truncheon-like </span><span>weapon in his hands, a huge staff-like shadow was formed.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Ice Rat shadow on Old Sixth also let out a squeaky sound which was extremely piercing. As it cried out, the huge staff-like shadow increasingly condensed itself and grew bigger.</span></p>
 <p><span>Heaven and Earth Club!</span></p>
 <p><span>Everything appeared to be very slow but was in fact happening at a very high speed. The Thunderous Beast kept on using its Thunderbolt and the violet light on its body was getting increasingly brighter.</span></p>
 <p><span>When Qing Shui saw the huge staff coming down on the Thunderous Beast, he wanted to use his primordial flame dragon to save it. However, it was then when he saw the tall and burly old man swinging his large saber.</span></p>
 <p><span>Lion King's Imprint</span><span>!</span></p>
 <p><span>A huge image of the black lion pounced toward Qing Shui with a domineering aura coming down. </span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui was just about to use his Divinity Protection when the Thunderous Beast sent him a message through his consciousness, telling him that it could handle the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span>Roar!</span></p>
 <p><span>The powerful aura from that huge staff-like shadow restricted the Thunderous Beast's movements and it was unable to dodge the attack. Therefore, it could only perform the </span><span>Lion King's Imprint</span><span> to receive the attack. Its </span><span>Lion King's Imprint</span> <span>and Violet Thunder Protection allowed it to reduce the damage received by half. However, despite this, the Thunderous Beast still let out a low roar. It spewed out blood from its huge mouth and was sent flying back.</span></p>
 <p><span>This moment, Qing Shui's heart ached. After all, this was a demonic beast he had brought up since it was young. Even in his previous life, if his pet which he had brought up since young was beaten up to the extent that it spewed out blood, he would also feel very pained and angry.</span></p>
 <p><span>Buddha's True Eyes!</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui was infuriated!</span></p>
 <p><span>The huge Buddha image appeared. He wanted to get rid of the tall and burly old man who was holding him back, and under the effect of Buddha's True Eyes, his primordial flame dragon wrapped around that huge </span><span>Lion King's Imprint</span><span>.</span></p>
 <p><span>Pfft pfft...</span></p>
 <p><span>Under the effect of the Buddha's True Eyes, Qing Shui was slightly stronger. This made him feel even more worried since he had no advantages at all in this fight. It seemed that he would still need to upgrade his own strength and treasures.</span></p>
 <p><span>Although Qing Shui was battling it out with that tall and burly old man, his gaze hadn't left the Thunderous Beast.</span></p>
 <p><span>The place where the Thunderous Beast had flown out to was filled with a brilliant violet light. Qing Shui felt more at ease since this was the Lightning Recovery.</span></p>
 <p><span>Lightning Recovery: The Thunderous Beast grew up in the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus, harnessing an extremely powerful self-recovery ability. Using Lightning Recovery, the Thunderous Beast can immediately heal 70% of its injuries on its body. Its natural restoration speed will also increase by tenfold for an hour. After two uses, the cooldown time will be two hours.</span></p>
 <p><span>Violet Lightning Strike!</span></p>
 <p><span>In mid-air, the Thunderous Beast dashed toward ‘OId Sixth’ with a flash and performed the Violet Lightning Strike. This was an attack which would definitely hit, the opponent would be unable to avoid, and there was a 100% chance of creating a numbing effect. It was just that time the numbing effect would last was related to the opponent's strength.</span></p>
 <p><span>‘Old Sixth’ avoided being struck in the head and was hit in the shoulder. At that moment, the Thunderous Beast's second Violet Lightning Strike struck out even faster than the first, targeting Old Sixth's head.</span></p>
 <p><span>Old Sixth's body was numbed by the first Violet Lightning Strike and as he watched, the second Violet Lightning Strike came at him with a speed that was faster than shooting stars. He could only watch in terror and was unable to move.</span></p>
 <p><span>Pfft!</span></p>
 <p><span>One's head was always the weakest spot, and as he was numbed, he couldn't even put up his defenses. This was how terrifying the Violet Lightning Strike was and how terrifying two consecutive usage of the Violet Lightning Strike was. This was also why Qing Shui had been so concerned earlier if it could use the Violet Lightning Strike for two consecutive times.</span></p>
 <p><span>Another reason was also because the Thunderous Beast had incessantly attacked ‘Old Sixth’ with its Thunderous Beast. Could it be that it was setting up a foundation for the Violet Lightning Strike...?</span></p>
 <p><span>Without his head, it would be useless even if there was any miraculous medicine which could bring one back to life. Moreover, even miraculous medicine was only effective toward people who had died for less than the time it took for an incense to burn. There were also certain conditions required for such a medicine to work, such as that the person couldn't be without his head or have their body crushed.</span></p>
 <p><span>With ‘Old Sixth’ being killed, the battle went into a short standstill. The remaining two old men from Lion King's Ridge were unable to accept this fact. It was because the whole thing had happened after the Thunderous Beast was dealt a heavy blow. However, in the blink of an eye, the seriously injured Thunderous Beast had instantly killed ‘Old Sixth’.</span></p>
 <p><span>The abrupt situation also caused Qing Shui to be quite astonished. Although he had thought that this could happen, he was still quite surprised since all these had been done by the Thunderous Beast. Right now, he finally knew that demonic beasts seemed to be even better at applying their battle techniques than humans. Qing Shui finally got to see this with his own eyes today.</span></p>
 <p><span>Violet Thunder Chain Lightning!</span></p>
 <p><span>The Thunderous Beast killed a demonic beast with the </span><span>Violet Thunder Chain Lightning</span><span>. Two of them escaped. After the effect of the Soulshake Bell from earlier, there were only three out of the over ten demonic beasts left.</span></p>
 <p><span>One of Old Fifth's arms were crippled and it was impossible to recover from such a serious injury within a short amount of time. The three old men from the Lion King's Ridge had lost half their battle prowess and they lost an even more considerable number of their tamed beasts. Only three relatively stronger demonic beasts were left, but they didn't pose too much of a threat. After all, they weren't powerful existences like the </span><span>Six-Headed Windfire Wolf</span><span> and the Seven-Headed Crystal Beast. </span></p>
 <p><span>"Who are you? Why are you attacking members of the Lion King's Ridge? Aren't you afraid that Lion King's Ridge would look for you to seek revenge?" The tall and burly old man looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p><span>"One is already dead and another is injured. If I were to say that we should stop here and make peace, do you think it's possible?" Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p><span>He didn't have any good impression of the Lion King's Ridge. While one would like the things the people he loved did, the same went for hatred. Ever since Qing Shui learned about the matter between Yiye Jiange and Lion King's Ridge, he had started to bear hatred toward this great sect that he had never met before.</span></p>
 <p><span>"What if I say it's possible?"</span></p>
 <p><span>After the tall and burly man said this, he suddenly moved and his Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation, the </span><span>Black Ember Lion</span><span> let out a high-pitched cry toward Qing Shui. Its cry was as if it was real. At the same time, the old man swung about his large saber, quickly forming a </span><span>Lion King's Imprint</span><span>. After completing the series of actions, the old man's pitch black saber slashed toward Qing Shui. The old man was best with his saber. It was just that ordinary people would tend to have weaker spirit energy and he had previously felt that it would be easier to get rid of Qing Shui using spirit energy. He now knew how wrong he was.</span></p>
 <p><span>Looking at the old man's ‘slyness’, Qing Shui broke into a smile of disdain. The tip of his Big Dipper Sword split into two and two primordial flame dragons that were as thick as an adult's arm dashed out. Wherever they passed by, the air would be as if there was an explosion.</span></p>
 <p><span>After the Qing Shui and the tall burly old man engaged in battle, the Thunderous Beast pounced toward the ‘Old Fifth’ who was at the back. Its speed was so fast that it was indescribable and continued to attack with its Thunderbolt incessantly once again.</span></p>
 <p><span>When the tall and burly old man saw the Thunderous Beast pouncing toward ‘Old Fifth’, he was shocked and wanted to head back. However, how could Qing Shui let him have his way?</span></p>
 <p><span>Buddha's True Eyes!</span></p>
