 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elderly told Qing Shui that in order to consume the Extreme Yang Righteous Pill, he would need a medicine with strong spiritual Qi to act as an initiator. This would make it easier for it to be absorbed. Another thing was that the time needed to refine the medicinal properties would also be slightly longer. It'd be best to find a quiet place and get someone else to be on guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man had wanted to help and guard Qing Shui. However, upon knowing that the time taken would be very long, he thanked and rejected the old man's kind intentions. He told the old man that he had his own methods. Qing Hanye also said that if he needed someone to help stand guard, she could help him as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, and there was nothing that was more suitable than it. Moreover, he had the best item with spiritual Qi to be the medicinal initiator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spring of Life!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui slowly calmed his mind down in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. During this period of time, he had gotten a little stronger. Although it didn't seem to be much, it was quite significant to Qing Shui. His physical strength had increased from 80,000 Suns to 100,000 Suns.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This increment wouldn't be considered much for other Divinities, but Qing Shui had many martial techniques. Therefore, this increment was considered to be magnificent. Most important, the increment had come in recent times and prior to that, he hadn't made any progress for very long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The time Qing Shui had in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal removed all of his concerns. He was also able to calm down easily when there was no one who could come and disturb him. At the thought of the Watermoon Cavern, Qing Shui would become agitated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn't a person who would admit his loss easily. Not only would a man have to be upright and hold his head high, he must also have his own stand and beliefs. He had his share of reverse scales that mustn't be touched and he wouldn't back off even if it was at the expense of his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Qing Hanye could be considered Qing Shui's woman. It wasn't as if a woman would belong to someone if she had given her body to them. If that was the case, those women who worked in brothels would belong to many people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took out a cup of Spring of Life and then opened the small rustic box slowly. Without any hesitation, he swallowed it together with the golden Qi. He then finally drank the Spring of Life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sitting down cross-legged, Qing Shui faced the Eastern direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very soon, the golden Qi surrounded Qing Shui. It was very faint but appeared to be very sacred, making him just like a golden Buddha statue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Qing Shui's body was going through tremendous changes. An extremely violent power that held the strength to destroy everything entered his body. It seemed like the power was creating new meridian channels in his body, and felt as if sharp swords had brushed by or rockets had flown through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an extremely painful experience but it was something that Qing Shui could put up with. No matter how damaging the physical pain was, it would eventually be over. It was unlike mental anguish, which was something which would not be removed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Qing Shui was given a choice, he would rather choose physical pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He thought of Qing Hanye and wondered how she had felt when she took the Extreme Yin Righteous Pill. Did she feel the same amount of pain back then? However, the great pain that he felt already forced him to stop these thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The seven-colored pellet in his Dantian spun rapidly and a gush of Nature Energy continued to soar. Even the shiny paragon vessel was exuding a brilliant golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's eyes opened abruptly as the golden light on his body grew increasingly brighter. A circle of aura that could be seen by the naked eye brushed past and those artificial mountains and rocks instantly turned into dust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thankfully, he was in a vacant piece of land in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. If he was around the medicinal herbs, he would have incurred huge losses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pa!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sound that sounded like bones shattering rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was actually the sounds of broken bones. That terrifying power had broken two of Qing Shui's rib bones and made him frown. This power was indeed terrifying. So terrifying that he felt that it was a little hard to bear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Opportunities and risks co-existed. Furthermore, such a sacred heavenly and earthly treasure could only be used by people who were worthy of them. When consuming items like these, there would be a certain amount of risks involved. One might even lose their life just like that if they weren't careful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Qing Shui had the Nine Yang Golden Body, but he hadn't successfully mastered the Nine Yang Dragon Soul. Despite so, his confinement skill was still very powerful, to the extent that they could be described as being extraordinary. Even with that, his bones were still broke from the impact. If it was someone else, this dominating power would have definitely turned them into meat paste very easily, or cause them to disappear completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dantian's seven-colored pellet continued to spin increasingly faster. The glow it exuded also grew intense by the minute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pfft!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A deep and stifled sound rang out and Qing Shui used his Inner Sight to check out the seven-colored pellet in his Dantian. It hadn't become bigger, but instead, shrunk to become like a bead the size of a date. The seven-colored glow was extremely brilliant and there was an indescribable substantial feeling to it. It was as if it was the most treasured pearl in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could clearly sense that the power it exuded was getting more and more intense. At almost the same time, the paragon vessel in his Dantian underwent some minor and strange changes. Only Qing Shui knew about this feeling. The paragon vessel's appearance became clearer, just like how a feeble young man had now gained muscles and looked much stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, this was just an analogy, a feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The power in his body had reached a pinnacle and was starting to slowly come down. It had dashed through three nameless meridian channels, causing Qing Shui's abilities to become a lot stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A human body had countless meridian channels. What currently known to humans was only a small portion of it. The entire system could be described as a vast sea. As people said, the human body was like a small universe and this analogy wasn't exaggerating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time everything calmed down, nine days had already passed. This didn’t seem like a long time, but nine was considered an extreme end in numbers and to a certain degree, it was considered to be the greatest, even when compared to taking several tens of days.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was an indescribable mystical sense to it, and was also a rule in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Qing Shui's bones had broken, his strong recuperative abilities had healed them. It was only that he noticed he was now covered in tainted blood and something that looked like gray fatty substance. The stench was piercing and unbearable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took off his clothes and with a wave of his hand, destroyed them. They had completely disappeared in the air. After washing up and changing his clothes did Qing Shui then have the time to sense his current body's condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sensing his physical strength made Qing Shui felt a lot happier. His physical strength had now reached 150,000 Suns, having increased by 50,000 Suns. It wasn't overrated for the Extreme Yang Righteous Pill to have such powers. Moving his body and intent slightly, his Dantian moved. Qing Shui was not stunned, but instead, filled with surprise.</span></p>

For the paragon vessel, it changed from 60 folds to 70 folds.</span></p>

The seven-colored pellet and the paragon vessel hadn't gone through any changes for very long so he hadn't expected to experience such a great improvement this time around.</span></p>

However, his spirits were very high. He got up and headed out to make some food. Only after gulping down his meal that he felt a lot better.</span></p>

He was afraid that he would disturb Yiye Jiange. The child wouldn't wake up so easily.</span></p>

Everything was beautiful, extremely beautiful under the moonlight.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even a cultivator, a powerful one, would need some time to recover. Qing Shui was a miraculous physician and there weren't many problems with Yiye Jiange's body. However, he still hoped that more time had passed before they went back to having sex.</span></p>

Her transcendence appearance now had a hint of additional motherly glow. Her mature body exuded a lethal attraction.</span></p>

Yiye Jiange was unsure of Qing Shui's abilities, but she could sense that there had been some changes.</span></p>

He also told her about the Watermoon Cavern. At first, he had planned on keeping this from her, but now that his strength had doubled, he managed to keep his calm.</span></p>

In the ocean domain within one million li, it's considered one of the strongest influences. However, we aren't sure how strong they are exactly." Yiye Jiange was a little worried.</span></p>

I've been through so much and traveled so far. Your man isn't someone who could be defeated so easily." Qing Shui tried to ease the tension in the atmosphere.</span></p>

If there's anything, please discuss it with senior. After all, she is older and can see through things better than we can." Seeing that Qing Shui didn't really seem to care about this, she reminded him.</span></p>

He said seriously, "Don't worry. I can't bear to leave you guys behind."</span></p>

It was because it was only now that he had discovered that he had already cultivated the Dragon Claw Crushing Gold Chant to a considerable level of proficiency. He was only a small step away from reaching the small success stage and could be said to already have one foot in that level.</span></p>
