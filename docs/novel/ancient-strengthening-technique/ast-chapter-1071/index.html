 <p><strong>AST 1071 - Three Lion King’s Ridge’s Elders, Thunderous Beast’s Formidable Control Ability</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui and the Thunderous Beast interacted to find out if it was possible to retrieve the Thunderstones. Regrettably, the center area could not be entered and the Thunderstones on the perimeter could not be broken. There was no way of retrieving them.</p>
 <p>Thinking back to the Violet Lightning Strike that could be used twice within 24 hours, Qing Shui decided to let Thunderous Beast use it. He wanted to know if it could be used consecutively in quick succession or if it was one use every 12 hours.</p>
 <p>This was simple. Qing Shui had Thunderous Beast cast two consecutive Violet Lightning Strikes. It was a success. Even the naked eye could see the violet lightning streak of the Violet Lightning Strike. It was rather brilliant. Compared to before, it was more clear and shocking.</p>
 <p>This made Qing Shui felt reassured. Knowing that it could use Violet Lightning Strike twice consecutively was much stronger than the one-use from before. With Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, the 24-hour limit would only be a very short time. Thus, having only one-use every 12 hours was not as strong in comparison.</p>
 <p>After using it twice, Qing Shui had Thunderous Beast use it once more and discovered that it could no longer be used. If he had wanted Thunderous Beast to use it again, he would have to wait another 24 hours. He had it use Thunderbolt several times afterwardsd. Qing Shui noticed that Thunderbolt was much stronger than before.</p>
 <p>Before they had enough time to test Violet Lightning Armor and Violet Thunder Chain Lightning, they felt a pulse of Qi being emitted from their backside. They turned and looked behind them. His spiritual sense was strong.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was satisfied, though he did not say anything while looking at the distance behind him, a silhouette appeared. He was surprised but not by much. 400,000 miles in six hours was not slow.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui retrieved Thunderous Beast and immediately used Nine Palace Steps to disappear from his original location. He hid himself behind a nearby boulder. He was curious to find out who could rush over in such a short amount of time. He was in a good mood, so he decided to find out what those people wanted to do here.</p>
 <p>There were three elders. Taking a quick glance, Qing Shui was left in shock.</p>
 <p>Lion King’s Ridge!</p>
 <p>These three belonged to Lion King’s Ridge. Their mount was the Silver-winged Lightning Eagle; it was a mutated beast. The beast’s size was not large at roughly 30 meters. Their battle ability was not strong either. Their strength was its excellent flying capabilities with high speed and endurance.</p>
 <p>Silver-winged Lightning Eagle was not a battle beast. They could not compete in strength with other beasts but there were very few that could catch up to it in terms of speed. That was the balancing factor.</p>
 <p>Silver-winged Lightning Eagle was Lion King’s Ridge’s iconic flying mount. Their members were all beast tamers; thus, they had the ability to tame one Silver-winged Lightning Eagle as a mount and other beasts as battle beasts.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had thought earlier that members of Lion King’s Ridge would arrive together. Now he realized that they were probably scattered about. At least these three elders had separated themselves from the group. Were they tempting Qing Shui to attack?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that something was wrong about attacking the underlings of Lion King’s Ridge on the first day of entering the Ancient Ruins. In addition, these three elders’ appearance could mean that there were more coming.</p>
 <p>“What formidable Violet Lightning! Old Fifth, Old Sixth, look at the Thunderstones. If we could retrieve those, our trip would not be in vain.” The elder in the middle said hopefully while staring at Thunder Mountain. His voice was loud and his body was tall and sturdy. He had wide nose, large mouth and thick brow. His eyes were round and close together. His hair was completely black. Though there was not a shred of him resembling an elder, with his imposing manner, Qing Shui knew for sure that he was an elder.</p>
 <p>“Fourth elder brother, we can only look at it. I believe nobody arriving this time will be able to retrieve the Thunderstones,” the taller elder to the left said with some pity.</p>
 <p>This elder was taller but not as sturdy as the elder in the middle. This elder emitted a vigor that was swift and fierce like a sword. His cold and piercing eyes left a strong impression in people’s minds.</p>
 <p>“That’s right Old Fifth, when we first entered, do you remember that little girl?” The last short elder spoke. He was around the same status as the other two.</p>
 <p>“Which ones?”</p>
 <p>“The girl with the Seven-headed Crystal Beast,” Old Sixth said while looking at the other two.</p>
 <p>After hearing the words from those three, Qing Shui felt an impulse from within. It was fortunate that he decided not to leave. He had wanted to attack at a later date but it looked as though he would have to take their heads today.</p>
 <p>“Oh, now that you mention it I think I have a recollection. And what of it? Did you want to steal the Seven-headed Crystal Beast?” The tall and sturdy elder questioned.</p>
 <p>“I have a low quality Sacred Beast Pill in my possession. If we can subdue them and the Seven-headed Crystal Beast than we can snatch it. This type of Spiritual Beast of Heaven and Earth is a top-tier existence in Lion King’s Ridge,” Old Sixth said as he got more excited.</p>
 <p>If the beast was tamed they would have to kill the master. Even if they did kill the master, to tame a beast that had been tamed once, was several times more difficult. If the person that wanted to tame that beast was the one who killed the original master, then the possibility to tame the beast was at the absolute lowest.</p>
 <p>“Oh, it would be possible with the Sacred Beast Pill. But to subdue the Seven-headed Crystal Beast here would be quite difficult,” Old Fifth said frowning.</p>
 <p>“If the opposition was in possession of the Seven-headed Crystal Beast, their strength would not be weak. The three of us would be barely enough to match.”</p>
 <p>“That little girl was not strong, she was able to tame the Seven-headed Crystal Beast because of some other reason. Mn, fourth elder brother, I suddenly remember that little girl resembles someone. Even though she was wearing a veil, the charm, grace and style did not change…”</p>
 <p>“Mn, once you mention that, I also thought of it. It was that person that the young master wanted to engage. The engagement that was a troublesome uproar.”</p>
 <p>“The Ridge Master does not allow us to speak of this matter. It has already been so many years. No matter right or wrong, we need to solve the problem at the beginning. The fact that the pair of Yiye clan’s youngster had escaped was the truth. Looks like we will have to report this to the eldest brother.” The furrows in Old Fourth’s forehead deepened as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Fourth elder brother should not be worried, as long as Yiye clan does not produce an offspring with the Heart of Seven Orifices, they will have no hope. The boy and girl that had escaped did not bear the Heart of Seven Orifices. Even if they tamed a Seven-headed Crystal Beast this would not change the result. However, the root of the problem could still occur. Even though the boy and girl that escaped did not possess the Heart of Seven Orifices, if they have their own offspring, their younger generation could possess the Heart of Seven Orifices. After several years, they would be the biggest threat to Lion King’s Ridge.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had a worried expression on his face but internally he wanted to laugh. They were unlucky. Although Yiye Jiange and Yiye Tian were not possessors of the Heart of Seven Orifices, the daughter of Yiye Tian had the Heart of Seven Orifices. Further, she had already matured into an adult. The formidable Heart of Seven Orifices will soon blossom the brightest radiance.</p>
 <p>Currently, Qing Shui could not allow these three to report to the higher-ups of Lion King’s Ridge. Due to the Heart of Seven Orifices, Lion King’s Ridge had been in pursuit of members of the Yiye clan that had escaped.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui held a 10,000 year Coldsteel Bead, that had been soaked in poison, in his hand. To deal with the three in front of him, Qing Shui did not need to resort to fair and honest methods. Especially when they were formidable Beast Tamers.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wanted to test the formidability of the Thunderous Beast. He summoned it from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Even though it had used Violet Lightning Strike twice, the passage of time within Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was different. A day within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was less than 15 minutes in the real word. Thus, he was not worried about Thunderous Beast being able to use Violet Lightning Strike again.</p>
 <p>Ancient Ruin was not bound by the rules of heaven and earth. This made Qing Shui a bit reactive. Qing Shui could not correctly perceive the three elder’s actual strengths. He could guess that they were not below himself, could even be stronger than him. However, having a high strength did not equate to high lethality. Strength did not determine everything. Winning and losing was also determined by method and technique.</p>
 <p>Thunderous Beast!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had no need of hiding his strength. He immediately summoned the Thunderous Beast in front of them. At the same time, Thunderous Beast roared into the sky. It was as though an explosion happened in the sky.</p>
 <p>A ten-meter large net-like violet lightning flew towards the three. The speed was so fast, it disappeared in the blink of an eye. The violet light shone brightly, the beating violet electric current could frighten anyone.</p>
 <p>Thunderbolt!</p>
 <p>Thunderbolt was casted in an instant. The bombardment struck the left side of the tall elder. Perhaps the opposition was still in a shocked state, since they were startled by being hit with Thunderbolt. Or perhaps it was the formidability of Thunderous Beast’s current strength.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s swept the Big Dipper Sword in his right hand.</p>
 <p>Sixth Wave Great Golden Buddha Palm!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not save any strength. It was for the best if he could eliminate them in one hit. Thus, at the instant that he had rushed out, Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation had been used.</p>
 <p>Sixth Wave Great Golden Buddha Palm mainly sealed the Elder’s backdoor.</p>
 <p>All of this occurred within an instant. The moment the tall and sturdy elder dodged and then received Qing Shui’s Sixth Wave Great Golden Buddha Palm, Qing Shui fired the 10,000 year Coldsteel Bead that had soaked in poison like a meteor towards the elder. It had left a radiant black streak in the air.</p>
 <p>Thunderbolt, Thunderbolt…</p>
 <p>At this time, Thunderous Beast fired five Thunderbolts consecutively. Qing Shui could see the tall elder with a face of shock. Violet Lightning Strike had already landed, though it did not hit anyone directly, the tall elder right shoulder had taken a hit. All of a sudden, the right side of his body went numb.</p>
 <p>Old Sixth was not affected but instead rapidly rush towards the Thunderous Beast. Qing Shui was worried at first but once he thought of Thunderous Beast’s Thunder Flash passive ability, he was reassured.</p>
 <p>There were not many that could match Thunderous Beast’s speed right now, thus Qing Shui was not worried.</p>
 <p>Roar...</p>
 <p>Suddenly, several giant beasts appeared beside Old Sixth. Qing Shui did not have enough time to see what beasts they were because he felt fluctuations of spirit energy surrounding him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not dare to be careless. Though he was nervous, he quickly summoned Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demons!</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>A faint golden ring of light surrounded them. Qing Shui’s Emperor’s Qi also pressed towards them. Around ten targets were affected. The sudden change in the battle left the three elders of Lion King’s Ridge startled. After all they had lost 30% of their original strength. It would be weird if they were not startled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took this opportunity to glance over at Thunderous Beast. He found it calmly mixed within the others. Its body was covered in a violet light. Thunderbolts continuously fell upon the surrounding beasts and the three elders.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wanted to laugh. The current Thunderous Beast was frightening. It was definitely the king of control type beasts. Though it looked busy trying to control several beasts and two strong elders, he knew that Thunderous Beast would get used to it quickly. This was its first experience in this type of battle.</p>
