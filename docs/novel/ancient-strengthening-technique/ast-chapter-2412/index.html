 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui could tell that there wasn't any strength to this hit and that she did this instinctively. Thus, he didn't move and allowed her to smack his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn't painful. It wasn't painful at all.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Qing Shui maintained his composure and took her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Let go!" Tantai Lingyan tried to draw back her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I won't!" Qing Shui said outright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tantai Lingyan landed a palm on Qing Shui's chest. This strike was unlike before; she had used a lot of strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Let go!" Tantai Lingyan continued saying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I won't!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only until blood flowed out from the corners of Qing Shui's lips that Tantai Lingyan stopped. She saw that Qing Shui was still smiling, and her mind was in a mess. Was this guy really hers in the past? She couldn't remember it. However, what she believed was that even though a person could lie, their gaze wouldn't. Moreover, she also had a feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A woman's intuition!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I don't remember you, so why are you doing this? I'm no longer the person whom I was in the past. I can only be considered to be another person now. You don't have to do this." Tantai Lingyan sighed and looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"To me, you've never changed, not at all. In the past, you told me that you didn't wish to become the Demon King. If there comes a day when you’re unable to suppress the Demon King's Blood, you told me to finish you off," Qing Shui said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Will you kill me?" asked Tantai Lingyan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I won't. You promised that you were going to bear a bunch of kids for me," Qing Shui said very seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time around, Tantai Lingyan didn't have the urge to hit him; she was even in a slight daze. She was lonely, very lonely. But what could she do? This was her mission. However, To this guy who had been her man in the past—the one whom she had given herself to—the one she had almost killed with her sword, she didn’t know what her feeling was. Earlier on, he hadn’t retaliated even though she had been hitting him like that. He could put down all of his guard before her...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, this person was a Battle God, a mortal enemy of her people. How many people could actually go to such an extent? If it wasn't that he loved her more than he loved himself, how was he able to do this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't feel pressured. In the future, I'll come to look for you when I miss you. If you don't come out, I'll shout." Qing Shui chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tantai Lingyan looked at Qing Shui's slightly pale countenance and wiped off the blood on the corners of his lips. This action scared even herself; Qing Shui was stunned as well. He looked at the slightly dazed Tantai Lingyan. "This is your instinctive action. Do you believe that you had been my wife now?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I do. But even now, I don't remember you," said Tantai Lingyan seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's because this is your mission. We're on opposing sides. It's because you won't be able to complete your current mission if you don't forget about me," Qing Shui sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tantai Lingyan seemed to be struck by realization as well. She looked at the hand that Qing Shui was holding tightly on to, and realized that she didn't actually detest this feeling that much. Moreover, she also realized that this man had once again left his shadow in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You can let go now, right? I'm going back," Tantai Lingyan said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Lingyan, I really wish that you can return to how you were in the past. I want to give you happiness. We were almost able to realize that, but I hadn't expected things to turn out this way." Qing Shui slowly let go of her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Take care. We'll still meet each other in the future. Oh right, I'm going to leave. The next time you come, you won't be able to see me," Tantai Lingyan said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're going to the Upper Three Regions? Mmm, you've attained a breakthrough. However, you must still be very careful after reaching that place."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Mmm, thank you!" Tantai Lingyan looked at Qing Shui then turned to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that beautiful figure slowly disappearing from his sight, Qing Shui felt very gloomy. She was a very precious existence to him, and he wasn't able to grasp her. He felt very upset.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui turned his head and saw the two ladies that had stood there without him knowing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Putting away his gloomy feelings, he broke into a smile and walked over, picking up their hands. "Why? Are you guys worried that I'll hook up with other women outside?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If you aren't happy, you don't have to put up such a forced smile. We aren't outsiders," said Shen Huang while stroking Qing Shui's face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's true. The two of you are both mine, and I'm able to enter into you ladies." Qing Shui said this very clearly, with more emphasis on the last part.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You rascal. We're trying to console you, but you're still in the mood to spout rubbish." Beihuang Fan laughed. When it was just the three of them, they were very casual with each other. Moreover, they had been married for very long; thus, something like this was common.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Come on, let's head back."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Four days later, Qing Shui had almost forgotten about the Nine Continents Martial Association's matters. He really had thought that Wu Dalang would not tell his family about it. But today, a big group of people from the Nine Continents Martial Association appeared outside his manor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were a lot of them—over a thousand—and they surrounded the entrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The few people in the lead were all young men. At least, they appeared very young. When Qing Shui came out, he saw a familiar face—Wu Dalang. Wu Dalang's injuries had gotten a lot better, but there was no way he could recover his teeth. Even if there were medicinal pills that could allow his teeth to grow back, it would still take time. Four to five days weren't sufficient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wu Dalang, it seems that you've forgotten what I told you last time." Qing Shui and the others had come out. After all, it was too noisy outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I... I didn't actually want to come..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Dalang, you're a member of our Wu Clan. Don't be bringing us shame. Your weakness is a humiliation for us. Are you still a member of our Wu Clan? The reason we're here today is because we're here to stand up for you," said a young man coldly, interrupting Wu Dalang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Dalang was stumped and he carefully said, "Uncle, he'll kill me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young man was very handsome. He looked at Wu Dalang and said, "Since Uncle is going to stand up for you, what's there to worry about? If you're a man, you need to have a stronger will."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These men who were in the lead appeared very young, but Qing Shui knew that they were slightly older than him. They were very strong. After all, this was the Nine Continents Martial Association, and it would be surprising if there weren't any young experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hmm, you've come to my place on several occasions to create trouble. If I don't teach you a lesson, you won't learn. It'll also make me seem like I'm a pushover," said Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another young man looked at the few ladies behind Qing Shui with great interest, not even concealing the excitement in his gaze. Qing Shui understood it now. It might be true that they were here to stand up for Wu Dalang and get back the Wu Clan's honor. However, the greater reason was still for the few ladies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You guys should be Battle Gods, right? It's a pity that you aren't from the Nine Continents Divine Palace. Even if you were, what would it matter? We're also from the Nine Continents Martial Association. Although it's just a branch, we're from the real Nine Continents Martial Association. You guys are nothing to us!" the young man said confidently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is the Forsaken Heaven City. In the Forsaken Heaven Region, I'm not afraid of any forces." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Do you really think that you're invincible just because you've reached the maximum strength allowed here? Which person who is able to dominate over an area here doesn't have some unique means? Our Wu Clan has never thought of making enemies out of others. You were the one who slapped us in the face, and we need to return the favor," the young man said calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh? So you're saying that we were the ones in the wrong first?" asked Qing Shui.</span></p>
