 <p><strong>AST 642 Life Is Filled With Too Much Dissatisfactions And Helplessness</strong></p>
 <p>This had granted her a brief moment of clarity.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, just please kill me. I’m not that kind of woman….”</p>
 <p>Two streams of crystal clear tears cascaded down Lady Duanmu’s face. She had neither thought of remarrying anyone else nor look for another ever since that man passed away. She had overcome the toughest of times. Any man who plotted against her would be punished back then. To think that she’d be stuck in such a situation now…</p>
 <p>This was karma….</p>
 <p>“Madam, can you promise me that you’ll live no matter what happens? Can you promise me you won’t take your own life? Think about your daughter, do you think you’re capable of abandoning her?”</p>
 <p>“My daughter. Yes, I still have a daughter. She already is pitiful enough, if I were to leave her again…” A slightly strange and pained look flashed across Lady Duanmu’s face.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had only brought this up this early because he was worried she wouldn’t cooperate with the treatment. She didn’t want Qing Shui to look at her body, but he didn’t expect something like this to happen. The Stone Beauty could be considered a treasure in the World of the Nine Continents. It was yearned by many, but people were afraid of being judged by others. Furthermore, this ‘Stone Beauty’ was composed of the White Milky Jade essence.</p>
 <p>The body would receive great benefits by relaxing on this bed. However, this item was loved by evil mediators of those Duo Cultivation Techniques, so most people didn’t dare to say that this was a treasure.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, we shouldn’t do this….” Yu Ruyan was a little panicked and pained.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rinsed Yu Ruyan’s wound with the White Milky Jade. Qing Shui was utterly perplexed as he watched the woman who currently seemed very agonized and conflicted.</p>
 <p>He could still contain the lust in his body, but Yu Ruyan on the other hand was already enduring it agonizingly. Qing Shui pulled out the Gold Needles again and inserted them into her Lingtai acupoint.</p>
 <p>“Madam, you’re giving yourself too much emotional pressure. Your heart already belongs to someone. You’re only doing this because you’re forced by circumstances. Besides, it wouldn’t make much of a difference even if you and I were to take things another step further. The most important thing is how you look at it. Your husband has passed away, if I were him, I’d be very happy that you’re able to do this much for him. If he really loved you, he would’ve definitely wished you to continue living well and happy.” Qing Shui was also currently at a loss.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan went silent. Her emotions were flying all over the place because she knew she couldn’t maintain herself like this for much longer. Her face was already red and her body was flushed crimson. Just as he said, she had become like this already….</p>
 <p>Then she suddenly remembered about her daughter. She could tell that her daughter was at least a little fond of Qing Shui, but Qing Shui didn’t seem to be very interested in her.</p>
 <p>Although her daughter possessed an exceptionally beautiful face, her personality was simply too cold. No man would like a type of girl who would freeze someone to death. She couldn’t help but to sigh the more she thought about it. How could things turn out like this?</p>
 <p>She really wanted to just die, but she simply couldn’t leave her daughter alone. Her friends had been persuading her to find another man for a long time. She was still young and she still had a lot of time ahead of her, even her daughter told her the same thing previously. She had never objected it, but then she had never really considered about it either. All this time and this man standing before her was considerably younger than her.</p>
 <p>To a cultivator, the age gap between Yu Ruyan and Qing Shui could hardly amount to anything, they had a very long lifespan after all. That would also mean that their prime time was also very long. The only thing standing between them was the existence of Duanmu Lingshuang.</p>
 <p>The two of them were still tightly embraced together. To go a step further or to stop here no longer made much difference. Her husband was no longer here and today’s incident hardly had anything to do with morality.</p>
 <p>“Unexpected things happen. The things that restrict and coerce you are your own notion and the ‘shackles you chained yourself with’,” Yu Ruyan sighed inwardly.</p>
 <p>The flame of lust that was burning in her had tinted her entire body pink. If it wasn’t for the cooling sensation coming from the needle that Qing Shui had inserted on her back, she would have lost herself a long ago….</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan watched Qing Shui. He was a rational man who dared to act and bear the responsibility. Even at this moment he was still thinking hard and trying to come up with alternative solutions.</p>
 <p>And that was the Stone Beauty. Any woman who laid on it would not be able to withstand that mystical effect, even if it were a sealed woman*.</p>
 <p>[TL Note: A woman whose vagina is blocked due to birth defect.]</p>
 <p>That burning delicate body lit up the flame in the deepest part of Qing Shui. He knew that he was already under a strong influence, but he was relying on Nature Energy to just barely resist it. After swallowing a Pure Jade Pellet with Yu Ruyan just now, he had consumed another Five Dragon Pellet. Unfortunately it was ineffective. This ‘Stone Beauty’ from legends was indeed overbearing. The only way to dispel it was to have sex.</p>
 <p>She was about the same age as Zhu Qing, the only difference between them was that one was a mother. For a dignified woman like her, things would be very difficult even if Qing Shui wanted to openly court her. Perhaps it wouldn’t be much of an issue when he becomes powerful in the future. For now, Lady Duanmu couldn’t bring herself to do it.</p>
 <p>Soon enough, Qing Shui’s Gold Needle couldn’t control the flames in Lady Duanmu’s body any longer. Qing Shui couldn’t let her die, so he had no choice but to pull out the Gold Needle on her back.</p>
 <p>He no longer tried to suppress the flame burning within him either. The two of them slowly fell back onto the stone bed. Qing Shui’s clothes were also quickly shed. The mood right now, was perfect.</p>
 <p>Two bare naked bodies wrapped around each other. Their movements were controlled by the most primitive energy within their body, melding perfectly into each other before climaxing in a series of pleasing moans&nbsp;of satisfaction.</p>
 <p>….</p>
 <p>Qing Shui opened his eyes as if he had just woken up from a dream when Yu Ruyan’s body glowed white. The two of them were currently joined together in the most intimate position.</p>
 <p>He looked at those divinely beautiful breasts which were just inches away from him, forcibly controlling his urges to lick them again. A silver necklace still hung around her delicate neck, but the pendant on it was lost. He was guessing that it must have vanished or dropped when she was resisting Old Man Ba’s final attack.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan opened her eyes too, but she immediately closed them since she was so shy. He was roused awake by her own breakthrough. Before that, everything had seemed just like a wonderful dream.</p>
 <p>Lady Duanmu, who was at peak Grade Eight Martial Saint, had now attained Grade Nine Martial Saint. Unexpectedly, she wasn’t as pleasantly surprised, but rather she felt a little at loss.</p>
 <p>The poison had already been dispelled. Even the injuries in Yu Ruyan’s body had been completely healed. The sun was setting when they came here, but it was already the following morning now.</p>
 <p>They had actually stayed here for an entire night. Yu Ruyan couldn’t help but blush the more she thought about it as she stayed motionless, snuggled in Qing Shui’s arms.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was leaning on top of Lady Duanmu when he realized that his abilities had also increased quite a lot. Not only that, his physical strength and spirit energy had also been raised tremendously. However, there wasn’t too much joy in him either.</p>
 <p>Because he didn’t know how to face this woman from now on.</p>
 <p>He had never thought the day where he would share such intimate moments with this woman would come. Qing Shui involuntarily moved his body a little, but it made Yu Ruyan, who was in his arms, tremble and let out a weak sigh.</p>
 <p>She didn’t seem to be in a hurry to get up. This incident had already been imprinted into their minds. Although it was as if they were dreaming, it felt real at the same time.</p>
 <p>It should’ve been many years since she last touched a man. Similarly, Qing Shui hadn’t tasted any flesh recently. The duo cultivation tonight was beyond delightful. It was wonderful.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui got up slowly. The feeling of his lower weapon sliding out still made them both quiver. Half of their bodies were soaked in the White Milky Jade, even filling up the places where they were previously joined. Although Qing Shui currently wanted to have another round again, he knew he shouldn’t.</p>
 <p>He had no choice but to let go earlier for the sake of saving a life. His action would no longer be justified if he were to do that again.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui!”</p>
 <p>“Yes?”</p>
 <p>“This incident is history, forever a history. Let’s forget about it, what do you say? Let’s pretend this never happened,” Yu Ruyan spoke gently with her head lowered.</p>
 <p>“Alright, I understand. I won’t make things hard for you. Sorry that you had to go through that.” There was nothing Qing Shui could do other than sigh.</p>
 <p>“I don’t feel like that at all. No one is aggrieved in this incident. If it had felt that bad, I would have chosen death,” Yu Ruyan shook her head in agony. The thought of Duanmu Lingshuang entered her mind, she was worried that something would happened to her daughter due to her death. Judging from her daughter’s temper, she would no longer allow herself to live. Yu Ruyan was extremely concerned that her daughter would commit suicide if she were to lose her mother as well.</p>
 <p>Life was filled with too much dissatisfaction and helplessness!</p>
 <p>“Perhaps my daughter will lose the her opportunity to be with him forever over this incident. He’s the saviour of both me and my daughter. He had not only saved my daughter but also myself. This incident also occurred because he had to save me. Perhaps I should be more open minded about it? But then my body….”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know what she meant with her words. He found his clothes and got dressed. He then helped Yu Ruyan to find her Interspatial Silk Sachet, she probably had a change of clothes inside there.</p>
 <p>After a man and a woman had sex, it was impossible to completely forget about what happened even if they were to treat each other like strangers. Qing Shui knew that he couldn’t do it, let alone a woman like Yu Ruyan. Otherwise she wouldn’t have stayed as a widow for all these years.</p>
 <p>After the two of them were fully dressed, the atmosphere between them obviously felt different when previously compared. A complex feeling was in the air, especially whenever their gazes met with other.</p>
 <p>There were also awkwardness, ambiguity, nervousness and some other indescribable feelings...</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I shall take my leave first. I’ll return to the Duanmu City with Lingshuang. I should be able to completely forget about this after some time,” Yu Ruyan spoke softly when the two of them reached the cave exit.</p>
 <p>“Don’t think about it too much and don’t blame yourself. If you feel bad about it then blame it all on me,” Qing Shui stood beside her and gently told her.</p>
 <p>“How can I possibly blame you? Alright, I have to go. You should return to the Di Clan after I leave. Forget about what happened today. We’re still the good friends as we were before.”</p>
 <p>After finishing her sentence, Yu Ruyan soared up the skies as she followed the path back home.</p>
 <p>Screech!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui summoned the Fire Bird!</p>
 <p>“Return with my Fire Bird!” Qing Shui’s voice was soft, but it had clearly travelled to Yu Ruyan’s ears and Fire Bird had already flew over to her side.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan turned her head around to look at Qing Shui, and then left with Fire Bird!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood at the cave exit while being baffled as he realized that his relation to the Duanmu Clan was indeed not bad. He had unintentionally lent a hand to the pair of mother and daughter before, but they were the type of people who must repay the act of goodwill done to them by others. If it had been other type of people, he had a feeling they wouldn’t have even been in contact with each other by now .</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t experience that much of an impact in his heart, but this incident had hurt Yu Ruyan. They could only forget about it since nothing would ever come out of this.</p>
