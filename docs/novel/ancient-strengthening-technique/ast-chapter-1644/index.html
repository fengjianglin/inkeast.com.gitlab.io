 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t know how much time had passed, but Qing Shui felt as if a tempest had arisen within his body. The Yin-Yang Image rapidly spun as usual, while the pain he felt all over his body started to clear his consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the pain was excruciating, Qing Shui had endured worse pains than this. This wasn’t too much. As his consciousness cleared, Qing Shui started to operate his Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique and Force of Rebirth to treat the damaged organs of the five viscera.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was slow, but something was better than nothing. He felt his hands healing and hands that were cool as jade grasping his. A familiar feeling filled his heart and he knew that Tantai Lingyan was holding onto his hands. However, he could not open his eyes nor could he move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, I know you are alright. Nothing can happen to you, you promised me. I have not promised to become your wife yet, so you must wake up and I’ll immediately become yours once you wake up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan’s voice passed into Qing Shui’s ear. Although he could not see it, he felt that his face was a little wet. She must be crying for him and while Qing Shui’s heart ached, he felt more joy instead. Although he didn’t know when he would wake up, he knew that he wasn’t going to die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He really wanted to grasp her hands too, but he couldn’t do it. Thankfully, he could regain control of his internal organs. Otherwise he might have followed in Yin Tian’s footsteps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unknowingly, his other hand was being pulled as well. This hand was warmer than the other but equally smooth as jade - he knew it was Qin Qing’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The physician is here but your body is rejecting his treatment, so you can only rely on yourself now. I believe you’re alright. You must quickly get better. The Hong Clan is no more now, so you don’t have to worry. Everyone is waiting for you to recover.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s body was constantly recovering slowly. Both women basically did not leave his side. This was Qing Shui’s previous room. Feng Xi and Yin Sha also largely spent most of their time here, other than leaving to settle any necessary matters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Yan and Little Qing, you should both go and rest. Leave everything here to me. Both of you need to take care of yourselves while waiting for him to gain consciousness.” Feng Xi ached a little as she looked at the two women.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We are ok. Godmother Feng, you should go and rest.” Tantai Lingyan did not even lift her head and her voice was rather indifferent. What happened to Qing Shui made her heart really conflicted. She suddenly felt as if her entire world had turned dreary and dismal again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her previous world might have been like that, but the appearance of Qing Shui pierced through the dark clouds of her life. It created some sort of sanctuary in her heart. But now, it reverted to its previous state and her entire world darkened again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Xi naturally felt it and she felt a sense of conflict. She struck a chord with Tantai Lingyan but could not neglect the existence of Qing Shui. She meant well, feeling that her current strength can help the Divine Moon Immortal Sect, but she realised she was wrong. She did not help them at all but instead was the one receiving help all this while. Each time she incurred such a huge favor such that she could probably not pay them back anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mother, it has already been half a month. How about we try the Sky Replenishing Pill?” Yin Sha said to Feng Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Sky Replenishing Pill is destroying to reconstitute. Tackling such injuries is certainly effective. However, the uncertainties are also abound. Normally, the pill is only used when all hope is lost, just like in the previous instance of your father. I didn’t even dare to give it to your father, much less to Qing Shui.” Feng Xi shook her head firmly and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Sha did not say anything again. He only wished for Qing Shui to get better. If anything happened to him, their entire clan would not be safe too. However, nothing could be done now as the Sky Replenishing Pill could not be used. He only casually said it previously, as he felt that they could try using it, since Qing Shui’s body was very strong. But now, he wasn’t sure if Qing Shui’s body could endure it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s body was slowly recovering with the strong Force of Rebirth. It was a pity he could not move and could only rely on his self-recuperating ability. But even this way of recovering was quite fast, which was why Feng Xi prohibited the use of the Sky Replenishing Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could recover based on the current progression, but there could not be any mishaps in the process. Moreover, the time required was lengthy and they might have to be prepared for a long period of unconsciousness. During the process of the body’s recovery, the damaged portions could deteriorate, which was why Yin Sha previously suggested the use of the Sky Replenishing Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s desolate and dark world made him feel dull and boring. He could feel the comings and goings of people, but there was always someone remaining by his side. Additionally, his hands were held by Tantai Lingyan for a really long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui also did not know when he woke up, as he could only continuously circulate his aura through his meridians. His Eleven Heavenly Meridians and Three Earthly Meridians were very strong after all, which curbed the deterioration of his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One round after another, on the whole, his body was recovering and it was something only he could feel. These few days, Tantai Lingyan and Qin Qing would also talk. Today should be the forty-eighth day, and the day would pass pretty quickly as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The injuries this time were severe and almost killed Qing Shui. Ultimately though, the Paragon Vessel helped him block half of the damage and now, it was lifeless within his Dantian. Even the tiny person wearing the golden armor had also noticeably sagged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the vital essence in his meridians circulated one round and entered his Dantian and nourished the Paragon Vessel in his Lower Dantian, all Qing Shui had to do now was awaken the Paragon Vessel. Only by doing this could he rapidly recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After so many days of effort, his complexion was much better than before - there was some slight change as it became slightly warmer and more moist. Yet, he still seemed weak and frail, unlike the imposing strength of before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Qing Shui was content since he was much stronger than before - he was gradually responding. Time passed by slowly and night had fallen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was only Tantai Lingyan and Qin Qing remaining in the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sister Yan, when did Qing Shui wake up? I can see his brazen and shameless face again.” Qin Qing sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can feel that his body is recovering. Hopefully he can recover immediately.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as this sentence was uttered, the supine Qing Shui’s breath rose. The two women whose hands each held one of his hands were suddenly clutched firmly. It was as if their blood circulated in tandem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, how are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sister Yan, he moved!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The violent aura surrounding Qing Shui’s body suddenly raged with further fury and caused both women who were initially happy to become worried. This was because blood was spilling out from Qing Shui’s nose, mouth, and body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Qing Shui felt that the Violet Golden Bloodline Essence in his meridians was strengthening rapidly. But what puzzled him the most was that the Paragon Vessel suddenly started emitting a radiant golden light and aura, as if it were the radiance of the setting sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he realised that what followed was the enormous aura constantly repairing his viscera and meridians. But at the same time, the huge wave of power also resulted in a fresh spurt of blood through his nose and mouth, while beads of blood oozed out of the pores of his body.</span></p>

He did not know the origin of this sudden surge of manic power but the previously sagging Paragon Vessel was suddenly filled with vigor.</span></p>

Moreover, the five senses of the Paragon Vessel that were previously nebulous turned clear and he once again felt a raging intent abruptly burst forth.</span></p>

Increase entire strength nine times, double all combat abilities including Sure Kill Heavenly Technique. Increase defence and endurance by three times and increase resistance to evil arts by three times, including mind-influencing types and poison types. Passive Paragon Heavenly Technique, not including passive combat abilities, zero consumption and does not require conscious use. Passive ability, can increase might; as long as one doesn’t die, the tyranny one exudes does not cease.</span></p>

Most importantly it could be leveled up, which could increase his strength. Qing Shui felt some sort of uncontrollable strength in his body, and now even without lifting a finger, his raw strength was already 1600 Dao. If he attacked under the influence of Jade Kirin Dragon Vessel Tyrannical Aura, his strength would be raised to 3200 Dao and less needed to be said about his defence.</span></p>
