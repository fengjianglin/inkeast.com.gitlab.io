 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2347 - Water Nation Imperial City, Crystal City, Widow Qing</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui perceived with his spiritual sense that this woman did it with more than five different men recently. Qing Shui frowned uncontrollably. This woman either practiced the Yang Collective Technique or she was simply an easy woman. Either way, Qing Shui did not fancy that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Anything?” Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don't be so serious, mister. I have come to make friends with you brazenly. You are making me feel awkward,” The woman said shyly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It would be wonderful if this woman were a virgin or if Qing Shui did not know her condition. After all, this woman was very beautiful. Plus, she was very seductive. At that moment, she looked even more charming. Unfortunately, it appeared a bit disgusting to Qing Shui once he knew her true self.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go back if you have nothing important. I have things to do,” Qing Shui did not want to continue the conversation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aren’t I pretty?” The woman secretly cursed Qing Shui for being coolheaded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The surface looks good,” Qing Shui said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don't you want to have some intimacy with me?” The woman sounded enticing. Adding to her expression and gestures, a faint aura infused into Qing Shui's body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Charm Art!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui smiled; that was a child's play. The slightest bit of fondness toward this woman was gone, “A thousand men must have slept with you already.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman changed her expression, “Don't think you are unrivaled in Bailan City just because you beat the Duke's men. I'm here for a trade and since you don't like my body, I'll use something else.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui smiled even more, but he was surprised inside. It seemed like the auction house was strong and did not take the Dukes seriously. What did that imply? It showed that the auction house was not any weaker than the Dukes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, I know the Dukes are the strongest in Bailan City. As for your auction house, I don't reckon it's stronger than the Dukes. I wonder what are you gonna trade for?” Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We need your medicinal pills. Are you interested in coming to the auction house? We will satisfy all your criteria.” The woman blinked her charming eyes to Qing Shui while talking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not interested. Also, I ran out of medicinal pills. It's getting dark so I'm going to rest.” Qing Shui yawned and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I'm very sincere,” The woman said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Being sincere doesn't mean you can force people into a difficult situation. Now please go back,” Qing Shui said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman hesitated. Seeing her, Qing Shui had a second thought and took out two bottles of Constitution Nurturing Pills, “I don't get this item all the time. Its ingredients are precious but the success rate of refining it is very low. These two bottles are for you. Take it as my appreciation for the auction house’s help today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui did not like this woman but he did not hate her either. After all, everyone had his own freedom. She was unrelated to him whatsoever. She was free to play with anyone she wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman accepted the pills, “Thank you, but please leave this place soon. I'm afraid that the auction house will act against you. They want to get your recipes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thanks for the warning.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was not afraid that the auction house would come for trouble. He would have them loose a massive amount of blood if they dared to come.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The night passed in peace. The next two days were peaceful too. On the third day, Qing Shui was prepared to head to the Water Nation’s Imperial City. He could only know the actual situation of the Demon King Domain once he reached there. Perhaps, he would make some special encounters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nine Continents Steps!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui did not want to have any more problems. He knew someone was tailing after him. It should be either the man from the auction house or the Dukes. They would never expect Qing Shui to have the Nine Continents Steps and vanished instantly beyond their stalking regions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He disappeared completely at once and left the men in disbelief. Initially, Qing Shui had always been under their eyes but he had vanished entirely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui did not want to mess with these people anymore. He was here to feel the strength of the Demon King Domain and see if he could collect some treasures, increase his experience and strength. The Demon King Domain might only be a stepping stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The benefit of this visit was great and the experience was crucial. If one stayed still in the same place, his strength improvement would slow down. This time, if he did not come to the Demon King Domain, he would not have gotten the Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda of Violence and Endurance. At least, the chance of getting it was so small that it was negligible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Qing Shui's current strength, though he might be able to top the Demon King Domain, he would probably be weaker in the Middle Three Regions. Thus, he wanted to go to the Water Nation Imperial City and check out the actual powerful warriors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A month later, Qing Shui had finally arrived at the Water Nation Imperial City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Crystal City!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui only realized how beautiful a city could be upon his arrival. The buildings and floor were built with a kind of crystal stone. This stone was only available in the Crystal City. It was extremely hard and gave out a subtle halo which was truly dreamlike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This city was one which was exclusively in dreams. It had a vibe of a kingdom in a dreamland. Everything was reflected in a world free from any speck of dust, regardless whether it was the best vehicle on the streets or the birds and demonic beasts in the sky. Everything seemed to be a lot prettier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Though pretty, the city was quite large. Besides, Qing Shui felt a sense of oppression as he arrived. The feeling was subtle but the cultivation seemed profound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui spent a short period to feel it carefully, his eyes brightening. He knew it in his heart that this should be the guardian Divine beast of the nation. He heard of it as he went on. Rumor had it that the Water Nation's guardian Divine Beast was an incredibly powerful Crystal Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was said to be a real Crystal Dragon which had been guarding the Water Nation for many years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides the Crystal Dragon, it was rumored that the inner city of the Imperial City had a huge guarding formation. It could protect the place and a very large region around it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This formation could reverse the attack as well as give protection. If you used one percent of energy to attack, it would be countered with several folds of the energy. It was extremely daunting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui did not feel very lonely, despite being by himself here. However, with the approaching new year, seeing people who came out with their families, he started missing his family members. However, Qing Shui had yet to find a suitable spot to fix the Five Elements Divine Flag. So, he could not go home. Otherwise, he would waste a lot of time again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Water Nation’s Imperial City was so beautiful, Qing Shui reckoned that he could really fix a spot here. Perhaps, he could settle down here later. It was not only beautiful but also full of spiritual Qi. The strength was also great. He knew that there were many forces in the Demon King Domain and the Water Nation was definitely one of the stronger ones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was the Water Nation, Gold Nation, Fire Nation, Earth Nation, Wood Nation and some big Sects here. Yet, most of them were attached to a nation while some others existed as nations. These were mostly the bigger Sects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui's eyes flashed suddenly and spotted a familiar silhouette from afar. He knew he would not get the wrong person, so he followed the figure. Then, he was stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a woman who looked like a married lady. He sensed it from first sight. It was not shown through her body but the natural aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her face was so pretty that it outshined all the women throughout the world. Her body figure had no difference from a teenage girl. Yet, she was fuller on some body parts, especially for the perky chest which stretched out her clothes wide and tall.
