 <p><strong>AST 1137 - Formation Immortal Sect, Changes to the Nine Continents Boots, Realm of Steps of Perfection</strong></p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan and Tantai Xuan were on one side, chatting about similar things. Since it was the first time she had came to this place, it was better for her to gain more understanding of the common knowledge in this world.</p>
 <p>They continued until about noon when they went out to get some food. Qiu Feng invited Qing Shui, Yu Ruyan and Tantai Xuan to Formation Immortal Sect, so he could host them but Qing Shui shook his head and declined.</p>
 <p>Qiu Feng's branch was the weakest one in Formation Immortal Sect. Formation Immortal Sect was considered a top notch Grade One Sect and there were still many strong experts in the sect. Therefore, Qing Shui didn't want to find trouble for himself and thus declined Qiu Feng's kind intentions.</p>
 <p>Qiu Feng and the others didn't insist either. They knew that if some powerful cultivator in the sect were to ask Qing Shui to join their sect and he didn't agree, it wouldn't end well.</p>
 <p>However, there were always some things which wouldn't go as planned. Just as Qing Shui and Qiu Feng stopped this conversation, two powerful demonic beasts appeared from afar. Although they were about 100 meters in size, the auras they released weren't of the same level as what Qing Shui had seen before.</p>
 <p>Formation Immortal Sect's clothes!</p>
 <p>Two demonic beasts, which seemed like an eagle yet like a condor but was neither. The fierce auras they unleashed were slightly more powerful compared to the ancient demonic beasts which Qing Shui had encountered before.</p>
 <p>Just such demonic beasts already astonished Qing Shui. He was even more taken aback when he saw the two old men on them. It was because he couldn't sense their abilities with his spiritual sense.</p>
 <p>It was like throwing a stone into the sea, the dept was so deep that it couldn't be fathomed. Many Sealing Formations were drawn on their clothes and accessories, making the clothes appear to be gleaming in a silvery light, causing the two old men to be like members of the gods.</p>
 <p>The old man on the left had pale skin and was truly a person with white hair but a young appearance. His forehead was broad and his head was shiny, causing him to stand out a lot. His eyes were always smiling, giving others a favorable impression in one look. His snow white long brows and beard made him appear even more amiable.</p>
 <p>The old man on the right had a tall physique and thick brows. Contrary to the other old man, this one was slightly tanned, had a big nose and a mix of black and white hair. He unleashed an aura like that of a wild beast and was a little fierce. However, Qing Shui still had the feeling that he was unfathomable.</p>
 <p>"Greetings to Elder White and Elder Black!"</p>
 <p>Qiu Feng and the others bowed and greeted the two old men respectfully.</p>
 <p>"Haha, we're all family, there's no need to stand on ceremony. Just be more at ease!" The white-skinned old man laughed and said.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, the tanned faced old man's huge eyes glanced around. All the people who were glanced at, shuddered. This was an Elder from their Formation Immortal Sect, the lowest Master in the sect. Even if they hadn't reached the level of the lowest grade State Master, they were not far from that and would become one very soon. He was already one step into the door of becoming a State Master.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the tanned faced old man's eyes landed on Qing Shui. A weird glow flashed in his eyes as he looked toward Qing Shui, "That lad there. In the future, you'll be my disciple."</p>
 <p>The tanned face old man pointed a finger at Qing Shui, causing everyone else present to feel very envious. How great was it to be taken in as a disciple by an Elder? This was a State Master and even the lowest grade State Master was revered and treated with great importance.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui frowned. He didn't wish to become anyone's disciple. At the very least, he didn't have a favorable impression of this man, especially not toward the domineering aura he gave off.</p>
 <p>"Old Black, you're really fast to speak up. This is really a good seed. With time, he'll definitely be ten times stronger than you," the amiable looking old man laughed and said.</p>
 <p>"Elder, he isn't a member of our Formation Immortal Sect." Qiu Feng saw Qing Shui's frown and stepped out to speak up.</p>
 <p>"Qiu Feng, can you not tolerate that there's someone else who's stronger than you and you cannot accept him?" The tanned face old man's sharp eyes pierced toward Qiu Feng like a blade.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qiu Feng's clothes were drenched with perspiration!</p>
 <p>"Elder, Qiu Feng didn't mean that..."</p>
 <p>"Alright, you don't have to continue." Elder Black waved his hand to interrupt Qiu Feng's words.</p>
 <p>Qiu Feng took one step back and looked toward Qing Shui apologetically. Qing Shui smiled and shook his head.</p>
 <p>"Young man, many people begged me to take them in as my disciple but I didn't agree. How about it? If you become my disciple, you'll be able to soar into the skies with just one step," the tanned face old man looked at Qing Shui and said calmly.</p>
 <p>"Soar into the skies with just one step? Sir, may I ask what your strength is?" Although Qing Shui was a far cry from the level of a State Master level existence, he wouldn't want it even if a Grade One State Master were to take him in as a disciple. He had no intentions of finding himself a Master and only Yiye Jiange had been his Master for a short period of time. It that wasn't even considered official.</p>
 <p>"Haha, my abilities just barely reached the level of a Grade One State Master. Why? Am I not qualified to be your Master?" the tanned face man laughed and said, his voice was loud and clear, having a confidence that came from deep within.</p>
 <p>"Would you be able to teach me to become a Grade Two or Grade Three State Master?" Qing Shui asked softly after the old man stopped laughing.</p>
 <p>The tanned faced old man glared at him for very long before he said slowly, "Lad, I hadn't expected you to have such great expectations. To be honest, I have the confidence to nurture you into a Grade One State Master in 100 years. However, I don't have any confidence to achieve anything beyond that."</p>
 <p>"100 years to only become a Grade One State Master..." Qing Shui mumbled softly to himself.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's voice was not very loud but it was sufficient to let the people in the surroundings hear him. Suddenly, it became so silent that they would probably hear the sound of a needle dropping to the ground. Even Yu Ruyan and Tantai Xuan looked at Qing Shui, stunned.</p>
 <p>"Arrogant! Ignorant! Do you think that it's so easy to attain a breakthrough to become a Grade One State Master? Come, let me see how much you're worth." The tanned face old man seemed to be have become a little agitated. He wasn't a person who could get irritated so easily but this time around, it was primarily because he wanted to take Qing Shui as his disciple.</p>
 <p>“Wait. Don't you think that you're bullying the weak to be testing my abilities now? Even if you were to beat me and killed me, would there be any meaning to it?” Qing Shui shook his head and said, smiling, not anxious in the least.</p>
 <p>Not just the tanned faced old man, even the pale faced old man was also astonished that Qing Shui was really so calm. It seemed that even a State Master was nothing much to this young man...</p>
 <p>In the Western Oxhe Continent, only those who had reached the level of a Grade One State Master could be considered a true powerful expert. The grades of dynasties and sects were actually a comparison of the State Master level cultivators.</p>
 <p>The tanned face old man was stunned for a moment. When had he ever been so disregarded by others before this? If it was someone else, he would probably have gone over and killed them with a palm. However, he couldn't bear to do that to this young man. Talents were hard to come by.</p>
 <p>"Elders, he is my friend and came with me this time around. He doesn't have the intention of joining any sects. What do you think if you were to let him be?" Tantai Xuan smiled and said to the two old men.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Tantai Xuan had stepped forth, the two old men could only find themselves a way out so as not to appear too embarrassed. The tanned face old man had pointed to Qing Shui to get him to become his disciple earlier. If there were no one to help resolve the situation, the old man would use force to "protect" his pride. Otherwise, he would have lost too much face.</p>
 <p>It was good that Putuo Mountain stepped up. They could only smile and say, "Since he is a friend of Miss Tantai, then we won't force it either. In the future, if you have time, do come visit Formation Immortal Sect."</p>
 <p>With that, they nodded and brought the others back with them.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hadn't expected things to be like this. In the past, if one had a high official post, they would be able to crush others. Here, it was the same if sects or dynasties were one grade higher and it would be one-sided and overwhelming. After all, the difference in strengths was too great.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and said, to Qiu Feng, "Thanks, brother."</p>
 <p>"Thank you, Miss Tantai!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned to speak to Tantai Xuan.</p>
 <p>"I didn't help much, you should thank Miss Tantai," Qiu Feng shook his head helplessly and said, smiling.</p>
 <p>"Alright, you helped me as well. I only said one line," Tantai Xuan smiled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn't stupid and naturally knew the reason Tantai Xuan was put in high regard. Tantai Xuan definitely had a high status in Putuo Mountain. If it was an ordinary disciple, even if the person was from a Grade Four Sect, that State Master wouldn't have shown her any face either.</p>
 <p>"Brother, my sect is calling for me to return. Are you guys going to follow Miss Tantai? Will you first look for a place to stay?" Qiu Feng asked Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Brother, you can return first. I'll look for you when I'm free. You can just leave us be," Qing Shui smiled and said to Qiu Feng. They both patted each other on the shoulder.</p>
 <p>The other people had already left and Qiu Feng also disappeared into the distance, following after the people who had left earlier.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw that the surroundings had already turned quiet. There were still some people from Formation Immortal Sect in the distance who were there to guard the teleportation array. Afterward, the teleportation array would also slowly close and only be activated again five years later.</p>
 <p>"Come, I'll bring you guys around the area, Sister Ruyan. I'll be your guide," Tantai Xuan looked at the surroundings and said to Ruyan.</p>
 <p>"Then I'll have to trouble Sister Xuan," Yu Ruyan smiled and said politely.</p>
 <p>"You're already calling me Sister Xuan, so why are you still standing on ceremony? Let's go!"</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan called out the World Cleansing Demonic Lotus and pulled Yu Ruyan up. She then smiled and said to Qing Shui, "You better not lose sight of us."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had always wanted to go up the Lotus Platform but seeing that Tantai Xuan had no intention of letting him do that, he could only call out the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and go up, following after the Lotus Platform as they flew out of the mountains.</p>
 <p>Seated on the back of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, he felt that there was a change to its speed. It seemed to be a lot faster now. He suddenly recalled that when they were using the teleportation array, a brief change happened to the Nine Continents Boots.</p>
 <p>He quickly looked toward them with his Heavenly Vision Technique.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Boots!</p>
 <p>Refined from the star fragments and strange beasts in the world of the nine continents. Has a mysterious and unfathomable ability.</p>
 <p>Increases speed threefold; reduces depletion threefold; hard for even a Martial Emperor to harm it in the slightest. Comes with the battle technique Nine Continents Steps.</p>
 <p>In the past, it had increased speed twofold; reduced depletion twofold. Right now it actually increases his speed threefold and reduces depletion by threefold!</p>
 <p>Nine Continent Steps: Activating the Nine Continent Boots and Nine Continent Steps will allow the user travel 800,000 li in a straight line instantly. Currently at the fourth level, Realm of Steps of Perfection, can be used eight times in a day.</p>
 <p>The user of the Nine Continents Steps can concurrently bring along with him all living things within a 50-meter radius from him, including humans, demonic beasts and others.</p>
 <p>Prerequisite: Martial Emperor level!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the ability of the Nine Continents Boots happily while he was on the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. Right now, he felt very agitated. The land area of the Western Oxhe Continent were very vast and he felt that the reason the Nine Continents Boots had suddenly increased in its abilities must definitely be because of the Ancient Teleportation Array. It might have gone through the change after absorbing its energy.</p>
 <p>Compared to the Nine Continents Boots from before, it had powered up by a lot. His speed went through a tremendous change. This was good stuff, an ability that was more important than strength.</p>
