The scene was too spectacular and since they were underwater, it looked even more shocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Giant Sea-Dragons, malevolent Giant Sharks, and various other kinds of organisms with different appearances. There were countless numbers of them. Though they were still quite far, their main body could already be seen now. It seemed that there was no need to transform into their human forms for this battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those Giant Sea-Dragons were different from the Dragons Qing Shui had seen before. He didn’t know whether or not these Sea-Dragons could assume human form, but they were all quite robust-looking and had only two giant front claws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These Sea-Dragons were blue in color for the most part and looked good, but were just a tad malevolent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can these Sea-Dragons assume human form? I remember that many in the Dragon Tribe were deprived of their ability to transform into their human forms during ancient times.” Qing Shui asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sea-Dragons can’t assume human form, but the controller of the Sea Dragon Palace is a Sea-Dragon Merman. They are a powerful existence similar to the Drakainas but they only have men among them.” Muyun Qingge said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those Giant Sharks were unusual existences which were also an ancient breed. They were emperors of the Giant Shark Tribes. A Giant Crowned Shark, the chiefs of these Giant Sharks possessed a golden crown-like thing on their heads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they stopped, four people appeared at the lead. Two of them were handsome middle-aged men and looked just like humans, wearing azure clothes. Each of their actions possessed a certain style.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other two wore purple robes but had a crown-like thing on their heads which acted as proof for their identities. Qing Shui had already known that these four were the Sea-Dragon Mermen and the Giant Crowned Sharks controlling the Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sea Dragon Palace didn’t have just the Sea-Dragons and Sea-Dragon Mermen. Similarly, the Vicious Shark Palace also didn’t have just the Giant Crowned Sharks. The Sea Dragon Palace’s Sea Dragons and Sea-Dragon Mermen comprised the least of the numbers among their ranks. It was the same for the Giant Crowned Sharks, except they were controllers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Qing Shui looked at this army, his mood became restless and his blood seemed to boil. A huge massacring battle was waiting but he also wanted to communicate with their counterpart and know their intentions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Sea-Dragon Merman came forward and looked at Muyun Qingge and then towards Yiye Jiange and Qing Shui. Finally, his gaze returned to Muyun Qingge: “It’s great that the Grand Palace Master has returned. How about your Sea King’s Palace surrenders and pays allegiance to me?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man’s voice was quite inducing and pleasant to hear. His manners were also quite mild. It’s just that many from the Sea King’s Palace frowned when those words were spoken as this was an insult towards them. Quite a few from the Sea King’s Palace had already begun to curse out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop boasting. Palace Master, let’s go kill ‘em all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They still haven’t learned their lesson after so many attempts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seems like the enemy has come prepared this time!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If they didn’t, the outcome would’ve been the same as before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You want me to surrender to the Sea Dragon Palace or to the Vicious Shark Palace?” Muyun Qingge looked towards the calm man on the opposite side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha. There’s no need for the Grand Palace Master to sow discord. You only need to surrender and it’ll be fine. Wouldn’t we become stronger if we all unite together?” One of the Giant Crowned Shark from the Vicious Shark Palace came out while laughing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since it’s good if everyone unites together, why don’t your Sea Dragon and Vicious Shark Palaces rely on the Sea King’s Palace? Wouldn’t that be better?” Qing Shui said while smiling. He knew that the enemy had already accomplished their wish, and Muyun Qingge and Yiye Jiange were the most crucial. After all, Yiye Jiange was an existence on the same level as a Drakaina. They merely didn’t know that she was already his woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Liyu was being exploited straight from the beginning and he merely didn’t know why it was so, as Jin Liyu wasn’t an idiot. Did he have a perverted mind?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s words seemed casual but they were enough to make the enemy restless. Beastmen didn’t like surrendering the most and especially under this kind of circumstances. They felt that they were stronger than the Sea King’s Palace. Humans were calm and unhurried when they possessed greater strength but Beastmen were different. They enjoyed seeing the weak side submit to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who are you? What’s your relation to this matter?” The Giant Crowned Shark looked at Qing Shui with displeasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was a stranger to them. After all, he had arrived only a few days ago and there wasn’t any information present on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am her man.” Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This simple sentence was enough to cause rage in the hearts of the two controllers of the Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace. This time, they looked towards Yiye Jiange and then towards Muyun Qingge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They sensed that Yiye Jiange’s body didn’t possess that mouth-watering aura. Originally, the co-operation between them was based on splitting the gains and these gains were Muyun Qingge and Yiye Jiange, but only Muyun Qingge remained now. The biggest benefit of attacking the Sea King’s Palace were these two women who could help them breakthrough into the next realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There naturally had to be benefits for a co-operation and in case a problem occurred, the alliance was also doomed to collapse. Naturally, they wouldn’t start quarreling on the scene but an obstruction towards the other party had already settled in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was a man with two lifetimes so his gaze was keen. He smiled: “Otherwise, why don’t you both have a fight and we’ll cooperate with whoever wins.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was straightforwardly sowing dissension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brat. You’ll have to die today.” A blue-robed Sea-Dragon Merman raged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll give you half-an-hour. If you want to surrender after that length of time, I won’t give you an opportunity even if you want to cooperate.” Qing Shui shook his head and poured oil into the fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Brother Long, let’s get rid of this brat first. What do you say?” The Giant Crowned Shark was quite enraged. Originally, there were equal benefits and both of their sides could cooperate quite harmoniously, but it was difficult to say now about when the Sea Dragon Palace would stab them from behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn’t a matter to joke about. If he had the chance, even he might stab the Sea Dragon Palace from behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I also feel the same. Let’s kill him first. The 2nd Palace Master shall belong to whoever kills him, &nbsp;OK?” The Sea-Dragon Merman said with a loud voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Beastmen were like this. If someone among the humankind tried to forcibly fight over things, the public wouldn’t accept it, but it was normal among the Beastmen. Women were merely an accessory to them. All of the powerful Beastmen had many women and this was also a kind of way to embody their strength.&nbsp;</span></p>

He looked towards that Sea-Dragon Merman: “I changed my mind. I won’t agree even if you lower your head. Especially you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui pointed towards the Giant Crowned Shark.</span></p>

Ignorant and arrogant. Come, let me take a look at what ability you have to act so brazenly.” The Giant Crowned Shark was also enraged by Qing Shui, so he directly went over towards Qing Shui.</span></p>

They were planning to compete in seeing who made the kill first. It seemed that they thought Qing Shui would be unable to withstand a single hit and thought the real target was Yiye Jiange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, I’ll go together with you!” Yiye Jiange walked out.</span></p>

She also nodded with a smile: “Be careful. We’ll prepare for the group battle.”</span></p>

It was just that before then, these two had to be eliminated. Yet he also knew that it wouldn’t be so easy but also not too difficult. He had confidence in this estimate.</span></p>

Qing Shui took the Golden Battle Halberd out and waved his right hand.</span></p>

Metal, Water, Wood, Fire, and Earth beget each other and Earth, Water, Fire, Metal, Wood inhibit each other.&nbsp;</span></p>

They thought that it was no wonder that he was so confident. They were even considering that Qing Shui was also from a sea tribe as how else could he possess the ability to move so freely underwater.</span></p>

That huge skill directly turned them into paste.</span></p>

The only difference was that the human-shaped body was covered with thick scales and had a giant Sea-Dragon head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a Sea-Dragon Merman which surpassed Sea-Dragons and possessed the power of the Dragon Tribe as well as heavenly techniques. Moreover, the Dragon Tribe were all-rounders. They could display their battle skills and their heavenly techniques power to the peak, and most importantly, had a high IQ. Of course, a Sea-Dragon couldn’t compare to a true Dragon.</span></p>

The scene looked like an ant in front of a giant hammer. The seawater also didn’t obstruct the hammer’s strength. Instead, it raised its strength, which was also the benefit of being proficient with water-type attacks.</span></p>

He found that with his strength, he’d have much difficulty in giving a fatal wound to this Sea-Dragon Merman. Hence, he could only make some unusual moves to prevail over him.</span></p>

The Golden Sword within his hand shot towards the enemy.</span></p>

However, this was enough to enrage the Sea-Dragon Merman. Those two giant hammers swung out again, trying to crush Qing Shui to death between them.</span></p>

Many of the surrounding tribes were accidentally injured due to this.</span></p>
