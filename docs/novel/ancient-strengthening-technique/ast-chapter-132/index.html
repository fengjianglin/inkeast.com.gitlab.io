  <p><strong>AST 0132 – Not saving someone at the verge of death!</strong></p>
  <p>Qing Shu laughed as he stared at the youth brimming with anger as he lightly spat the words out, “just a dog.”</p>
  <p>“Good, good! I will make you regret your words.” The youth huffed and puffed in anger, before turning about and leaving. These types of people, Qing Shui didn’t even have enough interest to punch him.</p>
  <p>“Doctor, I’m feeling uncomfortable around my head region!” A melodious sounding voice rang out, filled with a sense of attraction, and tinged with a crisp melody.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui, upon hearing the voice, did not even incline his head as a bitter smile was displayed on his face. “My big boss sister Wu-shuang, poor thing why is your head aching. Come, let me rub it for you.” After which, Qing Shui grinned captivatingly, at Wenren Wu-shuang.</p>
  <p>“Recently, it is said that this martial clinic is the most famous within Hundred Miles City, why didn’t you tell me that you were the one that opened it? Don’t you treat me as a friend?” Wenren Wu-shuang glared at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Hehe, of course I didn’t treat you as my friend. I’ve long treated as one of my own. I didn’t inform anyone because I didn’t want to bother you guys.” Qing Shui lightly spoke, as he unconsciously took advantage of her, and started rubbing Wu-shuang’s head.</p>
  <p>Wu-shuang laughed, but a hue of redness could be seen coloring her cheeks. She somewhat understood what Qing Shui meant when he said that he has long treated her as one of his own… “Your medicinal skills are already stronger than some of those other Xiantian Alchemists. Why are you holed up in here? Don’t tell me it’s because of earning money.”</p>
  <p>“Of course I’m doing this for money.” Qing Shui calmly smiled as he replied, while he began doodling on a piece of paper.</p>
  <p>“Then why did you chase that fellow from earlier away? Although he is just a servant, he is from the wealthy Dong Clan. You should know that wealthy people fear dying the most.” Wenren Wu-Shuang asked with some confusion.</p>
  <p>“I have a few rules of my own. I won’t provide treatment for certain types of people. For others, even if they have no money, I wouldn’t hesitate to help them!”</p>
  <p>“Do you mean, for example, the mother and daughter duo that just moved into the Qing Clan Medical Store? Earlier I saw the little angel.” Wu-shuang beautiful eyes blinked as she spoke, as her beautiful countenance seemed slightly moved.</p>
  <p>“When you were little, you’ve must’ve been an angel as well.” Qing Shui teased, as he lightly smiled.</p>
  <p>“Are you saying that I’m not an angel now?”</p>
  <p>“You are a celestial beauty that descended from the heavens, but I wonder who you descended for? I would be very jealous of that man!” Qing Shui hurriedly spoke, somewhat truthfully.</p>
  <p>“Hmph, I won’t talk any more nonsense with you. Hmm, oh yeah, what are the types of people you wouldn’t provide treatment for? Tell me, I’m very curious!” Wenren Wu-shuang inquired, as Qing Shui was still doodling on the piece of paper.</p>
  <p>“Those that have too intense of a killing aura.”</p>
  <p>“But why?”</p>
  <p>“Those that massacre a lot, should be prepared to be killed at any moment. If they died, then it’s Heaven’s will.” Qing Shui enigmatically explained.</p>
  <p>“And, who else?”</p>
  <p>“Those that are at extreme end of the spectrums, too kind, or too evil. And those that are too loyal to the country, as well as traitors!”</p>
  <p>“I understand why you wouldn’t treat those that are too evil. But what about those that are too kind in nature? And what do you mean traitors and loyalists?” Wu-shuang curiously inquired.</p>
  <p>“Those that are too loyal, might be considered traitors. Traitors on the other hand, could also be considered loyal. These types of people deserve death. There’s also evil in those whose kindness is too brilliant, almost all of those that are “too kind” are all people angling for fame. These types of people will also die young, so I don’t want to treat them.” Qing Shui didn’t explain it too much, as he babbled somewhat irresponsibility to Wu-shuang.</p>
  <p>“How does kindness equate to angling for fame?”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui gazed at that unchanging countenance of Wu-shuang as he continued, “those that appear extremely kind, are all merely doing it because of reputation or money. If not, why would they want to come out in the limelight. If they spent great amounts of money for charitable acts, don’t you wonder where all their money came from? It’s surely from cruel and violent means, and using money obtained from such a source to do charity, don’t you find that they are angling for fame?”</p>
  <p>“And, who else?” It appears as though Wu-shuang was getting more interested.</p>
  <p>“Those that are in extreme poverty, and those who are extremely wealthy. Lastly, also those that betray everything for money!” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
  <p>Wu-shuang speechlessly stared at Qing Shui, but questioning could be seen in the depths of her clear eyes.</p>
  <p>“Those that are in extremely poverty have suffered too much, so death could be also considered a form of release for them. As for those that are extremely wealthy, they enjoyed life too much. This could be considered a form of “expropriation”. Those that betray everything for money, would do all sorts of evil things, and thus, they deserve death.” Qing Shui put down the pen he was doodling with, and lightly drummed the table following a light rhythm.</p>
  <p>“And, who else?” Wu-shuang was as though her curiosity had been greatly peaked, as her beautiful eyes flickered with a fancy light, staring at Qing Shui. When she spoke, her perfect white teeth could be seen, giving a sense of artistic beauty.</p>
  <p>“Those that don’t look pleasing to me, those with no money, those that are more handsome than me, those with beautiful girlfriends or wives…”</p>
  <p>“Stop stop stop! Just tell me who would you provide treatment to!” Wenren Wu-shuang speechlessly stared at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“I would only heal those like you, unmatched peerless beauties.” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
  <p>“What about the consultation fees?” Wenren Wu-shuang blushed as her languid, melodious voice, sounded out, seemingly filled with a sense of magic that cause people to lose themselves in it.</p>
  <p>“Marrying me…would suffice!”</p>
  <p>Wenren Wu-shuang rolled her eyes, “Okay, I shouldn’t banter with you so much. I have a request, and need you to help me.”</p>
  <p>“Tell me about it. In this vast world, just meeting you could already be considered our destiny. Among the billions of people, the people I know amount to 50. You are a special existence in my heart. No matter what you need, as long as I can help, I would help. Even if the thing is beyond my capabilities, I would still give my all for you.” Qing Shui lightly said, but the words he said did truly come from his heart. The Qing Shui in this world, was many times more free-spirited compared to back in his previous world. Many things, he regarded lightly or treated them as a joke. But the ones he valued most were people close to him, regardless of kin or kith.</p>
  <p>“Do you know why I was injured by the Golden-ringed Snake King back then? Do you know what it was protecting?”</p>
  <p>A brilliant light flashed in Qing Shui’s eyes. Everyone would go crazy over the chance to obtain heavenly materials and earthly treasures. Something that a demonic beast guarded would definitely be a good thing! But because of the lack of information, Qing Shui was unable to formulate a guess.</p>
  <p>“Hmm, I’m unable to guess. But something that could make you this excited, has got to be a valuable treasure.” Qing Shui exclaimed, as he inquired.</p>
  <p>“It’s the Golden-Ringed Snake Fruit!”</p>
  <p>“Golden-Ringed Snake Fruit? What effect does it have?” Qing Shui felt his curiosity piquing. This fruit should have something to do with the Golden-Ringed Snake right? </p>
  <p>“Ingesting it grants you twice the amount of resistance you would have towards snake poison. And, it also allows you to maintain your youth for 10 additional years.” Wenren Wu-shuang lightly laughed.</p>
  <p>“I didn’t expect that even you, with a peerless countenance unmatched by those beauties in ancient era and even now, with beauty akin to that of lotuses and jade, would still pay so much attention to your appearance.” Qing Shui’s eyes misted over as he drowned himself in the beauty of Wu-shuang.</p>
  <p>“Am I really that great?” Wu-Shuang happily inquired upon hearing Qing Shui’s praising of her.</p>
  <p>“Of course, my words are even more real when compared to pure gold.”</p>
  <p>“If that’s the case, I would have to pay even more attention to my appearance. Although Xiantian cultivators have a lifespan of 500 years, their period of youth could only be considered about 20-30 years longer than normal humans. For them, 40 years of age, is their limit before their youth would start to wither away. For us, at most we could maintain our youthful looks till we’re about 70. We should take great care in maintaining now, otherwise in the future I would look like a granny…”</p>
  <p>No wonder those pills and pellets that could increase the period of youthfulness was so highly sought after. Not to mention females, even males would hanker after these. These types of herbs and pellets couldn’t even be easily bought even if one had the money.</p>

 <p>A brilliant light flashed in Qing Shui’s eyes. Everyone would go crazy over the chance to obtain heavenly materials and earthly treasures. Something that a demonic beast guarded would definitely be a good thing! But because of the lack of information, Qing Shui was unable to formulate a guess.</p>
 <p>“Hmm, I’m unable to guess. But something that could make you this excited, has got to be a valuable treasure.” Qing Shui exclaimed, as he inquired.</p>
 <p>“It’s the Golden-Ringed Snake Fruit!”</p>
 <p>“Golden-Ringed Snake Fruit? What effect does it have?” Qing Shui felt his curiosity piquing. This fruit should have something to do with the Golden-Ringed Snake right? </p>
 <p>“Ingesting it grants you twice the amount of resistance you would have towards snake poison. And, it also allows you to maintain your youth for 10 additional years.” Wenren Wu-shuang lightly laughed.</p>
 <p>“I didn’t expect that even you, with a peerless countenance unmatched by those beauties in ancient era and even now, with beauty akin to that of lotuses and jade, would still pay so much attention to your appearance.” Qing Shui’s eyes misted over as he drowned himself in the beauty of Wu-shuang.</p>
 <p>“Am I really that great?” Wu-Shuang happily inquired upon hearing Qing Shui’s praising of her.</p>
 <p>“Of course, my words are even more real when compared to pure gold.”</p>
 <p>“If that’s the case, I would have to pay even more attention to my appearance. Although Xiantian cultivators have a lifespan of 500 years, their period of youth could only be considered about 20-30 years longer than normal humans. For them, 40 years of age, is their limit before their youth would start to wither away. For us, at most we could maintain our youthful looks till we’re about 70. We should take great care in maintaining now, otherwise in the future I would look like a granny…”</p>
 <p>No wonder those pills and pellets that could increase the period of youthfulness was so highly sought after. Not to mention females, even males would hanker after these. These types of herbs and pellets couldn’t even be easily bought even if one had the money.</p>
