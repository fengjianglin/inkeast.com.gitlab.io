 <p><strong>597 - Fiery Golden Eyes, Heading to the Central Continent with Di Chen</strong></p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, it was the seventh day of the new year. Today was also the day of Luan Luan’s coming of age ceremony. In the World of the Nine Continents, the coming of age ceremony was a formal ceremony. After a bath, her hair needed to be cut and she had to change into adults clothes and put on makeup, this represented that she had turned into an adult.</p>
 <p>Only after they became an adult then they could marry someone, travel the world, make choices about their future, if they wanted to cultivate, be a farmer, carpenter, chef, merchant…...</p>
 <p>“Daddy, I am an adult now!”</p>
 <p>After Luan Luan had her coming of age ceremony, she happily hugged Qing Shui’s neck, her feet leaving the ground!</p>
 <p>“You are so big already and yet you are still acting like a child, are you not afraid of people laughing at you?” Qing Shui pinched Luan Luan’s nose and wriggled it left and right.</p>
 <p>“In front of daddy, I will always be a small kid.”</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange looked at Luan Luan from the side, her eyes full of happiness and there was also a feeling that could not be described, however, it was mostly happiness.</p>
 <p>Three days later, the Qing Clan returned to their previous lives, those who ran businesses ran businesses and those that opened shops opened shops. However, now there were the family members of the two Martial Saints, there were plenty of talented cultivators among them, they even had four peak Martial Kings.</p>
 <p>Now that the Qing Clan can be considered to be on the right track, Qing Shui planned to leave in a few days. His strength now was no longer suitable for the Greencloud Continent. He should travel the Nine Continents and experience more, see the world with his own eyes to let his strength rise faster. So that when the time comes, he would be able to help Di Chen, Yiye Jiange, the Old Ancestor, and Lin Zhanhan to achieve their dreams.</p>
 <p>Lion King's Ridge, Di Clan, Eastern Palace Clan, one was in the Central Continent, one in the Northern Sacred Lu Continent, and one in the Southern Viewing Ministry Continent. The situation with the Di Clan was a little special, but the Lion King’s Ridge and the Eastern Palace Clan had to be settled with blood.</p>
 <p>The Lion King's Ridge was the number one sect in the Northern Sacred Lu Continent, it was not something that the sects in the Greencloud Continent could compare with. As for the Eastern Palace Clan, the Old Ancestor had said before to not to go there until he had the strength of a Grade Five Martial Saint.</p>
 <p>Back then, due to his only grandson, he was forced to kill his own son with his hands. It had been many years already, but that torment was worse than death. He was the leader of a sect, the pillar of support, the expert protecting the sect, yet he could not protect his own son. He could only be forced by some silk pants disciple of a strong clan to kill his son just for his pleasure…...</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui already had the strength of a peak Grade Five Martial Saint but Qing Shui felt that things were not as simple as he thought. The Southern Viewing Ministry Continent was a relatively fertile continent with lots of resources and treasures, there were many strong sects and clan, some were even strong pirates, it was even said that there were some super strong Demonic Beasts of the seas dying in the Southern Viewing Ministry Continent.</p>
 <p>He had already waited all these years, he did not mind waiting for a little longer. Qing Shui intended to head towards the Southern Viewing Ministry Continent with Fei Wuji after some time, to repay that blood debt from back then.</p>
 <p>Now that it was time to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui returned to his own room.</p>
 <p>The Ancient Strengthening Technique had once again broken through to another cycle, after he practiced all his techniques once, Qing Shui prepared to refined medicinal pills. Suddenly, he remembered that when he broke through to the 6th Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique this time, he did not check to see if any new techniques or skills appeared.</p>
 <p>He had broken through when he was carrying his two children and had forgotten about this whole matter. Now that he remembered, Qing Shui hurriedly entered his sea of consciousness, then rapidly look towards the place with techniques or skills.</p>
 <p>Fiery Golden Eyes…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui look at the name of this technique and was shocked, he thought of the Fiery Golden Eyes he knew of from his past life. In his past life, the Fiery Golden Eyes in the myths could see through all forms of deceptions, it could see the true form of demons and ghosts.</p>
 <p>The part that Qing Shui was familiar with was that it could break transformations. Actually being able to see through transformations was the same thing, by seeing the true body of the opponent, they would have stripped away one of the opponent's abilities.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui did not know what was the effects of the Fiery Golden Eyes in the World of the Nine Continents, there were Demonic Beasts here but not demons.</p>
 <p>Holding onto his hope and anticipation, Qing Shui looked at the abilities of the Fiery Golden Eyes!</p>
 <p>After he read it, Qing Shui knew what was the deal with the Fiery Golden Eyes was. It was a Qi force technique, it could break some temporary effects on the opponent's body, such as Jewels, Demonic Beast essences, talismans, temporary effects of medicinal pills…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui currently did not know if the Fiery Golden Eyes were considered strong, but it should have some special usages during certain times. The experts of the World of the Nine Continents are very likely to be carrying jewels on them.</p>
 <p>The cultivation of the Fiery Golden Eyes could be divided into the stages of small success stage, large success stage, and then the Great Perfection Stage. The small success stage can break 10% of the temporary abilities on the opponent’s body, the large success stage can break 20%, and the Great Perfection Stage can break 50%.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not try to figure out whether it was strong or not since it was a reward of the 6th Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, Qing Shui felt that it should not be trash.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was still quite worried when cultivating it because he was somewhat afraid that he would cultivate till eyes would shine with a golden light. However, in the end, he had to try and cultivate it.</p>
 <p>Following the cultivation methods of the Fiery Golden Eyes, Qing Shui’s cultivation of it was very smooth. However, to cultivate it to the small success stage would still require a few days. When he cultivated the Fiery Golden Eyes, it was executed through his eyes, but he did not have any special feeling, his eyes were the same as usual, the only difference was that Qing Shui felt that his vision improved a little.</p>
 <p>Half a month later, Qing Shui prepared to head towards the Central Continent. This time, Qing Shui wanted to leave with Di Chen, maybe he could bring her to the Di Clan to have a look very soon.</p>
 <p>After another two days, Qing Shui informed his family members of his plans. Then he went to the Heavenly Palace. First, he went to Elder Ge since the Heavenly Palace was managed by him these days.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, are you leaving again?”</p>
 <p>This was not the first time and Qing Shui tended to come and go. When there were no problems in the middle, he would rarely come to the Heavenly Palace.</p>
 <p>“I do have this intention.” Qing Shui smiled as he sat across Elder Ge and poured himself a cup of tea, then filled Elder Ge’s cup up to 70%.</p>
 <p>“To the Central Continent?”</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, tell this old man what Grade of Martial Saints you can defeat now?” Elder Ge seemed to be curious about Qing Shui’s strength.</p>
 <p>“Probably Grade Five!” Qing Shui said after thinking for a little, it was now possible for him to defeat a peak Grade Five Martial Saint.</p>
 <p>“En, I see, then it is possible for you to go to the Central Continent but you must remember, do not provoke the Buddhist Sect, Duanmu Clan, Demon Gate, Tang Manor, Dragon Emperor Mountain, or the Sky City, these are the ones that I know of. When you see these people, do your best to tolerate and avoid them, you are currently not able to compare with them.” Elder Ge said to Qing Shui after thinking for awhile.</p>
 <p>This time, Qing Shui heard a familiar clan, the Duanmu Clan, those listed earlier should be amongst the strongest powers of the Central Continent. He did not expect the Duanmu Clan to be among them, he still did not know the extent of the Duanmu Clan’s power.</p>
 <p>“Elder Ge, do you understand these matters well? Can you tell me more? I am quite curious.” Qing Shui felt that it was good to hear about the powers of the Central Continent and their situations before heading there.</p>
 <p>“Haha, I only know what a few elders told me in the past, I can only tell you about them.” Elder Ge laughed as he drank some tea.</p>
 <p>“Why did Elder Ge not tell me about this the last time but is instead telling me now?” Qing Shui looked at Elder Ge, although he actually guessed the answer already.</p>
 <p>“The last time you went, your strength was not something that people will take notice of, plus you would avoid some of these experts. Now, it is different. Your strength is currently at a crucial position, thus, I am afraid that you would do something that you might regret.” Elder Ge said calmly.</p>
 <p>“I’ve cause Elder Ge to worry!”</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>Arriving at the Misty Hall, he met a female disciple that was standing guard. When she saw Qing Shui she smiled and greeted him. She then verified that he was looking for Di Chen before leaving quickly.</p>
 <p>In a short moment, Di Chen rode her Blue Luan out, Qing Shui just directly floated up then skywalked to Di Chen, landing on her Blue Luan. The Blue Luan gave a loud bird’s cry then left the Heavenly Palace mountain.</p>
 <p>“Sister Chen!”</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong, is there something you want to say?” Di Chen looked at Qing Shui and asked, she was not wearing her veil today. Although this was not the first time he saw her extraordinary complexion but he still felt moved by it.</p>
 <p>“I’m going to the Central Continent!” Qing Shui looked at the woman with a pure heart beside him, feeling at a loss in his heart.</p>
 <p>“Oh, you are here to say goodbye, do you want me to send you off?” Di Chen thought that Qing Shui would not want to go, that he would miss his family.</p>
 <p>“Of course, you have to send me all the way to the Central Continent. Come with me to the Central Continent, I should be able to bring you to see the Di Clan very soon.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>Di Chen stared blankly at Qing Shui, there were many times in the past where she wanted to go back and take a look. Sometimes she wished that she was an orphan. When she secretly left the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, she had just turned into an adult. She ran into danger when she was in the five million kilometers of wilderness, it was fortunate that she was saved by the previous Misty Hall Palace Mistress. Up until now, there were only some unpleasant exchanges with the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.</p>
 <p>[Author’s note: the background of Di Chen is a little complicated. There were some mistakes with the way I wrote about her background thus I shall clarify it here. She is from the Di Clan and was adopted by the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. She later left the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord and came to the Heavenly Palace, she stayed there until the previous Misty Hall Palace Mistress handed the position to her.]</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, the Di Clan is much stronger than the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.” Di Chen looked at Qing Shui and smiled.</p>
 <p>“I know, I do not intend on taking action against the Di Clan. Furthermore, it’s not like we are immediately going to the Di Clan after arriving in the Central Continent, but we should still go soon.</p>
 <p>“Sure, but you must promise me that you will act according to your strength, do not be reckless.” Di Chen slowly said after she thought for a while.</p>
 <p>“Sure, I will listen to you.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s words caused Di Chen to turn slightly red because she felt that she seemed like a wife managing her husband…...</p>
 <p>“When are we leaving?” Di Chen quickly changed the subject.</p>
 <p>“Start packing up, we leave in three days!”</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>Three days went by quickly.</p>
 <p>Ming!</p>
 <p>The Blue Luan cried out, Di Chen wore a snow white dress with a snow-white scarf. She seemed like a pure and unstained fairy. Qing Shui and his family already came out.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Di Chen then looked at Yiye Jiange, they were wearing a similar snow white clothing and the air they gave off were similar as well.</p>
 <p>Naturally, there were people that wanted to follow Qing Shui to the Central Continent, however, this was not the time. Qing Shui carried Qing Zun and Qing Yin. The two fellows did not know that Qing Shui was going to be leaving for a period of time and at this moment, they were happily laughing with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt reluctant to leave but he had no other choice. Di Chen took Qing Zun from Qing Shui’s hands, that young fellow actually stretched his hands out to grab onto her snow-white scarf.</p>
 <p>After they were delayed by an hour, Qing Shui and Di Chen mounted the Blue Luan and waved goodbye to the Qing Clan. The Blue Luan slowly flew further away and the Qing Clan slowly turned blurred before eventually disappearing from sight.</p>
 <p>“Sister Chen, do you intend to return to the Di Clan?” Qing Shui asked in a careless manner.</p>
 <p>As the Blue Luan flew rapidly, there were no winds at all because the speed of the Blue Luan seemed to be able to cut through the winds.</p>
 <p>“No, parents should not abandon their own child, regardless of the situation because that is the biggest sin they can commit.” Di Chen shook her head.</p>
 <p>“You don’t miss them?”</p>
 <p>“I miss my mother, it is a pity that she is no longer around.” Di Chen reminisced, her expression seemingly a little dull.</p>
