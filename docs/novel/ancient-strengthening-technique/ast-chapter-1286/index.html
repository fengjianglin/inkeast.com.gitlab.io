 <p><strong>AST 1286 - The Powerful Divine Beast's Blood Essence, Powerful Demonic Beast, Being Targeted</strong></p>
 <p>The increment to the grade of the Coiled Dragon Statue gave Qing Shui hope. This meant that the Spirit Gathering Lamp and the Heaven Shaking Drum would be going through an upgrade soon as well. He was full of anticipation of that day's arrival. Regardless what the situation, his demonic beasts were far too important for him.</p>
 <p>Another thing was his current abilities. His physical strength had increased by 2,000 nimbus and his overall strength increased by a lot. After all, he had the Seven-Colored Pellet, his Spiritual Weapon which was the Big Dipper Sword, the golden pellet, Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation, Divine Nebula Formation and others.</p>
 <p>The Formation Eye Stone made Qing Shui's movements even more astounding. His great speed and elusive movements also made him a lot stronger. Another thing was he had also recently started to cultivate the Seven Steps Nine Palace Crush.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used this once very long ago and didn't use it again thereafter. Today, he suddenly discovered that this battle technique was very powerful. It came with the Nine Palace Steps and when he performed the Nine Palace Steps with the Seven Steps Nine Palace Crush, each step he took would allow him to accumulate a certain amount of power which would then be unleashed explosively at the last step, crushing every obstacle within the Nine Palace.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stopped his trail of thoughts. After he tempered the magic treasures once, he looked at the two remaining drops of Divine Beast's Blood Essence and wondered which demonic beasts he should give them to.</p>
 <p>The Fire Bird had to take it, therefore, Qing Shui summoned it without any hesitation. However, the Fire Bird sent him a thought that it was unable to use the Divine Beast's Blood Essence because it belonged to a dragon.</p>
 <p>The Fire Bird had the phoenix's bloodline and the Dark Phoenix is also a type of phoenix. Moreover, it was a powerful one.</p>
 <p>This caught Qing Shui by surprise but he quickly understood. After all, this blood essence contain a powerful vitality which could even make the demonic beast that took it go through a transformation in their appearance.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was happier when he learned that the Fire Bird was unable to use it. He called out the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider and the Thunderous Beast. He first communicated with the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider and realized that it did not have any problem in taking the blood essence. The spider told him that it could engulf anything, even if it contained poison.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't hesitate and let the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider take the Divine Beast's Blood Essence directly.</p>
 <p>After the Fire Bird, Qing Shui was still a little worried if the Thunderous Beast would be able to use it. However, the result made him happy. The Thunderous Beast could use it but its appearance would forever remain as a violet Thunderous Beast and wouldn't go through any changes. This wasn't important. What was important was the Thunderous Beast's abilities.</p>
 <p>Very soon, the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider and the Thunderous Beast exuded brilliant light all over their body that sent an immense aura in all directions. The Seven-Headed Demonic Spider's cry was sharp and piercing, while the Thunderous Beast's body appeared to have flashing lightning that was accompanied by rolling sounds of thunder.</p>
 <p>When everything quieted down, Qing Shui was stunned. The Seven-Headed Demonic Spider still only had seven heads but the golden head in the middle grew two dragon horns, giving it an additional air of dominance. The entire Seven-Headed Demonic Spider now appeared very different from how it used to be.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that the changes to the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider this time around should be a very crucial one. It seemed that in the future, it would be able to fight alongside with his Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and the Fire Bird.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn't wait to see what level the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider had advanced to.</p>
 <p>Seven-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider!</p>
 <p>"Mmm, it's name has changed!" Qing Shui said in surprise.</p>
 <p>After seeing its name, Qing Shui once again looked toward the huge demonic spider. The golden head in the middle had not only grown two dragon horns, it also had a faint hint of a dragon's appearance. Of course, it was also limited to that particular head. However, it looked different from the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's dragon head. The Seven-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider's golden dragon head didn't appear as savage as the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's, but rather, appeared to be a little delicate.</p>
 <p>Could it be because the Seven-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider sounded like a female...</p>
 <p>Its physical strength had reached 70,000 nimbus, which was equivalent to seven suns. It was still a little bit off when compared to the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and the Fire Bird, but it was just a little. However, the Seven-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider was a control-type demonic beast.</p>
 <p>Five Qi Origin: Five-Headed Demonic Spider's innate battle technique, permanently increases its physical strength by 50 times and has zero depletion.</p>
 <p>The changes to the Five Qi Origin still took Qing Shui by surprise. He had expected a change, but not one by so much. It seemed that this was largely related with the dragon head. It had immediately rose up to the ranks of the Fire Bird and the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</p>
 <p>Corrosive Poison Web: The Seven-Headed Demonic Spider's all-encompassing web attack which have a powerful corrosive poison and stickiness. This web is so strong that it would be hard to cut through with blades. The damage caused by the poison web would be three times that of the damage it sustained.</p>
 <p>Poison Silk Entanglement: The Seven-Headed Demonic Spider can fire a thread of poison silk. This attack have a range of 3,000 meters and can be used to attack and entangle the target. Its speed is also very fast and it is highly toxic and sticky. The attacking prowess is five times stronger than that of its strength.</p>
 <p>There were no changes to these two battle techniques, but the range of the Poison Silk Entanglement had increased by 1,000 meters and the control had increased by quite a lot.</p>
 <p>Spider Swarm Attack: The unique ability of a king of demonic beasts. Its strong subjects would be able to attack together with it. The subjects could at most evolve into Six-Headed Demonic Spiders, with a certain chance of special mutated demonic spiders appearing.</p>
 <p>There was a little bit of change toward the end of this battle technique, but Qing Shui didn't really understand it. However, he had the feeling that it was a good thing and thus planned to test it out in the future.</p>
 <p>Flying Spider Silk: Passive battle technique, zero depletion. Speed permanently increases by 15 times.</p>
 <p>The Flying Spider Silk had also increased from ten times to 15 times, and to top it off, it was a passive battle technique. Qing Shui was very satisfied.</p>
 <p>Sharpness: The Seven-Headed Demonic Spider’s eight legs are incredibly sharp. They carry a high toxicity and penetrating ability.</p>
 <p>Unyielding Shield: The Seven-Headed Demonic Spider’s defense is extremely strong.</p>
 <p>Demonic Spider Dragon Head: Passive battle technique. Increases the toughness and sharpness of the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider, as well as the sturdiness, stickiness, and toxicity of its web by five times... In addition, it doubles attacking prowess, endurance, and sustainability. Zero depletion!</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui only felt exhilarated. The final battle technique became the Demonic Spider Dragon Head and its sturdiness, sharpness, and toxicity had all increased. Most importantly, even its attacking prowess had doubled. Power was also very important to control-type demonic beasts. With sufficient strength, their control would increase by a lot and even by several fold. Without power, even if the Seven-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider's silk can entangle the opponent, if it was too weak, it would probably to pulled away by the opponent. Even if the opponent didn't pull it away, it would also be able to escape. Therefore in this sense, the control would decrease by a lot.</p>
 <p>The Seven-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider's strongest attack, under the effect of the Demonic Spider Dragon Head, could now reach 3,500 suns. Its control was even more terrifying. Furthermore, with its toxicity and subordinates, even its purely killing prowess would be very terrifying.</p>
 <p>The Seven-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider happily transmitted a thought to Qing Shui and could also communicate with him. Its voice now was that of a mature lady, although it sounded a little metallic, it was still very pleasant to the ears. However, it was a bit unfamiliar and was easy to forget. Comparatively, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's voice was also very unique.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then finally turned to look toward the Thunderous Beast. There were no changes in its appearance but it increased quite a lot in size, by at least another one-third.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui's demonic beasts were about the same in size and were all at 200 meters or smaller. However, when the Fire Bird spreaded out its wings, it would seem to be able to cover up the skies.</p>
 <p>The Thunderous Beast's physical strength was at 40,000 nimbus, which was the equivalent to four suns. Although it was the weakest, Qing Shui was still extremely happy. It was because the Thunderous Beast's ability to control was even more powerful. Furthermore, growing from the strength of one sun to four suns was already quite powerful.</p>
 <p>Violet Thunder Protection: Unique ability of the Thunderous Beast. It can increase all of its abilities and make them 30 times stronger. It doesn't depletes energy and automatically circulates. If it received physical attacks, the Thunderous Beast have a chance of inflicting paralysis on its opponent, and concurrently, it can negate 20% of all its opponent's attacks.</p>
 <p>The ability of the Violet Thunder Protection increased to be more than double of what it was before. The powers of the Divine Beast's Blood Essence was really not to be underestimated. It seemed that this blood essence was truly that of a tremendous dragon.</p>
 <p>Thunderbolt: Releases an electrifying attack through its core. It is four times stronger than that of its physical attack and has a range of not exceeding 3,000 meters. This attack has a slight paralyzing effect. It also has the effect of speed reduction and reaction reduction on the opponents. This effect can be stacked. The depletion of the Thunderbolt is 10% of the usual depletion for attacks.</p>
 <p>Its attacking prowess doubled again, and the range had also increased by 1,000 meters. Its ability to control had gotten quite a lot stronger as well.</p>
 <p>There were no changes to the Violet Lightning Strike, Lightning Recovery, as well as the Violet Lightning Armor!</p>
 <p>Violet Thunder Chain Lightning: Launch a formidable Violet Lightning chain to attack an area. A successful attack has a chance of paralyzing the opponent! Attacking prowess is three times that of normal attacks!</p>
 <p>The attacking prowess had increased a little. This was considered an attack intended for a group.</p>
 <p>Thunder Flash: Passive ability, permanently increase speed by twelve fold!</p>
 <p>Its speed had increased quite significantly!</p>
 <p>Speed was a factor which would provide assurance for the control type demonic beast's ability to survive.</p>
 <p>There was no change to Mutual Destruction. Qing Shui wasn't surprised.</p>
 <p>Thunder's Fury: Passive battle technique with zero depletion. Can increases the prowess of Thunderbolts and Violet Lightning Strikes by three times!</p>
 <p>At the look of the Thunder's Fury at the very end, Qing Shui smiled. True to its name, it really instantaneously increased the Thunderous Beast's attacking prowess. Now, even the Thunderous Beast's attacks could reach 2,400 suns. This was when the most important skill of the Thunderous Beast was its ability to control.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui increasingly and earnestly hoped that the Spirit Gathering Lamp and the Heaven Shaking Drum would level up. When that happened, the four desolate sects would be able to become top-notch in the Western Oxhe Continent. No matter how talented those two geniuses from the Desolate Sect were, Qing Shui wouldn't be worried and would have absolute confidence in defeating them.</p>
 <p>The Spirit Channeling Jade had also improved. It was a pity that the two which he wanted to level up was still so stubborn. He had no idea when they would be able to level up.</p>
 <p>Cultivating, alchemy, drawing... The Golden Fragrance Jade's alchemy recipe was going to appear soon. However, Qing Shui now didn't have too much anticipation toward it. At the start, he felt that the medicinal pills he owned were very powerful, but he eventually realized that their restrictions were also very high as well. However, he noticed that refining these medicinal pills would increase his mastery in alchemy recipe. Furthermore, he still hoped that he would get a legendary medicinal pill which could truly resurrect the dead. It is a pity that he didn't know if it truly exists.</p>
 <p>That morning, Qing Shui got up very early. He came out from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal directly this time around as well. However, he came out before the time was up and then started his morning practice. Not long later, the two ladies came by.</p>
 <p>Breakfast was made by Qing Shui and there was a very good spread. However, before they started to eat, he felt that someone's spiritual sense had locked down on him. This spiritual sense didn't seem to belong to a human and felt very strange.</p>
 <p>Although he was locked down, Qing Shui knew that it was still very far away. However, he felt that the spiritual sense that had locked down on him was very strange. If he wasn't mistaken, it should be from a type of a unique demonic beast.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't know if he could finish the meal, but still chose to continue the meal with the two ladies.</p>
 <p>However, he was very curious. Who was trying to deal with him?</p>
 <p>He had offended quite a number of people, but at this time, there should only be one influence who would find trouble for him.</p>
 <p>Desolate Sect!</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui knew that the Desolate Sect had a little reputation and was on good terms with the barbarians, he wasn't worried at all.</p>
