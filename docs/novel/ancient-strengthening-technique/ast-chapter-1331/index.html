 <p><strong>AST 1331 - White Tiger Transformation, Yehuang Guwu’s past history</strong></p>
 <p>The increase in strength made Qing Shui feel particularly happy. His strength had actually increased by a few times within the short few days he went back to Qing Clan. This phenomenon made Qing Shui feel that he was closer to reaching the Eighth Heavenly Layer. In the past, he used to think that it was a tall mountain which could never be exceeded. But now, he somehow felt like a path had opened and that he would achieve it as long as he worked hard.</p>
 <p>He would definitely be able to step into the False God Realm as soon as he achieved the Eighth Heavenly Layer. Hence, Qing Shui stopped considering what he had to prepare to achieve False God.</p>
 <p>Other than that, it was the nameless technique. According to what Qing Shui had assumed, it should be something passed down from Joyous Meditation Sect of Buddha Sect. It’s just that he never expected it to be this strong. Or rather, it was because the women that he met were all perfect.</p>
 <p>In Duo Cultivation, Yin and Yang complemented each other. A lonely Yin wouldn’t grow, nor would a single Yang give rise to anything. Those methods to reduce Yin to nourish Yang or reduce Yang to nourish Yin were all low-class Duo cultivations. While the more decent ones would enable one side of it to grow without affecting the other. The top-class ones would help increase both sides together. Anything beyond that belonged to legendary or divine grade. Those Duo Cultivations could help significantly raise the strength of both Yin and Yang together.</p>
 <p>It was likely that this nameless technique belonged to at least a legendary grade. This martial technique had given a lot of benefits to Qing Shui. Not only that, even his women benefited a lot from it.</p>
 <p>By now, he already had an answer for it. If there were only twelve Portraits of Beauty, at least Yu He would be removed from the list. The reason being that she didn’t manage to establish contact with the Twelve Heavenly Meridians. But she managed to awaken one Golden Star, leading to a significant change in her Spirit Energy.</p>
 <p>It could also be that the twelve Portraits of Beauty were now complete. Other than the extremely beautiful woman in palace costume, who was on top of the enormous green dragon, he had seen the rest of the women.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was sitting inside the pavilion. It was now halfway through the morning. The others had all gone to cultivate. Those who were going into seclusion had done so. This time, Qing Shui had brought great opportunities for them. Including the third generation, everyone wanted to visit the other few continents. Which men wouldn’t feel heroic? Which men wouldn’t feel ambitious?</p>
 <p>A real man would hold a three foot long sword in their hand and achieve outstanding things.</p>
 <p>Yun Duan and Hai Dongqing approached here. As for Qing Yun, someone else was still playing with her. The two girls came to Qing Shui when they saw him daydreaming. Qing Shui only noticed the two women when they were in the pavilion.</p>
 <p>He stood up and grabbed the two women into his embrace and once again sat in the pavilion.</p>
 <p>“What were you thinking about? You seemed really deep in thought,” Hai Dongqing smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>“I am thinking whether you will finally be pregnant this time considering the amount of times I have worked hard this visit.” Qing Shui smiled and looked at the wise and elegant woman.</p>
 <p>“Are you seeking death?!” Hai Dongqing yelled at Qing Shui. Her face was a bit red. Her entire face became filled with blood every time she thought about the scene of her and him alone together. This man was very demanding. At the moment when he released himself, he displayed a lot of embarrassing stances as well as language.</p>
 <p>Yun Duan saw Hai Dongqing’s expression. Unknowingly, she also started blushing. And right at this moment, Qing Shui also happened to be looking right at her. He couldn’t help but laugh looking at both her and Hai Dongqing’s shy look. He somehow felt a bit high-spirited and proud. At this moment, he felt incomparably satisfied with himself.</p>
 <p>“It’s time you should be leaving again!” Hai Dongqing smiled and asked after she her expression returned to normal.</p>
 <p>“Yes, I can come back once every month. It was so much better compared to before. In the future, I can always keep you guys by my side. That way, we won’t have to separate from each other anymore.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, I am already very happy. Initially, I even thought that we might not be able to meet each other for ten to twenty years,” Yun Duan responded happily.</p>
 <p>Because of Duo Cultivation, the strength of Qing Shui’s women was improving at a very fast pace. Even when they were not from the Portraits of Beauty, they were still improving very rapidly. For example, Yun Duan, Mingyue Gelou. They were not much inferior to the women from Portraits of Beauty. They were all extremely beautiful women.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn’t worried with the fourth generations of Qing Clan. With his current ability, if he were to build up a foundation for them since young, they would at least turn out to be warriors with decent strength. The main ones were the third and second generations of Qing Clan.</p>
 <p>That person must be really strong, that’s how Qing Shui felt. The gap between him and his mother would be really huge. It had been so many years, people would change. Where could he be? Was he now a formidable person?</p>
 <p>On the last day, Qing Shui spent his time with his women and children. He looked at each and every one of his extremely beautiful women. They were all his women. Of course, there were also his daughters who were like small princesses. It was just that in comparison, he had fewer sons. Qing Zun, Qing Ming, Qing Long. Both Qing Zun and Qing Ming were already confirmed to not have any problems in terms of what they could achieve in the future.</p>
 <p>Qing Long was still young. He was bashful like a tiny calf. Even though he was still young, Qing Shui had already helped him decided on his path to cultivate. He was going to cultivate his body.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, it had been a week since Qing Shui returned to Qing Clan. After bidding farewell to Qing Clan, he immediately used the ability of the Five Elements Divine Flag to transport husband and wives. He wanted to go have a look at Western Oxhe Continent. In any case, it was really convenient for him to go wherever he wanted now.</p>
 <p>This time, they didn’t feel awkward with each other. Yehuang Guwu was standing by the window of the bamboo house looking far away into the distance. At the moment when Qing Shui appeared beside her, she turned around and smiled, “You’re back.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, Martial Aunt, what are you thinking about?” Qing Shui was standing beside her by the window and they were looking at the boundless sky and earth outside. Suddenly, he realized that he was slowly becoming calmer.</p>
 <p>“Your strength is improving at a very fast pace,” Yehuang Guwu changed the topic and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui pulled her gently when he saw her exhausted eyes, “Let’s go, I will help you relax yourself.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sat down opposite her. He extended his hands and put them on her shoulder. He slowly lifted up all ten of his fingers and after that, dropped them down very rapidly. He was doing it with average force. There was also a unique energy mixed within it.</p>
 <p>“Martial Aunt, let me teach you a martial technique. With your body type, I think you should be really suitable for it. I can feel a mysterious energy within your body. You should be able to draw out terrifying strength with it.” Qing Shui felt it when he was massaging her.</p>
 <p>“Oh, what martial technique?” Yehuang Guwu seemed to be really curious.</p>
 <p>“Tiger Form!”</p>
 <p>“Alright!”</p>
 <p>Just like this, they agreed to practice it. Both Qing Shui and the woman headed off to the beach outside while Yu Ruyan and Tantai Xuan were still going through their seclusions. Yehuang Guwu said that they had actually managed to step into some kind of grade by accident this time. If they were lucky, they might even be able to come in contact with the great door of Heavenly Dao. The great door of Heavenly Dao wasn’t something which only powerful people could step into.</p>
 <p>There were still other people who were quite unique along the road. For example, great scholars, great artists, doctors, alchemists, craftsman and such. It was possible for them to step into Heavenly Dao and became a super existence in their respective fields.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui practiced the forms first, he didn’t stop at all. At his current level, there was no need for him to slow down purposely. He took great pains to explain everything while he performed the stances of the full Tiger Form, gradually manifesting a golden gigantic tiger.</p>
 <p>State of Demonic Beast Manifestation!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui has already achieved the State of Demonic Beast Manifestation. When he thrust out his fist with his Tiger Form, an entire tiger would appear from it, just like an actual ferocious tiger.</p>
 <p>The woman only started moving after Qing Shui stopped. She was moving very slowly. However, Qing Shui was startled by it.</p>
 <p>As thought, her body type was made to be the most suitable to cultivate Tiger Form, his own Tiger Form in particular.</p>
 <p>She might be moving slowly but each and every one of her moves looked graceful and remarkably true to life. Furthermore, she was improving at a terrifying rate. Qing Shui could feel that the woman had already jumped out of the restrictions of Tiger Form with his Spiritual Sense.</p>
 <p>Kong!</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, the woman thrust out a punch. As she did so, an enormous snow white jade tiger appeared in front of her. It didn’t disperse. It was giving out majestic aura.</p>
 <p>White Tiger Transformation!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked towards the white tiger with his Heavenly Vision Technique and was stunned.</p>
 <p>White Tiger, Grade Silver. Formed by condensing energy together. It possessed strength one fold stronger than that of its owner. Zero consumption. The energy could last for fifteen minutes. Controlled with consciousness, zero consumption. It was possible that it would disperse when hit by sufficient strength.</p>
 <p>Was this woman reincarnated from a white tiger? Qing Shui was startled as he watched her condensing the white tiger that was almost fifty meters. Within half a day, the woman had already surpassed the Tiger Form which he taught her.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the woman felt as if she just woke up from a long dream. After that, she once again condensed it. Yet another white tiger which looked exactly the same as the one before appeared beside her.</p>
 <p>“For now, two white tigers are all that I can manage at the same time. But everytime I condense a White Tiger, it consumes 10% of my overall strength.” Yehuang Guwu looked at Qing Shui in shock with her beautiful pupils.</p>
 <p>“It seems only you are capable of cultivating the Tiger Form up to this kind of state. The others are all incapable of doing so.” Even Qing Shui himself admired her a little. How good would it be if he could cultivate up to this kind of level as well?</p>
 <p>“Actually, even I myself didn’t know how things turned out like this. The things before this were like a dream to me.” Yehuang Guwu looked like she was trying very hard to think back on the things before.</p>
 <p>“This is how it should be,” Qing Shui smiled and responded.</p>
 <p>“Thank you. To me, this Martial Technique may already well be considered a supreme level technique,” Yehuang Guwu said in excitement.</p>
 <p>“Martial Aunt, is everything in Western Oxhe Continent alright?” Qing Shui smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>“No, don’t worry about it, you can relax even more with me here now. This place isn’t the Phoenix Dancing Continent, nor is it the other two continents.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, Martial Aunt. If the Yehuang Clan in Yehuang Country came up to me, what shall I do?” Qing Shui asked after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>“Kill them if you can. But the precondition is that you need to stay safe yourself. Before reaching peak Martial Emperor, do not engage in combat with Yehuang Clan,” Yehuang Guwu said after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>“Are you aware that there are False Gods within Yehuang Clan?” Qing Shui smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>“I know but so long as Yehuang Clan isn’t facing a crisis in which they may get the entire clan eliminated, no one will dare to disturb the False God within the clan,” Yehuang Guwu said calmly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui let out a sigh of relief the moment he heard Yehuang Guwu’s words. He smiled and said, “Martial Aunt, are you someone from Yehuang Clan?”</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu looked at Qing Shui. After a moment of thoughts, she spoke slowly, “No, are you wondering why I still have the surname Yehuang?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded his head and didn’t say anything.</p>
 <p>“My mom was insulted by the people from Yehuang Clan. After that, they abandoned her like a pair of torn shoes. But my mom’s life was saved by someone else. He was a member from one of the branches of Yehuang Clan. He liked my mother, despite my mother being pregnant, he still married her and made her his wife. Ever since I was born, he even treated me like I was his own daughter. But later on, that person found out about it and soon, the entire family fell apart. He killed my father. My mother died too, she committed suicide. Because of her, my father’s entire family ended up getting killed. Hence, she had no choice but to accompany him. He might not have been my blood-related father but I followed after him with my surname. Not the current family name of Yehuang Clan.” When Yehuang Guwu talked up to this point, she seemed really calm. However, Qing Shui was able to feel the overflowing killing intent deep down in her heart.</p>
 <p>No wonder she looked so tired. She still needed to pretend like she was strong and happy. No wonder in Phoenix Dancing Continent, she didn’t……</p>
 <p>“Martial Aunt, believe me, you will definitely be able to seek your vengeance yourself. Very soon, you will have the ability to do so.” Qing Shui knew that she wouldn’t hesitate to kill the blood-related father of hers. The reason being that they didn’t share even the slightest family love with each other. On the contrary, the only existing feeling she had for him was hatred. Her mom was abandoned by them like torn shoes after being humiliated. To people like them, it’s best to make mincemeat out of them.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could already figure out her story with Yehuang Clan back then when the woman told him not to save anyone from Yehuang Clan. But he never expected the story to be like this. Actually, almost every aristocratic clan would run into incidents like this. But it was impossible for every clan to have a person like Yehuang Guwu.</p>
