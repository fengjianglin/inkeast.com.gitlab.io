 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2239 - Eight-Legged Jiao Tiger, Half-Blooded Sky-Obstructing Crow</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I want to know if the Five Tiger Immortal Palace's Guardian is strong."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui didn't beat around the bush and went straight to the point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old Golden Battle God hadn't expected that Qing Shui would ask this. He gave it some thought and said, "Qing Shui, the reason that the Five Tiger Immortal Palace is able to exist for so long and become allies with the Demon Gate isn't just because they are strong. It's also because of their Guardian Beast."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui understood upon hearing this. Their Guardian Beast was very strong. However, he asked once again, "Can Old Master please tell me what that Guardian Beast is?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old Golden Battle God sighed and added, "It's an Ancient Rare Species that is in the prime of its age. It's an Eight-Legged Jiao Tiger."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Eight-Legged Jiao Tiger... Qing Shui wasn't familiar with this demonic beast. He asked, puzzled, "Even if it's a mutated Dragon Tiger, it can't be that strong, right? Jiaos aren't that strong either."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Qing Shui, you underestimate demonic beasts too much. There are also Jiaos that have surpassed actual dragons. The Eight-Legged Jiao Tigers were also terrifying existences back in ancient times. They are a species that can reach the eighth level of the Cave Realm. This is an extremity. Only pure-blooded and powerful species can reach the ninth level of the Cave Realm. For the others, the eighth level is already the limit," The old Golden Battle God looked at Qing Shui and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The eighth level of the Cave Realm... Qing Shui was currently at the fourth level and was still some distance away from the eighth level. Fortunately, he had the Emperor’s Might and wasn't afraid that he'd be suppressed. However, he wasn't sure if this Eight-Legged Jiao Tiger was still at the Cave Realm and he had no idea of its exact strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Old Master, what's our Divine Palace's Guardian?" Qing Shui asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I thought you knew. Our Divine Palace's Guardian Beast is a Half-Blooded Sky-Obstructing Crow." The old Golden Battle God smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui knew about the Sky-Obstructing Crows. They were also powerful existences back in ancient times. It was said that the Sky-Obstructing Crows were also descendants of phoenixes. However, there was nothing to prove this. Dragons were known to have a lot of descendants, but the same went for phoenixes. Eagles, sparrows, Luans, rocs, swallows, and other species had a faint hint of phoenix blood in them. This was what some of the historical books wrote.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Half-Blooded. The Divine Palace's Sky-Obstructing Crow was only half-blooded. Wouldn't it only be half as powerful of a full-blooded one? Wrong, being half-blooded would mean that it would be several times weaker. However, even a Half-Blooded Sky-Obstructing Crow was already a powerful existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Divine Palace's Half-Blooded Sky-Obstructing Crow has protected the Divine Palace for many years ever since this Divine Palace was founded. However, our Divine Palace hasn't been founded for that long. The reason we can have a standing in the Northern Emperor Domain is also because of it." The old Golden Battle God was very respectful at the mention of the Half-Blooded Sky-Obstructing Crow. After all, it was older than everyone here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'd like to go take a look at it," Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Go on, it's at the back of the mountain," The old Golden Battle God said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui went to the back of the mountain but didn't see the Guardian Beast. However, his strength was unlike what it had been before, and his Spiritual Sense was very strong. Thus, he could sense that powerful aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To be able to stand up against the Five Tiger Immortal Palace in the Northern Emperor Domain... This meant that the Divine Palace's Sky-Obstructing Crow was very powerful and was definitely not weaker than the Eight-Legged Jiao Tiger. Therefore, Qing Shui came to take a look at the Divine Palace's Guardian. He wanted to see if he could get this powerful existence to help him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui stood there quietly. After about an hour, Qing Shui raised his head and looked toward a mountain peak. There was a large bird that was pitch-black like ink. It wasn't really that big and was only about two meters tall, emitting a faint cyclone that was like black clouds. Its eyes gleamed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui flew straight toward that mountain peak and said, "Qing Shui pays respect to Lord Guardian."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Haha, so you're Qing Shui. There's no need to stand on ceremony. I've heard your name many times but hadn't expected you to be so young. Not bad, not bad. The Divine Palace might be able to take flight because of you." A deep, middle-aged male voice rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was nothing special about this voice, but it gave off an amiable feeling that made him seem very easy to get along with and that people would be convinced by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Lord Guardian is too kind. I have some things here as a gift." Qing Shui brought out some stuff. There were the Bloodline Pellets, Ancient Demonic Fruit, and others. Each of the items was priceless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui had heard what the old Golden Battle God had mentioned previously that this was a Half-Blooded Sky-Obstructing Crow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sky-Obstructing Crow didn't seem to show much reaction to these things but looked calmly at Qing Shui and asked, "You want my help?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui shook his head. "Lord Guardian, you think too much. Don't think of me as those kinds of people. It's just to a part of my sincerity that I want to give these to you. There are definitely no other hidden intentions behind them."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui wanted to get the Sky-Obstructing Crow to help him but hadn't wanted to use anything to control it. It wasn't about whether he could do this or not, but that he hadn't thought of doing it. Moreover, Qing Shui really respected this powerful existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I believe you, but these things are too precious. I can't take them," The Sky-Obstructing Crow said very seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Please accept them. I don't just have this one set. I'll be able to prepare another set if given the time."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sky-Obstructing Crow didn't reject any further and received these things. At the very least, these things could raise his bloodline’s purity by 10% or even more. He was only of a half-blooded lineage and if he could reach 80% of his blood lineage, then his abilities would be able to increase a lot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Qing Shui prepared to leave, the Sky-Obstructing Crow said, "Right now, the most important thing for you is to cultivate. When you're strong enough, there's nothing you'll need to struggle over."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui went back after staying in the Divine Palace for half a day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He believed in Sky-Obstructing Crow's words. It showed that the Sky-Obstructing Crow knew what he was thinking of doing, thus Qing Shui decided to wait a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few days later, someone came to the Imperial Cuisine Hall. Qing Shui was stunned as a lady walked in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had a slender figure, like a fairy who had descended from the vast starry skies. Her aura was graceful... and the word dignified wasn't enough to be used to describe her. Qing Shui felt that she could only be described as a celestial being.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her eyes were like the bright moon in the sky, pure yet deep, impressive and intelligent-looking to the extent that it was hard for one to look at her in the eyes. Even now, Qing Shui still felt astonishment and ashamed of his unseemliness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There seemed to be a faint layer of fog around her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She wore white clothes with an image of a snow-white Divine Phoenix. She emitted strong power and gave off an intense aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Huang. To think that she gave Qing Shui a surprise once again. She had been able to find him previously, and this time around, she found him once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Qing Shui had left the Phoenix City, she was in seclusion and thus he only left a letter. He didn't know where he would be and thus, didn't tell her anything about his whereabouts. He merely told her that he would be heading north.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back then, he had planned to open an Imperial Cuisine Hall in the Northern Blue City which was next to the Phoenix City. However, after finding a place and before the business could even start, Qing Shui had left the place.</span></p>
