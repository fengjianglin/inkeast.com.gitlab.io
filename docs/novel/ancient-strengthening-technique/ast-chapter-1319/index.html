 <p><strong>AST 1319 - This Is Scorpiosnake Poison [1], The Great Yehuang Clan, Powerful Life and Death Needles</strong></p>
 <p>Li Husheng looked at Soulsearch and asked uneasily, his eyes filled with anticipation.</p>
 <p>"Mister Li, I'll only be able to suppress it temporarily," Soulsearch said a little helplessly.</p>
 <p>A faint hint of disappointment appeared on Li Husheng's face. He was clear about his own condition and had approached many physicians for help. However, out of all the physicians he had approached, only Soulsearch was able to temporarily suppress it. In the long term, there was still no cure. Therefore, Soulsearch told him to look for better alchemists and physicians to help him.</p>
 <p>The yang energy in his body continued to decrease and now, even his adam's apple was deteriorating and his lower body was shrinking. This was driving him crazy. If all of his yang energy were to dissipate, then he would lose his life as well. Soulsearch could only help him to control his condition for half a year. If he still couldn't find someone who could treat him within this time, he would probably only be able to hang on for another half a year at most.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, why don't you take a look at Mister Li's condition? He's a good man," Soulsearch smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Hearing Soulsearch's words, Qing Shui knew that the former was trying to tell him that this person was unlike Li Ye and was a person he could treat. Therefore, Qing Shui smiled and nodded.</p>
 <p>Li Husheng felt a little dejected. It could be because Qing Shui was still young. However, he still looked toward Qing Shui and said, "What do you need me to do?"</p>
 <p>"Let me take your pulse."</p>
 <p>Hearing Qing Shui's words, Li Husheng reached out his hand. However, there was still disappointment in his eyes. Soulsearch was a master in taking pulses and seeing Qing Shui's method, which seemed to be ordinary, he didn't hold much hope.</p>
 <p>Very soon, Qing Shui was stunned and he looked at Li Husheng.</p>
 <p>"You've been poisoned?"</p>
 <p>"Poison? That's impossible!" Li Husheng looked at Qing Shui in doubt.</p>
 <p>When Soulsearch heard what Qing Shui said, he was also taken aback. He then looked toward Qing Shui. Soulsearch felt that this was a strange illness where one's yang energy would deteriorate. One could only be healthy when the yin and yang energies in their body were balanced.</p>
 <p>If either was completely lost, one would lose their life.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui was very agitated as well. It was because he had encountered the symptoms of a poison he was familiar with. He smiled and said, "This poison is very mysterious and is called the Scorpiosnake Poison. This poison is given through a woman. Mister Li, you should who it was by now."</p>
 <p>While Qing Shui was saying this, he was very surprised as well. To think that the Scorpiosnake Poison really existed. This poison wasn't harmful to women but on the contrary, would make them appear more charming and beautiful. However, the man who had sex with the woman would be poisoned. Of course, there was a time restriction to the Scorpiosnake Poison. For example, after the woman took it, she must have sex with the man within a stipulated time period for the man to be poisoned.</p>
 <p>"Then are you able to cure it?" Li Husheng seemed to have a hint of hope ignited in him and he looked toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"I can but it's best for you to ask for the antidote. Otherwise, it'll be very hard for your cultivation to improve in the future," Qing Shui said calmly.</p>
 <p>"Thank you. I'll visit another day to express my thanks. I shan't waste any time and shall take my leave for now."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>"Brother's medical skills are really amazing," Soulsearch said in admiration.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't say much about this but just smiled and asked, "Elder Brother, is there a Yehuang Clan in the Yehuang Country?"</p>
 <p>"Of course there is. The head of the Yehuang Country is a gigantic existence. It's said that there are False God experts in their clan." Soulsearch's reply was very fast. This was no secret. The majority of the cultivators in the Dancing Phoenix Continent knew about this and it was said that every top notch clan in each country would have experts at the False God level. Therefore, Soulsearch spoke without any hesitation.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui had guessed this answer, he was still stunned. Yehuang Guwu should be a member of the Yehuang Clan. However, with such a powerful clan, why did she insist on staying in the Western Oxhe Continent?</p>
 <p>"Elder Brother, how does the Yehuang Clan compare to the Li Clan's main branch?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>"There's nothing to compare. The difference is far too great. False God experts are far too terrifying and although Li Clan isn't bad, they are still a far cry in comparison." Soulsearch shook his head. Even he had only occasionally gone to a great existence like the Yehuang Clan and it was so that he could provide treatment for a member of their clan.</p>
 <p>It was a pity that with his medical skills, he wasn't able to cure the patient completely. Therefore, eventually, he wasn't able to get into the top notch circle in the Yehuang Country. Compared to the world in Qing Shui's previous life, the Yehuang Country was many times larger. Therefore, it was still very hard for one to become the best physician in the country.</p>
 <p>"Elder Brother, do you know of the Demon Lord Palace?" Qing Shui had been wanting to ask this for a very long time.</p>
 <p>"The Demon Lord Palace isn't located on any continent but is at the intersection between the Dancing Phoenix Continent, Soaring Dragon Continent and the Haohan Continent. It could be said that it doesn't belong to any continent," Soulsearch said weirdly.</p>
 <p>"Why is that so?" Qing Shui asked, puzzled.</p>
 <p>"It's said that the Demon Lord Palace couldn't be accepted by orthodox sects. I'm not too sure why. Anyway, many people want to get rid of the Demon Lord Palace." Soulsearch looked at Qing Shui. He seemed to not be very sure either.</p>
 <p>He didn't ask Qing Shui anything else. He knew that Qing Shui was very mysterious but in this area, even if they were on quite good terms, he didn't ask. He knew that if Qing Shui wished to say, he would do so himself. Moreover, there were some things which might not be good for him to know about.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had wanted to go take a look at the Demon Lord Palace but he knew that now wasn't the time. It was because he knew that if he wished to help her, he would at least have to reach the False God realm.</p>
 <p>He knew that that woman wouldn't be against everyone from the three continents. It should be some people from the Dancing Phoenix Continent or the Soaring Dragon Continent. It was because, when the world was so big, it was impossible for one to make an enemy out of the entire world.</p>
 <p>It seemed a little impossible even if it was an entire continent. It could be a continent's capital. A continent's capital could at least represent a large part of a continent!</p>
 <p>Since that was the case, Qing Shui decided not to think about it for now. If he really wanted to help her, he must first get stronger.</p>
 <p>"Elder Brother, can I help you out as an assistant in the Imperial Cuisine Hall?" Qing Shui smiled and said to Soulsearch.</p>
 <p>Soulsearch's eyes lit up, "I'd be willing to give the entire Imperial Cuisine Hall to you."</p>
 <p>"There's no need for that. I'll also research in medicinal cuisine here and get to know some people. It's because I need to get information about some things. If there aren't many people and if they aren't people with abilities, then it'll be hard for me to get the information I need," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"I'll more than willing for Brother to stay. To tell you the truth, I haven't gotten married in my entire life but there's a lady who has been willing to stay with me. However, I still feel that I'm alone. With my job, I do have some friends but it's all because of my medical skills. Although it's also because of Brother's medical skills. I have came across many powerful physicians in the past as well. You're the only one I have such a strong sense of affinity with," Soulsearch smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was surprised that the old man was by himself. After all, something like this was very rare. A person like him should belong to a great clan.</p>
 <p>"Elder Brother, pardon my insolence. Why didn't you get married and have kids? You don't like it?" Qing Shui looked at the old man.</p>
 <p>"I'm the Ghost Physician and I've treated several hundreds of thousands of people before. However, it's a pity that I'm not able to cure myself." The old man appeared to be extremely bitter when he said this.</p>
 <p>In Qing Shui's previous life, there was a saying that for 30 years, the father venerates the son. 30 years later, the son venerates the father.</p>
 <p>In this world, time was very long. It would basically take 300 years. If one didn't attain any achievements within 300 years, things would be set in stone. Without any accidents, everyone would be able to reach a peak after 300 years and most people would basically not progress any further after 300 years of age.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui grabbed Soulsearch's wrist and took his pulse. He was stunned. Although the old man's medical skills were very amazing, he had a Jueyang Meridian Pulse. It would bring no negative impact to one's body but on the contrary, the person's physical body would be very strong. However, the only thing was that he would not be able to impregnate a lady...</p>
 <p>Soulsearch's age wasn't considered to be very old. He had a woman but no wife. It was because he knew that he couldn't impregnate women and thus had never taken on a wife.</p>
 <p>Due to this, he had grown much older. After giving it some thought, Qing Shui looked at Soulsearch, "I don't have absolute confidence in your ailment but there's slightly over 50% chance. Are you willing to try it out?"</p>
 <p>Soulsearch was really not very old and had a long life before him. The lady who was by his side was also one he liked. And although she didn't say anything, she had always wanted to bear a child for Soulsearch. She knew of Soulsearch's situation but yet was still unwilling to leave him.</p>
 <p>"Really?" Soulsearch looked at Qing Shui in surprise.</p>
 <p>Soulsearch trusted a lot in Qing Shui's medical skills.</p>
 <p>"I can give it a try immediately. You'll get to know in a while. I'll first apply acupuncture on you. It'll let you become younger."</p>
 <p>Nine Yang Constitution Nurturing. When one's vitality was more stabilized and stronger and when one's cells became younger and more powerful, one would appear younger. He didn't have confidence in the past but right now, he did.</p>
 <p>Earlier, after seeing the Imperial Cuisine Hall, Qing Shui had decided on his future path. He decided to stay here. As for Soulsearch, Qing Shui could help him a lot. Soulsearch was even more than willing to give the Imperial Cuisine Hall to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Soulsearch had a strong network and if he were to bring out the Imperial Cuisine Hall, there was nothing for him to fear. Furthermore, with his medical skills, it was hard for him to not become famous in the Yehuang Country.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out a drop of Spring of Life and got Soulsearch to take it. When Soulsearch saw it, he was stunned. He clenched his teeth and took it. The old man's Jueyang Meridian Pulse was like the Necrozoospermia condition in Qing Shui's previous life. His life essence was practically dead and the Jueyang Meridian Pulse was basically incurable.</p>
 <p>The Spring of Life had a large percentage of healing in it. Furthermore, the treatment from Qing Shui's acupuncture would bring the chances up to over 80%. The Life and Death Needles were very powerful and this time around, the benefits that Soulsearch would gain were immeasurable.</p>
 <p>Time passed by and the Life and Death Needles suddenly spewed out a stream of gray aura. However, Qing Shui reached out his hand to the bottom and lit up the primordial flames, incinerating it. it was because it would be harmful to the people who were to take in such death Qi.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stimulated his Force of Rebirth and then to his surprise, a layer of dry and cracking old skin appeared on Soulsearch's body and blood. In less than 7.5 minutes, they shattered.</p>
 <p>The Life and Death Needles were truly amazing. He could sense that even though these needles couldn't bring one back to life nor allow one's flesh and bones to be regenerated, he felt that his mastery of the Life and Death Needles had gone through another tremendous improvement.</p>
 <p>The Life and Death Needles were truly a divine artifact for physicians!</p>
 <p>When the old man saw the fragmented skin and Qing Shui drawing back the needles, he did not care if he sounded desperate and asked, "Brother, how is it?"</p>
 <p>"Elder Brother, you're lucky. One year later, you'll definitely be able to get a child."</p>
 <p>"Really?!"</p>
 <p>"I'm not going to leave anyway. You'll find out not long later." Seeing that Soulsearch was very happy, Qing Shui felt happy as well. Helping others brings joy to oneself.</p>
 <p>As if he had realized that he didn't smell good, partially because he didn't notice it in his state of joy, Soulsearch looked at his horrible state and quickly greeted Qing Shui and ran to wash up.</p>
 <p>He didn't realize that his vitality was stronger than before and his body seemed more upright now!</p>
 <p>After he washed up and stood before a mirror, he was stunned. To think that he reverted to his middle-aged appearance. Although things like this happened often in this world, he still found it a little unbelievable when it happened to him.</p>
