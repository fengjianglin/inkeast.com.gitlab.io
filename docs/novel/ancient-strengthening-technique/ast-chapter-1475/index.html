 <p><strong>AST 1475 - Yehuang Guwu’s Pregnancy, Yan Lang</strong></p>
 <p>Even without Hua Rumei’s prompt, Qing Shui would’ve left together with Tantai Lingyan. But since Hua Rumei had already spoken, the atmosphere became a little weird. Hua Rumei precisely wanted this effect. Qing Shui smiled at Hua Rumei before he left with Tantai Lingyan.</p>
 <p>The two of them walked side by side. Tantai Lingyan didn’t say anything but wasn’t unhappy. She casually walked along, and Qing Shui could even sense how carefree she was.</p>
 <p>“Are you happy?” Qing Shui smiled as he asked.</p>
 <p>If it was some other woman, Qing Shui wouldn’t ask this question. But this was a very good question to ask Tantai Lingyan because he had no idea what she was thinking of or how she felt right now.</p>
 <p>Tantai Lingyan was stunned for a moment. This was the second time she had heard this question. Could it be that this question was very important to him?</p>
 <p>“Why are you asking this?” Tantan Lingyan glanced at Qing Shui as they continued walking.</p>
 <p>“I wish to know.”</p>
 <p>“Is this very important?” Tantai Lingyan’s mouth curled slightly up. In that instant, it was as if a rainbow bloomed overhead. She was incomparably radiant.</p>
 <p>“It is very important.” Qing Shui replied.</p>
 <p>“Compared to the past, I feel more relaxed now. The pressure that was like a huge mountain pressing down on me has dissipated by more than half. I guess I can be considered happy?” Tantai Lingyan replied vaguely.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t even know what to think after hearing that. Maybe it was like what she said, that she ‘could be considered’ happy. At the very least, it was not a bad answer. This was a good thing.</p>
 <p>“What plans do you have in the future?” Qing Shui asked after being silent for a few moments.</p>
 <p>Tantai Lingyan started a bit but soon recovered, “Are you planning to leave?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui contemplated a little before he replied, “Not for the time being. I still have something important I have yet to accomplish. I just want to hear what your future plans are. Regardless whether I leave or not, I’m already yours. I belong to the Demon Lord Palace.”</p>
 <p>Tantai Lingyan pouted a little while staring at him. She didn’t know if Qing Shui was intentionally saying this or not but she felt that it was on purpose. It didn’t really matter even if it was so.</p>
 <p>“In the near future, I only want the Demon Lord Palace to become more powerful. I don’t wish for any other powers to bully us.” Tantai Lingyan spoke lightly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stared at her. Although this woman was cold at times, she was very kind inside her heart. Although the Demon Lord Palace was the leader of the four evil forces, they had never committed bloody atrocities or outrageously evil acts.</p>
 <p>“This wish of yours will surely come true. After you become strong, there would be no one who would dare to touch the Demon Lord Palace.”</p>
 <p>“The strength of an individual will only protect us for a moment. After this individual disappears, the consequences will be unimaginable.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was able to understand this sentence. His Qing Clan was a very good example. Although back then they weren’t that strong, they had enjoyed a high status because of Qing Shui gradually growing stronger. But if something had befallen Qing Shui back then, the entire Qing Clan would have surely been in miserable straits. If that’s the case, they might as well have never risen up before.</p>
 <p>For all the large and powerful clans, there would certainly be an individual who carried the fate of the clan on his back. No matter how strong someone was, he wouldn't dare boast that he’s invincible. If there’s an accidental defeat, his clan would be in mortal danger.</p>
 <p>“Lingyan, you are still young. At the very least, the Demon Lord Palace can have peace for thousands of years. With such a huge amount of time, there will surely be more new experts appearing. Even now, there are already so many experts like sister Hua, brother Zhan Yu, great elder etc.”</p>
 <p>“Let’s hope so.” Tantai Lingyan sighed softly.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. I can guarantee your wish will definitely come true.” Qing Shui seriously spoke as he looked at Tantai Lingyan.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. Shall we go for a walk at that place? Let me show you some of the demonic beasts I subdued.” After speaking, Qing Shui didn’t wait for her to reply and instantly pulled her along as they vanished and appeared again in a mountain valley.</p>
 <p>Tantai Lingyan didn’t know what to say to Qing Shui’s domineering behavior. She didn’t feel put off by it and wasn’t angered as well. She was actually slowly getting accustomed to it and she knew it herself.</p>
 <p>Was this really something she was getting accustomed to? Or was it because she didn’t reject it at all in her heart? If not, he wouldn’t dare to do this right? Also now...he was so tyrannical, holding onto her hand. He was too much at times, yet it was clear he knew how to maintain the proper distance, tiptoeing and dancing around the boundaries.</p>
 <p>With a wave of his hand, Qing Shui summoned the Hell Nightmare Beast. Its body was earthen yellow. Only its gigantic head and four paws was completely black. Its claws shimmered with a cold luster, appearing heavy and incomparably sharp.</p>
 <p>“You actually have the ability to cause a demonic beast to mutate?” Tantai Lingyan stared in astonishment at Qing Shui. Her sexy soul-stirring mouth was slightly apart, causing Qing Shui to want nothing more than to kiss her while sticking his tongue into her mouth.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui licked his lips a little and shifted his eyes away with difficulty. Tantai Lingyan turned her head away upon noticing Qing Shui’s expression. Even her earlobes turned pink when she saw his expression.</p>
 <p>“The method I’m using has a high failure rate, as much as 90%. Luckily I succeeded this time around. Not only does this demonic beast have the ability of super shield beasts, it even has some of the abilities of the Black Diamond Rat King. It also grants its owner an extremely powerful ability.” Qing Shui smiled as he stared at her. At this moment, there was a gentle softness in his gaze.</p>
 <p>“What ability?” Tantai Lingyan was also curious. After all, it’s very rare to find an ability which Qing Shui would say was powerful.</p>
 <p>“An increase of one-fold to my defence.”</p>
 <p>If it was someone else, increasing one-fold in defence might not count for anything. However, Qing Shui was different. The Ancient Strengthening Technique itself was a god-grade cultivation art. His Nine Yang Golden Body, Paragon Golden Armor, boosted by this powerful ability granted by ‘Foolish Loyalty’, made him become a nigh-indestructible existence. A human-shaped super shield beast and Dragon Slaying Beast all in one.</p>
 <p>Tantai Lingyan knew very well how monstrous Qing Shui’s defence was, but even she was shocked by his present strength. After which, she smiled and stared at Qing Shui, “This is truly a good news indeed.”</p>
 <p>This is the first time Qing Shui really saw her smile. Although it was just for a short moment, it felt like the spring wind. It also had a strong infectiousness and soon after, he unconsciously also smiled. This was something like an uncontrollable impetus.</p>
 <p>“You are so beautiful when you smile.” After a long time, Qing Shui recovered from his daze as he praised her.</p>
 <p>“Did I even smile?” Tantai Lingyan seemed as if she hadn’t even realised that she had smiled.</p>
 <p>“Mhm, you did. Please smile more in the future okay? It only adds to your beauty.” Qing Shui squeezed her hand.</p>
 <p>Tantai Lingyan didn’t say anything but the expression on her face grew more gentle. Suddenly, she felt that her relationship with this man was very close. It was a closeness in terms of their soul. It was unknown how long it had been since she had had this kind of feeling. Now that this feeling had seized her, it was like meeting someone very familiar in a crowd of strangers, only more intense.</p>
 <p>This was the first time she had felt like just sitting down leisurely, drinking tea with this man and enjoying the quiet moments of life. This feeling was something she liked, and she would unconsciously glance at Qing Shui time to time. He wasn’t bad looking at all, much more handsome compared to the vast majority of men. Although he exuded a little demonic charm, he still had that steely aura of a man.</p>
 <p>“Am I nice to look at? You can do anything you want to me. I won’t resist.” Qing Shui teased lightly.</p>
 <p>“Nope, you’re very ugly.” Tantai Lingyan calmly looked Qing Shui in the eye as she replied. The tone of her words was very casual, not forced at all.</p>
 <p>“You are lying.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>She wasn’t like other women. Some of her emotions were suppressed tightly, not shone on her face at all. One had to meticulously study her micro-expressions. He knew that her heart wasn’t fully opened to him yet. Only when her barriers were completely down would this icy woman show him her love.</p>
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p>Time passed by, day after day. In the blink of an eye, half a year had passed. During this period of time, Qing Shui would be at home. Today, Yehuang Guwu gave birth to a baby boy.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui entered the room, he saw Yehuang Guwu’s weakened constitution. She was carrying the little bundle of joy in her arms, as a gratified smile could be seen on her face.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, he really looks like you.” Yehuang Guwu smiled. In the surroundings, Qing Shui’s other women were all smiling as they looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took over carrying the baby. The baby had large clean eyes, unlike the babies in his previous world who needed a short period of time to cleanse their eyes of ‘eye wax’. Maybe it was because the spiritual qi in this world was much more abundant and that his parents both had special physiques. The skin of this new-born baby was just like jade.</p>
 <p>“Give him a name.” Qing Yi laughed.</p>
 <p>After Yan Zhongyue’s return, Qing Shui’s mother had felt something finally settle down in her heart. She was much calmer than before.</p>
 <p>“Let’s name him Yan Lang!” Qing Shui spoke after thinking for awhile.</p>
 <p>Qing Yi started for a moment before smiling as she nodded.</p>
 <p>Previously, his babies were all surnamed Qing. Since they were already named, they wouldn’t change it. But now since Yan Zhongyue had returned, Qing Shui’s surname by right should be Yan and not Qing. Hence, the babies born in the future would all take the ‘Yan’ surname. When he passed his son to Yan Zhongyue and told his father that the baby would be surnamed ‘Yan’, Yan Zhongyue’s eyes actually were actually welling up.</p>
 <p>Actually, he didn’t mind what surname his grandsons and granddaughters took as they were all family to him. However, he was still touched by the gesture.</p>
 <p>In this year, the Qing Clan’s population grew again. Their manor expanded, and even more formations were laid down. The Imperial Cuisine Hall also expanded and was much larger compared to before. The Qing Clan’s web of human connections naturally grew larger as well.</p>
 <p>There was no need to say much about the strength of Qing Clan. They had many connections in the Phoenix Dance Continent. Many major powers owed favors to the Qing Clan and would naturally stand on their side. In fact, they were deadly loyal to the Qing Clan because of Qing Shui. But even without Qing Shui, the current Qing Clan was strong enough as well. After all, quite a few of Qing Shui’s women were extremely fearsome existences.</p>
 <p>The Qing Clan could be said to be at the summit of a continent. It was only that they preferred to keep a low profile, and had no wish to contend for the resources of the Phoenix Dance Continent. But even so, their influence and authority was greater compared to any other power.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the strength of the Qing Clan was still growing. Those other clans and sects who had a little judgement all knew that, in a few decades, the strength of Qing Clan would reach a point where they could only gaze up in admiration.</p>
 <p>Qing Zun, Qing Yin and Qin Ming’s strength had already reached the initial grade of Martial King. Qing Ming also finished his coming of age ceremony. The four generations of the Qing Clan all had a meteoric rise and this year, Qing Hui and Qing Hu were both married. Their partners were members of two great clans in the Phoenix Dance Continent. Qing Shui wouldn’t object as long as the two parties in question were truly in love with each other. It was fine as long as they are happy together.</p>
 <p>Qing Hui and Qing Hu’s strengths weren’t weak. They were considered powerful existences within the clan. Ever since they had departed from the Hundred Miles City, the life they had experienced in Central Continent up had all caused them to transform a lot. They didn’t have the arrogance of the nobility, but rather, an identity even more precious.</p>
