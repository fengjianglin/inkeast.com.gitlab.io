  <p><strong>AST 285 Taichi Single Whip, Breaking Through To The 95th Cycle</strong></p>
  <p><span style>“Do you know why that Young Miss from your Yan Clan is selling tea leaves?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Xi Yue and Yan Linger are on very good terms, and have spent so long together, that they talk about anything under the sun. Xi Yue thus knew that the Yan Clan was the major power in Yan Jiang Country. They could be said to be the greatest clan &nbsp;in the whole of Yan Jiang Country.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Therefore, when she heard that there was a Young Miss from the Yan Clan who was selling tea leaves, she also felt that it was unbelievable. Even if she was not the child of the legal wife, she should not have to do so. Were they not afraid of wagging tongues?</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sister Xi Yue, you also came from a respectable clan, I’m not sure about such things either! I had asked grandfather about it before, but he, who had never scolded me before, reprimanded me! Ever since then, I’ve never raised it up again!” Yan Linger said helplessly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Xi Yue smiled, “Let’s go. Let’s return to our rooms and not think about these annoying things!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Xi Yue had guessed a little of what the reason was. For such things to be happening, it would generally be due to two types of reasons. One would be because of the person in question, the other would be due to external pressure. However, what she could not understand was that if the reason was not because of the person in question, she would not be doing such things. It was because it would bring shame to their Yan Clan as well.</span></p>
  <p><span style>But if it was because of external pressure, would it be to put that Young Miss who was selling tea leaves to shame? Or to put the whole Yan Clan to shame as well? Why did they not use the most extreme methods? After all, if they could do this, it would also mean that they would be able to crush the Yan Clan easily.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui returned to his room. Ever since he learnt that Yan Linger was from Yan Clan, he realized that each time he saw her, he could not help but recall the things which would weigh on his heart.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Crack!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>A light crisp sound signalled that Qing Shui’s Ancient Strengthening Technique had entered the 95th cycle. A warm but strong energy surged through his body and gradually merged into his never ceasing Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui unceasingly circulated 95 cycles once again. Now, each time he breakthrough to a new cycle, he would feel that his powers were raised significantly. It was an overall improvement, especially to his strength, speed, and defence.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui had gotten used to this. While the Ancient Strengthening Technique was at least a technique of the Legendary level, and was also a technique which could strengthen and train one’s muscles and bones, so it would be completely understandable for him to be able to receive such great power ups.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Picking up the Big Dipper Sword, Qing Shui instantaneously summoned his ‘forces’ and reached a surprising height, displaying the Heavenly Palace Sword Art. Earlier in the day, Qing Shui had already received many compliments, but it was when he was still holding back and had only released a 1st grade Xiantian cultivator’s level.</span></p>
  <p><span style>But now that he was in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui no longer restrained himself. The Heavenly Palace Sword Art was also known as the Falling Thunder Sword Art. The whole set of techniques were to use the ‘‘force” all the way, and to use the force to repel other forces!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Displaying the sword arts at full power created a slight thunder crack, which also seemed to be like a tiger’s roar. Each stance was composed yet strong. Qing Shui felt a very comfortable and satisfying feeling each time. A feeling as if he had fully vented off.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After accumulating the force to a certain degree, it would feel like a person’s raging emotions, and when one’s rage reached a certain level, it was also a type of force. And only then did Qing Shui attack with his sword. The attack was like the surging river, and even more like a tiger which was descending the mountain. It was a force which could easily smash through something!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui then slowly withdrew his sword. Having reached the Obscure Realm with his sword, picking up sword arts was much easier. Moreover, this set of sword techniques was very compatible with the Tiger Form. This allowed Qing Shui to reach a breakthrough with his Tiger Form, a very crucial one.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was just that Qing Shui had only just observed the insights from the tiger carvings，and had yet to be able to incorporate it into his sword arts.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Following on, Qing Shui combined the ten stances from yesterday with the ten he had learnt earlier today, gradually performing them over and over. However, bridging the gap between the stances was not smooth, and his speed was also very slow!</span></p>
  <p><span style> As he had practiced the ten stances in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal the night before, and considering that the earlier stances of a technique tend to be easier to grasp, it was very clear that the earlier ten stances in the twenty stances were much stronger.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Gradually, he became more familiar with the sword technique, and was able to exert more strength when performing it. However, time also passed by very quickly. Qing Shui did not pay much heed to the time during this period, eating food whenever he’s hungry, taking a break when he’s tired. For the rest of the time, he would do his sword practice, and temper the Soul Shake Bell, as well as perform alchemy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The prescriptions for the Five Dragon Pellet, Great Revitalizing Pellet and Beauty Pellet each were lacking a type of most precious medicinal herb which he could not find and which were irreplaceable. This made Qing Shui feel at a loss, especially for the Great Revitalizing Pellet’s Phoenix’s Tail, and the Beauty Pellet’s Beauty Fruit both heightened Qing Shui’s motivation to perform alchemy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui had once tried making them, since his Golden Medicinal Turtle and 1000 Year Clam were both able to act as a replacement for many 1000-year medicinal herbs and ingredients from 1000-year demonic beasts, but even after conducting many trials, he had still failed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When Qing Shui felt that his &lt;&lt;Heavenly Palace Sword Art&gt;&gt; &nbsp;was at an acceptable standard, half a month had already passed. Qing Shui felt that the half a month's time he had been spending in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had gotten shorter and shorter. In the future, the things he picked up would increase and the time he needed would increase. That was why Qing Shui was full of anticipation for the realm’s growth.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The next morning, Qing Shui woke up early. Practicing a round of Tai Chi everyday, especially in the morning reaped great effects. Recently, Qing Shui noticed that when he performed the Tai Chi towards the direction of the rising sun, the image of Yin-Yang in his consciousness would turn at a faster speed because of his Tai Chi practice.</span></p>
  <p><span style>While the degree of increase was very little, Qing Shui could clearly feel it! He knew that it was not a bad thing since the image of Yin-Yang was like a stream which provided Qing Shui with a never-ending amount of benefits. While the amount was little, it was long lasting and never ending. The unceasing release of a small golden ray of light, tempering his internal organs, muscles, vessels, meridian channels, and Dantian...</span></p>
  <p><span style>The reason Qing Shui practiced the Taichi was for the purpose of strengthening his body, &nbsp;and he practiced it with a casual attitude, not hoping to be able to use it to fend off enemies but to use it for relaxation.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was just the right mentality for practicing Taichi. Sometimes, success or failure may not be dependent on one’s deliberate actions or plans, but was something to be left to fate. To think that Taichi was the second martial arts to reach the Obscure Realm after &lt;&lt;Basic Sword Technique&gt;&gt;.</span></p>
  <p><span style>His Taichi now was no longer of the same standard as before. It would not lose out even when compared to his Tiger Form, and may even be better!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui slowly performed Taichi, his palms covered with a light layer of earthly yellow color, his speed was so slow, but that force gave one the pressure as if he would be able to flatten a mountain.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Many people around noticed Qing Shui, but they all threw a glance at him and shook their heads, “It’s too slow. What use is it to look overbearing? By the time you hit someone, they would have hit you many times over.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“That’s right. I’ve never seen such a slow martial art. The essence of martial arts is speed. I don’t understand why he would practice such a useless &nbsp;fist technique which moves at snail speed.” Another person’s interest was piqued and came to comment.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui paid no heed to all these. They were not very far away, but at that moment, Qing Shui was fully immersed in his practice. Fully enjoying himself as if his soul was traveling about out of his body. It was only today did he discover that practicing Tai Chi could also be such a warming and extremely comfortable feeling.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“See how much he is enjoying himself. The intoxicated look he has on is as if he is training some Legendary level techniques.” someone said in disdain.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Brother, look, that guy was the one who called Miss Xi Yue a nutcase!” Suddenly, a voice rang out. It sounded very sharp and weird.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“How dare he say that my goddess is a nutcase! I’ll let him know today who is the real nutcase.” compared to the sharp voice from earlier, this one was more coarse.</span></p>
  <p><span style>All the people who were gossiping now all, with great interest, looked towards this man who seemed to be unpresentable but yet he was someone ordinary people could not trifle with.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The man was burly and strong. His height was taller than an ordinary person by a head. His face filled with a beard that were akin to steep needles, and his hair a complete mess. He had a large build, with big bright eyes, and a big nose and mouth. He was quite good looking.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The man seemed like a straightforward person as he headed towards Qing Shui. He had a very large build and each step he took was an ordinary person’s one and a half step. When he walked, it was like a slight breeze was created. And this was only him walking casually.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was practicing his Taichi within a one-meter radius, keeping even his eyes closed, and gave the feeling that while it looked good, it had no practical uses.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He seemed to not know that someone was walking towards him as he continued to unceasingly practice the Taichi over and over again. Those who had taken a close look at him could even imitate his actions, but they were not able to imitate that spiritual charms.</span></p>
  <p><span style> “Chap, it’s you…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Before the man’s loud shout had ended, he was already reaching out his hand to grab Qing Shui’s arm. But just before he was able to touch Qing Shui’s arm… </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui’s left arm which had been slow as a snail, suddenly became like a sly rabbit, moving extremely fast. Displaying the Tai Chi Single Whip, he slapped away the man’s arm, and the spot he hit was at his Youchi Acupoint!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Even at this time, Qing Shui’s eyes remained closed as he practiced his Taichi. He seemed to have not noticed what was happening, not even taking a step away from where he was.</span></p>
  <p><span style>With a Single Whip, the man was actually sent back over three steps, and his arm which had received the attacked had turned numbed such that he was not able to lift it up for a moment.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Sarcasm, it was definitely sarcasm!</span></p>
  <p><span style>The man was also slightly angered. Although he wanted to slap Qing Shui’s shoulders, he did not exert a lot of strength. He would never had thought that this fellow would suddenly attack, and at such quick speed such that he could not dodge.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Taking in two deep inhales and rubbing his numbed arm for a while, the man clenched his fists. “How dare you make a sneak attack. I’ll teach you a lesson today.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The man let out a holler, releasing quite a strong aura. He was really infuriated. Once again, he waved his big fist, hurling towards Qing Shui’s ribs heavily. The ribs were weak and one would tend to suffer broken bones when struck there.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui’s eyes remained closed, he appeared to be so at ease that everyone was suspecting that he was putting up an act. However, the expression he gave people was an impression that he knew nothing at all.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, just as the man’s fierce fist was about to land on Qing Shui’s ribs, with a slight inhale, the area near Qing Shui’s ribs sunk in a little. This was just enough to give Qing shui an additional moment of time, as he once again used the Single Whip on the man, this time around, sending him flying three meters away. After landing, the man realized that he had actually not a single injury on himself. While the strength was immense, it was extremely gentle as well.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Don’t bother me, I don’t have time to waste on you guys.” Qing Shui said calmly. Only then did he open his eyes and look indifferently at that man who was sent flying.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Wow, to think that it can be so fast when it was so slow previously! So it was just an act!” Someone said in astonishment.</span></p>

While the Ancient Strengthening Technique was at least a technique of the Legendary level, and was also a technique which could strengthen and train one’s muscles and bones, so it would be completely understandable for him to be able to receive such great power ups.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Picking up the Big Dipper Sword, Qing Shui instantaneously summoned his ‘forces’ and reached a surprising height, displaying the Heavenly Palace Sword Art. Earlier in the day, Qing Shui had already received many compliments, but it was when he was still holding back and had only released a 1st grade Xiantian cultivator’s level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now that he was in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui no longer restrained himself. The Heavenly Palace Sword Art was also known as the Falling Thunder Sword Art. The whole set of techniques were to use the ‘‘force” all the way, and to use the force to repel other forces!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Displaying the sword arts at full power created a slight thunder crack, which also seemed to be like a tiger’s roar. Each stance was composed yet strong. Qing Shui felt a very comfortable and satisfying feeling each time. A feeling as if he had fully vented off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After accumulating the force to a certain degree, it would feel like a person’s raging emotions, and when one’s rage reached a certain level, it was also a type of force. And only then did Qing Shui attack with his sword. The attack was like the surging river, and even more like a tiger which was descending the mountain. It was a force which could easily smash through something!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui then slowly withdrew his sword. Having reached the Obscure Realm with his sword, picking up sword arts was much easier. Moreover, this set of sword techniques was very compatible with the Tiger Form. This allowed Qing Shui to reach a breakthrough with his Tiger Form, a very crucial one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was just that Qing Shui had only just observed the insights from the tiger carvings，and had yet to be able to incorporate it into his sword arts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following on, Qing Shui combined the ten stances from yesterday with the ten he had learnt earlier today, gradually performing them over and over. However, bridging the gap between the stances was not smooth, and his speed was also very slow!</span></p>
 <p><span style> As he had practiced the ten stances in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal the night before, and considering that the earlier stances of a technique tend to be easier to grasp, it was very clear that the earlier ten stances in the twenty stances were much stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gradually, he became more familiar with the sword technique, and was able to exert more strength when performing it. However, time also passed by very quickly. Qing Shui did not pay much heed to the time during this period, eating food whenever he’s hungry, taking a break when he’s tired. For the rest of the time, he would do his sword practice, and temper the Soul Shake Bell, as well as perform alchemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The prescriptions for the Five Dragon Pellet, Great Revitalizing Pellet and Beauty Pellet each were lacking a type of most precious medicinal herb which he could not find and which were irreplaceable. This made Qing Shui feel at a loss, especially for the Great Revitalizing Pellet’s Phoenix’s Tail, and the Beauty Pellet’s Beauty Fruit both heightened Qing Shui’s motivation to perform alchemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui had once tried making them, since his Golden Medicinal Turtle and 1000 Year Clam were both able to act as a replacement for many 1000-year medicinal herbs and ingredients from 1000-year demonic beasts, but even after conducting many trials, he had still failed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Qing Shui felt that his &lt;&lt;Heavenly Palace Sword Art&gt;&gt; &nbsp;was at an acceptable standard, half a month had already passed. Qing Shui felt that the half a month's time he had been spending in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had gotten shorter and shorter. In the future, the things he picked up would increase and the time he needed would increase. That was why Qing Shui was full of anticipation for the realm’s growth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next morning, Qing Shui woke up early. Practicing a round of Tai Chi everyday, especially in the morning reaped great effects. Recently, Qing Shui noticed that when he performed the Tai Chi towards the direction of the rising sun, the image of Yin-Yang in his consciousness would turn at a faster speed because of his Tai Chi practice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the degree of increase was very little, Qing Shui could clearly feel it! He knew that it was not a bad thing since the image of Yin-Yang was like a stream which provided Qing Shui with a never-ending amount of benefits. While the amount was little, it was long lasting and never ending. The unceasing release of a small golden ray of light, tempering his internal organs, muscles, vessels, meridian channels, and Dantian...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason Qing Shui practiced the Taichi was for the purpose of strengthening his body, &nbsp;and he practiced it with a casual attitude, not hoping to be able to use it to fend off enemies but to use it for relaxation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was just the right mentality for practicing Taichi. Sometimes, success or failure may not be dependent on one’s deliberate actions or plans, but was something to be left to fate. To think that Taichi was the second martial arts to reach the Obscure Realm after &lt;&lt;Basic Sword Technique&gt;&gt;.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His Taichi now was no longer of the same standard as before. It would not lose out even when compared to his Tiger Form, and may even be better!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui slowly performed Taichi, his palms covered with a light layer of earthly yellow color, his speed was so slow, but that force gave one the pressure as if he would be able to flatten a mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many people around noticed Qing Shui, but they all threw a glance at him and shook their heads, “It’s too slow. What use is it to look overbearing? By the time you hit someone, they would have hit you many times over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right. I’ve never seen such a slow martial art. The essence of martial arts is speed. I don’t understand why he would practice such a useless &nbsp;fist technique which moves at snail speed.” Another person’s interest was piqued and came to comment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui paid no heed to all these. They were not very far away, but at that moment, Qing Shui was fully immersed in his practice. Fully enjoying himself as if his soul was traveling about out of his body. It was only today did he discover that practicing Tai Chi could also be such a warming and extremely comfortable feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“See how much he is enjoying himself. The intoxicated look he has on is as if he is training some Legendary level techniques.” someone said in disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother, look, that guy was the one who called Miss Xi Yue a nutcase!” Suddenly, a voice rang out. It sounded very sharp and weird.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How dare he say that my goddess is a nutcase! I’ll let him know today who is the real nutcase.” compared to the sharp voice from earlier, this one was more coarse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the people who were gossiping now all, with great interest, looked towards this man who seemed to be unpresentable but yet he was someone ordinary people could not trifle with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man was burly and strong. His height was taller than an ordinary person by a head. His face filled with a beard that were akin to steep needles, and his hair a complete mess. He had a large build, with big bright eyes, and a big nose and mouth. He was quite good looking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man seemed like a straightforward person as he headed towards Qing Shui. He had a very large build and each step he took was an ordinary person’s one and a half step. When he walked, it was like a slight breeze was created. And this was only him walking casually.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui was practicing his Taichi within a one-meter radius, keeping even his eyes closed, and gave the feeling that while it looked good, it had no practical uses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He seemed to not know that someone was walking towards him as he continued to unceasingly practice the Taichi over and over again. Those who had taken a close look at him could even imitate his actions, but they were not able to imitate that spiritual charms.</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Chap, it’s you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before the man’s loud shout had ended, he was already reaching out his hand to grab Qing Shui’s arm. But just before he was able to touch Qing Shui’s arm… </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui’s left arm which had been slow as a snail, suddenly became like a sly rabbit, moving extremely fast. Displaying the Tai Chi Single Whip, he slapped away the man’s arm, and the spot he hit was at his Youchi Acupoint!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even at this time, Qing Shui’s eyes remained closed as he practiced his Taichi. He seemed to have not noticed what was happening, not even taking a step away from where he was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a Single Whip, the man was actually sent back over three steps, and his arm which had received the attacked had turned numbed such that he was not able to lift it up for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sarcasm, it was definitely sarcasm!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man was also slightly angered. Although he wanted to slap Qing Shui’s shoulders, he did not exert a lot of strength. He would never had thought that this fellow would suddenly attack, and at such quick speed such that he could not dodge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taking in two deep inhales and rubbing his numbed arm for a while, the man clenched his fists. “How dare you make a sneak attack. I’ll teach you a lesson today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man let out a holler, releasing quite a strong aura. He was really infuriated. Once again, he waved his big fist, hurling towards Qing Shui’s ribs heavily. The ribs were weak and one would tend to suffer broken bones when struck there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui’s eyes remained closed, he appeared to be so at ease that everyone was suspecting that he was putting up an act. However, the expression he gave people was an impression that he knew nothing at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, just as the man’s fierce fist was about to land on Qing Shui’s ribs, with a slight inhale, the area near Qing Shui’s ribs sunk in a little. This was just enough to give Qing shui an additional moment of time, as he once again used the Single Whip on the man, this time around, sending him flying three meters away. After landing, the man realized that he had actually not a single injury on himself. While the strength was immense, it was extremely gentle as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t bother me, I don’t have time to waste on you guys.” Qing Shui said calmly. Only then did he open his eyes and look indifferently at that man who was sent flying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, to think that it can be so fast when it was so slow previously! So it was just an act!” Someone said in astonishment.</span></p>
