  <p><strong>AST 184 – Refining Muscles and Bones Under Overbearing Pressure, Lifting Something Heavy as though it was Light!</strong></p>
  <p>Made from refined platinum, with a Big Dipper carved on it!</p>
  <p>Big Dipper Sword!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at the sword with the carving of the Big Dipper. It was heavy and had a primitive unsophistication. The ancient design with the seven stars made it look even more dignified and vigorous.</p>
  <p>“Daddy, let me hold it, let me hold it.” Luan Luan saw the pretty sword in Qing Shui’s hands and started bawling with the desire to hold it.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled bitterly and placed the sword on the floor!</p>
  <p>Luan Luan exerted all her force in an attempt to pick it up before she gave up gloomily, calling it a lousy sword, and went out to the hall to look for bird eggs.</p>
  <p>The Big Dipper Sword had no edge nor peak. It was created by the accumulation of the forces of the galaxy. When swung, it would be as if there were a meteor shower. It created a tremendous pressure, as if one was swinging mountains and rivers.</p>
  <p>“What a good sword! It suits me.” Qing Shui said to himself. This Big Dipper Sword that was no lighter than 200 jin was just nice for him to display the skill of lifting something heavy as though it was light.</p>
  <p>Having taken a closer look, Qing Shui realized that there was no sheath. His gaze fell on the ancient box. Could this be the sheath? Astonished, Qing Shui picked up the box.</p>
  <p>The texture was very unique, and the weight mediocre, but it was extremely hard. The ancient, dignified feeling it gave off was not as strong as the Big Dipper Sword; instead, it gave off an primitive aura.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui stowed the box and chain directly in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He made a thrust with the Big Dipper Sword, and a tremendous pressure was released. Qing Shui smiled. This was the forces of the galaxy!</p>
  <p>The forces of the galaxy of the Big Dipper was where its value and formidability lay. Qing Shui continued, swinging the sword amidst the immense pressure as he practised the sword thrust, point, hack, and the Tai Chi Sword Technique!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui had recalled the Tai Chi Sword Technique once on a whim. It was the only body-strengthening sword technique that he knew, one that was impractical and focused on appearance. However, similar to Tai Chi, it became amazing with the support of the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. While it would not be useful to fend off enemies, it had great effects on improving one’s physique. </p>
  <p>Only when the sky darkened did Qing Shui realized that he had spent the whole afternoon practising. He quickly washed up in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and changed into a clean set of clothes.</p>
  <p>When Qing Shui headed out, he saw the White Feathered Condor lying down on the floor while the lass had fallen asleep in its soft feathers. Her sleeping face was very adorable. Qing Shui knocked himself on the head, feeling that he had not done a good job being the father that she had been calling for a day.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui took out the bed, cooking utensils, and table from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and made some fish soup with black fish. The aroma woke the lass up as she hopped over after seeing the food Qing Shui had prepared.</p>
  <p>The good thing about young kids was that they did not ask questions, especially when they could get a bite of good food. After taking a bowl of fish soup, she patted her satisfied tummy and laid back down with the intent to sleep on the bed.</p>
  <p>Feeling helpless, Qing Shui woke her up. It was not good to sleep right after having a meal. The lass opened her eyes unwillingly. Qing Shui tried to entertain her to the extent of bringing out the fairy tales he had not come into contact with for so many years. After much effort, he managed to keep the lass awake for over one hour.</p>
  <p>When night fell, absolute silence covered the area. Feeling very strange, Qing Shui looked at the lass who was deep in sleep under the blankets. One way or another, he had gotten himself involved with this little angel. She seemed to be very reliant on him, saying that he had the smell of her father. Could it be the smell of a natural aura? It might be better to bring her to meet his goddess-like master.</p>
  <p>In the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui carried on with his training as usual. It was just that he had been focusing mostly on the Nine Waves of the Great Golden Buddha Palms and the smooth control of the Big Dipper Sword.</p>
  <p>The next day, Qing Shui continued his sword practice with the Big Dipper Sword near the divine statue, practising his sword thrust, point, hack and the Tai Chi Sword Technique. It was because Qing Shui realised that training under the divine statue’s overbearing presence allowed his sword art to improve greatly, and there was also another bigger advantage.</p>
  <p>Which was to use that overbearing presence to refine his muscles, bones and his body, just like how some people train under waterfall or in the sea. It was just that this method of training under the overwhelming pressure was even stronger, not just physically, but mentally as well.</p>
  <p>The overbearing pressure also allowed Qing Shui to experience much progress with his Ancient Strengthening Technique, as it becomes more refined, more active, and the tenacity of his meridian channels also increased by a lot.</p>
  <p>Very quickly, a few months time passed and there was only less than a month before the year end. He had promised his goddess-like master that he would return to Skysword Sect before the end of the year.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui did not expect to live with a lass in that cave for close to half a year.</p>
  <p>Within half a year’s time, Qing Shui reached a breakthrough, achieving the 73th cycle for his Ancient Strengthening Technique. He was also able to display the 3 basic sword technique proficiently with the Big Dipper Sword, building a strong base for the state of lifting something heavy as though it was light which made the prowess every stronger than ever before.</p>
  <p>This was not something achievable with merely brute strength. It was something which had spent Qing Shui half a year’s time to grasp, but it was hard to put into words. Once mastered, one would be able to lift an object of 100 jin with merely the strength of 80 jin, 70 jin, or an even smaller amount of strength.</p>
  <p>Half a year’s worth of tough training, coupled with what he had experienced previously, Qing Shui was now able to use a strength of slightly over 1000 jin to swing the Big Dipper Sword as he wished. Both the Deer Cantering and the Tiger Form had also reached the large success stage, further increasing Qing Shui’s powers.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui lamented on how quickly time had passed by in the mountains . He remembered harvesting the Energy-Enhancing Fruit and Agility-Enhancing Fruit just a while ago and now they are maturing again soon. It was almost going to reach 18 years since he first came to the world of the nine continents.</p>
  <p>Sword practice for half a year, especially with the usage of the Big Dipper Sword, or it may also be due to an increase in his powers and his locating in the mountains, Qing Shui’s aura had become more profound.</p>
  <p>His clear eyes remained as ever, but with an additional primitive charm, causing him to have a manliness with more maturity and stability than before.</p>
  <p>With his efforts of half a year, Qing Shui progressed 10 steps closer to the divine statue under the overbearing pressure. But there was still at least a 50 steps distance to the statue. Qing Shui did not know whether if he should be feeling happy or depressed.</p>
  <p>Merely the overbearing pressure from the divine statue already had such impact. But he was happy that his abilities was progressing at a fast pace. At the same time he was even more affirm that the divine statue should be one of a False God or Divine warrior. It was too bad that he could not observe from a closer distance.</p>
  <p>The lass enjoyed a more interesting life as compared to Qing Shui, heading out with the White Feathered Condor for half a day each time. But she would always be prompt to return during meal times as she wanted to eat what Qing Shui made.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui guessed that the lass was about 5 years old, and was about the time she should start to train. Therefore, he used the Energy-Enhancing Fruit and Agility-Enhancing Fruit, and even warm up her meridian channels with the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique each day. Moreover, he also took time at night to teach her how to read and write, as well as principles.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt as if he had become a full-time babysitter!</p>
  <p>While it was a bit tough, but it was also an enjoyment to stay in this abandoned cave. Moreover, Qing Shui also felt happy to see the lass’s progress and even taught her the Deer Cantering, Tiger Form and Tai Chi.</p>
  <p>The lass with a Seven Apertures Mystical Heart was definitely different from the rest. Her speed and talent made Qing Shui jealous, but he was still happy for her. Having lived together for half a year, he had long regarded her as his daughter.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt that with his abilities now, even if he were to encounter people who knew the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm, he would have no problems dealing with them. Of course, he would use the Big Dipper Sword since it would seem as if he was bullying them if he was to use the Third Wave of the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm…</p>
  <p>He had his overall prowess refined under the overbearing pressure. Especially the Deer Cantering, it had reached a breakthrough, allowing Qing Shui to attain an unbelievable speed.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui planned to pick one more creature out of the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique to learn. After all, it was hard to attain full mastery since it would require luck and opportunity. </p>
  <p>“Luan luan, Daddy will take you along and leave this place.” Qing Shui had nothing much to pack, but he secretly kept the bed, pots, bowls and other stuff into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p>“Alright, we can finally leave this place. Daddy, where shall we go?” Luan luan jumped into Qing Shui’s arms happily and said.</p>
  <p>“Skysword Sect!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui told the lass the way, and they flew towards the direction of the Skysword Sect on the White Feathered Condor.</p>
  <p>The freezing winter had already arrived and Qing Shui had used the fur of a snow fox to make a simple set of clothes the lass. While it can be used to keep warm, it did not look good. However, since it was worn by a little girl with the beauty sufficient to cause the fall of kingdoms and cities, she looked astonishingly adorable and beautiful.</p>
  <p>It took them less than a day to arrive at the foot of the Skysword Peak. The White Feathered Condor went around in a few circles before it landed, giving out a few low cries.</p>
  <p>“Daddy, little white says that there are dangerous demonic beasts on the mountain.” Luan luan blinked her big eyes curiously and said.</p>
  <p>“Dangerous demonic beast? Then it must be an even stronger demonic beast compared to the White Feathered Condor. But to be able to scare off the White Feathered Condor with just its aura, what kind of demonic beast is it?” Qing Shui seemed to have thought of something.</p>
  <p>Skysword Sect, Cang Lang Country’s leading sect. Having passed down for over 1000 years, how could it not have some form of hidden secret? Such as having 1-2 guardian beasts which looks over the sect.</p>
  <p>“Let Daddy carry you up.” Qing Shui had long seen himself as a father for this half a year. He did not know whether to be happy or depressed.</p>
  <p>People started to gossip after seeing him bringing with him an extremely beautiful little, especiall after Luan luan had said, “Daddy, there are so many people.”</p>
  <p>Everyone around was dumbfounded, standing there in a daze!</p>
  <p>“Sigh, only he would be able to have such a beautiful daughter.”</p>
  <p>“But why does his daughter looks so much like Martial Aunt Jiange?” A lady pointed out in astonishment.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s face turned dark, this is bad!</p>

 <p>The overbearing pressure also allowed Qing Shui to experience much progress with his Ancient Strengthening Technique, as it becomes more refined, more active, and the tenacity of his meridian channels also increased by a lot.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, a few months time passed and there was only less than a month before the year end. He had promised his goddess-like master that he would return to Skysword Sect before the end of the year.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not expect to live with a lass in that cave for close to half a year.</p>
 <p>Within half a year’s time, Qing Shui reached a breakthrough, achieving the 73th cycle for his Ancient Strengthening Technique. He was also able to display the 3 basic sword technique proficiently with the Big Dipper Sword, building a strong base for the state of lifting something heavy as though it was light which made the prowess every stronger than ever before.</p>
 <p>This was not something achievable with merely brute strength. It was something which had spent Qing Shui half a year’s time to grasp, but it was hard to put into words. Once mastered, one would be able to lift an object of 100 jin with merely the strength of 80 jin, 70 jin, or an even smaller amount of strength.</p>
 <p>Half a year’s worth of tough training, coupled with what he had experienced previously, Qing Shui was now able to use a strength of slightly over 1000 jin to swing the Big Dipper Sword as he wished. Both the Deer Cantering and the Tiger Form had also reached the large success stage, further increasing Qing Shui’s powers.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui lamented on how quickly time had passed by in the mountains . He remembered harvesting the Energy-Enhancing Fruit and Agility-Enhancing Fruit just a while ago and now they are maturing again soon. It was almost going to reach 18 years since he first came to the world of the nine continents.</p>
 <p>Sword practice for half a year, especially with the usage of the Big Dipper Sword, or it may also be due to an increase in his powers and his locating in the mountains, Qing Shui’s aura had become more profound.</p>
 <p>His clear eyes remained as ever, but with an additional primitive charm, causing him to have a manliness with more maturity and stability than before.</p>
 <p>With his efforts of half a year, Qing Shui progressed 10 steps closer to the divine statue under the overbearing pressure. But there was still at least a 50 steps distance to the statue. Qing Shui did not know whether if he should be feeling happy or depressed.</p>
 <p>Merely the overbearing pressure from the divine statue already had such impact. But he was happy that his abilities was progressing at a fast pace. At the same time he was even more affirm that the divine statue should be one of a False God or Divine warrior. It was too bad that he could not observe from a closer distance.</p>
 <p>The lass enjoyed a more interesting life as compared to Qing Shui, heading out with the White Feathered Condor for half a day each time. But she would always be prompt to return during meal times as she wanted to eat what Qing Shui made.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui guessed that the lass was about 5 years old, and was about the time she should start to train. Therefore, he used the Energy-Enhancing Fruit and Agility-Enhancing Fruit, and even warm up her meridian channels with the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique each day. Moreover, he also took time at night to teach her how to read and write, as well as principles.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt as if he had become a full-time babysitter!</p>
 <p>While it was a bit tough, but it was also an enjoyment to stay in this abandoned cave. Moreover, Qing Shui also felt happy to see the lass’s progress and even taught her the Deer Cantering, Tiger Form and Tai Chi.</p>
 <p>The lass with a Seven Apertures Mystical Heart was definitely different from the rest. Her speed and talent made Qing Shui jealous, but he was still happy for her. Having lived together for half a year, he had long regarded her as his daughter.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that with his abilities now, even if he were to encounter people who knew the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm, he would have no problems dealing with them. Of course, he would use the Big Dipper Sword since it would seem as if he was bullying them if he was to use the Third Wave of the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm…</p>
 <p>He had his overall prowess refined under the overbearing pressure. Especially the Deer Cantering, it had reached a breakthrough, allowing Qing Shui to attain an unbelievable speed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui planned to pick one more creature out of the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique to learn. After all, it was hard to attain full mastery since it would require luck and opportunity. </p>
 <p>“Luan luan, Daddy will take you along and leave this place.” Qing Shui had nothing much to pack, but he secretly kept the bed, pots, bowls and other stuff into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>“Alright, we can finally leave this place. Daddy, where shall we go?” Luan luan jumped into Qing Shui’s arms happily and said.</p>
 <p>“Skysword Sect!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui told the lass the way, and they flew towards the direction of the Skysword Sect on the White Feathered Condor.</p>
 <p>The freezing winter had already arrived and Qing Shui had used the fur of a snow fox to make a simple set of clothes the lass. While it can be used to keep warm, it did not look good. However, since it was worn by a little girl with the beauty sufficient to cause the fall of kingdoms and cities, she looked astonishingly adorable and beautiful.</p>
 <p>It took them less than a day to arrive at the foot of the Skysword Peak. The White Feathered Condor went around in a few circles before it landed, giving out a few low cries.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, little white says that there are dangerous demonic beasts on the mountain.” Luan luan blinked her big eyes curiously and said.</p>
 <p>“Dangerous demonic beast? Then it must be an even stronger demonic beast compared to the White Feathered Condor. But to be able to scare off the White Feathered Condor with just its aura, what kind of demonic beast is it?” Qing Shui seemed to have thought of something.</p>
 <p>Skysword Sect, Cang Lang Country’s leading sect. Having passed down for over 1000 years, how could it not have some form of hidden secret? Such as having 1-2 guardian beasts which looks over the sect.</p>
 <p>“Let Daddy carry you up.” Qing Shui had long seen himself as a father for this half a year. He did not know whether to be happy or depressed.</p>
 <p>People started to gossip after seeing him bringing with him an extremely beautiful little, especiall after Luan luan had said, “Daddy, there are so many people.”</p>
 <p>Everyone around was dumbfounded, standing there in a daze!</p>
 <p>“Sigh, only he would be able to have such a beautiful daughter.”</p>
 <p>“But why does his daughter looks so much like Martial Aunt Jiange?” A lady pointed out in astonishment.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s face turned dark, this is bad!</p>
