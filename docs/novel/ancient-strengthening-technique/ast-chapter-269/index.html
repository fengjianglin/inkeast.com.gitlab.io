  <p><strong>AST 269 The Two Ladies’ Thoughts, Mingyue Gelou Breakthrough To Xiantian</strong></p>
  <p>Seeing the Immortal Sword Sect’s Ancestor smash down from high up in the sky like a comet, that cry of desperation turned into the most melodious tune in Qing Shui’s ears.</p>
  <p>He lowered his head to look at the Soulshake Bell in his hands, feeling a great sense of unspoken satisfaction. He turned head and looked at Canghai Mingyue’s unparalleled beauty as she was extremely close to him. She was looking at him in a daze.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui could see a clear reflection of himself in that pair of dark and deep beautiful eyes. Her black, dense long eyelashes which spread out like a fan were so beautiful that they caused Qing Shui to fall into a trance.</p>
  <p>Leaning against Canghai Mingyue, Qing Shui could feel a spot of softness and bounciness. Although the pain he was experiencing was tearing him apart, he could still feel a hint of comfort.</p>
  <p>This could be considered a feeling happy while in pain.</p>
  <p>He then looked towards Huoyun Liu-Li who was at his side. Towards Qing Shui, she had held an unjustifiable sense of confidence. She was looking at Qing Shui with a bright smile, that eye-catching scar presented an unique charm to Qing Shui at that moment. Not affecting her beauty in any way at all.</p>
  <p>Looking at Qing Shui’s blazing and unconcealed gaze, a gaze which was filled with lust, Huoyun Liu-Li only felt happy. So long as Qing Shui likes her, she did not care of how she would appear in others’ eyes.</p>
  <p>“What should we do now? Do we go to the Heavenly Palace?” Canghai Mingyue supported Qing Shui, helping him to sit down slowly as she asked.</p>
  <p>“We don’t go back. We’ll look for a place to recuperate first. After we recover, we’ll return to uproot the Immortal Sword Sect from the roots. We’ll not head for the Heavenly Palace first.” Qing Shui gave it some thought and said. Being pushed to be such a pathetic state, he would not be able to get it past himself if he did not give them some punishment.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, although Immortal Sword Sect is doomed, there’s still the Joyous Sect, Imperial Beast Aristocrats and also many people who have been coveting for the Immortal Sword Sect. Do you think we’ll still be able to get a slice of the cake when we get back?” Canghai Mingyue frowned her beautiful brows slightly as she looked into the far distance.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui fell into a short moment of stupor as he looked towards Canghai Mingyue. He felt that at this moment, she had forced herself to walk out of the misery, as her thoughts had become sharp. When she sensed Qing Shui’s gaze, she felt a bit panicky, and she looked around at their surroundings.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was still attracted by her cute little actions and her appearance of unparalleled beauty!</p>
  <p>“To think that our Yueyue would also have such a cute moment. I’d always thought that you’re that goddess who would forever look down on the world in contempt.” Qing Shui grinned after having recovered from his stupor.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue’s face turned blush red, not daring to look at Qing Shui. After a while, she spoke out in a faint voice, “Qing Shui, I’d like to go home to take a look and set up a tomb for my parents.”</p>
  <p>Recalling that no one had recovered her mother’s corpse, although she knew that they should not be going back, she had felt so much heartache that she could not breathe.</p>
  <p>While she had expected this day to be coming, when it really happened, she was still at a loss. Nothing was left of her father’s remains, but her father had died smiling. Having killed the old blindee, he was satisfied.</p>
  <p>Seeing that the sky had already lit up and they were above a mountain range, Qing Shui let the Fire Bird find a spot to land. Since the old blindee and the Immortal Sword Sect’s Ancestor had already died, the Immortal Sword Sect was no longer a threat to Qing Shui. With the fire bird, there would be no problem for him to make his escape.</p>
  <p>“Let’s take a break for now, and then I’ll accompany you back after I’ve regained some strength, alright?” Qing Shui wanted to look for a place to land before spending half a month’s time at the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, letting his wounds recuperate.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue took a long look at Qing Shui before she shook her head, her eyes brimming with tears, “No, I’ll go back myself. You’re already like this, I don’t want you to take any more risks because of me.”</p>
  <p>At that moment, Qing Shui let the fire bird land on a flat platform stretched out from a hidden cliff as he noticed that there were dense vines and trees around the area.</p>
  <p>“Your parents have put you in my care. How can I let you take the risk alone?” Qing Shui said softly.</p>
  <p>Hearing Qing Shui’s words, Canghai Mingyue’s happiness felt as if cold water had been poured over it. She could not help but think that he was only fulfilling her parents’ wish or dying wish.</p>
  <p>Her bitter smile disappeared in an instant, before she smiled at Qing Shui, “Thank you!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui did not notice Canghai Mingyue’s changes. He was carried in Canghai Mingyue’s arms as they got off the fire bird’s back. Qing Shui sent the fire bird to keep a watch on the surroundings.</p>
  <p>The three of them looked for an area that was not as steep, and also searched around to see if there was a concealed and comfortable spot!</p>
  <p>“There’s a small cave there!” Huoyun Liu-Li suddenly pointed to a spot blocked by a few pine trees.</p>
  <p>“Everyone be careful, there might be some wild beasts inside!” Qing Shui reminded them and called the Fire Bird back.</p>
  <p>Just as Qing Shui and the others were entering the cave, back in the Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store in Hundred Miles City there were big changes happening too!</p>
  <p>There was a lady with a poised disposition. A young married lady with a unparalleled holy beauty! Her exquisite and pure countenance appeared especially dignified!</p>
  <p>It was the woman who had remained in Qing Clan, Mingyue Gelou!</p>
  <p>She was performing the Tiger Form in the Qing Clan’s courtyard by herself, releasing a series of sharp piercing Tiger’s Roars. She had long reached the great perfection stage for the Tiger Form and had brought it to even greater heights. It was a pity that Mingyue Gelou was not aware of which cultivation realm she had achieved.</p>
  <p>From the start of the year, there was already no one in the Qing Clan who could be her opponent. Old Master Qing Luo had come by once and said that she had reached the pinnacle of Houtian level.</p>
  <p>Although the Qing Clan’s members had long guessed it, they were still astonished. To think that a person who had not gone through any cultivation at all would be able to reach the pinnacle of Houtian within two years’ time… </p>
  <p>It was a pity that other than Qing Shui, no one else knew that she was born with her connecting and cleared meridian channels. That was why she would get twice the return for the same amount of effort others devoted to their cultivation.</p>
  <p>Moreover, she had only cultivated the Deer Cantering and Tiger Forms taught to her by Qing Shui and had long exceeded the great perfection stage, reaching a stage where every move was at the tips of her fingers. Each of her performed moves appeared with majesticness, and was even able to reach a similar state as the Obscure Realm. It was just that Qing Shui had not seen it for himself yet.</p>
  <p>Now, there was no one from the Qing Clan who did not hold Mingyue Gelou in high respect. Although everyone had treated her well all along, especially Qing Yi, most people had done so only because she was Qing Shui’s woman.</p>
  <p>Qing Luo for one, had always thought that as Mingyue Gelou had a daughter, she was not a good match for Qing Shui. But he had long dismissed this thought, since children and grandchildren have their own blessings. Moreover, no one in Qing Clan was able to rebut Qing Shui’s decisions any longer.</p>
  <p>This was the natural reaction to a martial practitioner who had reached great heights. In Qing Shui’s previous life, those with money would have a sense of superiority, even amongst relatives. In the world of the nine continents, clans that emphasized in martial arts were similar! </p>
  <p>Now, every morning, the Qing Clan’s three generations would practice the Tiger Form with Mingyue Gelou. This was because they knew that she was able to reach this stage merely from cultivating the Tiger Form alone. Moreover, her future was very bright, because she had showed the potential to breakthrough to the Xiantian level.</p>
  <p>Everyone in the Qing Clan, including Qing Yi, could not help but be amazed by Mingyue Gelou. At first, Qing Shui’s changes had already dealt them a huge blow, but they all knew that Qing Shui had an expert “Master”, but for Mingyue Gelou, she had relied on herself.</p>
  <p>Qing You, Qing Hu and Qing Bei all called her sister-in-law, making her turn red from blushing each time, as she panicked.</p>
  <p>“Brother Shui is a maniac at cultivation, but I’d never have thought that the sister-in-law he found for us is even stronger. This is such a huge blow.” Qing Bei mumbled.</p>
  <p>“Mmm mmm!” Qing You and Qing Hu nodded in agreement.</p>
  <p>“Sister-in-law has been practicing for so long, did you manage to notice anything?” Qing Bei furrowed her brows and asked.</p>
  <p>The spot they were at was quite far away from Mingyue Gelou. That was because other than during morning practice, no one would bother her practice. Even Little Yuchang was taken care of by Qing Yi. The little lass was now very close with Qing Yi, calling her granny day and night.</p>
  <p>“I didn’t notice anything. Did you?” Qing You asked Qing Bei.</p>
  <p>“I think that sister-in-law might be breaking through to Xiantian soon.”</p>
  <p>Qing Bei spoke out an alarming statement! </p>
  <p>“What? Xiantian? Although sister-in-law is at the pinnacle of Houtian, it has only been about half a year. Grandfather has been at the pinnacle for close to 40 years.” Qing You said, astonished.</p>
  <p>“Then what about Brother Qing Shui? Everyone is different. Have you seen anyone who had been able to reached the pinnacle of Houtian after slightly over two years?” Qing Bei smiled and said.</p>
  <p>“Darn, this is too huge a blow. I don’t even feel like training anymore.” Qing You smiled bitterly and said.</p>
  <p>“I have the same sentiments…” Qing Hu continued gloomily.</p>
  <p>“Hmph, you two good-for-nothings. You can only see other’s successes. Have you seen the effort Brother Qing Shui and sister-in-law have put in? The way they are fully focused and devoted, can only be described as being possessed or fanatic. Are you able to do the same?” Qing Bei acted like a female boss, reprimanding the other two.</p>
  <p>There was no way to go around it. Within the past two years, Qing Bei’s cultivation had surpassed Qing You’s, reaching the 6th grade of the Martial General realm whilst Qing You was a 5th grade Martial General and Qing Hu had just broke through to Martial General not long ago.</p>
  <p>Now, amongst the 3rd generation, Qing Bei was the strongest of them all. Of course, with the exception of Qing Shui!</p>
  <p>Mingyue Gelou performed the Tiger Form naturally with great ease, especially the Ripping Tiger Claw. Just from the technique alone, Qing Shui might not be able to match up to her.</p>
  <p>The Tiger’s Roar was getting stronger, the stances increasingly reserved. Each time a huge amount of energy broke out, the “claw’s grip” was increasingly weaker.</p>
  <p>Qing You, Qing Hu and Qing Bei looked at Mingyue Gelou, not blinking. They had sensed something, just like what Qing Bei had said earlier.</p>
  <p>Mingyue Gelou was not aware how many times she had performed the Tiger Laceration, her graceful figure performing the Tiger Form in perfection. Although Qing You and the others had long gotten used to this, this time around, the three of them were staring hard with wide open eyes at the attack Mingyue Gelou launched with her right hand.</p>
  <p>A milky white aura about half a foot long flowed out. That presence was sharp like a blade, stretching out and contracting irregularly. After that, Mingyue Gelou followed with a Ripping Tiger Claw.</p>
  <p>The Qi of Xiantian which represented the Xiantian realm proved that Mingyue Gelou had became a Xiantian cultivator. Her body had also undergone great changes, as if she had changed into a new set of bones, her impurities cleansed in that short moment. </p>
  <p>Suddenly the aura of one who had broke through to Xiantian attracted many Qing Clan’s members. Mingyue Gelou had already stopped, feeling very comfortable all over, especially during the moment she had broke through. It was the same feeling she had when she had sex with Qing Shui. That moment was very wonderful.</p>
  <p>The embarrassed Mingyue Gelou could not help but think of Qing Shui who had left for over two years. She did not know if he was doing well nor how far was she away from catching up to him.<br></p>
  <p>To be able to meet him was a great blessing from the heavens.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>“Mingyue, congratulations on breaking through to achieve Xiantian. It’s a pity that Qing Shui, that fellow is not around. If not, he’d be overjoyed.” Qing Yi carried Yuchang who was turning four years old soon, smiling as she walked over.</p>
  <p>Qing Yi had been addressing Mingyue Gelou as Mingyue.</p>
  <p>“Aunt Qing!” Mingyue Gelou smiled and called out, not showing the extreme joy from achieving the breakthrough. </p>
  <p>“Mother, mother!” The little lass shouted gleefully.</p>
  <p>Mingyue Gelou smiled, reaching out her hand to pinch on Little Yuchang’s tender cheeks lovingly.</p>
  <p>“Our Qing Clan now has another Xiantian cultivator. Mingyue, you have a bright path before you. We’ve always thought that Qing Shui was an exception, but seems like when compared to Qing Shui, you do not lose out at all.”</p>
  <p>“Let’s go, we’ll make some good food for lunch and have the whole family celebrate together. It’s a pity we don’t know where Qing Shui is right now!” Qing Yi said as she looked towards a few of the Qing Clan’s 2nd and 3rd generation members, who felt melancholy at the mention of Qing Shui’s name.</p>
  <p>“Don’t worry about Qing Shui. He is even more incomprehensible than I’ve thought. We can only support him. In the future, the Qing Clan will definitely be proud of him. Little sis, he’ll be back after two years at most. We should be happy for him.” Qing He smiled gently as he consoled his slightly disappointed sister.</p>
  <p>“Does daddy not want me anymore? Mommy, where’s daddy…” Little Yuchang’s words made the others slightly astonished. To think that such a young kid would be able to remember Qing Shui even after almost two years had passed.</p>
  <p>And at that moment, the seriously injured Qing Shui was supported by the two ladies as they entered the concealed cave!</p>

 <p>“Qing Shui, although Immortal Sword Sect is doomed, there’s still the Joyous Sect, Imperial Beast Aristocrats and also many people who have been coveting for the Immortal Sword Sect. Do you think we’ll still be able to get a slice of the cake when we get back?” Canghai Mingyue frowned her beautiful brows slightly as she looked into the far distance.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui fell into a short moment of stupor as he looked towards Canghai Mingyue. He felt that at this moment, she had forced herself to walk out of the misery, as her thoughts had become sharp. When she sensed Qing Shui’s gaze, she felt a bit panicky, and she looked around at their surroundings.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was still attracted by her cute little actions and her appearance of unparalleled beauty!</p>
 <p>“To think that our Yueyue would also have such a cute moment. I’d always thought that you’re that goddess who would forever look down on the world in contempt.” Qing Shui grinned after having recovered from his stupor.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue’s face turned blush red, not daring to look at Qing Shui. After a while, she spoke out in a faint voice, “Qing Shui, I’d like to go home to take a look and set up a tomb for my parents.”</p>
 <p>Recalling that no one had recovered her mother’s corpse, although she knew that they should not be going back, she had felt so much heartache that she could not breathe.</p>
 <p>While she had expected this day to be coming, when it really happened, she was still at a loss. Nothing was left of her father’s remains, but her father had died smiling. Having killed the old blindee, he was satisfied.</p>
 <p>Seeing that the sky had already lit up and they were above a mountain range, Qing Shui let the Fire Bird find a spot to land. Since the old blindee and the Immortal Sword Sect’s Ancestor had already died, the Immortal Sword Sect was no longer a threat to Qing Shui. With the fire bird, there would be no problem for him to make his escape.</p>
 <p>“Let’s take a break for now, and then I’ll accompany you back after I’ve regained some strength, alright?” Qing Shui wanted to look for a place to land before spending half a month’s time at the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, letting his wounds recuperate.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue took a long look at Qing Shui before she shook her head, her eyes brimming with tears, “No, I’ll go back myself. You’re already like this, I don’t want you to take any more risks because of me.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Qing Shui let the fire bird land on a flat platform stretched out from a hidden cliff as he noticed that there were dense vines and trees around the area.</p>
 <p>“Your parents have put you in my care. How can I let you take the risk alone?” Qing Shui said softly.</p>
 <p>Hearing Qing Shui’s words, Canghai Mingyue’s happiness felt as if cold water had been poured over it. She could not help but think that he was only fulfilling her parents’ wish or dying wish.</p>
 <p>Her bitter smile disappeared in an instant, before she smiled at Qing Shui, “Thank you!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not notice Canghai Mingyue’s changes. He was carried in Canghai Mingyue’s arms as they got off the fire bird’s back. Qing Shui sent the fire bird to keep a watch on the surroundings.</p>
 <p>The three of them looked for an area that was not as steep, and also searched around to see if there was a concealed and comfortable spot!</p>
 <p>“There’s a small cave there!” Huoyun Liu-Li suddenly pointed to a spot blocked by a few pine trees.</p>
 <p>“Everyone be careful, there might be some wild beasts inside!” Qing Shui reminded them and called the Fire Bird back.</p>
 <p>Just as Qing Shui and the others were entering the cave, back in the Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store in Hundred Miles City there were big changes happening too!</p>
 <p>There was a lady with a poised disposition. A young married lady with a unparalleled holy beauty! Her exquisite and pure countenance appeared especially dignified!</p>
 <p>It was the woman who had remained in Qing Clan, Mingyue Gelou!</p>
 <p>She was performing the Tiger Form in the Qing Clan’s courtyard by herself, releasing a series of sharp piercing Tiger’s Roars. She had long reached the great perfection stage for the Tiger Form and had brought it to even greater heights. It was a pity that Mingyue Gelou was not aware of which cultivation realm she had achieved.</p>
 <p>From the start of the year, there was already no one in the Qing Clan who could be her opponent. Old Master Qing Luo had come by once and said that she had reached the pinnacle of Houtian level.</p>
 <p>Although the Qing Clan’s members had long guessed it, they were still astonished. To think that a person who had not gone through any cultivation at all would be able to reach the pinnacle of Houtian within two years’ time… </p>
 <p>It was a pity that other than Qing Shui, no one else knew that she was born with her connecting and cleared meridian channels. That was why she would get twice the return for the same amount of effort others devoted to their cultivation.</p>
 <p>Moreover, she had only cultivated the Deer Cantering and Tiger Forms taught to her by Qing Shui and had long exceeded the great perfection stage, reaching a stage where every move was at the tips of her fingers. Each of her performed moves appeared with majesticness, and was even able to reach a similar state as the Obscure Realm. It was just that Qing Shui had not seen it for himself yet.</p>
 <p>Now, there was no one from the Qing Clan who did not hold Mingyue Gelou in high respect. Although everyone had treated her well all along, especially Qing Yi, most people had done so only because she was Qing Shui’s woman.</p>
 <p>Qing Luo for one, had always thought that as Mingyue Gelou had a daughter, she was not a good match for Qing Shui. But he had long dismissed this thought, since children and grandchildren have their own blessings. Moreover, no one in Qing Clan was able to rebut Qing Shui’s decisions any longer.</p>
 <p>This was the natural reaction to a martial practitioner who had reached great heights. In Qing Shui’s previous life, those with money would have a sense of superiority, even amongst relatives. In the world of the nine continents, clans that emphasized in martial arts were similar! </p>
 <p>Now, every morning, the Qing Clan’s three generations would practice the Tiger Form with Mingyue Gelou. This was because they knew that she was able to reach this stage merely from cultivating the Tiger Form alone. Moreover, her future was very bright, because she had showed the potential to breakthrough to the Xiantian level.</p>
 <p>Everyone in the Qing Clan, including Qing Yi, could not help but be amazed by Mingyue Gelou. At first, Qing Shui’s changes had already dealt them a huge blow, but they all knew that Qing Shui had an expert “Master”, but for Mingyue Gelou, she had relied on herself.</p>
 <p>Qing You, Qing Hu and Qing Bei all called her sister-in-law, making her turn red from blushing each time, as she panicked.</p>
 <p>“Brother Shui is a maniac at cultivation, but I’d never have thought that the sister-in-law he found for us is even stronger. This is such a huge blow.” Qing Bei mumbled.</p>
 <p>“Mmm mmm!” Qing You and Qing Hu nodded in agreement.</p>
 <p>“Sister-in-law has been practicing for so long, did you manage to notice anything?” Qing Bei furrowed her brows and asked.</p>
 <p>The spot they were at was quite far away from Mingyue Gelou. That was because other than during morning practice, no one would bother her practice. Even Little Yuchang was taken care of by Qing Yi. The little lass was now very close with Qing Yi, calling her granny day and night.</p>
 <p>“I didn’t notice anything. Did you?” Qing You asked Qing Bei.</p>
 <p>“I think that sister-in-law might be breaking through to Xiantian soon.”</p>
 <p>Qing Bei spoke out an alarming statement! </p>
 <p>“What? Xiantian? Although sister-in-law is at the pinnacle of Houtian, it has only been about half a year. Grandfather has been at the pinnacle for close to 40 years.” Qing You said, astonished.</p>
 <p>“Then what about Brother Qing Shui? Everyone is different. Have you seen anyone who had been able to reached the pinnacle of Houtian after slightly over two years?” Qing Bei smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“Darn, this is too huge a blow. I don’t even feel like training anymore.” Qing You smiled bitterly and said.</p>
 <p>“I have the same sentiments…” Qing Hu continued gloomily.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, you two good-for-nothings. You can only see other’s successes. Have you seen the effort Brother Qing Shui and sister-in-law have put in? The way they are fully focused and devoted, can only be described as being possessed or fanatic. Are you able to do the same?” Qing Bei acted like a female boss, reprimanding the other two.</p>
 <p>There was no way to go around it. Within the past two years, Qing Bei’s cultivation had surpassed Qing You’s, reaching the 6th grade of the Martial General realm whilst Qing You was a 5th grade Martial General and Qing Hu had just broke through to Martial General not long ago.</p>
 <p>Now, amongst the 3rd generation, Qing Bei was the strongest of them all. Of course, with the exception of Qing Shui!</p>
 <p>Mingyue Gelou performed the Tiger Form naturally with great ease, especially the Ripping Tiger Claw. Just from the technique alone, Qing Shui might not be able to match up to her.</p>
 <p>The Tiger’s Roar was getting stronger, the stances increasingly reserved. Each time a huge amount of energy broke out, the “claw’s grip” was increasingly weaker.</p>
 <p>Qing You, Qing Hu and Qing Bei looked at Mingyue Gelou, not blinking. They had sensed something, just like what Qing Bei had said earlier.</p>
 <p>Mingyue Gelou was not aware how many times she had performed the Tiger Laceration, her graceful figure performing the Tiger Form in perfection. Although Qing You and the others had long gotten used to this, this time around, the three of them were staring hard with wide open eyes at the attack Mingyue Gelou launched with her right hand.</p>
 <p>A milky white aura about half a foot long flowed out. That presence was sharp like a blade, stretching out and contracting irregularly. After that, Mingyue Gelou followed with a Ripping Tiger Claw.</p>
 <p>The Qi of Xiantian which represented the Xiantian realm proved that Mingyue Gelou had became a Xiantian cultivator. Her body had also undergone great changes, as if she had changed into a new set of bones, her impurities cleansed in that short moment. </p>
 <p>Suddenly the aura of one who had broke through to Xiantian attracted many Qing Clan’s members. Mingyue Gelou had already stopped, feeling very comfortable all over, especially during the moment she had broke through. It was the same feeling she had when she had sex with Qing Shui. That moment was very wonderful.</p>
 <p>The embarrassed Mingyue Gelou could not help but think of Qing Shui who had left for over two years. She did not know if he was doing well nor how far was she away from catching up to him.<br></p>
 <p>To be able to meet him was a great blessing from the heavens.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Mingyue, congratulations on breaking through to achieve Xiantian. It’s a pity that Qing Shui, that fellow is not around. If not, he’d be overjoyed.” Qing Yi carried Yuchang who was turning four years old soon, smiling as she walked over.</p>
 <p>Qing Yi had been addressing Mingyue Gelou as Mingyue.</p>
 <p>“Aunt Qing!” Mingyue Gelou smiled and called out, not showing the extreme joy from achieving the breakthrough. </p>
 <p>“Mother, mother!” The little lass shouted gleefully.</p>
 <p>Mingyue Gelou smiled, reaching out her hand to pinch on Little Yuchang’s tender cheeks lovingly.</p>
 <p>“Our Qing Clan now has another Xiantian cultivator. Mingyue, you have a bright path before you. We’ve always thought that Qing Shui was an exception, but seems like when compared to Qing Shui, you do not lose out at all.”</p>
 <p>“Let’s go, we’ll make some good food for lunch and have the whole family celebrate together. It’s a pity we don’t know where Qing Shui is right now!” Qing Yi said as she looked towards a few of the Qing Clan’s 2nd and 3rd generation members, who felt melancholy at the mention of Qing Shui’s name.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry about Qing Shui. He is even more incomprehensible than I’ve thought. We can only support him. In the future, the Qing Clan will definitely be proud of him. Little sis, he’ll be back after two years at most. We should be happy for him.” Qing He smiled gently as he consoled his slightly disappointed sister.</p>
 <p>“Does daddy not want me anymore? Mommy, where’s daddy…” Little Yuchang’s words made the others slightly astonished. To think that such a young kid would be able to remember Qing Shui even after almost two years had passed.</p>
 <p>And at that moment, the seriously injured Qing Shui was supported by the two ladies as they entered the concealed cave!</p>
