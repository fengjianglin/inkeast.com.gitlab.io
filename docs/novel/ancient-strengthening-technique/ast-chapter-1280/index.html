 <p><strong>AST 1280 - Putuo Mountain Sect’s Leader, Mysterious Powerful Old Fairy?</strong></p>
 <p>“This isn’t considered being shameless, this is called being confident in yourself,” Qing Shui said with a casual smile. Previously, Tantai Xuan also meant most of the things she said as a joke.</p>
 <p>She didn’t really tangle herself up with Qing Shui regarding this matter. She only squinted at Qing Shui once and then she stopped talking.</p>
 <p>“Why didn’t you bring Sister Chen along?” Yu Ruyan asked Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“She has already gone into seclusion. Otherwise, I would definitely have brought her along.”</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, don’t tell me you are planning to let Sister Chen seize control of the entire Lotus Sect!?” Suddenly, Yu Ruyan looked at Qing Shui and asked him the question.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately extended his hand and touched Yu Ruyan’s head, “Eh, what do you usually think about with that little head of yours. Do you really think that your husband would need to go through so much trouble against merely Lotus Sect? I could have just taken it by extending my hands.”</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan pushed away Qing Shui’s hand that was on her head. For a mature and knowledgeable woman like her, she wasn’t really used to letting a younger man touch her head. Nevertheless, she felt really happy about it.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan didn’t smile. It was just that she felt a bit warm when she looked at both of them. She could tell that Yu Ruyan felt really happy and blessed. Even more so, at the moment when she was within the image she pictured, she also looked really happy. Unknowingly, her face started turning red. The reason being that she had privately talked to Yu Ruyan about this matter before. It was about whether it felt comfortable doing that…..</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw Tantai Xuan’s expression and remembered that previously, she had watched Yu Ruyan and himself. Hence, he was really certain that this extreme beauty must have thought about something inappropriate again. It was just that the ‘inappropriate’ content also made him felt a bit depressed. After all, those so-called “inappropriate content” were originated precisely from Yu Ruyan and himself.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan noticed that Qing Shui had seen her expression. The helplessness as well as gloominess instead made her seem a lot more natural. With her face red, she grumpily gave Qing Shui a glare. From Qing Shui’s perspective, this glare seemed really flirty.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui slightly shook his head. This incident really made the three of them feel awkward. It was mainly because all three of them knew about it. Until now, even he himself had no idea how situations like this turned out. If it was only because these two women were women from the Portraits of Beauty, it somehow still didn’t really add up.</p>
 <p>“Do you really want to meet my master?” Tantai Xuan let herself calm down for a while and asked.</p>
 <p>“Yes, is your master able to make decisions for Putuo Mountain?” Qing Shui asked after thinking for a while. After all, Tantai Xuan was a Chief Disciple. Ever since she came to Western Oxhe Continent, she experienced significant awakening from things like Inheritances and so on. Her strength was also improving at a rapid pace.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that very soon, she would reach the same level as Fu Yantian and Fu Cang.</p>
 <p>“Of course, my master can decide everything for Putuo Mountain.</p>
 <p>Whenever her master was mentioned, Tantai Xuan would begin to miss her. She was her support. It somehow felt just like how children behaved in front of their parents.</p>
 <p>“Oh, this will be fine then. How am I going to meet her?”</p>
 <p>“I will bring you to Southern Sea Bamboo Pavilion. Normally, that’s where my master will be at. Men are allowed to go in and out of that place. Normally, master will discuss things with other people there,” Tantai Xuan said with a smile. She knew that her master thought very highly of this man.</p>
 <p>‘Well then, thank you for your trouble, Miss Tantai.” Qing Shui looked at her with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be so formal, I get creeped out when you do that,” Tantai Xuan said randomly before she flew into the direction of Putuo Mountain with Yu Ruyan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui on the other hand, stayed at the back and observed the two women with wonderful bodies. What he was seeing made him feel a bit unreal. Without realizing it he had already been in these continents for more than forty years.</p>
 <p>Similarly, men were also forbidden to enter Putuo Mountain but they wouldn’t stop their disciples from getting married. Once they did, they would no longer be able to be the disciples of Putuo Mountain on the surface. Despite this, they would still be in touch with it. They were just in a way considered to no longer be at Putuo Mountain. Everything else would remain the same.</p>
 <p>The only way they could return to Putuo Mountain was by reaching a certain level in their cultivation. There was no restriction to it. Undeniably this was a bit weird. It was likely that the rule was made in fear that aristocratic clans or other forces, who harbored bad intentions, would try to make use of Putuo Mountain.</p>
 <p>Southern Sea Bamboo Pavilion!</p>
 <p>This was a spot with bamboo houses made with bamboo. It was around ten meters above sea level. It was a small island, a really, really small one. There was bamboo densely packed together on top of the island. The Southern Sea Bamboo Pavilion was built precisely on top of it. When wind blew, the bamboo house would sway, depending on the wind. It felt a bit special. This bamboo was alive. It emitted a delicate and natural aura.</p>
 <p>Despite the fact that they tended to sway in the wind, they were really sturdy. This was the well-known Metallic Heart Bamboo. In fact, those here were the ones that were still growing. Even normal axes wouldn’t be able leave any marks on it.</p>
 <p>By the time Qing Shui saw all of this, he was already at the edge of the small island. But very quickly, he was already able to see the figure of a person. The reason why he was able to see it so soon was because he was locked onto by the person’s Spiritual Sense.</p>
 <p>The woman wore a plain colored court dress. She looked really casual but also tidy at the same time. It was something which couldn’t be described in words. Her face looked mature and composed with no sign of any wrinkles. Both of her eyes seemed a bit watery but at the same time they also contained a kind of wisdom and farsightedness within them. They were just like the bright moon in the night sky.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was unable to tell the woman’s age. She didn’t really look any older than the two girls around her. Despite this, she tended to give the people the impression that she was a truly mature kind of woman, causing other people to feel like they were children whenever they were in front of her.</p>
 <p>Although this caused Qing Shui to feel some shock, it could also be said that the aura of this woman was powerful.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui found the woman’s strength a bit immeasurable. But as compared to Fu Tongsheng, hers was a lot stronger, so much so that Qing Shui was certain that it definitely exceeded ten thousand sun.</p>
 <p>She had a fine and detailed body. She looked especially thin and tall. The most eye-catching features about her were her huge bust and bum. That slender and supple waist of hers was the sexiest and most attractive part of her body. She had long and straight legs. The bulging parts on her upper body and the loose clothes which she wore. They both looked really fatal and might just cause men to be stimulated. In any case, even Qing Shui himself already felt a bit impulsive himself. He was also finally able to understand why Tantai Xuan seemed a bit shocked previously when she heard him saying he wanted to meet her master.</p>
 <p>The woman wore plain clothes. There was a faint trace of youthfulness on her face. Her eyes however, were like the bright moon across the night sky. They both looked clear to the point that they made people feel as if even their very own soul was going to be pulled out of their body. It could very easily make a person lose themselves. Upon seeing Qing Shui, her beautiful pupils moved. She seemed a bit astonished. After that, she revealed a faint smile. That smile felt just like ripples that were spreading out in the pond.</p>
 <p>It felt really infectious. It could very easily make someone copy after her expression.</p>
 <p>“Master!’</p>
 <p>“Come up!”</p>
 <p>The woman’s voice sounded really rough. Or rather, it sounded some what magnetic and also a bit neutral. Qing Shui found himself really eager to hear her speak. This was how the voice of a mature woman was supposed to sound. It was a type of voice with a different kind of charisma.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan and the others immediately soared up into the sky and dropped down at the top.</p>
 <p>This place was the place with the biggest bamboo house. It was around twenty meters long and wide. Around it, there were a few smaller bamboo houses. Qing Shui saw that the woman was the only person living here. This place was almost like the “balcony” of the bamboo house.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing the three coming up,</p>
 <p>Everything inside the building was made of bamboo. The tables, chairs as well as bed. And there was also a few of smokiness in the atmosphere. This was a very mysterious sensation but very swiftly, Qing Shui soon discovered that it was because this cultivation art this woman was cultivating, was of the wood-element attribute.</p>
 <p>“Little brat, we haven’t seen each other in such a long time, you have made both of my disciples fall in love, head over heels.”</p>
 <p>The things which the woman said as soon as she opened her mouth made Qing Shui feel extremely weird. Despite this, he still felt really shocked upon hearing what she said.</p>
 <p>“Master, what nonsense are you saying?”</p>
 <p>“Alright, alright, I will stop talking about it. By then, don’t cry getting married to him. Even though you’re the eldest disciple in Putuo Mountain. Even if you are to take over Putuo Mountain in the future, I won’t forbid you from getting married. The most regretful thing a woman can do is not get married,” the woman said with a smile while indicating for the rest of them to sit down.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gave the woman an astonished look. Compared to the old lady from Lotus Sect, they clearly shared different opinions. However, Qing Shui agreed strongly with the viewpoint of this woman.</p>
 <p>“Well then, master, why are you still single?” Tantai Xuan asked gently.</p>
 <p>“Foolish girl, you aren’t even able to solve your own problems. Don’t start worrying about mine. If I want a man, I only need to give them a sign and they would have come to me on their own. Are you able to do this?”</p>
 <p>Once again Qing Shui was stunned. Clearly, the way the woman spoke was really different. There was a kind of charisma to it which couldn’t be described in words. She was really daring with what she said, making people’s hearts beat faster, especially at the moment when men heard her speaking.</p>
 <p>Tantain Xuan was unable to take it. She embarrassingly embraced the woman’s arm and shouted, “Master!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was frozen in shock with what he saw today. To think that Tantai Xuan would have such a feminine side…...</p>
 <p>“Little brat, look at this little guy, his eyes turned straight immediately when he looked at you. It seems that your little girly face still has a very strong ‘male-slaughtering’ power.</p>
 <p>She revealed a smile. It felt extremely attractive.</p>
 <p>An old fairy, she might just fit the term ‘old fairy’!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui revealed an awkward smile. Tantai Xuan also let go of the woman and shot Qing Shui a glare. After that, she went into the room and took out a teapot and teacups.</p>
 <p>Everything outside could be viewed from the inside of the bamboo house. But the same didn’t apply for when someone tried to view inside from the outside. The internal part of the building was a bit darker. The external part of it on the other hand, was bright. It was just like a hanging curtain.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, you are indeed really good at bringing surprises to the people around you. Even I myself am already feeling like stripping you apart to see what kind of secret you are actually hiding underneath your clothes.” The woman carried up the teapot. She had slender white hands. Each of her fingers looked like jade. The teacups on the table were made of green bamboo, untainted by even a speck of dust. As Qing Shui stayed here and looked at everything around him, even he himself felt as if he had been infected by the graceful aura here.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, the woman spoke like a gangster. Qing Shui pinched himself with all the strength he had to confirm that he wasn’t dreaming. To think that a man like him could still be toyed with by a woman…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt a strong urge to reply that she didn’t need to help him strip and that he could take off everything to let her examine him. But when he remembered that this woman might be an old demoness that was extremely skilled in keeping her own youthful looks, he gave up on his intention to do it. Furthermore, she was also Tantai Xuan’s master, at least for now, Yu Ruyan could also be considered her disciple.</p>
 <p>But Qing Shui was able to tell that this master of theirs was like a friend and a teacher but at the same time also like a sister to them. She was very casual.</p>
 <p>“Senior, you must be joking. I am already a husband and a father, how can I possibly let a woman strip off my shirt?” Qing Shui said seriously.</p>
 <p>Lo-lo-lo!</p>
 <p>The woman laughed joyfully. She looked at Qing Shui, “You’re indeed quite daring. I wonder if there is anything that you need for you to come look for me?”</p>
 <p>“Let me put it this way, I plan to go to the other three continents. Previously, I had the intention to bring my clan members here. But I was afraid that the situation here was too chaotic. Hence, I want to fix things here. This way, I might be able to use it as my own shield to make myself feel more confident when in the other three continents. It’s just that all of these are quite difficult to do. Maybe the other three continents are way more powerful than the Western Oxhe Continent.” At the moment when Qing Shui looked at the woman, he seemed to have understood something. He spoke while showing a bitter smile.</p>
