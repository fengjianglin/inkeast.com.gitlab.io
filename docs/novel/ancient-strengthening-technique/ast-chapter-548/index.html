 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 548 The Whole Clan Moves, Kaiyang Country’s Soulreaper Valley</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Thank you!" Shi Qingzhuang smiled and said in a serious manner.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"There's no need for thanks between us."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Oh, then I’ll thank you on behalf on my grandfather!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qingzhuang, let me guess why you’ve come. Do you think I can guess correctly?" Qing Shui grinned and gazed at Shi Qingzhuang, the feeling between the two of them at this moment was very wonderful.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Then, go ahead." Shi Qingzhuang's cool eyes had a hint of intoxicating smile. Qing Shui could clearly see the joy in her eyes. It was very faint, but it caused Qing Shui's heart to throb.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Did you come after seeing your grandfather take the first Xiantian Golden Pellet?"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang smiled happily. Although it may seem like a light smile to other people, it was hard to see such a smile on Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not bring up the matter about her parents. Since Shi Qingzhuang did not wish to talk about it, then so be it. Therefore, Qing Shui gifted Old Master Shi with two "Xiantian Golden Pellets", serving some filial piety in Shi Qingzhuang's behalf, and at the same time, let her rest at ease.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In Hundred Miles City, Xiantian was already at the peak amongst all the cultivators. Moreover, even if experts from outside came to wreck havoc in Hundred Miles City, they would still need to take into considerations of Qing Shui's existence.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Unknowingly, Qing Shui could feel that the hand holding Shi Qingzhuang felt tight. Shi Qingzhuang had grabbed his hand tightly!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Earlier, Qing Shui stopped the people from Shi Clan from sending him off as he did not wish to alarm too many people.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Swiftly, Qing Clan and Shi Qingzhuang both returned to Qing Clan and after the preparations were finished, everyone boarded the "horse carriage" which had been considered extremely big in the Hundred Miles City.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Gigantic Elephant pulled the carriage. Although it appeared very magnificent, not many people knew about it since the species are quite rare and could only be evolved. There was no such type of elephant to begin with. Beasts which contained elephant's bloodline could evolve into the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, but it was just that the possibility was extremely low.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was no need to maneuver since Qing Shui let the Fire Bird lead the way in the air. The Diamond Gigantic Elephant only needed to follow behind with the carriage. Therefore, everyone only needed to stay within the carriage which was bigger than a room.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing You and company were very much willing to take the outside seats of the "horse carriage". They gazed at the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's tremendous size as it moved gradually on the flat surface, pulling the carriage.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Brother Qing Shui, this carriage is extremely comfortable and doesn't shake in the slightest! It gives the same feeling as riding on a flying demonic beast! Even those rich people would not be able to enjoy a ride on such a high quality carriage! This feels good!" Qing You stood at the carriage's shaft and smiled as she exclaimed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"That's right, Brother Shui is the best!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang sat quietly on one side of Qing Shui, while Yiye Jiange and Luanluan sat on the other, followed by Mingyue Gelou and Yuchang. However, Yuchang would frequently run over to the area where Qing Shui was.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seated on the opposite of him were Qing Yi, Qingqing and Wenren Wu-shuang. Qing Bei also sat there. Following them were Qing Luo and the other men, with Qing Shui's aunt on one side, and behind them were also the big group of Qing Clan's 3rd generation.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was incredibly cosy in the carriage. There were tables, chairs, and even beds. This was the benefit of having such a large carriage. This was why everyone gathered together in small groups, chatting the topics they were interested in.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, is everyone in Greencloud Continent rich?" Feng Feiyan played with the playful Little Changfeng, as she smiled and looked at Qing Shui and asked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"There's always commoners in any place. After all, not every person is rich. It's just like how in our Hundred Miles City, there are few Xiantian cultivators. But outside, even if its in the Continent's Capital, there's still a small percentage of Xiantian cultivators. It's impossible to see Xiantian cultivators everywhere on the streets."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Then would it be good for us to do our business there? We aren't familiar with the place." Uncle Qing Hu asked, a bit excited and a bit worried.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"If you guys wish to start a business, you can just get a shop. There's no need to worry about the medicinal herbs and other stuff. When you become more familiar, you can slowly expand the business." Qing Shui said, thinking about it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Brother Qing Shui, can I really join the Heavenly Palace?" Qing You asked excitedly. He knew that one must be at least a Xiantian cultivator to be able to join the Heavenly Palace.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Of course you can. However, amongst the millions of people in the Heavenly Palace, you'll be the weakest of them all." Qing Shui grinned as he looked at Qing You.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I know that too. The stress is really great. With there being so many people, just anyone would be able to bully me." Qing You spoke with a bitter expression on his face.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"That's why I said that you need to work hard. You are quite talented but you're determination is not firm. As long as you have determination, you'll be able to breakthrough to Xiantian very quickly." Qing Shui understood that he needed to give him some motivation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Stop! Stop…!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I'm talking to you! Stop the carriage..."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Screech!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Ahhh!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Hm? Someone's been knocked dead by us?" Qing Shui's brows twitched and said, as he lifted up the curtains and walked out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They had left the Hundred Miles City for about half a month and had travelled across two countries. This should still be within Kaiyang Country, a country at the extreme west of Greencloud Continent. However, Kaiyang Country was still considered a fairly strong country in the Greencloud Continent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Stop him! Stop him! To think that he dares to knock down someone in broad daylight in our Kaiyang Country!" A man about thirty plus years old with a sharp mouth, triangular nose and a high pitch voice bellowed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Swiftly, close to a hundred people appeared, each of them equipped in heavy armor but their weapons were all long hooks which were three plus meters long. Their arms were very thick and muscular. The giant hooks in their hands flashed with a cold gleam.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Kaiyang Country's Soulreaper Valley!" Qing Shui frowned as he exclaimed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Lad, you know your stuff. In Greencloud Continent, even those strong warriors in the Continent's Capital aren't as arrogant as you, to run over someone from our Soulreaper Valley and yet still be so arrogant."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew about the Soulreaper Valley as well. He had heard Heavenly Palace's Old Ancestor talk about it before. This Kaiyang Country was actually not as well-known as the Soulreaper Valley, and the Soulreaper Valley was only well-known because of one person. Otherwise, it would only be considered a 2nd rate sect in Greencloud Continent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Soulreaper Valley had a character whose abilities was comparable to the Heavenly Palace's Old Ancestor. Therefore, even those 1st rate sects would not dare to behave atrociously there. Even if they were killed, there was nothing that could be done about it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui saw that the person who was run over laid in the middle of the road. But before power, everything was useless. If one was not strong enough, even if the victim was not knocked dead, or even if he was not knocked down at all, they could still be stopped in their tracks.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the horse carriage then at the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. He knew that the other party had gotten interested in the "treasures" in his carriage.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Ya Lin, what's wrong? What happened? Just then a clear voice rang out."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">All the Qing Clan members in the carriage all got down as well!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui saw that another twenty plus people had appeared, with a young man, or rather, a strong man at the age of approximately thirty years old, in the lead. He had a well-proportioned figure and wore embroidered clothes. However, his forehead was a bit bulging, his eye sockets deep, had a hawk nose, lips like blade, and his eyes extremely sharp.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">About twenty elderly appeared before the man. The thing that Qing Shui was astonished about was the fact that they were all experts at the Martial King level. There were even two who were Peak Martial Kings.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"No wonder no one in Greencloud Continent dares to offend this Soulreaper Valley. Only a sect like the Heavenly Palace could afford to offend them. Even one from "a big household and own great businesses" would not dare to take action easily, let alone the others. As time passed, the people from Soulreaper Valley naturally grew increasingly arrogant. Qing Clan smiled as he looked at the big group of people before him. Adding to those earlier, there were now about 120 of them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Young Master, this person knocked down and killed one of our people in broad daylight but still remained so arrogant. Look at how he's appearing as if nothing had happened as all." The man with a sharp mouth and a chin like an ape's who had stopped Qing Shui earlier now turned to the young man and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Oh, so that's how it is!" The man's sharp gaze turned toward Qing Shui then toward the people behind him. When he saw Wenren Wu-shuang, Shi Qingzhuang, Mingyue Gelou and Yiye Jiange, obvious excitement had lit up in his eyes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui frowned. He did not like such gazes. However, such gazes were frequent. It was normal for men to show such gazes when they come across beauties. Those with power would want to use their means to get their hands on them, and the methods they choose tend to be very extreme.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Those without power would naturally only be able to steal a few more looks.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that this man who was called the Young Master at least felt that he was one with power. Therefore, when he came across good things, including beautiful ladies, he would naturally want them for himself.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even Qing Shui had times when he felt like becoming a bandit, a powerful bandit, snatching beautiful ladies and good items for himself. It was a direct and fast approach.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had also thought of becoming one of those profligate sons with money and power. With a extremely big tree back facing him, he could play with birds or plant flowers when he had nothing to do; get a few beautiful lasses to serve him or pretend to be a big shot every now and then and beat up other profligate sons like himself and tease young girls...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The young man glanced at the people behind Qing Shui, and his gaze stopped when he saw Lin Zhanhan and Yiye Jiange. His brows also furrowed slightly, his gaze seemed as if he was going through a struggle.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled. He could tell what level this young man was at. The Soulreaper Valley's Young Master was also considered a genius. And if things went well, the Soulreaper Valley could really remain arrogant for a really long while.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The man was also a Peak Martial King with a strength of 2 countries. Lin Zhanhan had a strength of 3 countries. However, there were two elderly behind the man who had a strength of 4 countries.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Who are you guys? Why did you knock down and kill one of our people?" The man asked Qing Shui, because he noticed that this demonic looking young man was very calm. Most importantly, he could not tell what cultivation level Qing Shui was at.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was stunned. This young man was really sly, to speak up first. Just from this line alone, he had already indicated that he did not wish to let this matter go and was planning to check out Qing Shui's background.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui naturally was not a pushover. Especially when he saw the gaze the guy was using to stare at Yiye Jiange, he had very much wanted to cripple him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Since we've knocked down someone, I'm willing to pay a compensation. State a price!" Qing Shui smiled as he looked at the man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"You've ran over one of the men from our Soulreaper Valley in Kaiyang Country, killed him and now you're saying that you'll compensate with money? You think too highly of yourself." The man's gaze turned into one of indifference as he replied.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Oh? Then how do you think that we should settle this?" Qing Shui smiled with the mark in the centre of his forehead flashing a blood red color.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"A life for a life!" The man looked at Qing Shui and said calmly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"That isn't asking for too much, but whose life do you think should be used to compensate?"</p>

 <p dir="ltr">In Hundred Miles City, Xiantian was already at the peak amongst all the cultivators. Moreover, even if experts from outside came to wreck havoc in Hundred Miles City, they would still need to take into considerations of Qing Shui's existence.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Unknowingly, Qing Shui could feel that the hand holding Shi Qingzhuang felt tight. Shi Qingzhuang had grabbed his hand tightly!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Earlier, Qing Shui stopped the people from Shi Clan from sending him off as he did not wish to alarm too many people.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Swiftly, Qing Clan and Shi Qingzhuang both returned to Qing Clan and after the preparations were finished, everyone boarded the "horse carriage" which had been considered extremely big in the Hundred Miles City.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Gigantic Elephant pulled the carriage. Although it appeared very magnificent, not many people knew about it since the species are quite rare and could only be evolved. There was no such type of elephant to begin with. Beasts which contained elephant's bloodline could evolve into the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, but it was just that the possibility was extremely low.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was no need to maneuver since Qing Shui let the Fire Bird lead the way in the air. The Diamond Gigantic Elephant only needed to follow behind with the carriage. Therefore, everyone only needed to stay within the carriage which was bigger than a room.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing You and company were very much willing to take the outside seats of the "horse carriage". They gazed at the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's tremendous size as it moved gradually on the flat surface, pulling the carriage.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Brother Qing Shui, this carriage is extremely comfortable and doesn't shake in the slightest! It gives the same feeling as riding on a flying demonic beast! Even those rich people would not be able to enjoy a ride on such a high quality carriage! This feels good!" Qing You stood at the carriage's shaft and smiled as she exclaimed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"That's right, Brother Shui is the best!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang sat quietly on one side of Qing Shui, while Yiye Jiange and Luanluan sat on the other, followed by Mingyue Gelou and Yuchang. However, Yuchang would frequently run over to the area where Qing Shui was.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Seated on the opposite of him were Qing Yi, Qingqing and Wenren Wu-shuang. Qing Bei also sat there. Following them were Qing Luo and the other men, with Qing Shui's aunt on one side, and behind them were also the big group of Qing Clan's 3rd generation.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was incredibly cosy in the carriage. There were tables, chairs, and even beds. This was the benefit of having such a large carriage. This was why everyone gathered together in small groups, chatting the topics they were interested in.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, is everyone in Greencloud Continent rich?" Feng Feiyan played with the playful Little Changfeng, as she smiled and looked at Qing Shui and asked.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"There's always commoners in any place. After all, not every person is rich. It's just like how in our Hundred Miles City, there are few Xiantian cultivators. But outside, even if its in the Continent's Capital, there's still a small percentage of Xiantian cultivators. It's impossible to see Xiantian cultivators everywhere on the streets."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Then would it be good for us to do our business there? We aren't familiar with the place." Uncle Qing Hu asked, a bit excited and a bit worried.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"If you guys wish to start a business, you can just get a shop. There's no need to worry about the medicinal herbs and other stuff. When you become more familiar, you can slowly expand the business." Qing Shui said, thinking about it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Brother Qing Shui, can I really join the Heavenly Palace?" Qing You asked excitedly. He knew that one must be at least a Xiantian cultivator to be able to join the Heavenly Palace.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Of course you can. However, amongst the millions of people in the Heavenly Palace, you'll be the weakest of them all." Qing Shui grinned as he looked at Qing You.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I know that too. The stress is really great. With there being so many people, just anyone would be able to bully me." Qing You spoke with a bitter expression on his face.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"That's why I said that you need to work hard. You are quite talented but you're determination is not firm. As long as you have determination, you'll be able to breakthrough to Xiantian very quickly." Qing Shui understood that he needed to give him some motivation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Stop! Stop…!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I'm talking to you! Stop the carriage..."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Screech!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Ahhh!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Hm? Someone's been knocked dead by us?" Qing Shui's brows twitched and said, as he lifted up the curtains and walked out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They had left the Hundred Miles City for about half a month and had travelled across two countries. This should still be within Kaiyang Country, a country at the extreme west of Greencloud Continent. However, Kaiyang Country was still considered a fairly strong country in the Greencloud Continent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Stop him! Stop him! To think that he dares to knock down someone in broad daylight in our Kaiyang Country!" A man about thirty plus years old with a sharp mouth, triangular nose and a high pitch voice bellowed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Swiftly, close to a hundred people appeared, each of them equipped in heavy armor but their weapons were all long hooks which were three plus meters long. Their arms were very thick and muscular. The giant hooks in their hands flashed with a cold gleam.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Kaiyang Country's Soulreaper Valley!" Qing Shui frowned as he exclaimed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Lad, you know your stuff. In Greencloud Continent, even those strong warriors in the Continent's Capital aren't as arrogant as you, to run over someone from our Soulreaper Valley and yet still be so arrogant."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew about the Soulreaper Valley as well. He had heard Heavenly Palace's Old Ancestor talk about it before. This Kaiyang Country was actually not as well-known as the Soulreaper Valley, and the Soulreaper Valley was only well-known because of one person. Otherwise, it would only be considered a 2nd rate sect in Greencloud Continent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Soulreaper Valley had a character whose abilities was comparable to the Heavenly Palace's Old Ancestor. Therefore, even those 1st rate sects would not dare to behave atrociously there. Even if they were killed, there was nothing that could be done about it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui saw that the person who was run over laid in the middle of the road. But before power, everything was useless. If one was not strong enough, even if the victim was not knocked dead, or even if he was not knocked down at all, they could still be stopped in their tracks.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the horse carriage then at the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. He knew that the other party had gotten interested in the "treasures" in his carriage.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Ya Lin, what's wrong? What happened? Just then a clear voice rang out."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">All the Qing Clan members in the carriage all got down as well!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui saw that another twenty plus people had appeared, with a young man, or rather, a strong man at the age of approximately thirty years old, in the lead. He had a well-proportioned figure and wore embroidered clothes. However, his forehead was a bit bulging, his eye sockets deep, had a hawk nose, lips like blade, and his eyes extremely sharp.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">About twenty elderly appeared before the man. The thing that Qing Shui was astonished about was the fact that they were all experts at the Martial King level. There were even two who were Peak Martial Kings.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"No wonder no one in Greencloud Continent dares to offend this Soulreaper Valley. Only a sect like the Heavenly Palace could afford to offend them. Even one from "a big household and own great businesses" would not dare to take action easily, let alone the others. As time passed, the people from Soulreaper Valley naturally grew increasingly arrogant. Qing Clan smiled as he looked at the big group of people before him. Adding to those earlier, there were now about 120 of them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Young Master, this person knocked down and killed one of our people in broad daylight but still remained so arrogant. Look at how he's appearing as if nothing had happened as all." The man with a sharp mouth and a chin like an ape's who had stopped Qing Shui earlier now turned to the young man and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Oh, so that's how it is!" The man's sharp gaze turned toward Qing Shui then toward the people behind him. When he saw Wenren Wu-shuang, Shi Qingzhuang, Mingyue Gelou and Yiye Jiange, obvious excitement had lit up in his eyes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui frowned. He did not like such gazes. However, such gazes were frequent. It was normal for men to show such gazes when they come across beauties. Those with power would want to use their means to get their hands on them, and the methods they choose tend to be very extreme.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Those without power would naturally only be able to steal a few more looks.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that this man who was called the Young Master at least felt that he was one with power. Therefore, when he came across good things, including beautiful ladies, he would naturally want them for himself.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even Qing Shui had times when he felt like becoming a bandit, a powerful bandit, snatching beautiful ladies and good items for himself. It was a direct and fast approach.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He had also thought of becoming one of those profligate sons with money and power. With a extremely big tree back facing him, he could play with birds or plant flowers when he had nothing to do; get a few beautiful lasses to serve him or pretend to be a big shot every now and then and beat up other profligate sons like himself and tease young girls...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The young man glanced at the people behind Qing Shui, and his gaze stopped when he saw Lin Zhanhan and Yiye Jiange. His brows also furrowed slightly, his gaze seemed as if he was going through a struggle.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled. He could tell what level this young man was at. The Soulreaper Valley's Young Master was also considered a genius. And if things went well, the Soulreaper Valley could really remain arrogant for a really long while.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The man was also a Peak Martial King with a strength of 2 countries. Lin Zhanhan had a strength of 3 countries. However, there were two elderly behind the man who had a strength of 4 countries.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Who are you guys? Why did you knock down and kill one of our people?" The man asked Qing Shui, because he noticed that this demonic looking young man was very calm. Most importantly, he could not tell what cultivation level Qing Shui was at.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was stunned. This young man was really sly, to speak up first. Just from this line alone, he had already indicated that he did not wish to let this matter go and was planning to check out Qing Shui's background.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui naturally was not a pushover. Especially when he saw the gaze the guy was using to stare at Yiye Jiange, he had very much wanted to cripple him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Since we've knocked down someone, I'm willing to pay a compensation. State a price!" Qing Shui smiled as he looked at the man.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"You've ran over one of the men from our Soulreaper Valley in Kaiyang Country, killed him and now you're saying that you'll compensate with money? You think too highly of yourself." The man's gaze turned into one of indifference as he replied.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Oh? Then how do you think that we should settle this?" Qing Shui smiled with the mark in the centre of his forehead flashing a blood red color.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"A life for a life!" The man looked at Qing Shui and said calmly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"That isn't asking for too much, but whose life do you think should be used to compensate?"</p>
