 <p><strong>AST 837 - Like a hot knife through butter, Heart Toxin Talisman</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui heard their conversation clearly. The man verified the information that Hu Wenlong was dead. More importantly, Hu Wenlong was killed within seconds. If Qing Shui had the ability to kill Hu Wenlong in seconds, Hu Yunlong knew that Qing Shui could also easily kill him.</p>
 <p>“Hey, look! Someone actually went to burn Hu Wei Adventurer Guild. They must be very powerful to do that!” Some people cheered happily when they noticed from a distance.</p>
 <p>“Yes! I think Hu Wei Adventurer Guild is in deep trouble now! I can’t wait to see a good show!” Someone immediately replied.</p>
 <p>“Hu Wei Adventurer Guild has committed so many atrocities over the years, this must be a retribution from heaven!”</p>
 <p>“Hey, lower your voices. If Hu Wei Adventurer Guild wins this and finds out about this discussion, they won’t spare us,” a middle-aged man, who had been silent, quickly warned.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“What vendetta do you have against Hu Wei Adventurer Guild? “ Hu Yunlong looked at Qing Shui, he was still unable to accept that Qing Shui could actually kill Hu Wenlong.</p>
 <p>“Because you dare to bully my woman. So should I annihilate all of you?” Qing Shui said calmly.</p>
 <p>Hu Yunlong stared blankly at Yun Duan, who was slightly behind Qing Shui. He had never heard any news about the most beautiful woman in Heavenly Beast City having a romantic relationship. He never expected that she would entrust herself to such a powerful man and one so young.</p>
 <p>It was no wonder why she didn’t fancy any of the young talented men in Heavenly Beast City since those men weren’t even worthy of carrying this young man’s shoes. She probably saw those arrogant men as childish fools and he himself wasn’t that powerful anyway.</p>
 <p>Yun Duan trembled again when she heard what Qing Shui said. What did he meant by that? She was his woman?</p>
 <p>His words were loud and clear so the many people around them all heard what he said.</p>
 <p>What is he doing? Was he announcing his relationship with her? Yun Duan silently observed the man in front of her.</p>
 <p>“Didn’t I tell you? How can such a beautiful woman be unattached?” Someone explained hearing what Qing Shui had said.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Only such an outstanding man is worthy to be with her. This time round Hu Wei Adventurer Guild has made the wrong move in coercing Cloud Adventurer Guild. We can watch a good show now!” another person immediately said, rejoicing in Hu Wei Adventurer Guild’s impending doom.</p>
 <p>“Yang Laosan, don’t speak so loudly. What if the members from Hu Wei Adventurer Guild seek revenge on you?” a middle-aged man advised the man who spoke.</p>
 <p>“Hehe. Can’t you see that their buildings have been burnt down? Hu Wei Adventurer Guild will definitely be destroyed today! This man will never let those people escape!” Yang Laosan rebutted, smiling.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“I will give you a chance to give it your best shot. Otherwise, you won’t even get to do anything,” Qing Shui said looking at Hu Yunlong. He was neither being careless nor righteous when he said this.</p>
 <p>With a wave of his hand, he summoned his Diamond Gigantic Elephant. He wanted to a make a lasting impression with all the strength he possessed. This was mainly so that no one would dare to target Cloud Adventurer Guild even after he left, since he had promised her that she would be safe. Besides that, Qing Shui also had other intentions.</p>
 <p>Hu Yunlong took our his sword. It was a long sword which glowed with a moving green light. There was a sort of natural aura within it making it seem almost alive.</p>
 <p>“Let’s attack him together, kill him!” Hu Yunlong suddenly yelled and rushed towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Even if one lost, they should keep their dignity and poise. The fact that they could not even do that made it clear that they had already lost.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui responded calmly, drawing out his Big Dipper Sword. Since his opponents attacked first, he did not need to take anything else into consideration. He displayed his Combination Sword Technique and Cloudmist Steps together, in perfect unison.</p>
 <p>Boom! Boom!</p>
 <p>His Diamond Gigantic Elephant used its Mighty Elephant Stomp in the middle of the compound. The buildings around them fell rapidly. The impact was so forceful that it seemed like the entire ground would be destroyed. Even the people surrounding them were thrown a few hundred meters away!</p>
 <p>Seven Star Armored Vest!</p>
 <p>Without taking out his Thunder God, Qing Shui directly donned his Seven Star Armored Vest— he would have no problems as long as he didn’t receive damage to his vital points. His Four Moves Combination Sword Technique already gave a preview of his overwhelming strength.</p>
 <p>Sixth Wave of the Sword!</p>
 <p>Taking the opportunity, he immediately kill one of his opponents.</p>
 <p>Cloudmist Steps gave him an almost demonic-like presence in such battles. With Qing Shui’s speed, his opponents could only react passively— that meant that they could only stand there getting thrashed. Within a short time, half of his opponents were already defeated.</p>
 <p>Critical Damage!</p>
 <p>Without the added stats from his Thunder God, Qing Shui’s ability was not much higher than those people. He might even be a little weaker than Hu Yunlong but he had many ways of getting rid of that man.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui paused for a moment. Killing wasn’t his final goal but only a means to an end. Yun Duan walked to his side and he turned and smiled at her. “Let’s go back!”</p>
 <p>Yun Duan smiled and nodded.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha…”</p>
 <p>Just then, a loud laughter rang out in the air. The resounding laughter was marred with resentment and recklessness.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shifted in front of Yun Duan quickly as he locked his eyes on a position in front of him.</p>
 <p>An indistinct smile appeared on Yun Duan’s face as she gazed at Qing Shui, who was shielding her. She had so many surprises today and she really wanted to hug him, that thought made her blush.</p>
 <p>Many people were taken aback by the sudden laughter. Even a fool would know that the person who laughed was very powerful because even though the laughter was a few hundred meters away, it was ear-piercingly loud.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out his Thunder God without panicking and continued looking in the direction the laughter came from.</p>
 <p>A sturdy-looking old man walked towards them. His clothes were shabby and his hair was a mess. When Qing Shui saw the old man, he instantly understood the situation. That old man had been cultivating in seclusion.</p>
 <p>The old man’s face was full of sorrow when he saw the rubble around him. Then, it was replaced with rage. Finally, he gave Qing Shui a deadly stare, “Why did you do this?”</p>
 <p>“Because they deserved to die! Who are you?” Qing Shui stared at the old man. That old man was much more powerful than Hu Wenlong so Qing Shui took out his Violet Gold Divine Shield.</p>
 <p>“They deserved to die? Haha! Then, you too! I don’t know who I am but others call me Hu Langsha.” The old man’s eyes glowed with anger as he looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Huh, Hu Langsha. Didn’t he died twenty years ago?” Yun Duan blurted.</p>
 <p>“You know him?” Qing Shui asked without turning his head.</p>
 <p>“Twenty years ago, he was the most powerful person in Hu Wei Adventurer Guild. He is Hu Wenlong and Hu Yunlong’s father. After he came from Tiger Gorge Mountain with serious wounds, there were rumors that he died before he could recover. I didn’t think that he would be alive.” Yun Duan said worriedly.</p>
 <p>“After I went into isolation for twenty years, I never expected that my territory would be totally razed to ground. Fine then! Let me see how good you are?” The old man pulled out a fully purple long sword after he finished his sentence and waved his hand.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a huge demonic beast, entirely red, appeared above the old man’s head. Qing Shui was stunned for a moment when he realized that it was a Four-headed Red Jiao.</p>
 <p>A Four-headed Red Jiao is a variety of Fantastic Beast. If it was another type of Four-headed Jiao, Qing Shui might have been a bit apprehensive but a red variety of this did not threaten him, since a Red Jiao’s speciality was fire.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s body had a very high resistance against fire because he possessed his primordial flames. Normal flames did little damage to him but that demonic beast still looked quite fearsome.</p>
 <p>The Four-headed Red Jiao was about a hundred meters long. It’s girth was about the size of three large water vats. A fiery aura enveloped its body while it moved and red hot steam poured from its four large sinister-looking horns. The air in the surrounding atmosphere became scorching hot, so much so that those who were weaker could not approach.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui kept his Firebird. Carrying Yun Duan, he jumped up onto his Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>“Young fella, your elephant will be slaughtered in seconds by my Red Jiao,” Hu Langsha said disdainfully.</p>
 <p>I only need a split second to kill that giant worm of yours!” Qing Shui laughed, looking at the old man. He summoned his Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable so that it could protect Yun Duan. Next, he summoned his Thunderous Beast.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui summoned his demonic beasts, Hu Langsha’s eyes narrowed. He was very experienced and knowledgeable so he could recognize all the demonic beasts that Qing Shui had summoned. Then, he looked at the dead Hu Wei Adventurer Guild members. He had a feeling that this was not going to be as easy as he had thought.</p>
 <p>“Imbecile!”</p>
 <p>“Come meet your death!” the old man brandished his purple sword and charged at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Remember, don’t get down!” Qing Shui turned to look at Yun Duan and then he retreated backwards quickly.</p>
 <p>Descending Heavens Talisman!</p>
 <p>At the same time, his Diamond Gigantic Elephant activated its Vajra Subdues Demons!</p>
 <p>Fiery Golden Eyes!</p>
 <p>Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>The effects immediately affected the old man.</p>
 <p>The old man stopped suddenly. Qing Shui stood still as if he had anticipated that the old man would stop. He then looked at the old man who was now twenty meters away from him.</p>
 <p>Hu Langsha’s body wobbled for a few moments, both his eyes locked onto Qing Shui, his hand on his purple sword trembled.</p>
 <p>His strength had been shaved down from nine stars to not even six stars.</p>
 <p>When a person’s strength had been reduced by more than one third, how could they not be shocked and panic stricken! And at this moment, Qing Shui took out another talisman.</p>
 <p>Heart Toxin Talisman!</p>
 <p>This was a Talisman that he had not tested.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui laughed looked at the Heart Toxin Talisman in his hand. The woman on it was still as enchanting as before. He took a look at the old man and wondered if the “heart attack” effect of the talisman would cause the old man to be embroiled in the pain of that man’s past affections.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui had tested it, he remembered all the women who he felt guilty towards. There were also times where he saw visions where he was killed by Di Chen and Yiye Chuge.</p>
 <p>After that, Qing Shui discovered that his Heart Toxin Talisman would stir the emotions of the victim and drown the victim in fear. The hallucinations could appear so real that anyone without a strong spiritual energy would be driven insane.</p>
 <p>This Heart Toxin Talisman could be immensely effective in battle. The cost of being even slightly affected by it was a definite death. More important, it was unavoidable, unless one possessed an incredibly high amount of spiritual energy.</p>
