 <p><strong>Chapter 465 A True Man Should Strive To Kill, Provoking the Feng Clan.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>Chapter 465 - A Real Man Should Strive To Kill: Provoking the Feng Clan</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Do you think that I’m going to kill you right now?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui exuded an overwhelming aura. Feng Yunyang and the rest were forced to take a few steps back. He looked at Qing Shui with a pale face, unable to conceal the fear in his eyes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Feng Yunyang couldn’t help but shiver. After all, he could lose his life any minute now. In this situation, these profligate sons couldn’t even withstand the murderous intent that Qing Shui was currently exuding.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Feng Yunyang subconsciously swept his gaze around the surroundings and saw many people mocking him. This incited in him the sudden urge to escape. As the Feng Clan’s young master, he had never felt this humiliated before.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“See at how arrogant he was. Now look at how humble he is.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yeah. He had even said something like ‘even the arrival of the heavenly king wouldn’t suffice as compensation!’” someone added, as if the other insult wasn’t severe enough.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Do you think ‘no balls’ here will fight like a man for once?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The endless abuse stabbed deep into Feng Yunyang’s heart like a hot knife through butter. His blood immediately boiled. He suddenly lifted his head and glared at Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If you dare to kill me, the Feng Clan will wipe out your entire clan!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You really have a death wish!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui snorted contemptuously and walked nearer Feng Yunyang. His right arm exploded forth so quickly that sparks flared!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ripping Tiger Claw!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hold your horses, mister!” A voice compellingly called out.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A smile broke out on Feng Yunyang’s face. “You’re gonna get it this time, brat…...”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He was stunned before he could even finish his sentence. Qing Shui’s palm had landed squarely on his solar plexus!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Plop!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A dull noise thudded, as if a watermelon had been hammered open by a maul!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He was sent flying while blood rained down. A look of disbelief shone in his eyes until his very final breath. It was a pity that he was quickly swallowed up by an abyss of darkness.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had only just now turned around to look at the man who was rushing towards him. This middle-aged man looked ordinary, but was well built. He carried an air of maturity due to the thick eyebrows and big eyes on his square face. It was hard to hate a face like that.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The middle-aged man was surprised to see Qing Shui strike Feng Yunyang down on the spot. He then sighed. “Do you really think you can oppose the Feng Clan?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The man’s voice was laced with both helplessness and a bit of confusion!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Who are you? Are you telling me that he can’t be killed?” Qing Shui asked calmly, essentially emotionless.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I am the guardian of the Feng Clan. You are a talented man, but you are too impulsive,” the middle-aged man said to Qing Shui, pitying him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Then what are you going to do now?” He looked at this guardian of the Feng Clan. Although he didn’t know his character in any sort of detail, he could sense his strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He was actually at the peak of the Martial King grade, with the strength of nearly two countries!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui assumed that the man’s position wouldn’t be low in the Feng Clan, but he had no idea if he was directly related to the clan. Though having seen the happy expression on Feng Yunyang’s face as soon as he saw the middle-aged man, he ought to be directly related to the Feng Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No matter how abominable the people of the Feng Clan are, he is still one of the Feng Clan. Nobody is allowed to judge or harm the Clan. Since you are brave enough to do this, you have now incurred the wrath of the Feng Clan,” the middle-aged man declared calmly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had thought that this middle-aged man was someone who appreciated talents and someone who had a sense of righteousness. He didn’t expect him to be another person who honored his clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But Qing Shui could understand it. In the World of the Nine Continents, strength decided one’s influence, and familial ties were above all else. Qing Shui approved of this. He also had nothing to say about pride since they were strong and thus deserved to be proud.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If someone from the Qing Clan had been killed by someone, Qing Shui would also come forward and refuse to allow anyone to harm his clan. So he didn’t think that the middle-aged man was doing anything wrong. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But he must be prepared. Prepared to be suppressed. People who were overly proud, or arrogant, wouldn’t meet a good end. They would usually die a horrible death.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hahaha!” Qing Shui laughed lightly, but his laughter could be heard from afar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why are you laughing?” The middle-aged man couldn’t understand and asked in puzzlement about Qing Shui’s sudden outburst. It seemed like a sort of release and even had a hint of derangement.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The Heavenly Palace has turned into this because of the lot of you worthless things. The generations of the Feng Clan is going to stop here.” Qing Shui’s voice wasn’t loud, yet his statement was carried to many people, instantly making them felt hot-blooded.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Preposterous!” The middle-aged man both laughed and yelled in righteous indignation and fury.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Kill him, Uncle Chen!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Kill him, Uncle Chen!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The men who remained shouted to the middle-aged man’s name.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Come. Or else you won’t have any other chance,” said the middle-aged man, looking at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stared at him in disdain. He knew that he couldn’t even tell what his strength was. Even so, Qing Shui no longer planned to go easy on him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A real man should strive to kill!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gradually accelerated the qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique circulating within his body. The strength in his body had reached a terrifyingly colossal strength of 11.5 million jin!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He didn’t even wear his armor or take his weapon out! He hadn’t even prepared to use his Heavenly Talisman.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Frenzied Bull’s Strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui didn’t plan to fight with his full strength, because his power had already reached 27 million jin. This was the strength of more than two countries, which was more than enough to take care of this middle aged-man before him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Without speaking further, he sprinted at the middle-aged man!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tiger Laceration!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Art of Pursuing!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui used a basic attack along with the Art of Pursuing the Great Perfection Stage!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He didn’t budge, but the middle-aged man immediately recoiled a few steps back. The expression on his face changed immediately as he stared at Qing Shui. He knew that he had underestimated this youth who stood before him, and this underestimation might cost him his life.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He felt an uncomfortable heaviness in his legs, as if he had just stepped on extremely sticky tar. Not only that, he also felt as if something very heavy rested on his body.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">20% of weight and speed was a very impressive amount. To a peak Martial King, this 20% of speed reduction and weight increase was simply too significant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui didn’t even allow him any chances to gasp for breath. The disparities between their speed was beyond comparison. Qing Shui punched out with both of his arms, his attacks raining down like a torrential downpour in a monsoon.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They were not even on the same level in the first place. Qing Shui could easily and completely suppress the middle-aged man with just his brute force. Booming noises were endlessly thundering from the public square.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The middle-aged man was going through unspeakably bitter suffering. The direction of the entire battle had fallen into Qing Shui’s hands. He had thought that killing Qing Shui with his own abilities would be as easy as flipping a hand. It seemed that the gap between a cultivator who barely reached the peak of Martial King grade and him was still a great difference.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had been using the Connecting Fist!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He didn’t instantly kill the middle-aged man, simply planning to use him as a punching bag first.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The middle-aged man finally failed to endure and coughed out a mouthful of blood.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This mouthful of blood clearly sent a obvious message to many. Some were shocked, some were happy, some were anxious; and the people brought here by Feng Yunyang, who were shouting for Qing Shui to be beaten to death earlier, instantly paled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui couldn’t care less about anything. His fists continued to strike true one after another without stopping, and they got even faster and harder.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He punched once again with his fist. Like a gigantic fleeing snake that was as quick as lightning, the punch left a long, trailing afterimage in the air.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Energy passed through the back; Back Connecting Longfist Killing Technique!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bang!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The middle-aged man was once again forced to retreat from the relentless attacks. Blood spilled from the corner of his mouth and stained the front of his clothes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Plop!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The middle-aged man crumpled to the floor, motionless. He soaked in a pool of red from the blood that he vomited. As he lay on the floor, it was uncertain if he was dead..</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I will not kill you all today. Take him back and inform them that I, Qing Shui, will personally go to the Feng Clan in three days. You can tell them that the purpose of me going over is for a visit or you can say it is to wipe out the Feng Clan!” Qing Shui said without looking at those few other people.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“How strong! This is what I call a man!” A curvy woman sighed, infatuated with Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The Feng Clan is a large, prestigious, and influential clan. The skills of the experts within the clan are as high as the clouds. Qing Shui is still too young. To knock on their door is to throw away his life.” An elderly man with a beard also sighed, though for different reasons.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why doesn’t such a talented man like Qing Shui have an influential figure supporting him?” an elderly man questioned pitiably.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Thank you, Brother Qing Shui!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yan Ling’er expressed her gratitude to Qing Shui happily after he left the arena.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui let out a sigh. He didn’t know what to say.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, I’m so sorry. It’s because of me that you and the Feng Clan…” Tears welled up in Yang Ling’er’s eyes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It’s not because of you. Don’t think too much. I have only conveniently saved you. I am not afraid of the Feng Clan at all. If I were, I wouldn’t have saved you in the first place.” Qing Shui said flatly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Devastated, despair flashed across Yan Ling’er’s eyes. But she still forced out a smile for Qing Shui!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright, I’m leaving. I think no one will dare to bully you again in the future,” Qing Shui told Yan Ling’er indifferently.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Anything else?” Qing Shui stopped in his tracks, he couldn’t bear to look at this lonely lass.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Never mind!” Yang Ling’er never said anything in the end. Her once beating heart was completely crushed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For some reason, Qing Shui looked back and glanced at that lonely silhouette that was leaving silently after he took a few steps. He didn’t feel any better in his heart either; it was a little painful. He was able to treat Qing Bei nicely. Why couldn’t he treat her the same way too?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What am I still so bothered about?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It’s over and I was the one who let them off that time. Moreover, they didn’t even do anything wrong and had even taken care of Qing Qing for a bit. What more do I still wish for?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If they are outsiders and have helped Qing Qing before, I should even personally visit their residence to pay my respects, just like what I did for that Guo Polu.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Is it because they are part of the Yan Clan?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why is it usually so easy to forgive people who are not your close relatives but when it instead comes to your own relatives, you would hurt them even if doing so hurts yourself?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui didn’t know if what he felt was normal for others!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">While he headed towards Cang Wuya’s residence, news of the recent incident spread like wildfire throughout the Heavenly Palace. After all, it was a challenge issued by one person to an entire clan. Everyone was aware of the large disparities in strength between this person and the clan, yet he still went on to issue the challenge with just his abilities alone.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Wild conjectures were flying everywhere!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Some believed that Qing Shui had a powerful supporter behind the scenes, some said that he was a madman…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had arrived at Cang Wuya’s residence!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He was surprised to discover that Cang Wuya, Fei Wuji, Canghai Mingyue, Huoyun Liu-Li, Mingyue Gelou and Little Yuchang were all there despite it still being early in the afternoon. All of them were looking at Qing Shui anxiously!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, how can you be foolish enough to challenge the Feng Clan?” Huoyun Liu-Li asked worriedly, and quickly walked over.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The others looked at him similarly frowning, but didn’t say anything.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It will be fine. Don’t worry,” Qing Shui chuckled.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“How would it be fine? There are many Supreme Elders within the Feng Clan. How will you be fine?” Huoyun Liu-Li questioned him doubtfully.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was actually establishing his dominance with this. It was a message to others that no one was allowed to harm anyone related to him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You can ask Old Man. Ask him if I’ll be fine,” Qing Shui told her with a smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Cang Wuya skeptically. She wanted to hear the opinions of this elder because he was the strongest among them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li, my lass. Qing Shui wouldn’t normally do something he has no confidence in. He must have his own reason or reasons for doing this. Today, he needs to make us believe he will be fine. What do you say?” Cang Wuya smiled, even though he was still worried.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“All right!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everyone once again directed their gaze on Qing Shui!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui nodded with a smile and then walked to his bedroom.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He entered the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Putting on the Golden-Ringed Battle Armor, and with the Big Dipper Sword in his hands, he slapped a piece of Godly Force Talisman and Divine Shield Talisman on his body!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He exited the realm and slowly made his way downstairs!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Frenzied Bull’s Strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Big Dipper Sword!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Golden-Ringed Battle Armor!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gradually circulated all the aura in his body, including techniques that raised qi aura, such as the Core Qi Technique and Mental State akin to that of Immovable Mountains!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His body already possessed 11.5 million jin of colossal strength. With these additional effects, his strength was immediately raised to the amount of three and half countries or even close to four countries!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The strength of nearly four countries!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In addition to those qi auras, it was no less powerful than the strength of four countries!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the peak of Qing Shui’s current strength, achieved with the help of a weapon, armor and a Godly Force Talisman. If he could have a breakthrough in his Upper Dantian, he would be able to successfully achieve the strength of four countries.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Soon. Qing Shui knew it would happen very soon. Qing Shui had said to visit in three days because he was actually waiting for his Upper Dantian to bear the Heavenly Dan. He had a feeling that he would have a higher chance with more time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Speaking of the upper Dantian, Qing Shui had been polishing his Ancient Strengthening Technique. He didn’t know if he would be able to cultivate the Upper Dantian and Middle Dantian in the end, but for now, he actually needed to cultivate the Upper Dantian in advance.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If, at that time, my Ancient Strengthening Technique cultivates with the Upper Dantian and the Middle Dantian, would they compete against each other or fuse together?” Qing Shui mulled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The moment Qing Shui released his qi aura invisibly, on the second floor, expressions of astonishment appeared on Cang Wuya’s and Fei Wuji’s faces. They could feel the powerful qi aura.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya’s strength was at the level of three countries. To raise one’s strength beyond the level of three countries was an extremely difficult task. This was because the cultivators of three countries had usually taken medicinal pills that aided in raising cultivation, including those widely recognised precious cultivation enhancement pills. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to reach the strength of three countries in the first place.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But now, Cang Wuya clearly felt that Qing Shui’s strength had surpassed his own by leaps and bounds. As they said, the strength of one country could easily suppress another. The gap of one country was the difference between heaven and earth.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What’s wrong with you, Grandfather?” Canghai Mingyue couldn’t help but ask after seeing the expression on Cang Wuya’s face. Cultivators below the strength of peak Martial King were unable to sense the terrifying aura of Qing Shui because the aura that he was exuding wasn’t specifically directed at anyone.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui slowly made his way downstairs!</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>Chapter 465 - A Real Man Should Strive To Kill: Provoking the Feng Clan</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Do you think that I’m going to kill you right now?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui exuded an overwhelming aura. Feng Yunyang and the rest were forced to take a few steps back. He looked at Qing Shui with a pale face, unable to conceal the fear in his eyes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Feng Yunyang couldn’t help but shiver. After all, he could lose his life any minute now. In this situation, these profligate sons couldn’t even withstand the murderous intent that Qing Shui was currently exuding.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Feng Yunyang subconsciously swept his gaze around the surroundings and saw many people mocking him. This incited in him the sudden urge to escape. As the Feng Clan’s young master, he had never felt this humiliated before.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“See at how arrogant he was. Now look at how humble he is.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yeah. He had even said something like ‘even the arrival of the heavenly king wouldn’t suffice as compensation!’” someone added, as if the other insult wasn’t severe enough.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Do you think ‘no balls’ here will fight like a man for once?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The endless abuse stabbed deep into Feng Yunyang’s heart like a hot knife through butter. His blood immediately boiled. He suddenly lifted his head and glared at Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If you dare to kill me, the Feng Clan will wipe out your entire clan!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You really have a death wish!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui snorted contemptuously and walked nearer Feng Yunyang. His right arm exploded forth so quickly that sparks flared!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ripping Tiger Claw!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hold your horses, mister!” A voice compellingly called out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A smile broke out on Feng Yunyang’s face. “You’re gonna get it this time, brat…...”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He was stunned before he could even finish his sentence. Qing Shui’s palm had landed squarely on his solar plexus!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Plop!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A dull noise thudded, as if a watermelon had been hammered open by a maul!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He was sent flying while blood rained down. A look of disbelief shone in his eyes until his very final breath. It was a pity that he was quickly swallowed up by an abyss of darkness.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had only just now turned around to look at the man who was rushing towards him. This middle-aged man looked ordinary, but was well built. He carried an air of maturity due to the thick eyebrows and big eyes on his square face. It was hard to hate a face like that.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The middle-aged man was surprised to see Qing Shui strike Feng Yunyang down on the spot. He then sighed. “Do you really think you can oppose the Feng Clan?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The man’s voice was laced with both helplessness and a bit of confusion!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Who are you? Are you telling me that he can’t be killed?” Qing Shui asked calmly, essentially emotionless.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I am the guardian of the Feng Clan. You are a talented man, but you are too impulsive,” the middle-aged man said to Qing Shui, pitying him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Then what are you going to do now?” He looked at this guardian of the Feng Clan. Although he didn’t know his character in any sort of detail, he could sense his strength.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He was actually at the peak of the Martial King grade, with the strength of nearly two countries!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui assumed that the man’s position wouldn’t be low in the Feng Clan, but he had no idea if he was directly related to the clan. Though having seen the happy expression on Feng Yunyang’s face as soon as he saw the middle-aged man, he ought to be directly related to the Feng Clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No matter how abominable the people of the Feng Clan are, he is still one of the Feng Clan. Nobody is allowed to judge or harm the Clan. Since you are brave enough to do this, you have now incurred the wrath of the Feng Clan,” the middle-aged man declared calmly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had thought that this middle-aged man was someone who appreciated talents and someone who had a sense of righteousness. He didn’t expect him to be another person who honored his clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But Qing Shui could understand it. In the World of the Nine Continents, strength decided one’s influence, and familial ties were above all else. Qing Shui approved of this. He also had nothing to say about pride since they were strong and thus deserved to be proud.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If someone from the Qing Clan had been killed by someone, Qing Shui would also come forward and refuse to allow anyone to harm his clan. So he didn’t think that the middle-aged man was doing anything wrong. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But he must be prepared. Prepared to be suppressed. People who were overly proud, or arrogant, wouldn’t meet a good end. They would usually die a horrible death.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hahaha!” Qing Shui laughed lightly, but his laughter could be heard from afar!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why are you laughing?” The middle-aged man couldn’t understand and asked in puzzlement about Qing Shui’s sudden outburst. It seemed like a sort of release and even had a hint of derangement.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The Heavenly Palace has turned into this because of the lot of you worthless things. The generations of the Feng Clan is going to stop here.” Qing Shui’s voice wasn’t loud, yet his statement was carried to many people, instantly making them felt hot-blooded.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Preposterous!” The middle-aged man both laughed and yelled in righteous indignation and fury.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Kill him, Uncle Chen!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Kill him, Uncle Chen!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The men who remained shouted to the middle-aged man’s name.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Come. Or else you won’t have any other chance,” said the middle-aged man, looking at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stared at him in disdain. He knew that he couldn’t even tell what his strength was. Even so, Qing Shui no longer planned to go easy on him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A real man should strive to kill!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gradually accelerated the qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique circulating within his body. The strength in his body had reached a terrifyingly colossal strength of 11.5 million jin!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He didn’t even wear his armor or take his weapon out! He hadn’t even prepared to use his Heavenly Talisman.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Frenzied Bull’s Strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui didn’t plan to fight with his full strength, because his power had already reached 27 million jin. This was the strength of more than two countries, which was more than enough to take care of this middle aged-man before him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Without speaking further, he sprinted at the middle-aged man!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tiger Laceration!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Art of Pursuing!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui used a basic attack along with the Art of Pursuing the Great Perfection Stage!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He didn’t budge, but the middle-aged man immediately recoiled a few steps back. The expression on his face changed immediately as he stared at Qing Shui. He knew that he had underestimated this youth who stood before him, and this underestimation might cost him his life.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He felt an uncomfortable heaviness in his legs, as if he had just stepped on extremely sticky tar. Not only that, he also felt as if something very heavy rested on his body.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">20% of weight and speed was a very impressive amount. To a peak Martial King, this 20% of speed reduction and weight increase was simply too significant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui didn’t even allow him any chances to gasp for breath. The disparities between their speed was beyond comparison. Qing Shui punched out with both of his arms, his attacks raining down like a torrential downpour in a monsoon.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They were not even on the same level in the first place. Qing Shui could easily and completely suppress the middle-aged man with just his brute force. Booming noises were endlessly thundering from the public square.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The middle-aged man was going through unspeakably bitter suffering. The direction of the entire battle had fallen into Qing Shui’s hands. He had thought that killing Qing Shui with his own abilities would be as easy as flipping a hand. It seemed that the gap between a cultivator who barely reached the peak of Martial King grade and him was still a great difference.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had been using the Connecting Fist!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He didn’t instantly kill the middle-aged man, simply planning to use him as a punching bag first.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The middle-aged man finally failed to endure and coughed out a mouthful of blood.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This mouthful of blood clearly sent a obvious message to many. Some were shocked, some were happy, some were anxious; and the people brought here by Feng Yunyang, who were shouting for Qing Shui to be beaten to death earlier, instantly paled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui couldn’t care less about anything. His fists continued to strike true one after another without stopping, and they got even faster and harder.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He punched once again with his fist. Like a gigantic fleeing snake that was as quick as lightning, the punch left a long, trailing afterimage in the air.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Energy passed through the back; Back Connecting Longfist Killing Technique!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Bang!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The middle-aged man was once again forced to retreat from the relentless attacks. Blood spilled from the corner of his mouth and stained the front of his clothes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Plop!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The middle-aged man crumpled to the floor, motionless. He soaked in a pool of red from the blood that he vomited. As he lay on the floor, it was uncertain if he was dead..</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I will not kill you all today. Take him back and inform them that I, Qing Shui, will personally go to the Feng Clan in three days. You can tell them that the purpose of me going over is for a visit or you can say it is to wipe out the Feng Clan!” Qing Shui said without looking at those few other people.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“How strong! This is what I call a man!” A curvy woman sighed, infatuated with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The Feng Clan is a large, prestigious, and influential clan. The skills of the experts within the clan are as high as the clouds. Qing Shui is still too young. To knock on their door is to throw away his life.” An elderly man with a beard also sighed, though for different reasons.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why doesn’t such a talented man like Qing Shui have an influential figure supporting him?” an elderly man questioned pitiably.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Thank you, Brother Qing Shui!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yan Ling’er expressed her gratitude to Qing Shui happily after he left the arena.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui let out a sigh. He didn’t know what to say.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, I’m so sorry. It’s because of me that you and the Feng Clan…” Tears welled up in Yang Ling’er’s eyes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It’s not because of you. Don’t think too much. I have only conveniently saved you. I am not afraid of the Feng Clan at all. If I were, I wouldn’t have saved you in the first place.” Qing Shui said flatly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Devastated, despair flashed across Yan Ling’er’s eyes. But she still forced out a smile for Qing Shui!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright, I’m leaving. I think no one will dare to bully you again in the future,” Qing Shui told Yan Ling’er indifferently.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Anything else?” Qing Shui stopped in his tracks, he couldn’t bear to look at this lonely lass.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Never mind!” Yang Ling’er never said anything in the end. Her once beating heart was completely crushed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">For some reason, Qing Shui looked back and glanced at that lonely silhouette that was leaving silently after he took a few steps. He didn’t feel any better in his heart either; it was a little painful. He was able to treat Qing Bei nicely. Why couldn’t he treat her the same way too?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What am I still so bothered about?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It’s over and I was the one who let them off that time. Moreover, they didn’t even do anything wrong and had even taken care of Qing Qing for a bit. What more do I still wish for?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If they are outsiders and have helped Qing Qing before, I should even personally visit their residence to pay my respects, just like what I did for that Guo Polu.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Is it because they are part of the Yan Clan?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why is it usually so easy to forgive people who are not your close relatives but when it instead comes to your own relatives, you would hurt them even if doing so hurts yourself?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui didn’t know if what he felt was normal for others!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">While he headed towards Cang Wuya’s residence, news of the recent incident spread like wildfire throughout the Heavenly Palace. After all, it was a challenge issued by one person to an entire clan. Everyone was aware of the large disparities in strength between this person and the clan, yet he still went on to issue the challenge with just his abilities alone.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Wild conjectures were flying everywhere!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Some believed that Qing Shui had a powerful supporter behind the scenes, some said that he was a madman…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had arrived at Cang Wuya’s residence!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He was surprised to discover that Cang Wuya, Fei Wuji, Canghai Mingyue, Huoyun Liu-Li, Mingyue Gelou and Little Yuchang were all there despite it still being early in the afternoon. All of them were looking at Qing Shui anxiously!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, how can you be foolish enough to challenge the Feng Clan?” Huoyun Liu-Li asked worriedly, and quickly walked over.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The others looked at him similarly frowning, but didn’t say anything.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It will be fine. Don’t worry,” Qing Shui chuckled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“How would it be fine? There are many Supreme Elders within the Feng Clan. How will you be fine?” Huoyun Liu-Li questioned him doubtfully.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was actually establishing his dominance with this. It was a message to others that no one was allowed to harm anyone related to him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You can ask Old Man. Ask him if I’ll be fine,” Qing Shui told her with a smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Cang Wuya skeptically. She wanted to hear the opinions of this elder because he was the strongest among them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li, my lass. Qing Shui wouldn’t normally do something he has no confidence in. He must have his own reason or reasons for doing this. Today, he needs to make us believe he will be fine. What do you say?” Cang Wuya smiled, even though he was still worried.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“All right!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everyone once again directed their gaze on Qing Shui!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui nodded with a smile and then walked to his bedroom.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He entered the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Putting on the Golden-Ringed Battle Armor, and with the Big Dipper Sword in his hands, he slapped a piece of Godly Force Talisman and Divine Shield Talisman on his body!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He exited the realm and slowly made his way downstairs!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Frenzied Bull’s Strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Big Dipper Sword!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Golden-Ringed Battle Armor!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
