Both of his eyes stared at the broken dragon thorn that was piercing over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This broken thorn emitted a special energy that felt like a spatial lock. Qing Shui wanted to evade, but he couldn’t do so. It wasn’t because his opponent’s speed was fast. It was simply a feeling that he couldn’t evade the strike, no matter how much he wanted to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s spiritual sense was very clear. He wouldn’t joke around with his life. Right now, he only had a single method left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sacrifice the pawn to protect the king!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Minute Subtlety!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It has been a very long time since Qing Shui had used Minute Subtlety. At the very instant before the dragon thorn pierced into his throat, a marvelous attractive force seemed to guide the thorn downwards in a slanted path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi!</span></p>

The broken dragon thorn pierced right into his shoulder. The wound was very deep but the dragon thorn didn’t manage to penetrate it cleanly. Qing Shui instantly felt an extremely cold coursing through his entire body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t over yet!</span></p>

This was the ultimate water elemental technique of the Third Palace Master - Frozen Solid!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this instant, despite having a Nine Yang Body, Qing Shui also felt his heart turn cold from fear. In spite of the chill, Qing Shui was still able to move. If it isn’t for his special physique, he would likely have already turned into a block of ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he still could move, his movements became much slower. Right now, he was in great danger and didn’t have much time to think. A golden beam of light flashed from the area near his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Third Palace Master was still very happy when he saw that the dragon thorn managed to pierce into Qing Shui’s shoulder. He knew that not many people could withstand the freezing energy within. Just as he was preparing to use his origin energy to augment the dragon thorn to shatter Qing Shui, he suddenly felt a pain in his brain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This pain acted up very fast, but the Third Palace Master didn’t believe that there was no cause for this pain. He hurriedly sent his origin Qi, wanting to use it to invade Qing Shui’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at this very moment, the Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm Qing Shui placed in the Third Palace Master’s body already started to nibble on his brain tissue. Such pain was something unbearable, no matter how strong one was in cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very swiftly, the Third Palace Master’s consciousness started to grow blurry. However, his origin qi still invaded Qing Shui’s body, causing more cracks to appear around Qing Shui’s wound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The meridians around it were broken, but luckily the wound wasn’t near his heart. If the wound was there, things would be extremely troublesome. Broken meridians were something incurable in the Nine Continents. Many cultivators were crippled because their meridians were broken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To cripple a cultivator, damage to the meridians must be precisely administered. Damage to the meridians near the cultivator’s shoulder wouldn’t be able to disable the cultivator at all. There were plenty of experts who had lost the use of a shoulder, but for those cases, it could still be considered damage to their meridians. Their combat prowess would be affected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only if those important meridians near the heart, the central Palace, dantian, or brain were damaged would the cultivator be crippled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Third Palace Master had died. He died an extremely swift death. Qing Shui had immense confidence in the abilities of the Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm. He glanced at the gory wound on his shoulder, yet a happy smile could be seen on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was on the border of life and death in this battle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he didn’t have the Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm, he would have no idea how to evade this calamity. At this moment, Qing Shui was completely drenched in his perspiration, yet he couldn’t feel the pain of his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His body was still very strong. The Nine Yang physique was able to ward off the cold in his body. He was slowly recovering, Qing Shui gritted his teeth and wrenched the broken thorn out of his body as he coughed out blood. The intense pain caused his body to tremble violently as he let out a groan of misery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took out some golden needles to seal his meridians, and used a drop of water from the Spring of Life to wash the wound first before using Golden Ointment Powder on it. When all that was done, he swiftly took out some bandages and wrapped them around the injured area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All this happened within the span of a single breath. Qing Shui didn’t dare delay for too long. The battle had yet to end but the death of the Third Palace Master caused chaos to erupt from the experts under him. The death of a supreme expert could cause the situation to change abruptly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sunset Palace Mistress took this chance and launched a sure-kill technique, breaking off the arm of one of the old men. Her opponent was distracted for a moment because of the death of the Third Palace Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">WIth immense spirit, one could conquer mountains and rivers. This location was considered their territory, while the Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace had to travel so far. It was inevitable their aura and morale would be slightly weakened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui initially thought that he still needed to act. He didn’t expect the death of the Third Palace Master would instantly cause the battle situation to change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These people were all supreme experts and should have perfected their states of heart. However, humans were all like this. People who wouldn’t flinch in the face of death were very rare, very very rare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The remaining old man suddenly executed a technique that caused his figure to grow faint. The dragon thorn in his hand transformed into an oily dark-color as he stabbed towards the Sunset Palace Mistress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Brand of Life, Soul Chasing Strike!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge’s countenance changed. At this moment, Qing Shui rapidly rushed over but because of the distance, he couldn’t be there in time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge was closer and she was prepared for something like this to happen earlier. She sent out a burst of energy that shifted the Sunset Palace Mistress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made it so that the Palace Mistress was able to evade the strike to the heart, but her stomach was pierced through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only then did Qing Shui arrive. The Golden Battle Halberd smashed down with no mercy, onto the body of that old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could fight evenly against the Third Palace Master, but it was clear that these remaining enemies were not on his level. The old man naturally collapsed under the might of that strike and died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The remaining old man only had a single arm left. Right now, both parties were already at a state where one wouldn’t give up until the others died. He didn’t beg for mercy because he knew it was useless. If he did so, this wouldn’t be a life-and-death battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui caught hold of the Palace Mistress. The wound to her stomach was very deep and he didn’t dare to be careless. He hurriedly took out his golden needles to seal the meridians and vessels around the wound to stop the flow of blood. Staring at that beautiful face of the Palace Mistress, her countenance was a pale, sickly white.</span></p>
