 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ancient Golden Shrimp General looked at Qing Shui and he could feel that this man was much stronger than he was. Upon seeing Qing Shui’s amiability, he became less tense and drawled: “This is one of the entrances to the North Ocean. I’m here holding the fort. Idle people should not casually be around here to prevent any misunderstandings.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui laughed and looked around: “We are not intending to go to the North Ocean. Can’t we just stay around here and look?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ancient Golden Shrimp General was slightly taken aback since he was strong and he could simply use his strength to scare away the average person. He didn’t even need to break a sweat. Normally he wouldn’t kill people to prevent the two clans from warring but today he unexpectedly met an extremely strong human.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright. In that case, you can stay here but I won’t be keeping you company any longer.” said the Ancient Golden Shrimp General and started to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother, wait up!” Qing Shui said in a hurry. It wasn’t easy to meet an Aquatic from an Ocean Domain so Qing Shui was not going to let him just leave like that. He still wanted to go to the North Ocean to take a look so finding an Aquatic to be his guide was imperative.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Anything else?” the Ancient Golden Shrimp General seemed to have seen through Qing Shui’s intentions. He had an obstinate look that seemed to tell Qing Shui that they didn’t know each other so they shouldn’t get overly familiar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have with me a Dragon God Blood Essence and if Brother here uses it, he will surely become an Ancient Golden Dragon Shrimp General.” Qing Shui said while taking out the Dragon God Blood Essence, which was definitely authentic, left behind previously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ancient Golden Shrimp General looked at Qing Shui cautiously as well as the gleaming porcelain bottle in Qing Shui’s hand. However, the drop of Blood Essence within the bottle emanated a great temptation and constantly attacked his willpower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t have to worry. I don’t have any ill intentions towards the North Ocean Domain. My wife is one of the Palace Mistresses of the Ocean Domain. Moreover, I don’t know what kind of strength you possess within the North Ocean so how can I have any ill intentions?” Qing Shui took the opportunity to strike while the Shrimp General was still hesitant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui really did not have any ill intentions. Thinking of Yiye Jiange and Muyun Qingge, as well as the Sunset Palace, he felt that he would surely visit the other Ocean Domains, like the North Ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do you need me to do? Go ahead and say it. If I can do it, I’ll help you. Otherwise, I don’t want your items.” the Ancient Golden Shrimp General solemnly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I just love people with morals. I don’t know where your allegiance lies but whoever put you in charge of the North Ocean’s Entrance certainly did not choose wrongly.” Qing Shui laughed and tried to flatter him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nice words were coaxing and whoever were to hear it will certainly like it. The Ancient Golden Shrimp General had no change in expression but he felt a little happy inside and continued to look at Qing Shui earnestly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I want to make friends with Brother here. Perhaps, if I were to visit the North Ocean Domain in the future, I’ll ask you about its scope of strength.” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that the North Ocean Domain was vast and entrances were many so it would be strong. Haohan’s North Ocean Domain would have a strength that’s not just in the tens of thousands so this was definitely reasonable to ask.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As expected, the Ancient Golden Shrimp General had a look of relief and earnestly replied: “I really do need your object. So, if I were to accept it right now and you were to make me do something to harm my master, I will perish.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was Qing Shui’s turn to seriously nod his head: “Am I really that scary? You can put your heart at ease. Take this and I definitely will not put you in a difficult position. As long as there’s a shred of difficulty, you can reject me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person who eat would be unable to speak* but Qing Shui did not intend to do anything to him. Simply, it was to have someone familiar in the North Ocean Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">(*T/N: A saying that means as long as one has received a favor from someone else, he would have to turn a blind eye to the other party’s faults or misdeeds)</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Qing Shui finished speaking, the Ancient Golden Shrimp General did not hesitate any further, took the Blood Essence from Qing Shui and said: “Perhaps we can really become friends.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people from such clans have a mystical feeling akin to the gut feeling of humans. However, it is very mysterious for it is said to be more accurate than the human’s instincts. He felt that Qing Shui bore no malice and that’s why he tried to become friends with Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui returned to the Hellfire Phoenix and rejoined his two women. They hurried on their way though it was not the original route. It was a circuitous path that still led them back to the Divine Moon Immortal Sect except that they would not take it if they were to return back here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was still early upon their return to the Divine Moon Immortal Sect as it was barely past noon. This was the residence of Qing Shui and his women and if there weren’t any problems, they wouldn’t be bothered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui decided to help Qin Qing and Tantai Lingyan raise their strengths since he now possessed the ability to do so. Only he possessed this ability which was akin to an initiation. Although it wouldn’t harm one’s body, the increase would solely depend on the women’s good fortune.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was now a Divine and both women were compatible with this method. If it were a small child, he would be unable to use this method. It would only serve to cause harm by overdoing it. A strong vitality is required. Otherwise, the consequence is being crippled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both women were compatible also because their strength was right at a juncture, which was why Qing Shui wanted to helped them raise their strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Raising their strength was a simple method. Both parties were to face each other and grasp each other’s hands while Qing Shui used force to imbue it in them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan went first. When the two of them held hands, a very strange feeling occurred, akin to their bloodlines uniting but not quite it meither. Qing Shui suddenly recalled his own breakthrough to Divine when the two women were holding his hands tightly while he lay unconscious. This additional reaction was probably due to his prior breakthrough to Divine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This feeling was extremely wonderful and Tantai Lingyan looked at Qing Shui in astonishment. She really enjoyed this feeling and it made her feel like she wasn’t alone anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the imbuing process, they realised it was extremely smooth-sailing. Although he couldn’t be sure, it was likely related to the strengthening of Tantai Lingyan’s meridians, dantian as well as skeletal structure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The speed of this was fast but the requirements were demanding and everyone could basically only use this method once. Unless one’s body and constitution were special, they might be able to use it two more times but even then, that was the limit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Also, this method of raising one’s strength was not especially scary. It was mainly to raise the strength during Constitution Nurturing and the extent would be large but not particularly large either. Take False Gods for example. If they were to raise their strength when they were on the cusp of the next realm, the extent would be the largest. However, if it were only a little, they would have to immediately undergo a False God Tribulation right after raising their strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In truth, Qing Shui was not concerned about the people beside him undergoing False God Tribulations since their capabilities could withstand it. Although many people died during the False God Tribulation, there were also as many who succeeded in completing it. After all, people of this stage would have one or even many treasures that can help them tide through the Tribulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan and Qin Qing both had various treasures that would assist them. Qin Qing’s Goddess Divine Set was one of the best there is while Tantai Lingyan’s treasures were largely family heirlooms. Moreover, Tantai Lingyan also had a set similar to Qin Qing and Yiye Jiange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui even suspected that the women in the Portraits of Beauty all possessed such a Divine Set, but shook his head quickly at that thought since such an occurrence was probably extremely rare.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In no time, Tantai Lingyan’s False God Tribulation was about to happen so Qing Shui immediately took both women high into the sky with his Nine Continents Steps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan was already a Grade 10 False God and after this, she would become a Peak False God. Nevertheless, the gap between Peak False Gods could be very wide. Before Qing Shui broke through to Divine, he was a Peak False God that was stronger than an early Divine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not know how much Tantai Lingyan would raise her strength by. The lightning in the sky thundered and flashed as she easily parried. The lightning and thunder became more and more violent which turned the entire surroundings into a lightning region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan held the blood-red long sword and as time passed, the lightning became increasingly concentrated before slowly coming to a halt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled as he gazed at Tantai Lingyan who was invigorated rather than exhausted. He instnatly knew that she had entered Peak False God. Her strength should be around 50 Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">50 Dao was already very strong and comparatively, Qing Shui was only at 160 Dao - which could be increased to 320 Dao before his breakthrough. However, Qing Shui possessed this amount of strength for some time while Tantai Lingyan had only just broken through. Thus, such strength was certainly due to her talent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Next, it was Qin Qing and it also went smoothly for her. However, her strength was slightly lower than Tantai Lingyan’s at 45 Dao. 1 Dao worth of strength was actually quite terrifying so the difference between both of them was not insignificant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time went by in a flash and the sky was already dark. Tens of thousands of kilometers into the sky, Haohan’s horizon was unimaginable for humans. If this was in his previous life, such a distance was estimated to be beyond gravitational pull, but here, perhaps because the Nine Continents was too vast, the gravitational pull was strong too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was bitingly cold here, which felt like scraping knives. The average person would have died a painful death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This place makes one really uncomfortable. It’s better that we head back!” Qing Shui smiled and reached to grab a hand from each of them. Next, he immediately used his Nine Continents Steps to return to the Divine Moon Immortal Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, both women have already become Peak False Gods just like Yiye Jiange but she was probably not as strong as either of them. Yehuang Guwu wasn’t as strong either since her raw strength was not at Peak False God, although she could depend on Tiger Form to achieve Peak False God. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was pleased with his increased strength as well as that of both his women. Their increase in strength this time was a significant shift which relied on their talent. Breaking through to Peak False God could be 10 or 20 Daos, just like Qing Shui breaking through to Divine and immediately reached 3200 Daos. 100 Daos was also Divine, but of course the prerequisite was to possess Divinity Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both women were extremely talented. Qing Shui only helped them at the beginning but they had already raised their strength by that much. It was mainly due to their breaking through to Peak False God,</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The change at the Divine Moon Immortal Sect was not small. Hong Clan was gone and both Supreme Guest Elders Qing Feng and Ming Yue elected to leave as they felt ashamed of remaining. Yin Tian tried his best to persuade them to stay but both of them were adamant so he had no choice but to let them leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, to err is human. If one had made a mistake, so be it. However, some mistakes cannot afford to be made. Otherwise, it would forever leave a stain that cannot be erased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Tian did not blame them because the Hong Clan got them by their weak points. Both their entire families’ lives were threatened by the Hong Clan.</span></p>
