 <p><strong>AST 1129 - Mu Qing Is Almost Here, No More Worry, Burden Tossed</strong></p>
 <p>Two hours later, Yun Duan was on the verge of collapsing. Qing Shui stood there, hugging the lady who had gone limp. Her face was flushed red, satisfied from the sex which they just had. Right now, the two of them were still tightly connected but Yun Duan was hugging Qing Shui tightly, not letting him move.</p>
 <p>"You're like a raging bull..." Yun Duan lifted her flushed beautiful face and said tiredly, her beautiful eyes misted.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui grinned and said, "Thank you for giving your husband the best praise."</p>
 <p>"Who's praising you..." Yun Duan was speechless but her body was still trembling slightly. Qing Shui's hand gradually moved around her body.</p>
 <p>Cultivators had good physiques and Yun Duan recovered very quickly. By the time they put on their clothes, the sun had already set. Yun Duan looked at this man next to her. She had never expected that she would perform such an act in the wilderness one day. Just thinking about it made her felt anxious. However, at the same time, it gave her a strange sense of excitement.</p>
 <p>"Duan`er seems to have become even more beautiful. It's no wonder they say that doing such things can let a person stay youthful and become more beautiful." Qing Shui looked at the charming lady and said, feeling satisfied.</p>
 <p>Yun Duan didn't answer and just reached out her hand to pinch him, urging him that it was time to head home.</p>
 <p>Using the Nine Continents Steps, they arrived close to the Qing Clan in an instant. By the time they arrived, it was already dark. Qing Shui carried Qing Yun who had come running and fed her a Violet Golden Bloodline Pearl.</p>
 <p>Right now, the family could basically be considered to have united. The only one who was left was Mu Qing, who was in the Eastern Victory Divine Continent. This made Qing Shui feel a little regretful. It would be too late for him to head to Eastern Victory Divine Continent now.</p>
 <p>Recalling Mu Qing caused Qing Shui to think back to the scenes when they were together.</p>
 <p>Mu Qing had a tall and slender figure. She wore a golden colored phoenix pleated dress, with two vivid looking golden phoenixes with colorful wings on the sides. Her beautiful hair was put up, showing off her slender white neck, making her appear even more beautiful.</p>
 <p>The slightly loose pleated dress was unable to hide her soft and charming figure. She didn't have exaggerated curves but her exquisite curves gave Qing Shui quite a visual impact.</p>
 <p>Just a back view alone would cause an instant kill. Moreover, Qing Shui could sense the pure Spiritual Qi in her body, or rather, her charm.</p>
 <p>Her voice was heavenly, elegant and polished. It made those who listened to her get the feeling that they were resuscitated or that they were flying. Right now, Qing Shui felt as if her voice was ringing next to her ears.</p>
 <p>The image of Mu Qing became increasingly clear. Her skin white and tender, her brows charming, her eyes full of emotions, her beautiful skin giving out a transcending feeling like that of the autumn's moonlight, her shoulders slender. Standing there, she gave off an independent charm which was graceful and otherworldly. From afar, it felt as if one was able to sense an aura like that of an orchid.</p>
 <p>Her golden colored phoenix dress gave her an additional poised and dignified aura, making her like a fairy from the heavens. Her divinely beautiful appearance fully displayed her grace and charm.</p>
 <p>"How nice would it be if Mu Qing could be here as well." Qing Shui sighed in his heart.</p>
 <p>"You must be thinking of Mu Qing, right?" Yu He smiled and walked over, then sat next to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Yu He, stunned. He had known this woman since very long ago and had been mesmerized with her since then. He hadn't expected that his actions had caused her to go through such tremendous changes. The power of love was truly amazing. It was just like how it was mentioned in [The Peony Pavilion] [1]: "Her love started unknowingly, as she dived in deeper and deeper. When she was alive, she could die for love, and when she was dying, she could live for love. People who couldn't die for love when they were alive or live for love when they were dead, cannot be considered to have known the limits to love."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui picked up one of Yu He's hand and held it tightly. Although he didn't say anything, it was as if their hearts were tightly connected. The feeling they had in that moment was an amazing one.</p>
 <p>"I already informed Mu Qing. She will probably be arriving in half a month at most." Yu He blinked her beautiful and said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned from the surprise. "Really?"</p>
 <p>"Of course. When I found out that you were going to head for the other Four Continents, I knew that this day would come. I've gotten the people from the Hundred Flowers Valley to escort her all the way here. You don't have to worry about her safety."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was so happy that he couldn't describe how he felt. If he couldn't see Mu Qing before he left, he wouldn't be able to feel completely assured. However, the limited time he had didn't allow him to head to look for her.</p>
 <p>Before he left, he wanted to see Mu Qing and gift her with a powerful demonic beast, as well as the Violet Golden Bloodline Pearl and the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring. With that, the ladies' safety would be taken care of. Qing Shui also wanted to show her to the rest of the family. After all, they were already married.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>The next morning, Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He had held beauties in his arms the night before and thus had to change the time he spent cultivating in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to the day.</p>
 <p>In the afternoon, Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan headed for Duanmu City. They wanted to head to Duanmu Lingshuang’s location. Lady Duanmu couldn't help but worry for her daughter and thus he wanted to let Yu Ruyan be completely assured.</p>
 <p>Right now, Yu Ruyan's relationship with Qing Shui was already very unique. They could be considered to have broken through the final line in their relationship. The things they had between them in the past were not considered, at least, not all of them. Yu Ruyan was slowly opening up her heart, letting go of her worries and burdens.</p>
 <p>They arrived at Duanmu Lingshuang's manor. They were considered to have left Duanmu Clan. Since Yu Ruyan was together with Qing Shui now, she naturally had to leave Duanmu Clan. It was more so for Duanmu Lingshuang since Duanmu Clan would not accept them. Right now, they could already take good care of themselves and thus leaving was a good option too.</p>
 <p>This manor wasn't very big but it was exquisite. This was the first time Qing Shui was here and he found it very unfamiliar. Duanmu Lingshuang and Hu Yanlin shouldn't just have this manor alone. Seeing that the door to the main entrance was opened, Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan walked over. There was only an old man sitting there, dozing off. When he heard the sounds of footsteps, he opened his eyes to look at Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan.</p>
 <p>"Madam, you're here!" The old man quickly and said.</p>
 <p>"Uncle Xiang, you can have a rest. I'll go take a look at Lingshuang and the others." Yu Ruyan quickly indicated for the old man to rest.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't say anything but entered with Yu Ruyan. They hadn't walked for long when they saw Duanmu Lingshuang playing with her son in the courtyard. Sounds of their laughter would ring out occasionally. No matter who it was, if one were to see this scene, they would feel relaxed and heartwarming. It was really a beautiful scene.</p>
 <p>"Mother, you've come!" When Duanmu Lingshuang saw Yu Ruyan, she happily carried her son and walked over quickly to give Yu Ruyan a hug. She seemed to have missed her a lot.</p>
 <p>She only let go of Yu Ruyan after quite a while.</p>
 <p>"Lingshuang, are you guys well? Is her still cultivating in the backyard?" Yu Ruyan asked softly with a smile.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, this is how he is. There's no need to pay him any attention. Mister Qing, welcome." Duanmu Lingshuang smiled and greeted Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>After all, they owed Qing Shui a big debt for the previous time. In fact, since then, she had no longer been against her mother being together with this young man. She liked to see her mother being happy, like she was now. It was just that it was probably hard for her to change the way she addressed Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and nodded, "Thank you, Miss Duanmu."</p>
 <p>"There's no need to stand on ceremony. You can call me Lingshuang like mother does!" Duanmu Lingshuang smiled. This was already a very huge hint, letting Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan know that she was supportive of their relationship.</p>
 <p>Duanmu Lingshuang was a very cold person by nature and it wasn't easy for her to take this step. What she had done now was something that she could only do after changing after so many, many years had passed. Qing Shui was now very happy. Knowing that Duanmu Lingshuang could accept them was something very crucial.</p>
 <p>"Alright, then I won't stand on ceremony. We're here to take a look at you guys today. Your mother and I might need to leave for a while and she's worried about you guys. Therefore, I've brought her here today to reassure here." Qing Shui smiled and took out a toy to play with the son Duanmu Lingshuang was carrying as he said this.</p>
 <p>"Oh, how are you going to let mother feel assured?" Duanmu Lingshuang was stunned. She took Yu Ruyan's hand and looked at her mother. This mother and daughter pair was very close. Since a young age, Duanmu Lingshuang had been brought up by her mother alone.</p>
 <p>"Come, let's go take a look at the backyard."</p>
 <p>When they arrived at the backyard, Hu Yanlin just happened to be taking a break. When he saw Yu Ruyan and Qing Shui, he walked over happily. "Mother, you're here. Hello, Mister Qing!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and replied. Hu Yanlin smiled and quickly said, "Lingshuang, bring Mother and Mister in to have a seat first. I'll go have a change of clothes."</p>
 <p>"There's no hurry. It's good now. There's no hurry to go and change your clothes."</p>
 <p>Duanmu Lingshuang didn't have the chance to say anything before Qing Shui smiled and said this. He then took out the Violet Golden Bloodline Pearl, handing it to them. There was a share for the kid as well.</p>
 <p>"It's beneficial to take this. Don't bring this up with anyone. Just keep this to yourself."</p>
 <p>"Thank you, mister!" Hu Yanlin took the violet colored pearl and swallowed it without any hesitation. This made Qing Shui see this honest man in a new light. He was a straightforward and honest man who would be very insistent in the things he had decided on. Qing Shui had given him quite a lot of benefits previously. Thus, Hu Yanlin was able to trust him without any hesitation. This trust wasn't an act.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could sense that after Hu Yanlin met Duanmu Lingshuang, he had gotten luckier. From a villager in the mountains he had become what he was today, it could be considered a legend...</p>
 <p>Duanmu Lingshuang knew that Qing Shui wouldn't do them any harm and thus took it and gave it to her son as well. Very quickly, both Hu Yanlin and Lingshuang could sense how powerful the Violet Golden Bloodline Pearl was. They looked at Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan in surprise.</p>
 <p>If the Violet Golden Bloodline Pearl had brought them an extreme surprise, the powerful demonic beasts which he let them tamed caused them to be filled with disbelief. They were still in a daze a long time after they had tamed the beasts successfully, feeling as if they were in a dream.</p>
 <p>"Although you now have demonic beasts to protect you, don't use it under normal circumstances. Work hard on your cultivation. It's the safest for you to rely on your own strength. The kid's physique has changed completely and he's a talent. As long as you nurture him with great care, his achievements in the future would surpass that of yours. Another thing is that I hope that when you guys are free, go visit Qing Clan in Fair Wind City. We're all family. What do you think about me bringing you guys to meet the rest of the family today?"</p>
 <p>"Thank you, Mister. As long as Mother doesn't object, we'll go. Lingshuang won't be changing the way I address you for now. I'll work hard to change it by the time we meet next time." Duanmu Lingshuang smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Address is nothing. You just need to remember that we're a family." Qing Shui took Yu Ruyan's hand and said, smiling.</p>
 <p>Duanmu Lingshuang smiled and looked at Qing Shui and then at Yu Ruyan. "Thank you, Qing Shui. I'm very happy. I feel really happy to see that my mother is happy. In the past, Mother had been the one supporting everything. However, no matter how strong a woman is, sometimes, they need someone to depend on."</p>
 <p>Hu Yanlin went to wash up and change his clothes while Duanmu Lingshuang headed for the hall with Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan's expression was very relaxed and it came from the bottom of her heart. She now appeared to be glowing. This went to show that she had been very tired in the past, at least mentally so. However, right now, she should be very relaxed!</p>
