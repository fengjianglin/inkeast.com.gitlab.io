 <p><strong>Chapter 35 Consumption of the Energy Enhancing Fruits.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><b>Ancient Strengthening Technique Chapter 35</b><b> – Consumption of the Energy Enhancing Fruits</b></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui glanced at the 10 glistening, blood-red Energy Enhancing Fruits, the thought of eating them and gaining 500 jin of strength directly was extremely appealing to him. It’s a pity that there was the limitation that a human could only consume two Energy Enhancing fruits in their lifetime, because of that, eating more would be pointless. If there was no limit to the stacking effect, he would definitely abuse this to the maximum, and gain an additional 5000 jin of strength every year.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The current Qing Shui, who already possessed a strength level of 15,000 jin, was not overly enamored by the effects granted by Energy Enhancing Fruits. It was only an increment of 500 jin was it not? Not enough to get flustered over. However, as the saying goes, even though the amount of meat a mosquito has is small, it is still meat. [1] Not to mention, he was still sorely unable to break through the bottleneck of the 3rd heavenly layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. Although the probability was miniscule, there was still the possibility that consuming the Energy Enhancing Fruits would allow him to break through.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After thinking it through, Qing Shui went in front of the sturdy and vigorous looking Energy Enhancing Tree and sized up the 10 glistening, blood-red Energy Enhancing Fruits. He allowed their savory smell to waft over him before he extended one of his hands and plucked one of the Energy Enhancing Fruit off the branch of the tree.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ai! This cannot be possible right? I cannot pluck it off?” Qing Shui estimated that earlier, when he attempted to pluck the fruit off, he had only used a few dozen jin worth of strength, but unexpectedly, he was unable to pluck the fruit off the branch! Not only that, the sturdy Energy Enhancing Tree did not even budge an inch when Qing Shui exerted his strength!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Excellent! Excellent! Qing Shui exclaimed in wonder, after which he exerted even more strength, but he still failed to pluck the fruit from the tree. This time around, Qing Shui had used a few hundred jin worth of strength!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“F*ck!” Getting impatient, Qing Shui directly used an even greater amount of strength and finally succeeded in plucking the Energy Enhancing Fruit. Thinking back, during the moment he succeeded, the strength level he exerted should have been around 500 jin worth of strength!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was absorbed in his thoughts, eating an Energy Enhancing Fruit that gave an increment of 500 jin worth of strength actually required the strength level of 500 jin to pluck the fruit off the branch. This was the first time he had come across such a bizarre thing. However, he was not that surprised by it, as there were even more bizarre things in the World of the Nine Continents. After all, wasn’t the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal even more bizarre? Shrugging it off, Qing Shui unconcernedly shook his head. Ever since the day when the Ancient Strengthening Technique appeared in his mind, his ability to comprehend bizarre stuff exceeded that of normal humans!</span></p>
  <p><span style>This fruit, could never have be plucked by an ordinary human….</span></p>
  <p><span style>The size of the Energy Enhancing Fruit was just about the size of Qing Shui’s palm, it was emanating slight waves of heat when held. If the Energy Enhancing Fruit was held more tightly, one could feel a scorching heat emanate from it. Looking at the glistening fruit, Qing Shui experimentally took a bite out of it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>En, the texture was a bit tough and a bit crispy, but an extremely savory taste spread out in his mouth, giving rise to an alluring scent! Very quickly, the entire Energy Enhancing Fruit was devoured by Qing Shui! The most surprising thing was that the Energy Enhancing Fruit actually had no seed! After it was eaten, the fruit released waves of fiery Qi that arose from his Dantian, circulated through all of his energy channels and meridians, infusing his body with boundless strength!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui activated the Ancient Strengthening Technique as his whole body slowly took on a reddish hue. When compared to his regular attempts at activating the Ancient Strengthening Technique, there was currently a lax but extremely comfortable feeling as he circulated the 48th cycle of Qi. At this moment, Qing Shui finally opened his eyes, but instead of his usual confident expression, there were hints of confusions to &nbsp;be seen in his eyes!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Although he did not manage to break through the bottleneck, Qing Shui was not confused about that. Instead, he was extremely puzzled as to why consuming the Energy Enhancing Fruit actually increased his strength by 2000 jin instead of the 500 jin mentioned! In addition, other than increasing his strength level, the Energy Enhancing Fruit also tempered the tendons and bones of the user! Not only that, there was even the slight effect of impurities cleansing! Too bad that Qing Shui had already undergone two rounds of impurities cleansing. Because of that, this particular effect of consuming the Energy Enhancing Fruit was not displayed. Still, he could not help but be awestruck… This type of fruit, in the hands of a normal human would certainly be considered a great heavenly sent opportunity!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I thought the description stated that a fruit would only increase one’s strength by 500 jin?” Qing Shui scratched his head and had no conclusions despite pondering over it for half a day. In any case, it was not disadvantageous for him, after all, a greater increase was always better than a smaller increase right?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Since there was the limit of two fruits, Qing Shui wasted no time and directly consumed the second Energy Enhancing Fruit. This time around, he did not pause to savor the taste and directly swallowed it. After eating, he could not help but curse “F***!” He only gained an increase of 500 jin of strength!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Reasons flashed through his mind as Qing Shui attempted to make sense of the situation. Could it be, that one could gain greater increase in strength from their first consumption of the fruit? Or was it because his body was special? Maybe it was because he was the current sovereign of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal…..</span></p>
  <p><span style>After ingesting both of the Energy Enhancing Fruits, Qing Shui gained an increase of about 2,500 jin of strength. This increase in strength could not be looked down upon as it was an approximate increase of 20% of his original strength level. After all, the Ancient Strengthening Technique was a heaven defying technique which focused on tempering the body of the cultivator. It’s main focus was on bodily strength and defense; overall it was a technique to strengthen one’s entire body!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Looking atop the tree branches, there were still eight more glistening blood-red Energy Enhancing Fruits. Qing Shui plucked them off and bundled them up in a cloth, preparing to gift two of the fruits to Qing Yi and two to Qing Luo when he returned to the Qing Village. Qing Shui had not yet decided how to &nbsp;distribute of the rest of the fruits. In any case, after a year, 100 years would have passed in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and he would have 10 more Energy Enhancing Fruits!</span></p>
  <p><span style>During this period of time, Qing Shui also discovered that the crystal clear water inside the pond of the spatial realm would automatically refill itself to it’s original level after every reset. Qing Shui was ecstatic on this discovery as he knew that this water was not ordinary water, it had mystical properties! After that he took a look at the purplish soil underneath his feet and pondered: “Should I plant something here? If I don’t, it would be a waste of fertile land, but what should I plant? Ahh, I know, herbs with medicinal properties!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>After this period of time, Qing Shui was already extremely knowledgeable about Herbal Medicine and Dan Medicine. That was why he wanted to plant crops of medicinal herbs inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The best thing that could happen was that he managed to plant the valuable and expensive herbs. However, currently, Qing Shui did not even have the seedlings for the cheapest and most common herbs, which was why the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal was still bare.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Holding the thick and heavy wooden sword in his hand, in an moment of impulse, he decided to carve three words onto the crude looking body of the wooden sword.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Even when rushing on the road, trying to return to the Qing Clan as fast as possible, Qing Shui would still hold the wooden sword in his hand, inadvertently practicing his Iaido Technique. There was a saying that a sword user must reach the state of where the sword never left one’s hand. Qing Shui was trying to get a feel of that stage.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I will soon reach home, the year is almost ending, not to forget about my celebration of coming-of-age. Also, after this year I will be considered an adult, able to marry beautiful wives and father many children, as well as struggle for survival in the World of the Nine Continents on my own.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Qing Clan could also be considered a Cultivator Clan, which was why people from the Qing Clan tended to marry later. For example, eldest grandson Qing Zi had not married yet. This was because, after getting married, it would be bad if they started to enjoy married life too much and indulged in the pleasure of lovemaking to the point of neglecting their cultivation.</span></p>
  <p><span style>So typically, it was those who had low talent in cultivation that could be allowed to marry a wife early and give birth to children. After they started their own family they would then help the Qing Clan handle their various businesses!</span></p>
  <p><span style>In the eyes of the Qing Clan, Qing Shui was placed in the classification of those that were allowed to start their own family. After all, in the eyes of his clan members, he was nothing but trash. There would not be much progress even if he chose to continue on the path of cultivation.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui thought about the World of the Nine Continents, especially the region where the Qing Clan was currently residing. Most families would allow their children to marry around the ages of 16-18 and would be considered an elder after they reached the age of 20!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regarding this type of early age marriage, Qing Shui was unsure of his own feelings towards it. He knew that in his previous world, marriage was only legal when the male was 22 years old and the female was 20. However, if he took into account his real age, then Qing Shui was already 30+ this year. He had hoped that he would be able find a ravishing beauty to be his permanent bed warmer too.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The moment he thought of women, his thoughts would drift to Shi Qing Zhuang, he could only helplessly sigh because Shi Qing Zhuang was the most beautiful woman he had seen who was unrelated to him, but she was already the fiancee of that arrogant jackass, Situ Bu Fan. Regarding those jade-like beauties from the nearby regions, they were either already betrothed to someone or they were underaged lolis!<br></span></p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui, for the nearby regions at least, he did not want to bed other people’s wives. He also had no interests in lolis. The only type of women that could catch his interest were those that were older than him. Shi Qing Zhuang fits this bill perfectly…..</span></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <hr>
  <p></p>
  <p><span style>[1] I’m pretty sure that the author invented this saying. lol I couldn’t find anything remotely similar to this. What he meant was that despite the increase in strength being small, there was still an increase in strength.</span></p>

 <p><span style>After ingesting both of the Energy Enhancing Fruits, Qing Shui gained an increase of about 2,500 jin of strength. This increase in strength could not be looked down upon as it was an approximate increase of 20% of his original strength level. After all, the Ancient Strengthening Technique was a heaven defying technique which focused on tempering the body of the cultivator. It’s main focus was on bodily strength and defense; overall it was a technique to strengthen one’s entire body!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking atop the tree branches, there were still eight more glistening blood-red Energy Enhancing Fruits. Qing Shui plucked them off and bundled them up in a cloth, preparing to gift two of the fruits to Qing Yi and two to Qing Luo when he returned to the Qing Village. Qing Shui had not yet decided how to &nbsp;distribute of the rest of the fruits. In any case, after a year, 100 years would have passed in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and he would have 10 more Energy Enhancing Fruits!</span></p>
 <p><span style>During this period of time, Qing Shui also discovered that the crystal clear water inside the pond of the spatial realm would automatically refill itself to it’s original level after every reset. Qing Shui was ecstatic on this discovery as he knew that this water was not ordinary water, it had mystical properties! After that he took a look at the purplish soil underneath his feet and pondered: “Should I plant something here? If I don’t, it would be a waste of fertile land, but what should I plant? Ahh, I know, herbs with medicinal properties!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After this period of time, Qing Shui was already extremely knowledgeable about Herbal Medicine and Dan Medicine. That was why he wanted to plant crops of medicinal herbs inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The best thing that could happen was that he managed to plant the valuable and expensive herbs. However, currently, Qing Shui did not even have the seedlings for the cheapest and most common herbs, which was why the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal was still bare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Holding the thick and heavy wooden sword in his hand, in an moment of impulse, he decided to carve three words onto the crude looking body of the wooden sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even when rushing on the road, trying to return to the Qing Clan as fast as possible, Qing Shui would still hold the wooden sword in his hand, inadvertently practicing his Iaido Technique. There was a saying that a sword user must reach the state of where the sword never left one’s hand. Qing Shui was trying to get a feel of that stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will soon reach home, the year is almost ending, not to forget about my celebration of coming-of-age. Also, after this year I will be considered an adult, able to marry beautiful wives and father many children, as well as struggle for survival in the World of the Nine Continents on my own.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Qing Clan could also be considered a Cultivator Clan, which was why people from the Qing Clan tended to marry later. For example, eldest grandson Qing Zi had not married yet. This was because, after getting married, it would be bad if they started to enjoy married life too much and indulged in the pleasure of lovemaking to the point of neglecting their cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So typically, it was those who had low talent in cultivation that could be allowed to marry a wife early and give birth to children. After they started their own family they would then help the Qing Clan handle their various businesses!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the eyes of the Qing Clan, Qing Shui was placed in the classification of those that were allowed to start their own family. After all, in the eyes of his clan members, he was nothing but trash. There would not be much progress even if he chose to continue on the path of cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui thought about the World of the Nine Continents, especially the region where the Qing Clan was currently residing. Most families would allow their children to marry around the ages of 16-18 and would be considered an elder after they reached the age of 20!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regarding this type of early age marriage, Qing Shui was unsure of his own feelings towards it. He knew that in his previous world, marriage was only legal when the male was 22 years old and the female was 20. However, if he took into account his real age, then Qing Shui was already 30+ this year. He had hoped that he would be able find a ravishing beauty to be his permanent bed warmer too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he thought of women, his thoughts would drift to Shi Qing Zhuang, he could only helplessly sigh because Shi Qing Zhuang was the most beautiful woman he had seen who was unrelated to him, but she was already the fiancee of that arrogant jackass, Situ Bu Fan. Regarding those jade-like beauties from the nearby regions, they were either already betrothed to someone or they were underaged lolis!<br></span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui, for the nearby regions at least, he did not want to bed other people’s wives. He also had no interests in lolis. The only type of women that could catch his interest were those that were older than him. Shi Qing Zhuang fits this bill perfectly…..</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[1] I’m pretty sure that the author invented this saying. lol I couldn’t find anything remotely similar to this. What he meant was that despite the increase in strength being small, there was still an increase in strength.</span></p>
