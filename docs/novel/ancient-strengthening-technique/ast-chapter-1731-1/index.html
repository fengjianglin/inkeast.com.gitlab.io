 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Qing Shui thought about all of these and realizing how formidable beast tamers were, he also understood how tough it was to be a Beast Tamer. He felt a lot more relieved as a result. Although he was an alchemist, Qing Shui believed he was also considered a Beast Tamer. Despite all his advantages, his demonic beasts only possessed a decent amount of strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beast Tamers had a very fatal restriction: It was very difficult for them to surpass their own demonic beasts in terms of power. Furthermore, after reaching a certain point, Beast Tamers would also have great difficulties if they wanted to progress. After all, they had spent most of their time focusing on improving their beasts’ strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was already satisfied with what he had. It didn’t matter whether he was a Beast Tamer or not. Deep down, he knew that with the demonic beasts which he currently had, many formidable Beast Tamers would be envious of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The letter from the Xuan Clan hadn’t really affected Qing Shui’s life. He simply continued on with his life. The Hell Nightmare Beast underwent a change after it took the Constitution Nurturing Pill. As a result, Qing Shui felt that he had already gained huge benefits from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment, in the Northern Ocean Domain, Qing Shui was near the ocean. Without much thought, he could already figure out where the deepest part of the ocean was. However, for the time being, Qing Shui didn’t have any intentions to travel deeper into the ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui might indeed possess a very solid strength, but it was until after he took the Constitution Nurturing Pill when he realized that martial arts had no limit. Before this, he used to always harbor the thought that he was already very strong and this was as far as he could go. As he was recalling this, he found it a bit funny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui understood many things from this experience. Though he didn’t express it directly, in spite of appearance, he was quite satisfied with it. It was a form of self-satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Humans feared self-satisfaction because once they were indulging in this state, they would find it very difficult to continue advancing, not even taking into consideration other people’s advice. Once their body became saturated, it would be tough for them to continue improving as their strength would stop growing. As the saying went, ‘even the Holy Saints could still learn new things from ordinary people’. This would come to be known as a state of mind. Usually, when a person became strong, they would start to have the thought that those who were inferior to them would always be wrong, therefore developing a low state of mind. This was a form of arrogance as well as self-satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt very lucky that he managed to prevent this from happening. When people cultivated, they also cultivated their mind at the same time. It was a facet of their innermost being. It was necessary to cultivate their mind in order to be more powerful. The bigger a person’s heart was, the larger the world they viewed would be. Without a powerful heart, they would find it difficult in withstanding many things. This would, in turn, limits their views of the world. It was the same as when a person from his previous incarnation mentioned that they wanted to explore and have a look at the outside world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a flash, two months had gone by. On this day, Qing Shui brought Qing Xiu back home. The little brat was already half a year old and he looked very handsome. Even Qing Shui couldn’t help but feel emotional from it. He had inherited too much of Yiye Jiange’s genes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The little brat was hugging Qing Shui’s neck. Its hands were constantly moving, interacting with different parts of Qing Shui’s body. From time to time, it would also let out a baby’s laughing noises, calming down the heart of those who heard it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t the first time Qing Shui had played with his children. He had also played with Qing Zun, Qing Yin, Qing Ming, Qing Yan, and Qing Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nevertheless, it had been a long time since Qing Shui had last done it. He seemed to particularly reminisce from this experience. It was just like how parents tend to favor their youngest child. The reason was when they tried to recall memories with their elder children, they would be quite vague, particularly after they had younger children. Seeing their children smiling, the parents would suddenly come to realize that they had no knowledge of when their babies had actually learned to smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was precisely how it was for Qing Shui. Among his children, some of them didn’t have their father by their side at the moment when they were born. Not only that, he was also often not at home. Though he might occasionally go back to visit them, he still felt guilty because of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that he was carrying Qing Xiu, it was only during these times that he finally felt that he had fulfilled his responsibility as a father. Since ancient times, we were all made aware that no one was perfect. Everyone would have things they felt guilty for but it was precisely due to these that they would realize how good perfection was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as they went in, the Sunset Palace Mistress happened to come out. She smiled as she approached Qing Shui and took Qing Xiu. Children who were six months old would already be able to recognize other people. However, meeting with the girls quite often had stopped them from getting unfamiliar with each other. Qing Xiu could also hug each of them whenever they met.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The duration which Qing Shui spent there with the girls was quite long. Since the time Qing Xiu was born, he had stayed there for almost six months without leaving. They looked really like a family when they were together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shui Yunfeng is here. He is waiting for you in the living room.” The Sunset Palace Mistress said while playing with Qing Xiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright. Let me go and have a look.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui rubbed Qing Xiu’s head before heading to the living room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As two months had passed, it was about time he helped Shui Yunfeng with his treatment. Shui Yunfeng came here relatively often throughout these two months. He visited about five to six times throughout the two months, once every ten days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder brother, you came!” Upon walking in, Qing Shui saw Yiye jiange and Shui Yunfeng while Muyun Qingge seemed to be saying something. Since everyone was already friends, they felt obliged to bring each other gifts as a symbol of their friendship. It didn’t matter whether the two meant it when they addressed each other as brothers, it was fine even if they were just saying it casually. Nevertheless, since it was already mentioned, they made sure they followed the appropriate etiquette to suit the title.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, where is Qing Xiu? Why didn’t you bring him here?” Shui Yunfeng smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two girls took their leave after greeting Shui Yunfeng and Qing Shui. After watching the two girls go, he smiled and said to Shui Yunfeng, “How is it? Have you been feeling unwell?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No. It’s just that I have been feeling that time has been passing very slowly.” Shui Yunfeng revealed a bitter smile while saying it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder brother, it’s good to be satisfied with what you already have. You were even ready for the worst outcome. With a panicked heart, you would never be able to taste the warm tofu. I can guarantee you that I will be able to cure your wounds. You needn’t worry about it.” Qing Shui understood how Shui Yunfeng felt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am well aware of this. Oh right. Qing Shui, I have just recently received some news. Are you interested in hearing it?” Shui Yunfeng’s eyes were gleaming when he looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui gave a confused look at Shui Yunfeng. There weren’t many news that could actually make the eyes of someone of his level to brighten. Seeing that, Qing Shui also followed along and started getting curious about what exactly it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sure thing.” Qing Shui smiled and looked at Shui Yunfeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Northern Ocean Dragon Mercy Path found a place with treasures in it. The only problem is that it’s guarded by a formidable Guardian Beast. Ever since the news about that place full of treasures got out, a lot of forces have been attempting to make their way there. Brother, are you interested?” Shui Yunfeng looked at Qing Shui after explaining slowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Throughout the explanation, Qing Shui’s mind was very calm. Under the circumstances where he didn’t know what treasures there were, it was very hard for Qing Shui’s heart to be agitated. He already had a lot of treasures. So much, that he had become a bit reluctant to get involved in this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Northern Ocean Dragon Mercy Path!” Qing Shui called the name of the group before looking at Shui Yunfeng in shock, “Is it the Dragon Generous Dao that links to the Northern Ocean Divine Temple?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Yunfeng nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, Qing Shui started being hesitant about whether he should go or not. The Northern Ocean Divine Temple no longer existed. A long time ago, it was a formidable force and even now, he was still aware of the existence of the Northern Ocean Divine Temple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, the Northern Ocean Divine Temple had quite a lot of branch temples. The problem was no one was clear on whether these temples were still owned by the descendants of the Northern Ocean Divine Temple or not. It was very likely that the treasures found by Northern Ocean Dragon Mercy Path were once things owned by the Northern Ocean Divine Temple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was in human nature to be greedy. Be it because of rumors or if a person was driven by benefits, a considerable amount of forces had already made their plans to pay the Northern Ocean Dragon Mercy Path a visit. If they were lucky, they would obtain a treasure from the divine temple and skyrocket in their positions. They could then find themselves some beautiful women to marry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Qing Shui was a bit confused.</span></p>
