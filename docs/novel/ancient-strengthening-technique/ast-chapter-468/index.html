  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 468 Jin’s Clan’s reaction, Eve of the battle</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">When the Beautiful women saw Feng Zhixing’s unhappy face, in addition, the with the fact that he mentioned the Feng Clan Old Ancestor, she did not dare to speak anymore.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Don’t cry anymore, the Old Ancestor will overup all shortcomings, that guys will be hacked into thousands of pieces. After all these years, no one dared to challenge the Feng Clan, or provoke the Old Ancestor.” Feng Zhixing comforted the timid women.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That Qing Shui conceitedly said that he will flatten the Feng Clan, tomorrow will be the third day already, would he come? Would he run away?’ The beautiful women quietly asked, the fear that Qing Shui will flee apparent in his voice.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Whether he dares to come or not, i cannot be sure, but there is no possibility of him escaping. Our Feng Clan had been keeping an eye on him, would we give him an opportunity to flee?” Feng Zhixing said confidently.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui came out of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, today was already the third day, he should be heading over to the Feng Clan tomorrow. Qing Shui realised that he was calm, without a thread of nervousness, even though he was aware of the presence of an expert with the strength of 4 countries.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Thinking that the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was still bare, his Ancient Art of Forging count refine as things such as a collar, beast bell and beast armour!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui decided to attempt the refine it tonight, as well as temper the armour he is wearing, after all he had not tempered anything for awhile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;After Qing Shui thought about it, he went to sleep!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Soon, the sky turned bright, Qing Shui got out of bed, not feeling tired. As always, he came to the square, but this time there were plenty of people there already.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As sure as the sun would rise from the east, Qing Shui would choose this time for his morning practice. Even if he got up earlier, he would make full use of this period of the rising sun.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes?” Qing Shui raised his head and saw 2 persons.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Jin Changzheng and Jin Guyao!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They seem to always be dressed in gold thread armour.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Young brother, elder sister is here to see you.” Jin Guyao said with a smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel that his forehead seemed to have black lines!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Many people around looked over in wonder. They seem to recognise Jin Changzheng and even the 2 sisters from the Jin Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Golden Throne Palace may not be the strongest of the Heavenly Palace's nine halls, but they were at least ranked in the top few. The Jin clan also have many Supreme elders and elders, as well as a expert.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But now, Jin Changzheng as the Jin Clan’s young lord and his sisters are affectionately addressing a men as younger brother…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“So, Qing Shui had ties with the Jin Clan, no wonder he is not afraid!” a bearded man sighed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Starmoon Hall is not weaker than the Golden Throne Palace, only that there was no suitable successor in the younger generation. The Feng Clan is not weaker than the Jin Clan, in fact they were stronger. The Jin Clan would not stake everything and fight the Feng Clan for Qing Shui.” A refined looking middle-aged man standing beside the bearded man said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;“Isn’t Qing Shui the successor from Starmoon Hall?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That is why currently the Starmoon Hall is comparable to Lingxiao Treasure Hall, you must know that the Custodians of the Heavenly Palace does not belong to any of the Heavenly Palace's nine halls, they exist only for the Heavenly Palace.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Its a pity that the Feng Clan will never allow Qing Shui to live, that is the difference between a sect and clan. If Qing Shui was from a clan, his treatment will be very good.” Sighed the bearded man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Niu, do you think that the Jin Clan would help Qing Shui against the Feng Clan.” The refined looking middle-aged man laughed and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No, because this is the internal affairs of the Starmoon Hall. If the Jin Clan interferes, it could lead to a conflict between the Golden Throne Palace and Starmoon Hall, the Elder Association will not let that happen.” the bearded man laughed, his straightforward mannerism made people feel comfortable.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Niu’s thoughts are the same as mine. Look like Qing Shui can only deal with this alone. What a pity, that we will lose a genius like him.” The refined looking man said, shaking his head.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui might not necessarily be in trouble!’ The one called Brother Niu turned towards the refined looking man and laughed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Based on what?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Instinct!”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Refined looking Middle-aged man: “......”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why are you guys here?.” Qing Shui forced himself to say with a smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Look at you, little brother don't seem to be too happy to see us.” Jin Guyao glared at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, we should be supporting you in this matter between the Feng Clan and you, we are very willing to do so……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Jin, I don’t need any help with this, I can deal with it myself!” &nbsp;Qing Shui interrupted Jin Changzheng.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Jin Changzheng sighed, feeling sad!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Jin Guyao looked at Qing Shui saying: “Because of this matter, we even argued with our grandfather. If the Jin Clan makes a moves, it will create a conflict between Golden Throne Palace and Starmoon Hall. Heavenly Palace will never allow this kind of large scale conflict to happen.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the now concern, earlier happy, Jin Guyao while she explained the thought of the Jin Clan as well as the analysis of the situation.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, I do not now what do you think of us, but, many times, you can’t accomplish things just because you want to, even if you did your best, the results will not change.” Jin Guyao said helplessly watching Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui never expected that she would say these, because Qing Shui could identify closely with what she said, for he had been through a few of such situations.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Looking curiously at this beautiful girl with bright eyes and pretty teeth, what people would consider as the standard of beauty, She and her sister were prim and proper beauties, unlike those icy beauties, sexy beauties or charming beauties, because not everyone could accept those, but can still drive people crazy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What is this, you are speaking as though I am going to die, do you not believe that I can flatten the Feng Clan.” Qing Shui gently smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It does not matter the stand of the Jin Clan, but currently Qing Shui can feel the sincerity of Jin Changzheng and Jin Guyao, in fact, under such situation, most people would choose to stay silent.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Because under normal situations, Qing Shui, going to the Feng Clan, had no chance of survival. In other words, Qing Shui will die because of the Feng Clan’s pride.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Little Brother, we are serious, big sister will accompany you when the time comes, I will just watch by the side, is that alright?” Jin Guyao anxiously shouted at Qing Shui, causing him to ge numb.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You want to watch me die?” Qing Shui helplessly gave a bitter smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No no, you won’t die.” Jin Guyao hurriedly shook his head.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This can’t do then, if I am not dying then why are you worried?” Qing Shui felt weird after saying this, because Qing Shui found it dubious.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Fortunately, Jin Guyao did not feel anything, but only shook her head:” Qing Shui, what are you going to do, you are not a match for the Feng Clan, how are you going to manage……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could hear that Jin Guyao voice had a tone of weeping! Oh boy, Qing Shui had to go console her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“There there, I already said you don't have to worry, there are experts helping me, just relax, I won’t die!” Qing Shui seriously said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Really?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Of course, do I need to treat my life as a joke? I have not lived long enough yet, I still may pretty wifes waiting for me at home.” Qing Shui joked but sounding calm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hrm, this is good, you cause me and my brother to worry for you.”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Jin Guyao lowered her head slightly, but the was a trace of disappointment in her beautiful eyes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Soon, Starmoon Hall! Even the whole of the Heavenly Palace knew that Qing Shui was going to trample over the Feng Clan the next day. Many people knew this news and even spread how tyrannical he acted and then killed the Feng Clan members.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The public was mislead with rumors!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But rumors will collapse on its own!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not feel anything after knowing about it. Without thinking about it, he knew that this was the doings of the Feng Clan. It was to let everyone know that the Feng Clan was benevolent and are the victims, however, Qing Shui still insisted on trampling over their Feng Clan, no matter how magnanimous the Feng Clan was, they could not tolerate such a person living.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, there were many witnesses, the true story had already been spread around. Now the Feng Clan is spreading this rumor, Qing Shui said that the Feng Clan was done for, thus the Feng Clan was nitpicking on this, claiming that killing him is righteous.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Too bad that the reputation of the Feng Clan was not good, plus there were many witnesses, thus not many believed in the rumors spreaded by them, except for one point, that Qing Shui wanted to beat down the Feng Clan, even kill them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was actually the Feng Clan’s motive, it does not matter rumors or not, the Feng Clan did not care. They did not care about what others thought about the Feng Clan, they only believed in strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As for why they waited for Qing Shui to personally show up at the Feng Clan before taking action, it was because after some consideration, they figured that Qing Shui was a genius, a smart person, if he dared to say such words, he probably had a backer. Thus, they wanted to know who it was, within the Heavenly Palace, the Feng Clan only feared one person.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Waiting for 3 days, the Feng Clan actually held a great advantage!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They could attack or defend as they choosed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Currently, Qing Shui was actually very carefree, the others were worried, especially the 3 girls that were by his side, sometimes staring blankly at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright, stop looking at me like that, you still can see me in future.” Qing Shui said, but his heart feeling warm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Collar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal at night making a collar for the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. What he used was a piece of metal from the Yan Clan Treasury, Qing Shui did not know what metal it was, but could feel that there was some spiritual fluctuations from it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Silvery White!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Very similar to coldsteel, but he felt it was not coldsteel, Qing Shui did not care about what material it is since he could tell the quality of it by the strength of the Spiritual Qi it gave off.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui refined it, it was incomparably skillful, afterall it was not his first time, furthermore, his Thousand Hammer Technique had improved a lot compared to before.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When that gleam of 3 colors came out, Qing Shui happily squinted, the time that Qing Shui spent refining the collar was very little, too be specific, he only did it 3 times.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui coulg not resist looking that the light, restoring the plain collar, using the Heavenly Vision Technique, he saw the attributes of the collar.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Niu, do you think that the Jin Clan would help Qing Shui against the Feng Clan.” The refined looking middle-aged man laughed and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No, because this is the internal affairs of the Starmoon Hall. If the Jin Clan interferes, it could lead to a conflict between the Golden Throne Palace and Starmoon Hall, the Elder Association will not let that happen.” the bearded man laughed, his straightforward mannerism made people feel comfortable.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Niu’s thoughts are the same as mine. Look like Qing Shui can only deal with this alone. What a pity, that we will lose a genius like him.” The refined looking man said, shaking his head.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui might not necessarily be in trouble!’ The one called Brother Niu turned towards the refined looking man and laughed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Based on what?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Instinct!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Refined looking Middle-aged man: “......”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why are you guys here?.” Qing Shui forced himself to say with a smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Look at you, little brother don't seem to be too happy to see us.” Jin Guyao glared at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, we should be supporting you in this matter between the Feng Clan and you, we are very willing to do so……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Jin, I don’t need any help with this, I can deal with it myself!” &nbsp;Qing Shui interrupted Jin Changzheng.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Jin Changzheng sighed, feeling sad!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Jin Guyao looked at Qing Shui saying: “Because of this matter, we even argued with our grandfather. If the Jin Clan makes a moves, it will create a conflict between Golden Throne Palace and Starmoon Hall. Heavenly Palace will never allow this kind of large scale conflict to happen.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the now concern, earlier happy, Jin Guyao while she explained the thought of the Jin Clan as well as the analysis of the situation.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, I do not now what do you think of us, but, many times, you can’t accomplish things just because you want to, even if you did your best, the results will not change.” Jin Guyao said helplessly watching Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui never expected that she would say these, because Qing Shui could identify closely with what she said, for he had been through a few of such situations.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Looking curiously at this beautiful girl with bright eyes and pretty teeth, what people would consider as the standard of beauty, She and her sister were prim and proper beauties, unlike those icy beauties, sexy beauties or charming beauties, because not everyone could accept those, but can still drive people crazy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What is this, you are speaking as though I am going to die, do you not believe that I can flatten the Feng Clan.” Qing Shui gently smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It does not matter the stand of the Jin Clan, but currently Qing Shui can feel the sincerity of Jin Changzheng and Jin Guyao, in fact, under such situation, most people would choose to stay silent.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Because under normal situations, Qing Shui, going to the Feng Clan, had no chance of survival. In other words, Qing Shui will die because of the Feng Clan’s pride.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Little Brother, we are serious, big sister will accompany you when the time comes, I will just watch by the side, is that alright?” Jin Guyao anxiously shouted at Qing Shui, causing him to ge numb.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You want to watch me die?” Qing Shui helplessly gave a bitter smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No no, you won’t die.” Jin Guyao hurriedly shook his head.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This can’t do then, if I am not dying then why are you worried?” Qing Shui felt weird after saying this, because Qing Shui found it dubious.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Fortunately, Jin Guyao did not feel anything, but only shook her head:” Qing Shui, what are you going to do, you are not a match for the Feng Clan, how are you going to manage……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could hear that Jin Guyao voice had a tone of weeping! Oh boy, Qing Shui had to go console her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“There there, I already said you don't have to worry, there are experts helping me, just relax, I won’t die!” Qing Shui seriously said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Really?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Of course, do I need to treat my life as a joke? I have not lived long enough yet, I still may pretty wifes waiting for me at home.” Qing Shui joked but sounding calm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hrm, this is good, you cause me and my brother to worry for you.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Jin Guyao lowered her head slightly, but the was a trace of disappointment in her beautiful eyes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Soon, Starmoon Hall! Even the whole of the Heavenly Palace knew that Qing Shui was going to trample over the Feng Clan the next day. Many people knew this news and even spread how tyrannical he acted and then killed the Feng Clan members.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The public was mislead with rumors!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But rumors will collapse on its own!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not feel anything after knowing about it. Without thinking about it, he knew that this was the doings of the Feng Clan. It was to let everyone know that the Feng Clan was benevolent and are the victims, however, Qing Shui still insisted on trampling over their Feng Clan, no matter how magnanimous the Feng Clan was, they could not tolerate such a person living.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, there were many witnesses, the true story had already been spread around. Now the Feng Clan is spreading this rumor, Qing Shui said that the Feng Clan was done for, thus the Feng Clan was nitpicking on this, claiming that killing him is righteous.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Too bad that the reputation of the Feng Clan was not good, plus there were many witnesses, thus not many believed in the rumors spreaded by them, except for one point, that Qing Shui wanted to beat down the Feng Clan, even kill them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was actually the Feng Clan’s motive, it does not matter rumors or not, the Feng Clan did not care. They did not care about what others thought about the Feng Clan, they only believed in strength.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As for why they waited for Qing Shui to personally show up at the Feng Clan before taking action, it was because after some consideration, they figured that Qing Shui was a genius, a smart person, if he dared to say such words, he probably had a backer. Thus, they wanted to know who it was, within the Heavenly Palace, the Feng Clan only feared one person.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Waiting for 3 days, the Feng Clan actually held a great advantage!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They could attack or defend as they choosed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Currently, Qing Shui was actually very carefree, the others were worried, especially the 3 girls that were by his side, sometimes staring blankly at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright, stop looking at me like that, you still can see me in future.” Qing Shui said, but his heart feeling warm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Collar!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal at night making a collar for the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. What he used was a piece of metal from the Yan Clan Treasury, Qing Shui did not know what metal it was, but could feel that there was some spiritual fluctuations from it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Silvery White!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Very similar to coldsteel, but he felt it was not coldsteel, Qing Shui did not care about what material it is since he could tell the quality of it by the strength of the Spiritual Qi it gave off.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui refined it, it was incomparably skillful, afterall it was not his first time, furthermore, his Thousand Hammer Technique had improved a lot compared to before.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When that gleam of 3 colors came out, Qing Shui happily squinted, the time that Qing Shui spent refining the collar was very little, too be specific, he only did it 3 times.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui coulg not resist looking that the light, restoring the plain collar, using the Heavenly Vision Technique, he saw the attributes of the collar.</p>
