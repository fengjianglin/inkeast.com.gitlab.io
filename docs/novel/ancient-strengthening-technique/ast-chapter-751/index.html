 <p><strong>AST 751 - Wolf Fang City, The Divine Wolf Hall , Yet Another Shrine?</strong></p>
 <p>Pu pu!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s sleeve consecutively fluttered a few times. A few people instantly died on the spot. The Fire Bird then spread its wings and flew towards the south and disappeared into the distance almost instantaneously.</p>
 <p>Ye Yan had been gripping tightly on Qing Shui’s sleeve all this time. Her little face was flushed from excitement, because she knew that she had finally found the right person. She had looked for so many people over the past two years, but none of them were willing to help her. She also didn’t want to bring trouble to the others. She couldn’t escape and had been trapped in Tianyuan City for two years just like this. It had been almost three years since she left her sister’s side.</p>
 <p>Three years. It was hard to imagine what kind of life she had been through, as well as her anguish and yearning.</p>
 <p>But now, she knew she had found someone who could help her. She was so excited that she didn’t know what to do. All she knew was that she had to grab Qing Shui tightly.</p>
 <p>Fire Bird’s speed was very fast, but the few of them were shielded by a middle prominent bone of Fire Bird. In addition, they weren’t able to feel the wind’s intensity from their spot due to the way the Fire Bird flew. However, the howling of the wind was still quite terrifying. Fortunately, Qing Shui was there to shield Ye Yan, so it wasn’t a problem.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had gotten quite skillful in killing cultivators of Martial Saint level by now, he could now do it without much effort. Besides, this was only a cultivator of Martial Saint beginner level.</p>
 <p>No one chased them from behind. Fire Bird’s speed was quite decent and Qing Shui had nothing to fear either. This was the northernmost part of the South Viewing Continent. They were heading towards the southernmost part of the South Viewing Continent.</p>
 <p>Based on the terrain and some rumors, the South Viewing Continent was stronger towards the southern side. The truly powerful clans were situated around the Southern Sea area. It was much like the Greencloud Continent, which was weaker towards the west. The Hundred Miles City was situated at the westernmost part of the Greencloud Continent and was also one of the weakest cities on the continent.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn’t the least bit worried. This Cai Clan of the Tianyuan City shouldn’t be too much of a problem. He felt that they were men of very bad character so he killed them without sparing a second thought.</p>
 <p>“Grandpa Cang, Uncle…thank you.” Ye Yan expressed her sincere gratitude to the few of them. Tears streamed down her cheeks again within an instant. She wasn’t as emotional as this before.</p>
 <p>“Why are you crying again?” Qing Shui quickly comforted her.</p>
 <p>“Aside from big sister, you’re all people who treat me best,” Ye Yan wailed with her red eyes.</p>
 <p>The Wolf Fang City!</p>
 <p>When they passed by Wolf Fang City three days later, Ye Yan let Qing Shui know about their location. Stopping by wasn’t in Qing Shui’s plans at first, but he decided to stay for a meal and let the others clean up and get changed after hearing that they were at Wolf Fang City,.</p>
 <p>The Wolf Fang Country was famous due to a Wolf Fang Divine Artifact. Legend has it that this place wasn’t initially known as the Wolf Fang Country a long time ago. A Divine Beast, the Nine-Headed Moon Wolf appeared here. After it died, a legendary craftsman obtained a fang from its main head. He then spent a hundred years to forge a Wolf Fang Dagger out of it. However, no one currently knew where this Wolf Fang Dagger was. Instead, the Wolf Fang Country was passed down as a name.</p>
 <p>A Divine Artifact. Qing Shui couldn’t help but to yearn for it too. Divine Artifacts and Supreme Treasures were objects that cultivators in the World of the Nine Continents yearned for the most, since they had no restrictions. Even a False-Divine Artifact had usage restrictions. The Thunder God that Qing Shui obtained required the strength of a few thousand countries to use.</p>
 <p>However, Divine Artifacts and Supreme Treasures had none of those restrictions. They could also offer an extremely powerful protection effect. This meant that while one was in the state of absolute defense, all damage would be negated. Of course, there was a limit to this negation. However, the Divine Artifacts would be able to at least render the strength of peak Martial Saint and below ineffective. It could also launch powerful attacks. With a Supreme Treasure and a Divine Artifact in possession, even an ordinary person could obliterate a cultivator of peak Martial Saint level and below. This was provided if he was under that state. After the state vanished, he would revert back to an ordinary person.</p>
 <p>The Wolf Fang Dagger was definitely a powerful existence. It was a shame that no one knew whose hands it had fallen into, since it was an ancient tale. Divine Artifacts and Supreme Treasures were simply too scarce. It was very rare to hear anyone possessing a Supreme Treasure within a continent.</p>
 <p>That woman from the Tantai Aristocrat Clan seemed to be in possession of one. Qing Shui couldn’t help but to think that the woman was indeed fortunate. This had immensely strengthened the Tantai Aristocrat Clan once again.</p>
 <p>Wolf Fang City appeared to be a little more lavish compared to Tianyuan City, it was a more boring and frivolous place. They were able to sense the Bell Spirit and grace of the Southern Viewing Continent here. Everything here also seemed to be slightly spiritual in nature.</p>
 <p>“Yan’er, are there any fun or famous places in this Wolf Fang City?” Qing Shui asked. He was searching for an inn to have their meal.</p>
 <p>“I’m not too familiar around here. But the Wolf Fang Mountain comes into mind whenever Wolf Fang City is mentioned. Legend has it that the carcass of the Nine-Headed Moon Wolf was buried there.” Ye Yan answered with a smile after thinking for a moment. She seemed to be so much more cheerful now than before.</p>
 <p>“Oh, the Wolf Fang Mountain?” Qing Shui laughed. This name was too familiar to him, what a coincidence. Then again, this had nothing to do with the Wolf Fang Mountain in his previous world.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Do you want to visit there, Uncle? Look, it’s the tallest one,” Ye Yan pointed through the open windows of the restaurant and towards the hazy mountain silhouette in the distance.</p>
 <p>“Let’s eat first. We can wait until tomorrow to explore with everyone.” Qing Shui didn’t think that it was a bad idea to have a look around that place. If he was lucky enough, he might even find a Wolf Fang to be used as a forging material.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, are you trying your luck in finding the Wolf Fang?” Ye Yan laughed.</p>
 <p>“Cough cough, of course not. Eat your food, little girl,” Qing Shui was a little embarrassed to be seen through like this. This idea was after all, a little too naive. Even Qing Shui himself thought that it was impractical. Even if there were any Wolf Fang, it would never be his turn to discover it.</p>
 <p>As soon as he entered the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal that night, The Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable immediately leapt onto his shoulder and squeaked. It seemed to be in an exceptionally good mood.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was speechless. The Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable had eaten quite a number of the poisonous things in the realm. It has even eaten the ones that he had repeatedly warned it not to eat in order to avoid the calamity that would befall on the things in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Those things might just be valuable items to his future cultivation or forging!</p>
 <p>The Soulshake Bell hadn’t levelled up for a very long time. It seemed to have hit a brick wall this time. Even so, Qing Shui continued to refine it everyday. When this thing got more powerful, he will be able to dispatch his opponents’ demonic beasts within an instant if he was lucky.</p>
 <p>The Demon Binding Ropes seemed to have increased by one realm again. This made Qing Shui extremely happy. It was too bad that it would level up slower towards the end. Qing Shui could afford to wait though, he was content as long as there was hope rather than being left in a limbo.</p>
 <p>….</p>
 <p>The next day, after their morning practice and breakfast, the group immediately got onto the Fire Bird and head out for the Wolf Fang Mountain.</p>
 <p>“Yan’er, have you been to the Wolf Fang Mountain?” Qing Shui stood on the back of Fire Bird and questioned Ye Yan, who was standing on one side.</p>
 <p>“Nope.” Ye Yan shook her head.</p>
 <p>Fire Bird’s speed was incredibly fast. The Wolf Fang Mountain was already in their sights. The mountain was covered by lush vegetation, overrun with weeds and vines. The endless stretch of green pine trees and green bamboos made for a very beautiful scenery.</p>
 <p>The Wolf Fang Mountain was very tall. It could be considered the highest mountain range around this area. The Fire Bird landed slowly on the summit of the Wolf Fang Mountain. This place was very famous, but Qing Shui honestly failed to see anything special about it.</p>
 <p>He could make out the silhouettes of people who were ascending the mountain in the distance along the very long stone steps, which went all the way up to the summit. This place had became a tourist spot, but the spot that Qing Shui landed at was much more secluded.</p>
 <p>The Divine Wolf Shrine!</p>
 <p>An enormous Divine Wolf Shrine sat on the summit. It was also the only building on the entire Wolf Fang Mountain. This place was visited by a lot of people daily, but most of the visitors were armed with weapons and cultivation. It was impossible for ordinary people without cultivation to ascend this Wolf Fang Mountain.</p>
 <p>“Since we’re here, let's go have a look at the Divine Wolf Shrine,” Qing Shui said cheerfully.</p>
 <p>Fire Bird landed on a spot not too far away from the Divine Wolf Shrine and was then put away by Qing Shui. Their group followed everyone else towards the Divine Wolf Shrine. However, Qing Shui had an odd feeling when the Divine Wolf Shrine came into his view.</p>
 <p>A shrine?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn’t shake off the odd feeling as he followed the others into that enormous Divine Wolf Shrine. The place was a little familiar to him. Qing Shui was dumbfounded as soon as he set his foot inside.</p>
 <p>It was a shrine!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was immediately struck dumb by the familiarity and the faint oppressive aura. Although it was a different statue from before, there was a towering statue of a Nine-Headed Moon Wolf….</p>
 <p>A familiar pressure….</p>
 <p>This was a pleasant surprise to Qing Shui. He didn’t expect this Divine Wolf Shrine to actually be a shrine. It was his third time discovering a shrine. He had received great benefits previously when he’d stumbled upon two other shrines. The only difference this time was that many people knew about it too. He wondered if there was still something valuable left in here.</p>
 <p>He shifted his gaze to the bottom of that gigantic Nine-Headed Moon Wolf statue and got extremely excited, since he saw a familiar box.</p>
 <p>The immense pressure kept everyone from advancing any further. Even Ye Yan was affected by it. The oppressive aura from the previous two statues didn’t affect people without any cultivation. He was uncertain if it were the same case in this shrine.</p>
 <p>Many people tried to approach the Nine-Headed Moon Wolf statue, but most of them gave up completely after just a few steps. Some were trying to use stuff like hooks. As soon as the iron hooks were thrown out, they were crushed in midair. This greatly discouraged many others from any further attempts.</p>
 <p>“Forget about it. There was once a peak Martial Saint cultivator who tried and he could only make past two-thirds of the distance,” someone sneered at the persistence of those people.</p>
 <p>“No one stronger came?” Someone asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“A stronger one? A few peak Martial Saints came, but do you think peak Martial Saints are cabbage sellers? How many peak Martial Saints have you met?” The person from earlier shot back at the person who questioned him disdainfully.</p>
 <p>The person who asked that question immediately left with his tail between his legs!</p>
 <p>The people here came and go. Qing Shui pondered for a moment and decided that he would leave as soon as he got his hands on the box. He immediately released a big swarm of Jade Emperor Bees. The air around them was instantly filled with buzzing noises that could make one’s blood run cold.</p>
 <p>“Poisonous bees!”</p>
 <p>“RUN!”</p>
 <p>….</p>
 <p>The crowd immediately left the Divine Wolf Shrine in chaos. Each and every one of them scrambled to escape outside. After all, every single Jade Emperor Bee was about a few metres large and they were of Martial King level. It was especially terrifying to see a several hundreds of them.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, let’s escape!” Ye Yan called out to Qing Shui in panic.</p>
 <p>“Everything is fine, don’t be scared!” Qing Shui assured her with a smile. He then slowly made his way towards the Nine-Headed Moon Wolf statue. That familiar oppressive feeling felt quite pleasant to him. It bestowed a warm feeling on Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>With his previous experience, Qing Shui was brimming with confidence. He had Thunder God on his left hand. The increase of one-fold strength allowed him to advance a little further.</p>
 <p>He flung the Demon Binding Rope that was tied to a special metal chain.</p>
 <p>It binded that box and he managed to pull it forward slightly before he had to repeat the same thing again….</p>
 <p>The Demon Binding Ropes that had broke through another level of realm seemed to be able to keep its target bound a little longer. At least, this held true for objects that weren’t living. This had saved Qing Shui a considerable amount of time.</p>
