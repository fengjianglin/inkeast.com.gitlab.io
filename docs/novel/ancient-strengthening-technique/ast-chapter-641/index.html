 <p><strong>AST 641 - White Jade Milky Pond, Stone Beauty</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui walked towards the cave that wasn’t too concealed among this well hidden mountain valley. If it wasn’t for Qing Shui’s spiritual sense that felt the rich Spiritual Qi in here, he wouldn’t be able to discover this place.</p>
 <p>The only thing that puzzled him was the absence of any powerful demonic beasts around this place that had a rich Spiritual Qi. He was deep in thought as he walked when very soon enough, he had found out the reason.</p>
 <p>Poison Valley!</p>
 <p>He hadn’t really pay much attention to his surroundings earlier, but now he noticed that most of the plants around here seemed to possess either high or low level of toxicity. Then, he found five similar mysterious poisonous plants in the east, south, west, north and center parts of the valley!</p>
 <p>Cloudmist Daylilies!</p>
 <p>No wonder the Spiritual Qi was so abundant in here, there were actually Cloudmist Daylilies that grew up around here.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui activated his Nature Energy to its peak and didn’t sense any aura of powerful demonic beasts around.</p>
 <p>As soon as he realized that this was a poison valley, he quickly fed Yu Ruyan a Pure Jade Pellet.</p>
 <p>He saw a few birds and small beasts around, but all of them were poison beasts. It was impossible for non-poisonous beings to survive in this place. The air around the area was not highly toxic, but all the plants here were poisonous especially those five Cloudmist Daylilies.</p>
 <p>The Cloudmist Daylilies were highly toxic and one of its important effect was that they could double the toxicity of all poisonous beings within the radius of a 100 meters.</p>
 <p>Other than that, there was always a Five-Colored Daylily Python on every Cloudmist Daylily. Although it was called a python, it was only a meter in length and it twisted itself along with the less than two meters tall Cloudmist Daylily. They were the true chiefs of this mountain valley but they normally wouldn’t wander more than 100 meters away from their respective Cloudmist Daylily.</p>
 <p>As each pythons oversees a radius of 100 meters around them, they had basically occupied half of the mountain valley itself. Qing Shui had quite some knowledge about these Cloudmist Daylilies and the Five Colored Daylily Pythons. He had decided to walked in the gaps in between the territories of each pythons and made his way towards the cave near the cliff. Qing Shui didn’t have time right now to pay any attention on interesting things that attracted him.</p>
 <p>He appeared to be moving slow but in fact, his speed was extremely fast.</p>
 <p>Soon, he had reached the cave’s entrance.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui entered the cave after he had checked his surroundings. He expected it to be dark inside, but on the contrary, the inside of the cave was very bright. However, the cave was covered with a thick layer of dust that it looks like no one had come inside for a long period of time.</p>
 <p>Drip!</p>
 <p>The sound of dripping water!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui noticed that the inside of the cave had winding paths and the sound of dripping water had come from behind a wall that was not too far away. He couldn’t sense any traces of poison along the path, but on the contrary, the Spiritual Qi here was quite abundant.</p>
 <p>He decided to walk around the massive stone that was like a protective wall when suddenly, a water pond came into his view. This place was entirely different than the outside and most importantly, the water pond was filled with a milky white substance.</p>
 <p>White Jade Milky Pond!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui understood now why he had sensed a wave of Spiritual Qi within the mountain valley. All of it was due to this White Jade Milky Pond. Compared to the outside, this place was untainted and was surrounded with a humid air that makes people felt extremely refreshed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was very excited. He didn’t expect that he would discover such a precious place. The White Milky Jade in this White Jade Milky Pond was far more valuable than those 1,000 or 10,000 years old hot springs. With this, he had more confidence to heal Lady Duanmu’s injuries.</p>
 <p>“Madam, I would like to treat your injuries. But, your clothes need to…...” Qing Shui didn’t finish his sentence but he hoped that what he meant was conveyed.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan remembered what Qing Shui had told her. She must cooperate with him during her treatment and she must not take her own life. Although she should have known that this was something inevitable in the process of getting treated.</p>
 <p>A faint pink color tinted her pale face. This was also one of the reason why Qing Shui had refused Duanmu Lingshuang earlier when she wanted to come along with them.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at this mature and peerless woman, who was already a mother but still possessed an unmatched stunning aura. To Qing Shui, someone like her was the true definition of a woman. Only people who had been through a lot could exude this kind of aura.</p>
 <p>“Alright, I understand. Please do it for me, I don’t have the strength to do so.”</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan said as she used the last ounce of strength in her body to answer, ad she slowly closed her beautiful eyes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was perplexed at the current situation, as if his five senses were assaulted at the same time. Then, he noticed a partly hidden tall rock that stood in the middle of the White Jade Milky Pond. It had a slope that was higher on the southern part while lower on the northern part, and was about 3 meters tall and 2 meters wide. He couldn’t really tell accurately what it was, so he had decided to removed his boots and carefully leaped onto it.</p>
 <p>There wasn’t a single trace of White Milky Jade on the rock’s surface on the southern part. Then it gradually inclined downwards until it was slightly immersed with White Milky Jade on the other end. The White Milky Jade flowed and circulated around it slowly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui helped Yu Ruyan lie on the surface of the rock, with her head positioned on the higher southern part. The smooth White Milky Jade covered her body and it felt warm and creamy like milk.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan lied down and her body below her waist was submerged onto the White Milky Jade. When she opened her eyes, she saw Qing Shui looking at her with a frown.</p>
 <p>“I’m going to strip you…..”</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan blushed and nodded before she closed her eyes once again.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had assessed her injuries before he undone the fabric around her waist while he clenched his teeth. But, due to her injuries, he had decided to cut her clothes with a dagger. All of her clothes were removed as she had to absorb the Milky White Jade</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had found Yu Ruyan’s exquisite body stunning, despite the terrifying injury on her abdomen. Her body was fair like jade and it was as silky and smooth as the White Milky Jade. The beautiful sight of Yu Ruyan being surrounded by the White Milky Jade was indescribable.</p>
 <p>She laid there with her perky breasts exposed, which weren’t only large but also beautifully shaped and plump. Although Qing Shui found their perkiness to be unbelievable, the women around him indeed possess the same impressive assets and he had already felt that indescribable plumpness. He could tell that those were definitely rare gems in just a glance… But he must not touch this woman before him.</p>
 <p>Her enticing body and slim abdomen appeared soft and smooth, but there was a gaping wound on it right now. As soon as he saw that area, Qing Shui composed himself before he reached out and gave a few gentle presses on her body.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui applied some pressure, blood had started to gradually spill out from her wound as it seeped out and disappeared into the White Milky Jade.</p>
 <p>Saintly Hands!</p>
 <p>Both of Qing Shui’s hands had turned translucent, then, he immersed his hands into the White Milky Jade and slowly rubbed the areas around the wound. He tried to focus solely as he treated her wound to distract himself.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t dare to look at those beautiful breasts and tightly shut eyes on her exquisite face, and he also didn’t dare to look down either. He felt that his blood was still surging quickly when he had stripped her earlier and saw her alluring body.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t even realize that Yu Ruyan had opened her eyes. She looked at her bare naked body and at the hands of the man who was still touching her lower abdomen. He would see everything if he shifted his gaze even just a little. But then again, he had helped her removed her clothes earlier, so it was impossible that he didn’t see anything…...</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan felt that Qing Shui had a pair of strange hands. She could feel the trace of energy that was continuously channeled into her body from his hands, which gave a comfortable and cool sensation on her wounds.</p>
 <p>After he did this for about an hour, Qing Shui pulled out his Gold Needles. He had soaked them in the White Milky Jade before he inserted the needle in her wound.</p>
 <p>Another four needles were inserted in a single breath!</p>
 <p>Five Element Acupuncture!</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan’s six organs* in her abdomen were damaged and needed to be restored by the Five Element Acupuncture. The Spiritual Qi from the White Milky Jade around her had slowly seeped into her body.</p>
 <p>[TL Note: Gallbladder, stomach, large intestine, small intestine, bladder and ‘sanjiao’, which are the three truncal cavities - thoracic, abdominal and pelvic]</p>
 <p>The Gold Needles on her body whirled and trembled continuously. Qing Shui laid both of his hands around Yu Ruyan’s dantian area as he slowly circulated the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique to stimulate and increase the vitality of her body.</p>
 <p>He could clearly feel the injuries in her body as it healed at the speed that was observable with the naked eye. With the help of the Milky White Jade, scabs had already formed over the wound’s surface.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had already stored the Gold Needles but his hands was still placed on her abdomen. Everything went fine during the treatment but he wished to help her recover with his abilities for a little more longer.</p>
 <p>But then, Yu Ruyan let out a soft groan.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui asked as his heart raced.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan had quickly assured him that nothing was wrong but her face involuntarily turned red. Qing Shui then discovered that her entire body had started to flush, and even her beautiful eyes on that alluring face were moist.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s heart skipped a beat at the turn of events, he quickly propped her up and pressed on her Ling Tai acupoint. Yu Ruyan was a little sober now and can tell that something was wrong, as her entire body had started to burn up and she felt a little pent up inside…...</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong with you?” Qing Shui asked worriedly.</p>
 <p>“I felt a sharp pain in my rear as if something had just bit me……”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t notice until now that the rock surface beneath her had turned into a strange pink color. He radiated a wave of his Qi force to disperse the White Milky Jade around them.</p>
 <p>A stone bed!</p>
 <p>This rock surface was actually a stone bed. It was only partly visible earlier but he could completely see it at this moment. Now that the entire thing was revealed, both of them were dumbfounded.</p>
 <p>The name of this bed was Stone Beauty!</p>
 <p>Even a sealed woman* would become a slut as long as she laid down on this bed…….</p>
 <p>[TL Note: A woman whose vagina is blocked due to birth defect.]</p>
 <p>The ‘Stone Beauty’ from legends looked similar to this stone bed. As long as a woman lied down on it for a period of time, she would feel a needle like prick on her rear. The drop of blood would then fuse with the stone bed, turning it pink very quickly. Then, the bed would start to exude an intense aphrodisiac in the air. Even a sealed woman would also get excited and this cannot be dispelled by any medicine…...</p>
 <p>So this bed really existed…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was dumbfounded. Perhaps it was due to the Nature Energy, Qing Shui could only feel his lust growing in intensity. He thought that it was because he was tempted by Lady Duanmu’s body but he had sensed that something was wrong because he felt that his lust was very hard to suppress. Now he finally understood why.</p>
 <p>He had suddenly felt something soft and silky in his arms. With an agonized face, he looked at Lady Duanmu who was already delirious. Her beautiful eyebrows were knitted together and her eyes were filled bitterness as she leaned closer towards Qing Shui with a kiss.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that Lady Duanmu hadn’t completely lost her sanity yet, but her behavior was already controlled by her lust. She was distressed, but she didn’t know what to do…...</p>
 <p>Lady Duanmu was indeed a beauty unmatched in her generation. Qing Shui wasn’t going to deny the fact that she wasn’t less inferior to the ladies on the Portraits of Beauty. However, he had never thought that this would happen between them. Besides, her daughter’s age was almost the same as him and most importantly, Qing Shui were friends with her. No matter what, they were very close friends so he was at loss right now on what he would do.</p>
 <p>He turned his face to the side and Lady Duanmu’s kiss was planted on his cheek instead!</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, Lady Duanmu slammed her fist against the stone bed with an unknown burst of strength. However, this stone bed was no ordinary bed, her delicate hand was instantly injured.</p>
 <p>This had granted her a brief moment of clarity. “Qing Shui, kill me. I’m not that kind of woman. Just kill me…...”</p>
