It was because the Poison Willow Darts that shot out now had strong poison on them. Even after so many years had passed, the poison on the darts was still very terrifying. He collected these Poison Willow Darts. At the very least, he would be able to use them himself in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other people were also in great astonishment. If they were hit by these poison darts, no one knew what would happen to them. Even though the Dragon Slaying Beast could take the poison, it wouldn't be able to fend off more than a single side. After all, its body wasn't big enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the other demonic beasts, it was hard to say if they could fend off the poison darts. The group managed to cross the first stage which was considered hard to pass. The rhythm of the formation and poison darts seemed to make it hard to dodge. At the very least, when one discovered them, it would be too late to dodge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Qing Shui could be sure that this place had been sealed up by the Liu Clan. However, he had no idea why the Liu Clan had sealed up this place. Was it to seal up someone else? Or themselves?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It didn't seem plausible that they had sealed up themselves. Sometimes, people would do this in order to save themselves. However, judging from the situation of the place, it seemed as if they had done a dead seal, which made it really puzzling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There seems to be a house in front that looks similar to an ancestral hall." Beihuang Fan said.</span></p>

This place should be in the middle of the village. Although it looked very old as well, it clearly looked a lot sturdier than the other places. Moreover, it was very well retained despite looking a little old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he walked up to the entrance, Qing Shui saw a layer of dust above. With a swing of his hand, the words on it were revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Clan Ancestral Hall!</span></p>

This place made Qing Shui feel that things were getting increasingly dramatic. He was here in search of treasure. Moreover, this was a small space within the Door of Energy. Could it be that this place was also a part of the world in the past?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui decided to put this aside and not give it much thought. He had come across too many strange and mysterious things in the past, and this wasn't much. He started to head toward the ancestral hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn't know if it was because of the long age or something else that there weren't any barriers as he walked in. Qing Shui had no idea if there were any restrictions here in the past, but there was nothing here now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ancestral hall wasn't very big. It was about 50 meters in length, 30 meters in width, and ten meters in height.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were many pillars in the ancestral halls as well as some old tables and chairs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui then saw that there were some statues in the surroundings, each of them about three meters tall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took a casual look at a few of them. He didn't have any interest in them, but when he was looking around, he came across a big inscription steele. It was very big and there were many words on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xuanriver 30th year, Liu Zongyuan relied on his Light Division Shadow Movement Technique and Liu Clan's Three Darts to achieve dominance.</span></p>

Qing Shui took a very serious look all until the end. It could be that the memories here are real, and it could unveil the truth behind the reason why the Liu Clan was sealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heavendragon 52nd year, Demonic Wolf Clan killed Liu Clan's Liu Can.

This meant that it had all been over for the Liu Clan. At the last line, it said that Liu Fengmang had turned against the clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason that they had suggested Liu Fengmang had disappeared was due to the fact that he could not bear with the life after the Liu Clan had been sealed. He couldn't put up with being sealed up for life and thus, had turned his back against the clan. However, whether or not he was able to continue to survive was another thing altogether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was nothing on the inscription steele that suggested what status Liu Fengmang had in the Liu Clan.

The old man from the Divine Palace exclaimed after reading, "To think that it's over even for the Liu Clan which had stood over the others in the past. I only wonder if there are any more surviving members of the Liu Clan now."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing what the old man said, Qing Shui knew that the Liu Clan was very powerful. Their moves, their poison, and their great mastery of hidden weapons made Qing Shui thought of the Deinonychus from the Jurassic era. It only had speed and sharp claws but could kill the massive Sauroposeidon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Speed was power. In this world, speed could overcome anything.</span></p>

It was an extremely unrealistic feeling, but the environment was changing.</span></p>

There were many records on it. He led the Liu Clan, which could only be considered a third-rated clan at that time, and slowly climbed up to the top of the pyramid.
