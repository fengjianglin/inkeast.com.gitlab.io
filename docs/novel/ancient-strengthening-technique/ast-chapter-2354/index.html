 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2354 - Beiyuan Clan Found Out</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui felt that Nalan Qing was pure and irreproachable. Her stance toward other people was very cold. She was a widow and looked very mature, so much that Qing Shui felt that for this type of woman to become lovely and charming, it would require a lot of time and effort. It might even be impossible since it was difficult to change someone’s character.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus many people felt fulfillment at turning a cold woman into a charming and bubbly one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nalan Qing’s current somewhat happy and somewhat angry look struck Qing Shui especially hard. This woman may not be as cold as Tantai Lingyan, but she wasn’t inferior in any way. Tantai Lingyan had a beautiful and enviable type of cold. Nalan Qing, on the other hand, had an indifference under the coldness facade. An indifference towards everything. This made many people unable to act naturally around her and thus severely affecting their emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, alright. Even if I’m dirty, could you give me a chance to be clean? You can’t just keep calling me dirty for no reason. At least tell me how I can make up for it!” Qing Shui said happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cleanse your mind!” Nalan Qing did not even realize that her tone was different from before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui could tell, but he wouldn’t call her out for fear of her embarrassment. She had very thin skin, so it was best to let her realize it herself. It wouldn’t take long. Maybe she had already realized but didn’t want to go back to normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, in the end, Nalan Qing still brought Qing Shui to her bedroom as her bedroom was close to Qing Shui’s. It was just 2 bedrooms in a big palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was not Qing Shui’s first time entering a girl’s bedroom. There was nothing special, as it was newly decorated. It was also Nalan Qing’s first time entering since she had not lived here in a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The room was clean. Spotless, in fact. It felt remarkably pure and clean. The couch, bed, and beddings were all snow white. Though the color was dull, it did not affect the aesthetic, the room still looked good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After an uneventful night, Qing Shui started to cure the Nalan Clan the next day. He realized that only some of them were suffering from Immortal Powder. Most weren’t even affected. Even if it was not Immortal Powder, it was a terrifying poison as the person who made the poison was highly skilled. If Qing Shui did not have the Heavenly Vision technique, there would be no way to rid them of the poison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They managed to save some time on getting rid of the poison but it was still true that the Nalan clan’s strong warriors were all poisoned. The person who did this had extraordinary skill, being able to silently poison Shui Huang and a bunch of strong warriors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This had nothing to do with luck. Though poison masters were highly advantaged, this was within a certain realm of strength. Qing Shui could see through the Water Emperor’s strength, and in the end, powerful warriors had their own methods for resisting poison. Poison itself wasn’t a crutch to overcome absolute differences. Poison masters could rank in the formidability leaderboards, but couldn’t sweep the top spots with these flaws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Qing Shui was very interested in this poison master, as it couldn’t be some no-name. Whoever this poison master was would probably have unlimited prospects in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three days had passed without any major incidents. Qing Shui had cured several of the Water Emperor’s strongest experts. The Beiyuan clan waited outside for Qing Shui and Nalan Qing as they didn’t dare to involve the imperial palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was not that they did not dare, but more like there was no need to. They just needed to wait patiently. The Divinity Scattering Powder and other poisons would quickly take effect, removing all obstacles and worries for the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Huang had regained his former powers during this period of time, his strength now at around 4.5 trillion Daos, slightly beating out Qing Shui’s— who was at 4 trillion Daos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nalan Qing was not poisoned and her abilities were considered good amongst the younger generation. Certainly, a force to be reckoned with. However, she couldn’t match up with the older experts such as the poisoned experts in the Nalan Clan, each with 2.5 trillion Daos or more of strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui recognized that their opponents wouldn’t be weak, perhaps not any weaker than the Nalan Clan. Even worse was the fact that the Beiyuan Clan weren’t alone in this coalition of tens of powers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another three people were cured today; two men came to find Qing Shui for drinks. They were roughly the same age as Qing Shui. Even Qing Shui did not know if they were older than he was. This was because they were Nalan Qing’s brothers, Nalan Jin and Nalan Kang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were Nalan Qing’s younger brothers and were grateful for Qing Shui’s help. Though they guessed about Qing Shui and Nalan Qing’s relationship, they didn’t touch on that subject.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing their sister happy was all they wanted, which was why they hoped that this man would become their brother-in-law. Him being a doctor was just a plus. This was the first time that their sister had ever indicated any interest in a man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui had saved the entire Nalan clan so the Nalan brothers had long treated Qing Shui as a family member. There was nothing that they would not do to repay Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui felt that these two guys were not bad. Though much weaker than Nalan Qing, their strength was still passable. Qing Shui didn’t judge them by their strength, but by their character.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother-in-law…” Nalan Kang accidentally called out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was stunned for a moment. Nalan Qing’s shy, flustered voice rang, “ Nalan Kang, speak any more nonsense and I’ll beat you up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, let’s drink,” Nalan Kang laughed and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was happy drinking with them, but he would turn to look at Nalan Qing from time to time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you looking at?” Nalan Qing said curtly as she glared at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder sister Qing, you’re peerlessly graceful and elegant. Why can’t people look at you?” Qing Shui drank some wine. The presence of good wine and a beautiful woman gave him a good feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nalan Qing didn’t reply but found it strange that she felt something special whenever she heard a compliment from him. Perhaps she really was falling for him…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Beiyuan Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? Nalan Jian has been cured?” Beiyuan Cao stood up from his chair, face filled with all sorts of rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many people below but the one who answered was an old man. He wore a black top with a white skeleton sewn onto it. As thin as firewood, he gave off a cold, pallid aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. The Divinity Scattering Powder has no antidote. Even I cannot revert it.” The old man said in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then how? Did you see something wrong?” Beiyuan Cao asked, not wanting to accept the truth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m certain of my sightings. He must have had used some kind of treasure or medicinal pill. However, even if it was a treasure or medicinal pill, it wouldn’t definitely cure him. This is really puzzling.”</span></p>
