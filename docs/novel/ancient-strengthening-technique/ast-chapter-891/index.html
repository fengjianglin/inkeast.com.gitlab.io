 <p><strong>AST 891 - Getting Hold of the Sky Penetrating Grass, Escaping In A Pathetic State</strong></p>
 <p>Before Qing Shui dashed out, he circulated all his abilities to their limits, not having the wishful thought that he would be able to stop the opponent's attack. However, sometimes, doing this could still save his life.</p>
 <p>The Long-armed Vicious Monkey King noticed him the moment he dashed out. Letting out a furious bellow as if he was going to tear the sky apart, he ignored the Five-Headed Demonic Spider and dashed for Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The Five-Headed Demonic Spider naturally would not allow the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King to attack Qing Shui and quickly followed. Its spider webs had tightly wrapped around the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King but the latter was still dashing toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The strength of the Five-Headed Demonic Spider couldn't be compared to that of the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King and the spider webs were quickly torn up. Even the Five-Headed Demonic Spider was tugged and sent flying toward the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King.</p>
 <p>Corrosive Poison Web!</p>
 <p>Corrosive Poison Web!</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>A few layers of the Five-Headed Demonic Spider's poisonous web were thrown out toward the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King. In mid-air the Five-Headed Demonic Spider tried very hard to change its direction.</p>
 <p>With this help, Qing Shui managed to gain some time and he had reached the Sky Penetrating Grass. Reaching out his two hands, he grabbed one with each hand and tugged them out fiercely.</p>
 <p>He succeeded!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not have the time to feel happy when he sensed a huge force whipping out toward him. There was no way he could avoid it. Qing Shui was already using the Seven Star Armored Vest but he knew that this little defense would do him no good.</p>
 <p>He didn't have enough time to return to the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Abruptly flying up, his body inclined forward, he concurrently used the Heavenly Palace's "Divinity Protection" and the "Seemingly Sealed Shut" from his Taichi Fist techniques.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was blasted out like an arrow and while in mid-air, his consciousness was blurred. However, he knew that he mustn't pass out. The tremendous pain he was feeling also woke him up instantaneously.</p>
 <p>Fresh blood splurted out freely and was even flowing out from his ears, nose and eyes. Other than his heart, all his other internal organs had been badly damaged...</p>
 <p>Earlier, he had already checked out the direction and called for the Five-Headed Demonic Spider to wait for him there. Therefore, Qing Shui was caught by the Five-Headed Demonic Spider and the strong impact once again hurt Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The Five-Headed Demonic Spider brought Qing Shui with it as it dashed off, swift as the wind. It deliberately looked for positions where the webs had been formed and it worked its way through them like a fish in water. Moreover, in the condition where the "Flying Spider Silk" was activated, its speed was definitely extremely powerful.</p>
 <p>The Long-armed Vicious Monkey King bellowed out and chased after the Five-Headed Demonic Spider. At the start, he stomped through several tens of the Corrosive Poison Webs and the webs' extremely sticky and corrosive nature gradually slowed the big fellow down.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't pay any heed to it. The moment his body recovered a little, he immediately took out a petal of the "Golden Buddha Aura Lotus", eating it. Earlier, even with the Seven Star Armored Vest, Divinity Protection and Seemingly Sealed Shut activated, he was still almost instantly killed. Toward the end, he had even used the boost from the impact.</p>
 <p>He had no other way out but to do this. Otherwise, he wouldn't have gotten his hands on the Sky Penetrating Grass. Moreover, he had also relied on the fact that he had the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal which could extend his life.</p>
 <p>This was how powerful a divine medicine was. Qing Shui recovered at such a rapid speed that it could be seen with the naked eye and the unbearable pain also gradually subsided.</p>
 <p>Fiery Golden Eyes!</p>
 <p>Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>Once he regained his abilities, Qing Shui didn't stand on ceremony and just weakened his opponent before feeding the Five-Headed Demonic Spider one Gale Pellet. The pill it had taken earlier should be wearing off soon. Although the Five-Headed Demonic Spider's Corrosive Poison Web caused the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King's snow white fur to turn into an extremely bad state, they didn't cause it too much damage.</p>
 <p>This Long-armed Vicious Monkey King had also relied on its powerful physical strength to push forth relentlessly. However, it now discovered that its speed was slightly lacking and there were poisonous webs in the surroundings, which were driving it crazy.</p>
 <p>And Qing Shui's amazing weakening impact was also driving it crazy.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui let the Five-Headed Demonic Spider head back to where he had set up the tent earlier. His other demonic beasts were still there and he needed to quickly leave this place with them. If the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King had some killing technique, they would be in trouble.</p>
 <p>Once they arrived at the tent, Qing Shui quickly put them all in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, even the Five-Headed Demonic Spider and himself.</p>
 <p>Almost at the same moment he entered, a huge gush of power swept by where Qing Shui was standing earlier like an impact wave, turning everything in the surroundings into dust. The Long-armed Vicious Monkey King let out a furious bellow which could be clearly heard across 10,000 li.</p>
 <p>Only after entering the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal did Qing Shui truly feel relieved. He looked at how half of the "silver mountain" outside had been flattened. The Long-armed Vicious Monkey King was still venting its frustrations incessantly.</p>
 <p>In this dog eat dog world, this was how things were. There were no owners to heavenly and earthly treasures. Looking at that ferocious demonic beast outside, Qing Shui could only say that it was just plain unlucky.</p>
 <p>Looking at the two Sky Penetrating Grass which he had tugged out, Qing Shui realized that although their roots were torn off, it might not affect their growth. Qing Shui quickly planted one of the two in the soil.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui intended to use the other one to refine medicine and thus didn't plant it. Looking at the three Sky Penetrating Grass he had in total, each of them having an age of over 5,000 years, moreover with two of them close to 10,000 years, Qing Shui was very agitated.</p>
 <p>It has been very long since he had left Greencloud Continent and now his goal was accomplished. Moreover, he had also gained a lot of benefits. This time around, the Five-Headed Demonic Spider was the most useful. Otherwise, there was no way that he would be able to get the Sky Penetrating Grass from the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King.</p>
 <p>Regulating his breathing, recuperating, cultivating!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was previously seriously damaged by the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King's impact. Although it was healed by the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus, it still required some time before he could completely recover. Now, he was in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and thus it would not take more than a few days time.</p>
 <p>However, during those few days, Qing Shui would not perform alchemy. He wanted to perform alchemy only after his abilities and condition has been returned to their optimal state. The medicinal herbs were hard to come by and he could not allow for there to be any mistakes.</p>
 <p>Every once in awhile, Qing Shui would look out. He realized that the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King was still circling the place, bellowing non-stop. The entire silver mountain had been thrashed.</p>
 <p>Looking at how it was late and his time in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was going to be up soon, Qing Shui directly left the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to take a look at where the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King was in case it would dash toward them.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Steps!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used the Nine Continents Steps.</p>
 <p>He then repeated it again.</p>
 <p>The first time, he was brought 200,000 li away and the second time, he was brought 100,000 li away. It was because Qing Shui wanted to head to where that deity was, to the place where he had been together with Mu Qing. Qing Shui wanted to stay there for some time.</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui was 300,000 li away. By rights, if he were to travel 200,000 li away for each of the time he used the Nine Continents Steps, he would be able to reach 400,000 li away. However, this time around, Qing Shui wanted to go kill that Golden Jiao King.</p>
 <p>After all, he now had the Five-Headed Demonic Spider and it shouldn't be too hard for him to kill it. Qing Shui wanted the materials from the Golden Jiao King. Previously, even the 10,000 Years Coldsteel Needle was not able to pierce through it. The reason why Qing Shui had made this decision was also because he now had the Five-Headed Demonic Spider. Otherwise, he would just make his escape. With his current abilities, he would only end up being instantly killed if he were to encounter the Golden Jiao King.</p>
 <p>It was already late and he had already used up the time in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and thus he could only wait till the second day if he wished to enter the realm. He couldn't enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, nor could he use the Nine Continents Steps. Now, at 200,000 li deep in the mountains, Qing Shui didn't need to worry. It was because he still had the Five-Headed Demonic Spider, which was an unrivaled existence in this area.</p>
 <p>He found an empty spot, set up his tent and let out his demonic beasts to get some fresh air. They were in the wilderness and he decided to let them get some fresh air while taking turns to be on guard while he himself lay down on the bed, thinking of things.</p>
 <p>Now, the thing he thought about the most was the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellet and the Du Meridian Strengthening Pellet. Their alchemy recipes appeared clearly in Qing Shui's mind and other than the Sky Penetrating Grass, all the other ingredients were fully prepared. Now that he had gotten his hands on the Sky Penetrating Grass, everything was ready.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui only entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal in the later part of the night, entering with the Five-Headed Demonic Spider and the others. After a round of cultivation, Qing Shui started to prepare the medicinal herbs he needed.</p>
 <p>He then tempered the medicinal herbs. This preparation work took a lot of time as well. Just like that, preparing some after a while of cultivation, he only finished up when it was time for him to leave the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Leaving the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui headed towards the Golden Jiao King's nest with the Five-Headed Demonic Spider. They neither traveled at a fast nor a slow speed. Qing Shui planned to reach it before daybreak.</p>
 <p>To have encountered a demonic beast at this level, other than the Thunderous Beast, all the other demonic beasts he had were of no use at all. And even the Thunderous Beast could only provide support. Actually, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant could do the same, such as to use the Vajra Subdues Demons. However, it was a pity that their abilities were too weak. Otherwise, their battle techniques would be very heaven-defying.</p>
 <p>It seemed that he would need to raise the abilities of these demonic beasts in the future. Their progress in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was not slow but to Qing Shui it was still slow.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't wish to see their progress be so slow. At the very least, he would need to try to let his demonic beasts reach the level the Five-Headed Demonic Spider was at as soon as possible.</p>
 <p>Thinking about it, it seemed to be very difficult. It was very difficult to attain a breakthrough to the Martial Emperor level. There was still a very long path on which he would have to travel. He had refining demon, he had the Ice Snow Sacred Fruit and now he had the Jade Spirit Fruit Tree, he was still very confident.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui once again went up to the nest of the Golden Jiao King. Although the Golden Jiao King's body was much longer than that Long-armed Vicious Monkey King, it was not as wide. The Golden Jiao King's body was primarily long and although it was many times longer than the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King, it was much weaker. Now, the Golden Jiao King was probably weaker than the Five-Headed Demonic Spider.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>This time around, from afar, he could already hear the Golden Jiao King's huge roar. It might be because of the Five-Headed Demonic Spider's aura. Very quickly, Qing Shui once again saw that familiar golden colored figure circling in mid-air.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had to admit that this Golden Jiao King was really handsome looking and its cry was a little like that of a Jiao King's howl, giving off a sense of astonishment. It was a pity that after looking at its horrible looking head, all that feeling from earlier disappeared.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood there, not moving, speechless. It was because when the Golden Jiao King saw the Five-Headed Demonic Spider, it abruptly dashed down, bringing about a huge splashing sound before it turned completely silent.</p>
 <p>It ran away?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had not expected that such a powerful demonic beast would throw away its pride and escape.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and the Five-Headed Demonic Spider rushed to where the Golden Jiao King had appeared earlier. It was only then that he did realized that there was an inner sea in this area. The previous time Qing Shui had been forced to make his escape in a pathetic state and had not noticed this sea.</p>
 <p>The water of this inner sea was a faint golden color and appeared to be extremely beautiful. Moreover, the Spiritual Qi in this water seemed to be very high. Thinking about this Golden Jiao King entering the water, Qing Shui once again recalled that ancient poetry, 'Regardless of its height, any mountain can be famous with the presence of an immortal; regardless of its depth, any water can be holy with the presence of a Jiao King [¹].'</p>
