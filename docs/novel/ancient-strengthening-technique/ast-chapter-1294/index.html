 <p><strong>AST 1294 - Two Physiques Suitable To Cultivate Divine Beast Possession Technique, Making Preparations</strong></p>
 <p>The old man was well aware of his body's condition. Now that he was really cured, he looked at Qing Shui with astonishment and disbelief. After all, something like this was like a fantasy. The impact was the same level as if someone from Qing Shui's previous life was fully cured despite being at the last stage of cancer.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the old man and knew that the shock he dealt with was too great. As for the effects of the healing, Qing Shui was clearer than the old man.</p>
 <p>"If something like this didn't happen on me, I'd never have believed it. Qing Shui, I won't say anything else. I had promised you previously that I'll be helping you out with my remaining life." The old smiled as he looked at Qing Shui and said seriously.</p>
 <p>The old man knew what great benefits there were for him to have a longer lifespan. Family, legacy... and he could also pursue the path of the Heavenly Dao now, or at least try to go further on it. After all, he had just stepped into the Heavenly Dao when he realized that his life was running short. No one would be able to accept this and now that he was given the chance, how could he possibly not feel happy about it?</p>
 <p>Being able to try even if one knew that the end result would be a failure was also considered a form of happiness.</p>
 <p>"Old Master Cao, I'll help you treat your body tomorrow." Qing Shui looked toward Old Master Cao and said.</p>
 <p>"It's fine, there's no hurry. It's not as if I'll be dying in another two to three days." Headmaster Cao also said happily.</p>
 <p>He and Headmaster Sui were as close as real brothers. Having been fated to become brothers in this life, they were originally due to continue their brotherhood in another world but now discovered that they could continue to be brothers here. They could still see their family. Was there anything that could be even more blissful than that?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui went back and personally cooked for the three ladies. Qing Sha was very attached to him but he still had his own things to do. Therefore, when he was around, he would shower her with more love. This would also make him feel happier as a father.</p>
 <p>Today, when he had was chatting with the two Headmasters, he learned that the Heaven Secrets Academy was considered to be well-fortified in the Western Oxhe Continent. Whoever wanted to get their hands on the Heaven Secrets Academy would have to pay a terrible price regardless of who they were and they might not succeed.</p>
 <p>With that, Qing Shui would be assured even if he was no longer in the Western Oxhe Continent. Thinking back, he also felt that he might have been too much of a worrywart previously. Without him, the Heaven Secrets Academy would continue to operate and leave a very long history. Now that he was here, the Heaven Secrets Academy would go down even longer into history.</p>
 <p>"Father, when you head out this time around, can you bring me along?" Qing Sha sat next to Qing Shui during the meal and asked.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and shook his head. "Stay here and work hard on your cultivation. We still have a very long life before us. There won't be a lack of time for you to spend with me."</p>
 <p>Qing Sha replied gloomily, "Alright, I'll listen to father."</p>
 <p>"Mmm. Lass, having been around for the so many years, you should know how important power is. Therefore, don't give up. When you get stronger, there'll be nothing that can pose a problem to you." Qing Shui did not continue.</p>
 <p>Qing Sha nodded as her frown deepened.</p>
 <p>The Seventh Princess' relationship with Qing Shui was still considered to be quite good. He did not know what the Eldest Princess and the Seventh Princess had said between themselves. The other time, Qing Shui had seen that because of the relationship between himself and the Eldest Princess, the two sisters had almost fallen apart.</p>
 <p>However, the matter came to a rest. By right, they should say something after that episode but Qing Shui did not know what they had said between themselves. Anyways, right now, he and the Seventh Princess were just friends.</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu was Qing Shui's sworn elder sister and treated him very well. Her good treatment toward him included living needs as well as mental needs. It was the treatment that an elder sister would show toward a younger brother.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's concern toward Yan Clan was only limited to Yan Jinyu now. Yan Jinyu's siblings were still alright too. If one day, someone from Yan Jinyu's generation were to take over the clan, then Qing Shui might forge closer relationships with them. However, he was not interested in doing so at the moment.</p>
 <p>At night, Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>After going through one round of tempering his magic treasures, Qing Shui once again looked toward the book of Paragon about the Divine Beast Possession. He thought of what the lady had said before. She had told him that without the bloodline of the Beast Blood Tribe, it was impossible to cultivate this.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had once received the Dragon Qi. Furthermore, he had a unique physique to begin with. Therefore, even though he did not feel happy about it, he did not give up hope.</p>
 <p>Right now, he had the feeling that if he were to try again, he should be able to sense it if the martial technique rejected him. He really felt that it was a bit of a pity if he did not cultivate this battle technique.</p>
 <p>He decided to not worry so much and took out that handwritten manual for the Divine Beast Possession. This book must have had been through many years. He flipped it opened and started reading.</p>
 <p>The first condition for cultivating the Divine Beast Possession was to have the bloodline of the Beast Blood Tribe, even though this condition was not specified. However, the words ‘our tribe’ should be referring to that.</p>
 <p>Another condition was to have the Divine Beast Possession and to have a strength not lower than 7,000 suns. This was the lowest benchmark required. The most important thing was that there was a success rate for the cultivating of the Divine Beast Possession. Once failed, the same person would not be able to cultivate it again.</p>
 <p>The Divine Beast Possession allowed a battle beast of a certain trait to be awakened from one's body, while the Divine Beast Possession fully awakens this beast so that one would be able to use it for battle. It was different from the phantom image in the first form. The awakened state would be much more powerful, just like it was a real powerful demonic beast.</p>
 <p>The way to awaken was through blood essence!</p>
 <p>The Beast Blood Tribe's blood essence had a great similarity to demonic beast's and their success rate would be relatively higher. Using a human's divine blood would have a lower success rate. Upon failing, there was an 80% chance of death and a 20% chance of staying alive. One would also be rendered unable to cultivate the Divine Beast Possession anymore in the future. Therefore, no matter the location, there were not many people who cultivated the Divine Beast Possession. It was a huge gamble where the chances of losing were far greater than winning.</p>
 <p>However, it was mentioned that there were two types of people who would be able to cultivate this technique with a 100% success rate. One was people with the Heart of Demonic Beast, while the other was people with the Heart of Seven Orifices.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan had a 100% success rate of cultivating this technique!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also recalled the genius in the Desolate Sect who had the Heart of Demonic Beast. They would cultivate the Divine Beast Possession in the future and would have a 100% success rate. It was no wonder that the Desolate Sect had wanted to unify and reign over the Western Oxhe Continent. It seemed that they did have a trump card up their sleeves.</p>
 <p>Was the Heart of Seven Orifices stronger or the Heart of Demonic Beast stronger?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had not seen this daughter for very long and did not know what cultivation level she was now at. By right, at her age, the improvement in her cultivation should be in leaps and bounds. She might even experience swelling blood vessels and the refinement of her heart force.</p>
 <p>There was also the others from Qing Clan. With Qing Shui's current abilities, if it were someone else, many people would give up on their clan. Moreover, he had already done enough for them. Most importantly, such a clan would have too much of a late start. It would be dreaming to want to bring their level up. It would be easier to start nurturing the next generation.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui would never give up on Qing Clan. Half of his efforts had been for the sake of Qing Clan; to let his family live longer and happier.</p>
 <p>He was not afraid of hard work or fatigue. As long as there was still Qing Clan behind him, with so many family members behind him, he would feel as if he was invigorated.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought about a lot of things. It might not be a bad decision to let Qing Clan stay in the five continents for now. Of course, if his Nine Continents Steps or Five Elements Divine Flags were to gain the ability to bring them to various place, his decision would still be to bring them around. He would never give up on his family and just let them go into declination. Since he had already taken on the path of martial arts, he wanted to try to bring them as far as he possibly could.</p>
 <p>Looking at the Divine Beast Possession, Qing Shui felt gloomy. He wanted to cultivate it but the results could be disastrous. Even if one had the bloodline of the Beast Blood Tribe, the chances of failing would still be very high.</p>
 <p>His body had been tempered by Dragon Qi before, and dragons were also considered demonic beasts. They might be considered immortal demons type demonic beasts. At the very least, a true dragon would be categorized under immortal demons and would be at the False God realm.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. Why did he suddenly gain an understanding of this? He shook his head. A real dragon... Would that huge green dragon he encountered in his consciousness be considered a real dragon?</p>
 <p>Would that adolescent flame dragon be considered one?</p>
 <p>Clenching onto the handwritten Divine Beast Possession manual, Qing Shui was stumped. It was too dangerous to cultivate but it was such a pity to give up.</p>
 <p>After much hesitation, Qing Shui still put it down. Right now, he was very strong. Moreover, he might come across some heavenly and earthly treasures or some medicinal pills that would allow him to have a 100% success rate in cultivating this technique. Therefore, it would be better for him to put this down for now.</p>
 <p>He then continued his usual tempering, training, and alchemy. He hoped to be able to quickly bring up the grade of the Five Elements Divine Flags. The more these were set up, the easier it would be for him to travel around.</p>
 <p>The next day, Qing Shui went to apply acupuncture to Headmaster Cao. There was no such thing as absolute selflessness. Qing Shui believed that even if he were to help the weak, even if it was out of his own selflessness, and even if he was not hoping to get any returns, helping others would be able to give him some positive returns mentally.</p>
 <p>Between people, there would tend to be some benefits or contacts, which would add more colors to a person. For example, for two families of compatible standing, they would eventually form marriage relationships after long periods of cooperation. People who collaborate in businesses in Qing Shui's previous life might end up being friends, true friends, or even become as close as partners eventually.</p>
 <p>At the start, Qing Shui was thought of highly by these two old men and they had stopped the mutual destruction between Fu Yantian and Qing Shui. They had done all this because both of them were talents and it would bring benefits to the Heaven Secrets Academy in the future. If Qing Shui was far from a match for Fu Yantian, then even if Qing Shui were to die in battle, no one would step out to save him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui treated them was also because he hoped that they would help to take care of Yu Sunu, Qing Sha, and the others. He also hoped that the two would nurture them. However, this was not a purely interest-based relationship. There were more emotions added in. Even if they were not considered kin, they were not just friends.</p>
 <p>In Qing Shui's mind, he did not have many friends. Someone like Tian Jiange was only considered an ordinary friend.</p>
 <p>"Two sirs, I'll still have to head out. I hope that you'll be able to continue to take care of the few of them." Qing Shui drew back his needles and said with a smile.</p>
 <p>"Don't worry, we'll treat them like our own juniors. Ever since we attained physical strength, we've been very bored. We'll continue to pursue the path of Heaven Secrets Academy here and also help to manage the Heaven Secrets Academy," the old men said happily.</p>
 <p>"In the future, Heaven Secrets Academy, Putuo Mountain, and Lotus Sect would all appear in the other three continents. The two of you will forever be Heaven Secrets Academy's Headmasters," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>After his strength increased this time around, his mental state had also been elevated. He had his eyes set on the other three continents. He must definitely head over there and create a world for himself. Moreover, no matter who that lady was up against, he was going to help her and her Demon Lord Palace.</p>
 <p>Thinking of that cold and arrogant lady, that lady who was like a goddess, he felt warmth grow in his heart. In addition to that, he felt hints of worry. He decided to consider it as a debt that he owed her!</p>
