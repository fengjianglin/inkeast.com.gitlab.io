 <p><strong>AST 606 - Wang Clan As A Stepping Stone, Di Chen’s Intention (4)</strong></p>
 <p>“Madam Duanmu!”</p>
 <p>“Madam Duanmu!”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Everyone cried out in alarm and respectfully greeted her, except for Wang Delong. At this moment, his face had already turned ashen.</p>
 <p>The huge Ice Crane flew to Qing Shui’s side. Di Chen, Lan Tong, Tian Yuan, and the rest stood not far away, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant besides them.</p>
 <p>“What kind of benefits did the Wang Clan gave you? To think that there are actually so many people shamelessly going against my friend here. Say it out, I will give you two times, no three times the benefits. I hope that you will not interfere with the matters of today.” Madam Duanmu did not even bother to look at the surrounding people and just slowly walked to Qing Shui’s side.</p>
 <p>Her pleasing voice had an attractive quality to it, however, there was a trace of coldness to it!</p>
 <p>“I did not know that this sir was Madam Duanmu’s friends, I had earlier said that it was shameless for so many people to make things difficult for this little brother, consider my Li Clan to be in the wrong, I will make reparations to this little brother later.”</p>
 <p>“Brother Wang, I’m sorry, this brother has already done all that he can, I shall take my leave first!” The Old Man from the Li Clan rode on his mount and quickly departed. As for the rewards from Madam Duanmu, he had forgone it. What a joke, after making things difficult for her friend, if he still wanted some benefits wouldn’t that just be courting death?</p>
 <p>“Brother Wang, something urgent has cropped up at home, my great-granddaughter has been falling ill frequently recently. I have to take my leave first when I have time, I’ll come to look for brother to have some tea.” another old man said as he turned to leave even before he had even completed his sentence.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui watched as the man left, this person was lying brazenly. Urgent family matter? Great-granddaughter falling ill? Looking for him to drink tea when he was free? Who doesn’t know the matter today would not be left alone? This brazen lie of his truly required him to be shameless.</p>
 <p>Soon, everyone slowly left, leaving the five people on the Scarlet Eyed Snow Monarch Falcon from the Wang Clan and that robust middle-age man, the one with the surname Luo that had initially wanted everyone to deal with Qing Shui together.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that this man was very abominable, he felt that it was a good thing that he had stayed behind. Just when Qing Shui thought that, the man with the surname Luo faced the old man the Wang Clan and said: “Brother Wang, look at all the people you found, what….. what is this? Forget it, there is no need for me to be here……”</p>
 <p>After he said that, he quickly left as well. Qing Shui smiled at the sight of all these people. These were Wang Delong’s so-called friends. These ‘friends’ merely sought benefits and would abandon you at the moment there were any signs of trouble, unless there were some benefits that could attract them.</p>
 <p>Wang Delong was currently speechless, his face was a greenish-black with an expression of anger on it. If Madam Duanmu interfered, the Wang Clan would perish.</p>
 <p>“Haha, the Wang Clan is not something you, with the surname Qing, can deal with. Today, I was forced by the Duanmu Clan, when word of this is spread out, we would not be laughed at.” Wang Delong suddenly laughed when he looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked speechlessly at Wang Delong, this old man initially wanted to shamelessly attack him with a group. Now that a great power showed up to support Qing Shui, he tried to use his words to agitate Qing Shui. Even if he died, he probably wanted to drag Qing Shui down with him.</p>
 <p>“The Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord did not perish at the hands of the Qing Clan, instead it was the Duanmu Clan and the Nian Clan who eradicated them.” Wang Delong stated expressionlessly as he looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Aren’t you just saying all these to taunt me into battling you alone? Actually, even without you saying that, I would have done so. Furthermore, regardless of the winner, the Duanmu Clan and Nian Clan will not interfere.” Qing Shui smiled at Wang Delong, his expression was as though he was looking at a clown’s performance.</p>
 <p>“You are truly courageous young man, I did not misread read you.” an expression of joy appeared on Wang Delong’s face as he shamelessly praised Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, although he is a peak Grade Five Martial Saint, he has a special technique that could temporarily raise his strength to a Grade Six Martial Saint for one hour, are you still confident?” Madam Duanmu hurriedly asked Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui frowned, according to principle, a peak Grade Six Martial Saint should have the strength of 1200 countries. With his Emperor's Qi, he could reduce that strength by 240 countries, leaving behind only slightly more than 900 countries of strength.</p>
 <p>However, when Qing Shui held the Violet Gold Divine Shield and Big Dipper Sword, his strength could reach 960 countries. Most importantly, he still had other trump cards like Critical Damage, Demon Binding Ropes, and the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb.</p>
 <p>“En, there should be no problems.” Qing Shui nodded his head, he was grateful to Madam Duanmu for showing up earlier.</p>
 <p>Madam Duanmu frowned and thought for awhile, “Then please be careful!”</p>
 <p>“Thank you!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Nian Yuyang, who smiled and nodded his head at Qing Shui. Nian Yuyang had seen the battle Qing Shui had with the people of the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, he was confident in Qing Shui’s abilities.</p>
 <p>Wang Delong held a big green colored sword that seemed like a saber, it was at least three meters long and at least a foot wide, it emitted a faint green radiance and had a tyrannical aura.</p>
 <p>Wang Delong stood upright in the air and watched as Qing Shui slowly made his way towards him. He had hope in his heart, if he killed this young man today, he would be able to grasp his only chance of living.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was actually relaxed in his heart, the vigor in his body started to slowly press towards Wang Delong. The aura of the Nature Energy and the State of Immovable as Mountains caused Wang Delong to suddenly roar.</p>
 <p>It sounded like a desperate roar, then his originally short and round body actually grew by a foot after the roar and his whole body turned sturdy. He seemed like a different person from earlier, his muscles were like dragon whiskers, his eyes were blood-shot, they seemed strange, blood-thirsty, and berserk.</p>
 <p>Blood Surging Art!</p>
 <p>It causes the blood in the body to burn up, resulting in an increase in the body’s strength. This was a very tyrannical art but it couldn’t be sustained for long, or else there would be a big backlash on the body. Every use of this art had to be separated by a day at least, or the body would not be able to withstand it. This Blood Surging Art that Wang Delong cultivated was of the best grade, thus it did not have any weak phases, the only limit was that it could only be used once a day.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could feel the tyrannical strength from Wang Delong’s body, the strength of a Grade Six Martial Saint, only it was not the strength of 1200 countries but the strength of 1500 countries…...</p>
 <p>Could it be that after Grade Five Martial Saint, every grade differed by a strength of 500 countries? Although Qing Shui knew that breaking through from Grade Five Martial Saint to Grade Six Martial Saint was a big breaking point, but the difference in strength should not be that big!</p>
 <p>Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui directly used the Emperor's Qi to reduce Wang Delong’s strength to the Strength of 1200 Countries, Qing Shui was not worried because even when bare handed, he had the defense of 840 countries, if he included the defense of the Lunar Silk Shirt, he had the defense of 960 countries!</p>
 <p>If he used the Godly Armor Shield, as well as the Seven Star Armored Vest and the Divine Shield Talisman…… Just thinking of it made Qing Shui’s blood boil, his various skills and equipment were why Qing Shui felt confident in traveling around the Central Continent.</p>
 <p>The strong defense of his body means that even against a High Grade Martial Saint, he would not be defeated, the Godly Armor Shield could halve the damage of an attack, it was a pity that he could only use it once per day and it only lasted an hour each time. The Seven Star Armored Vest was similar. Under such a situation, Qing Shui felt that the Divine Shield Talisman in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal were really useful, as long as there were talismans available, they could be continuously used.</p>
 <p>Adding the 40% increase of defense by the Divine Shield Talisman and the 30% increase of defense by the Blue Lotus Art, Qing Shui could have the defense of 1170 countries……</p>
 <p>Thus Qing Shui temporarily did not use the Godly Armor Shield or the Seven Star Armored Vest, nor did he call out the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to battle. Or else, with the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s Vajra Subdues Demons and State of One with Elephant, his defense would be perversely strong. It was a pity that Qing Shui was lacking in offensive strength, but this could be remedied with Critical Damage.</p>
 <p>Wang Delong, who was weakened by Qing Shui, had an unsightly expression. His strength was weakened significantly, as the same time, he felt a great threat from Qing Shui’ aura.</p>
 <p>The humongous green saber in his hands slashed towards Qing Shui, a black shadow that seemed like a huge python rushed towards him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not dare to be careless, right now, his defense was still not sufficient to clash with his opponent’s attack. Even if they were the same, there would still be some damage, just that that damage would be insignificant. Furthermore, the strength of Qing Shui’s body would be about to negate some of the opponent’s attack, thus even if the attack of the opponent exceeded his defenses, it could not heavily injure him.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>There was a huge sound and an intense air could be felt from far away!</p>
 <p>Wang Delong’s eyes lit up, he could wield this power for an hour, furthermore, he could feel that Qing Shui’s attacking strength was not comparable to his but his defense seemed to be very strong.</p>
 <p>“Fury Chop!”</p>
 <p>Wang Delong loudly shouted and his body seemed to grow larger. He took a step towards Qing Shui and used the big saber in his hands to chop at Qing Shui, the huge blade shadow was like a blade of divine heavenly wrath chopping towards Qing Shui!</p>
 <p>Godly Armor Shield!</p>
 <p>Seven Star Armored Vest!</p>
 <p>Shield Attack!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui struck out with the Violet Gold Divine Shield in his hands and he used the Big Dipper Sword to support the Violet Gold Divine Shield from behind and ferociously struck out towards that huge blade shadow.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>A huge bang resounded and the Blade Qi splattered everywhere, the bright Blade Qi had a terrifying strength but it was soon dissipated. That sharp clash caused one’s scalp to go numb.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s body was knocked down by that chop but he used both his feet to try to forcefully skywalk in mid-air. Soon, he stopped his descent and quickly rushed back up again.</p>
 <p>Although the battle had just started, Qing Shui had learned quite a few things, This time Qing Shui used the Cloudmist Steps in midair and rushed at Wang Delong.</p>
 <p>He held the heavy Big Dipper Sword as though it was light as a feather and struck out with it!</p>
 <p>Sword of Fifth Wave!</p>
 <p>Art of Pursuing!</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s techniques were supportive, not only he could increase the strength of his body, he could weaken his opponent’s strength, increasing his own advantages.</p>
 <p>Bang Bang Bang……</p>
 <p>There were loud sounds and both Sword Qi and Blade Qi scattered. Qing Shui cautiously battled with Wang Delong. This kind of battle, a life and death battle, was one that tempered a person.</p>
 <p>Moon Slaughtering Chop!</p>
 <p>Once again, Qing Shui was knocked back, Wang Delong raised his big saber, the green big saber actually slowly turned milky white, it was incomparably strange. At the same time, strength frantically gathered towards it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that his move would be horrifying, even to the point that he felt that this move would be able to heavily injure him. Qing Shui forced himself calmed down.</p>
 <p>Madam Duanmu unconsciously clenched her fist in the distance, she even quietly took a step forward.</p>
 <p>Demon Binding Ropes!</p>
 <p>At the instant that Wang Delong was about to make a move, Qing Shui suddenly threw out the Demon Binding Ropes and tightly confined Wang Delong, causing him to not be able to move.</p>
 <p>Although it was only for a breath of time, this breath of time caused Wang Delong to lose control of the killing technique that he had been charging up for a period of time. The Moon Slaughtering Chop used a shocking amount of strength, he had already activated it but since he was trapped by the Demon Binding Ropes, he lost his opportunity to use it……</p>
 <p>Binding Talisman!</p>
 <p>Armor Break Talisman!</p>
 <p>A decrease of 40% of Wang Delong’s body’s defense!</p>
 <p>This caused Wang Delong’s defense to be lowered by 120 countries. The strength of 1500 countries raised by the art was already weakened to the strength of 1200 countries, now, his defense was further lowered by the strength of 120 countries.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui raised his speed to its peak, the Big Dipper Sword in his hands glowed like a morning star as he slashed at Wang Delong!</p>
 <p>Critical Damage!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui attacking strength was 960 countries, there was a difference of more than 100 countries, thus, he could ignore half of his opponent’s defense.</p>
