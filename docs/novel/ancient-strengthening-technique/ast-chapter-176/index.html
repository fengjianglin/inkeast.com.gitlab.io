  <p><strong>AST 176 If You have the Capability You Can Also Turn Me Into A Nymphomaniac For You</strong></p>
  <p>“Are you not arrogant enough already? Even I don’t dare to offend you.”</p>
  <p>After hearing Huoyun Liu-Li’s coquettish tone, Qing Shui felt that this woman in front of him was the most feminine out of all that he had come across.</p>
  <p>Before Qing Shui headed out, Huoyun Liu-Li passed him silver notes worth a million taels which caused him to be speechless. To think that she was so generous. Although he wanted her to give him more so that he could afford expensive items that he may take a liking to, he still did not expect that she would give him this much.</p>
  <p>“These are too much!” Qing Shui looked at the silver notes and smiled bitterly.</p>
  <p>“If I were to put the fruits you gave me in soups and sell them, I would only be giving you a small portion of the profit. I’m already not drawing a clear line with you, so why are you treating me like an outsider now?” Huoyun Liu-Li said mischievously as she pushed the silver notes into Qing Shui’s hands.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled bitterly at the huge stash of silver notes he ended up with.He couldn’t decide if she was understanding or quick-witted. He had already taken out 400 of the Drunken Fragrance Fruits.</p>
  <p>Due to the dramatic turn of events, Qing Shui stayed in the Earthly Paradise. When he had nothing to do, he would shop around in the vicinity, and especially at the auction hall. Although he had already patronized the auction hall a few times before, it was unfortunate that there were no rare items available.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui had bidded for an amulet, merely because it looked exactly the same as what he had remembered. It had an appearance of a golden lock with good workmanship. It was the lowest level ornament in the Western Fantasy, but its price was raised to 100,000 taels of silver here.</p>
  <p>Since his first visit, Qing Shui would always choose to go to the VIP rooms in order to avoid trouble.</p>
  <p>He still never had an opportunity to taste one of the uniformed ladies here, since Huoyun Liu-Li had a tendency of accompanying Qing Shui. Because of that, every time he visited here, he felt like he wasted 1,000 taels of silver. To be honest, Qing Shui had no interest in these ladies who had been through thousands or even ten thousands of men. However, it would still feel good to be able to enjoy a massage.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui had no use for the amulet since it was merely a golden longevity lock, but it still had &nbsp;good workmanship. It was too bad that he already had a moonstone around his neck given to him by his goddess-like master, which he could not bear to take down.</p>
  <p>“For you!” After he saw that there was nothing unique about the lock, he decided to just give it to Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
  <p>“For me?” Huoyun Liu-Li’s sexy and refined face was filled with surprise.</p>
  <p>Every time Qing Shui saw her face, he had an urge to touch it with his hands. Her eyes were very charming, and her nose was especially tall. When putting together her beautiful features with the luring small mouth of hers, there was a unique beauty to them.</p>
  <p>No wonder Young Master Pan had said that Wenren Wu-Shuang was not as attractive as her!</p>
  <p>“Do you like it?…You don’t like it?” Qing Shui’s hands awkwardly remained in the air. After all, it was only something that costed him 10,000 taels of silver. Perhaps it could be that she didn’t take a liking to his gifts.</p>
  <p>“I want you to put it on for me.” She said coquettishly.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was stunned for a moment before he put his hands through her black long hair towards the back of her neck. The distance between their faces was not even as big as a fist. Qing Shui could smell the fragrance of the air exhaled through her beautiful tall nose. He needed something here that could smoothen flawless skin to look more tenderly sparkling and translucent.</p>
  <p>While Qing Shui’s nose was not as tall and sexy as hers, it was upright. Therefore, their noses lightly brushed against each other’s.</p>
  <p>That moment was so wonderful that it was breathtaking, as if their hearts had collided. It was an exceptionally heart-throbbing moment. Qing Shui saw a slight dash of pink rising on her snow-white translucent skin. This gave her a greater magnificence upon a closer look.</p>
  <p>“Beautiful!” After Qing Shui saw Huoyun Liu-Li’s moving appearance and said gently.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was also feeling a bit distressed. Huoyun Liu-Li appeared as a strong-minded and cool woman who was similar to Shi Qingzhuang. In addition to her status and power, she was also well respected by everyone. Even some of those talented or self-proclaimed youths from a strong background in Cang Lang Country could not hide their inferiority. After all, they were not comparable to her in any aspects.</p>
  <p>She was a Xiantian cultivator who was also a peerless beauty; the owner of Earthly Paradise which rolled in a large amount of wealth daily. She also had the strongest master who doted and backed her up.</p>
  <p>Cang Lang Country’s leading lady, a beauty who was unmatched in her generation!</p>
  <p>It may be because of his first impression of her that Qing Shui had always treated Huoyun Liu-Li as an Elder Sister in the neighborhood. Moreover, he was also a Xiantian cultivator himself and had once even killed a grade 4 Xiantian Cultivator. After picking up the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm, his abilities had grown immensely. The display of the full prowess of the Second Wave was in no way weaker than the Tiger Tailwhip Kick.What was most important were Qing Shui’s thoughts, so he would not be intimidated by her presence.</p>
  <p>“Thank you!”</p>
  <p>“You’re welcome. If you find a guy you like in the future, you’ll have to return this golden lock to me.” Qing Shui laughed and said.</p>
  <p>When Huoyun Liu-Li heard the words ‘golden lock’, she was startled as she looked at Qing Shui. She had not thought about it too much at the start and only felt happy to receive a gift from Qing Shui. But now, she was at a loss.</p>
  <p>The world of the nine continents had a tradition. When both parties were engaged or promised to each other, the guy would gift the lady with a lock. The rich would gift golden locks, purple gold locks, or 3-colored rock locks. Even one from an ordinary household would gift a silver lock. These locks were used as a symbol. Once a lady revived a lock, it would mean that her heart belonged to that man. Therefore, it was also known as the Joint Heart Lock, which represented that the lady had someone she liked.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui had actually thought that this was an amulet instead of a lock. When both of them got their senses back, the golden lock was already tightly hanging around Huoyun Liu-Li’s neck.</p>
  <p>“Alright, let’s get going!” Huoyun Liu-Li tugged on the sleeves of Qing Shui who was in a daze. He could see her pink translucent earlobes from behind.</p>
  <p>Time passed very quickly, and one month was about to pass. Qing Shui had promised his goddess-like master that he would head back at least once a month!</p>
  <p>“I’ll be heading out for a few days but I will be back soon!” Qing Shui told Huoyun Liu-Li before he left.</p>
  <p>“Do you need my help?”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at this understanding lady and shook his head gently!</p>
  <p>Heading for the Skysword Sect for the second time, Qing Shui felt very peaceful. When Qing Shui headed up for the Skysword Sect in a purple suit, he realized that many people were staring at him in surprise. Their eyes were filled with perplexity.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui knew that they probably did not recognize him as a Protector. According to the rules of the Skysword Sect, everyone who was ranked lower than an Elder were required to wear clothes of a specific color. Each color represented their respective ranks. It was the first time Qing Shui had put on this suit of purple and he felt a little uneasy.</p>
  <p>“Since when our Skysword Sect have such a young Protector?”</p>
  <p>“This Protector is so unfamiliar. Which peak is he from?”</p>
  <p>“This Protector looks really charming. If only I can be together with him.” A young girl in a yellow dress looked intoxicatingly at Qing Shui as she mumbled.</p>
  <p>“Nymphomaniac!”</p>
  <p>“What’s wrong with being a nymphomaniac? If you have the capabilities, you can also turn me into a nymphomaniac for you, idiot!”</p>
  <p>The guy: “…”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was also speechless! Such audacity. One could really not judge a book by its cover.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, you’re back.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled to himself bitterly when he heard a familiar voice. He turned around to find the mature and seductive Zhu Qing smiling at him.</p>
  <p>“3rd Martial Aunt!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled and paid his respect as a junior!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at this seductive and seemingly submissive woman and recalled the event when she was rolling together with another lady in the cave. He still could not forget her cry that was full of elation and seductiveness!</p>
  <p>“You just came back? You can’t get up to Cloud Mist Peak right?” Zhu Qing blinked her eyes cutely while saying this.</p>
  <p>“That’s right. 3rd Martial Aunt, is Wu-Shuang at Zhu Qing Peak?” Thinking of how he had not met Wenren Wu-Shuang for a month, he immediately had a desire</p>
  <p>to see her since he came back.</p>
  <p>“Missing her since you haven’t seen her for the past month?” Zhu Qing smiled seductively, but Qing Shui felt very awkward. It was good that while he was not supportive of lesbians, he did not hate them that much. However, he still felt that it was strangely uncomfortable.</p>
  <p>“Alright, go look for her at Zhu Qing Peak. That lass also misses you!”</p>
  <p>“Thank you, 3rd Martial Aunt!” Qing Shui smiled and quickly left.</p>
  <p>Seeing how Qing Shui had left as if he was trying to escape, Zhu Qing was a bit perplexed. Was the love between males and females that good? Would sex between males and females feel very comfortable? Why did she hate men and was not even willing to let men touch her…?</p>
  <p>With Skysword Peak in the center, the other peaks were as if a myriad of stars were clustered around the moon as they surrounded the Skysword Peak. Only Cloud Mist Peak was not connected with the Skysword Peak, while all the other peaks were!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was aware of the route so he headed towards Zhu Qing Peak. It was just that when a guy reached the entrance of the Zhu Qing Peak, he would be stopped. If there were any other matters, the female disciples would take over.</p>
  <p>When they saw Qing Shui the Protector dressed in a purple suit, the eyes of the few ladies on guard duty lit up. There were even a few who recognized Qing Shui as their eyes were all shining.</p>
  <p>“You must be looking for Protector Wu-Shuang, please wait!”</p>
  <p>One of the ladies was unwillingly forced by the rest to leave.</p>
  <p>“Protector Qing Shui, my name is Juanjuan. If I see you in the future and talk to you, you can’t say that you don’t know me!” A round-faced lady smiled sweetly and said.</p>
  <p>“I’m Yuanyuan!”</p>
  <p>“I’m Najia!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui: “…”</p>
  <p>When Qing Shui saw Wenren Wu-Shuang coming, he quickly gave a smile to the few girls and quickly pulled Wu-Shuang away like he was escaping. This time, he really was escaping!</p>
  <p>When Wenren Wu-Shuang came out, she saw that Qing Shui was at a loss, surrounded by over 10 ladies. When he saw her, it was as if he had seen his savior. Wu-Shuang could not help but want to laugh.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, you must be feeling good. There are so many ladies trying to get close to you!”</p>
  <p>The two of them left Zhu Qing Peak and took a stroll in the quiet mountains. Wu-Shuang grinned and said.</p>
  <p>“Are you that happy?” Qing Shui looked at this beauty who enjoyed seeing him feeling awkward, and said gloomily.</p>
  <p>“Of course. You don’t know how cute you looked there.” After saying this, Wu-Shuang laughed out again. Her bright eyes, white teeth, and her poised aura, together with the purple dress she was wearing as a Protector, she exuded an intoxicating charm as she walked.</p>
  <p>“Cute?” Qing Shui was speechless since this was first time he received a compliment by a peerless beauty. He would prefer if she called him a beast.</p>
  <p>“We haven’t seen each other a month. Do you miss me?” Qing Shui grinned.</p>
  <p>“I don’t. Why would I miss you? You left for a month and did not even come to visit me.” Wu-Shuang said while looking at the mountains in the far distance and smiled.</p>
  <p>“I missed you a lot. It’s because that you’re here that I feel that this place is also familiar, amiable and a little bit warm!” Qing Shui looked at Wu-Shuang’s slender figure which was as elegant as ever. It was just that the peerless beauty had an additional melancholy which he could not decipher.</p>
  <p>Wu-Shuang trembled as she turned back to look at Qing Shui. She revealed a slight smile and said, “I missed you too and I am so happy to see you. I couldn’t get used to it when I would not see you for the past month. I don’t even know when I started feeling this way.”</p>
  <p>“Hehe, you’ll be my woman in the future after all. I will come back and spend some time with you for two days each month. During that time, you can torment me as you like. What do you think?” Qing Shui held onto Wu-Shuang’s tender hands.</p>
  <p>“Nothing good comes out from your mouth! Don’t you dare be rude to me, unless I allow it!” Wu-Shuang said coquettishly.</p>
  <p>“Alright, alright. In the future, I will definitely wait until our lady says ‘Qing Shui, I want it. Quickly be rude to me’ before I do anything.” Qing Shui grinned and said.</p>
  <p>“Pfft! When did you become such a scoundrel?”</p>
  <p>“If I wasn’t a scoundrel, would I be able to see this smile of yours that can cause the destruction &nbsp;of cities? Wu-Shuang, I like to see you smiling without a worry.” Qing Shui lightly held onto her hand and said.</p>
  <p>Time passed by very quickly. It was already noon when he came up, and now, the sun was slowly setting!</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, the snakeskin of the Golden-Ringed Snake King that you gave to that Skysword Sect had already been made into 320 pieces of light armors. Other than the 20 pieces which were left for your disposal, the rest had been used to form the 300 Golden-Ringed Snake Guard!</p>
  <p>“This name sounds quite suitable. Did you get one?” Qing Shui asked.</p>
  <p>“Protectors have no need for them, so they were mostly given to guards. Now, the guard’s powers should increase by quite a lot. The Golden-Ringed Snake Guards are all formed by the guards.”</p>
  <p>“It’s late. Let’s go back!” Wenren Wu-Shuang said when she realised that they had been walking for quite some time.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui nodded and headed back slowly towards the way they came from.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, do you miss home? I miss my elder sister.”</p>
  <p>“I do, but a man should set his aspiration high. I want to become a good man.” Qing Shui purposely sounded casual.</p>
  <p>“What an honorable phrase. I’ll meet this good man here today!” A resounding voice broke the silence in the vicinity!</p>

 <p>“These are too much!” Qing Shui looked at the silver notes and smiled bitterly.</p>
 <p>“If I were to put the fruits you gave me in soups and sell them, I would only be giving you a small portion of the profit. I’m already not drawing a clear line with you, so why are you treating me like an outsider now?” Huoyun Liu-Li said mischievously as she pushed the silver notes into Qing Shui’s hands.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled bitterly at the huge stash of silver notes he ended up with.He couldn’t decide if she was understanding or quick-witted. He had already taken out 400 of the Drunken Fragrance Fruits.</p>
 <p>Due to the dramatic turn of events, Qing Shui stayed in the Earthly Paradise. When he had nothing to do, he would shop around in the vicinity, and especially at the auction hall. Although he had already patronized the auction hall a few times before, it was unfortunate that there were no rare items available.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had bidded for an amulet, merely because it looked exactly the same as what he had remembered. It had an appearance of a golden lock with good workmanship. It was the lowest level ornament in the Western Fantasy, but its price was raised to 100,000 taels of silver here.</p>
 <p>Since his first visit, Qing Shui would always choose to go to the VIP rooms in order to avoid trouble.</p>
 <p>He still never had an opportunity to taste one of the uniformed ladies here, since Huoyun Liu-Li had a tendency of accompanying Qing Shui. Because of that, every time he visited here, he felt like he wasted 1,000 taels of silver. To be honest, Qing Shui had no interest in these ladies who had been through thousands or even ten thousands of men. However, it would still feel good to be able to enjoy a massage.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had no use for the amulet since it was merely a golden longevity lock, but it still had &nbsp;good workmanship. It was too bad that he already had a moonstone around his neck given to him by his goddess-like master, which he could not bear to take down.</p>
 <p>“For you!” After he saw that there was nothing unique about the lock, he decided to just give it to Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
 <p>“For me?” Huoyun Liu-Li’s sexy and refined face was filled with surprise.</p>
 <p>Every time Qing Shui saw her face, he had an urge to touch it with his hands. Her eyes were very charming, and her nose was especially tall. When putting together her beautiful features with the luring small mouth of hers, there was a unique beauty to them.</p>
 <p>No wonder Young Master Pan had said that Wenren Wu-Shuang was not as attractive as her!</p>
 <p>“Do you like it?…You don’t like it?” Qing Shui’s hands awkwardly remained in the air. After all, it was only something that costed him 10,000 taels of silver. Perhaps it could be that she didn’t take a liking to his gifts.</p>
 <p>“I want you to put it on for me.” She said coquettishly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned for a moment before he put his hands through her black long hair towards the back of her neck. The distance between their faces was not even as big as a fist. Qing Shui could smell the fragrance of the air exhaled through her beautiful tall nose. He needed something here that could smoothen flawless skin to look more tenderly sparkling and translucent.</p>
 <p>While Qing Shui’s nose was not as tall and sexy as hers, it was upright. Therefore, their noses lightly brushed against each other’s.</p>
 <p>That moment was so wonderful that it was breathtaking, as if their hearts had collided. It was an exceptionally heart-throbbing moment. Qing Shui saw a slight dash of pink rising on her snow-white translucent skin. This gave her a greater magnificence upon a closer look.</p>
 <p>“Beautiful!” After Qing Shui saw Huoyun Liu-Li’s moving appearance and said gently.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was also feeling a bit distressed. Huoyun Liu-Li appeared as a strong-minded and cool woman who was similar to Shi Qingzhuang. In addition to her status and power, she was also well respected by everyone. Even some of those talented or self-proclaimed youths from a strong background in Cang Lang Country could not hide their inferiority. After all, they were not comparable to her in any aspects.</p>
 <p>She was a Xiantian cultivator who was also a peerless beauty; the owner of Earthly Paradise which rolled in a large amount of wealth daily. She also had the strongest master who doted and backed her up.</p>
 <p>Cang Lang Country’s leading lady, a beauty who was unmatched in her generation!</p>
 <p>It may be because of his first impression of her that Qing Shui had always treated Huoyun Liu-Li as an Elder Sister in the neighborhood. Moreover, he was also a Xiantian cultivator himself and had once even killed a grade 4 Xiantian Cultivator. After picking up the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm, his abilities had grown immensely. The display of the full prowess of the Second Wave was in no way weaker than the Tiger Tailwhip Kick.What was most important were Qing Shui’s thoughts, so he would not be intimidated by her presence.</p>
 <p>“Thank you!”</p>
 <p>“You’re welcome. If you find a guy you like in the future, you’ll have to return this golden lock to me.” Qing Shui laughed and said.</p>
 <p>When Huoyun Liu-Li heard the words ‘golden lock’, she was startled as she looked at Qing Shui. She had not thought about it too much at the start and only felt happy to receive a gift from Qing Shui. But now, she was at a loss.</p>
 <p>The world of the nine continents had a tradition. When both parties were engaged or promised to each other, the guy would gift the lady with a lock. The rich would gift golden locks, purple gold locks, or 3-colored rock locks. Even one from an ordinary household would gift a silver lock. These locks were used as a symbol. Once a lady revived a lock, it would mean that her heart belonged to that man. Therefore, it was also known as the Joint Heart Lock, which represented that the lady had someone she liked.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had actually thought that this was an amulet instead of a lock. When both of them got their senses back, the golden lock was already tightly hanging around Huoyun Liu-Li’s neck.</p>
 <p>“Alright, let’s get going!” Huoyun Liu-Li tugged on the sleeves of Qing Shui who was in a daze. He could see her pink translucent earlobes from behind.</p>
 <p>Time passed very quickly, and one month was about to pass. Qing Shui had promised his goddess-like master that he would head back at least once a month!</p>
 <p>“I’ll be heading out for a few days but I will be back soon!” Qing Shui told Huoyun Liu-Li before he left.</p>
 <p>“Do you need my help?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at this understanding lady and shook his head gently!</p>
 <p>Heading for the Skysword Sect for the second time, Qing Shui felt very peaceful. When Qing Shui headed up for the Skysword Sect in a purple suit, he realized that many people were staring at him in surprise. Their eyes were filled with perplexity.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that they probably did not recognize him as a Protector. According to the rules of the Skysword Sect, everyone who was ranked lower than an Elder were required to wear clothes of a specific color. Each color represented their respective ranks. It was the first time Qing Shui had put on this suit of purple and he felt a little uneasy.</p>
 <p>“Since when our Skysword Sect have such a young Protector?”</p>
 <p>“This Protector is so unfamiliar. Which peak is he from?”</p>
 <p>“This Protector looks really charming. If only I can be together with him.” A young girl in a yellow dress looked intoxicatingly at Qing Shui as she mumbled.</p>
 <p>“Nymphomaniac!”</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong with being a nymphomaniac? If you have the capabilities, you can also turn me into a nymphomaniac for you, idiot!”</p>
 <p>The guy: “…”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was also speechless! Such audacity. One could really not judge a book by its cover.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, you’re back.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled to himself bitterly when he heard a familiar voice. He turned around to find the mature and seductive Zhu Qing smiling at him.</p>
 <p>“3rd Martial Aunt!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and paid his respect as a junior!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at this seductive and seemingly submissive woman and recalled the event when she was rolling together with another lady in the cave. He still could not forget her cry that was full of elation and seductiveness!</p>
 <p>“You just came back? You can’t get up to Cloud Mist Peak right?” Zhu Qing blinked her eyes cutely while saying this.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. 3rd Martial Aunt, is Wu-Shuang at Zhu Qing Peak?” Thinking of how he had not met Wenren Wu-Shuang for a month, he immediately had a desire</p>
 <p>to see her since he came back.</p>
 <p>“Missing her since you haven’t seen her for the past month?” Zhu Qing smiled seductively, but Qing Shui felt very awkward. It was good that while he was not supportive of lesbians, he did not hate them that much. However, he still felt that it was strangely uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>“Alright, go look for her at Zhu Qing Peak. That lass also misses you!”</p>
 <p>“Thank you, 3rd Martial Aunt!” Qing Shui smiled and quickly left.</p>
 <p>Seeing how Qing Shui had left as if he was trying to escape, Zhu Qing was a bit perplexed. Was the love between males and females that good? Would sex between males and females feel very comfortable? Why did she hate men and was not even willing to let men touch her…?</p>
 <p>With Skysword Peak in the center, the other peaks were as if a myriad of stars were clustered around the moon as they surrounded the Skysword Peak. Only Cloud Mist Peak was not connected with the Skysword Peak, while all the other peaks were!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was aware of the route so he headed towards Zhu Qing Peak. It was just that when a guy reached the entrance of the Zhu Qing Peak, he would be stopped. If there were any other matters, the female disciples would take over.</p>
 <p>When they saw Qing Shui the Protector dressed in a purple suit, the eyes of the few ladies on guard duty lit up. There were even a few who recognized Qing Shui as their eyes were all shining.</p>
 <p>“You must be looking for Protector Wu-Shuang, please wait!”</p>
 <p>One of the ladies was unwillingly forced by the rest to leave.</p>
 <p>“Protector Qing Shui, my name is Juanjuan. If I see you in the future and talk to you, you can’t say that you don’t know me!” A round-faced lady smiled sweetly and said.</p>
 <p>“I’m Yuanyuan!”</p>
 <p>“I’m Najia!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui: “…”</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw Wenren Wu-Shuang coming, he quickly gave a smile to the few girls and quickly pulled Wu-Shuang away like he was escaping. This time, he really was escaping!</p>
 <p>When Wenren Wu-Shuang came out, she saw that Qing Shui was at a loss, surrounded by over 10 ladies. When he saw her, it was as if he had seen his savior. Wu-Shuang could not help but want to laugh.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, you must be feeling good. There are so many ladies trying to get close to you!”</p>
 <p>The two of them left Zhu Qing Peak and took a stroll in the quiet mountains. Wu-Shuang grinned and said.</p>
 <p>“Are you that happy?” Qing Shui looked at this beauty who enjoyed seeing him feeling awkward, and said gloomily.</p>
 <p>“Of course. You don’t know how cute you looked there.” After saying this, Wu-Shuang laughed out again. Her bright eyes, white teeth, and her poised aura, together with the purple dress she was wearing as a Protector, she exuded an intoxicating charm as she walked.</p>
 <p>“Cute?” Qing Shui was speechless since this was first time he received a compliment by a peerless beauty. He would prefer if she called him a beast.</p>
 <p>“We haven’t seen each other a month. Do you miss me?” Qing Shui grinned.</p>
 <p>“I don’t. Why would I miss you? You left for a month and did not even come to visit me.” Wu-Shuang said while looking at the mountains in the far distance and smiled.</p>
 <p>“I missed you a lot. It’s because that you’re here that I feel that this place is also familiar, amiable and a little bit warm!” Qing Shui looked at Wu-Shuang’s slender figure which was as elegant as ever. It was just that the peerless beauty had an additional melancholy which he could not decipher.</p>
 <p>Wu-Shuang trembled as she turned back to look at Qing Shui. She revealed a slight smile and said, “I missed you too and I am so happy to see you. I couldn’t get used to it when I would not see you for the past month. I don’t even know when I started feeling this way.”</p>
 <p>“Hehe, you’ll be my woman in the future after all. I will come back and spend some time with you for two days each month. During that time, you can torment me as you like. What do you think?” Qing Shui held onto Wu-Shuang’s tender hands.</p>
 <p>“Nothing good comes out from your mouth! Don’t you dare be rude to me, unless I allow it!” Wu-Shuang said coquettishly.</p>
 <p>“Alright, alright. In the future, I will definitely wait until our lady says ‘Qing Shui, I want it. Quickly be rude to me’ before I do anything.” Qing Shui grinned and said.</p>
 <p>“Pfft! When did you become such a scoundrel?”</p>
 <p>“If I wasn’t a scoundrel, would I be able to see this smile of yours that can cause the destruction &nbsp;of cities? Wu-Shuang, I like to see you smiling without a worry.” Qing Shui lightly held onto her hand and said.</p>
 <p>Time passed by very quickly. It was already noon when he came up, and now, the sun was slowly setting!</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, the snakeskin of the Golden-Ringed Snake King that you gave to that Skysword Sect had already been made into 320 pieces of light armors. Other than the 20 pieces which were left for your disposal, the rest had been used to form the 300 Golden-Ringed Snake Guard!</p>
 <p>“This name sounds quite suitable. Did you get one?” Qing Shui asked.</p>
 <p>“Protectors have no need for them, so they were mostly given to guards. Now, the guard’s powers should increase by quite a lot. The Golden-Ringed Snake Guards are all formed by the guards.”</p>
 <p>“It’s late. Let’s go back!” Wenren Wu-Shuang said when she realised that they had been walking for quite some time.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded and headed back slowly towards the way they came from.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, do you miss home? I miss my elder sister.”</p>
 <p>“I do, but a man should set his aspiration high. I want to become a good man.” Qing Shui purposely sounded casual.</p>
 <p>“What an honorable phrase. I’ll meet this good man here today!” A resounding voice broke the silence in the vicinity!</p>
