 <p><strong>AST 1429 - Fighting, Qing Shui’s Battle, The Powerful Formation Eye Stone</strong></p>
 <p>Upon hearing the old man’s words, Qing Shui smiled, “Naturally, I also won’t hold back.”</p>
 <p>A green and sharp pitchfork appeared in the elderly man’s hand. It was abundant with spiritual qi. One could tell at a glance that it was not an ordinary weapon. He swung it and charged his way towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Seal of Xuantian!</p>
 <p>The Seal of Xuantian today was incomparable to the ones in the past. It heavily struck the elderly man who was charging his way here. The old man who got struck was stunned.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Step!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was already extremely skillful with his Nine Palace Step. As soon as his figure moved, he immediately disappeared and appeared beside the elderly man.</p>
 <p>The elderly man also reacted very quickly. The green pitchfork in his hand stabbed at Qing Shui with great force. It was fast and merciless. Just as it was about to pierce Qing Shui, a green Jade flame shot out of it.</p>
 <p>As soon as Qing Shui moved his legs, he strangely appeared near the old man. It was suicide to compete with Qing Shui in body motions.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Finger!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not want to waste his time. By quickly taking down his opponents, it could help boost his team’s morale. It also caused the opponents to feel pressured. It was certain that this old man possessed formidable strength among those people. Killing him would bring forth great pressure to the opponents.</p>
 <p>Peng!</p>
 <p>First finger! Qing Shui poked it at the old man’s arm. It almost caused the old man to drop his weapon out of his hand.</p>
 <p>The expression on the elderly man’s face looked really heavy. Immediately, his feet started to look less discernible. Jade-colored flames was flaring on top of his green colored pitchfork, looking like a fearsome dragon snake.</p>
 <p>After that first finger, Qing Shui straightforwardly swung his arm. A Primordial Flame Dragon condensed from it.</p>
 <p>Spirit Snake Exits Cave!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately used the Snake Elephant’s Movement. Combined with Qing Shui’s terrifying speed, it had become a formidable, sure-kill technique. At least, they were formidable to the elderly men here.</p>
 <p>The Phoenix Battle Intent and Heavenly Talisman had already boosted Qing Shui’s strength by 20%. They were now worth almost thirty million sun.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>A loud and clear noise was heard as the elderly man immediately got thrashed out. However, this was only his first whip. Qing Shui subsequently let out his Heavenly Dao pressure. Since he was also more powerful than his opponents, Qing Shui was too lazy to even use the Emperor’s Qi and the Heavenly Talisman, which weakened the opponents.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui stopped, only ten breaths had elapsed before the opponents were already at their last. It was very tough for them to survive this.</p>
 <p>Cheering emerged immediately from the side of Demon Lord’s Palace. Dragon Palace, on the other hand, were more silent. However, the elderly man from before came out with a smile, “I really didn’t realize that you were quite strong. Alright, set up your formation. I will break it.”</p>
 <p>Regarding this point, the elderly man was really honest about it. Rather, this was his confidence.</p>
 <p>Devil Slaying Battle blood Formation!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately made Battle Pavilion set up the Devil Slaying Battle Blood Formation which they had practiced for a relatively short time.</p>
 <p>Zhan Yu was no longer able to give out orders. Hence, Qing Shui treated Zhan Yu. Let alone both Qing Shui and the elderly man were competing against each other’s formations. As for Demon Tribe and Hua Rumei, he didn’t send them here. There were still the people from Cotton Hall here. The opponents had huge armies, if Qing Shui was to send out everyone here, it’s likely that the opponents would do the same.</p>
 <p>If there were not many people on his side, even if the opponents were to send out a lot of people, they would only send out the amount of people which only slightly outnumbered that of their enemy’s side. Besides, the number of people was only one of the determinants in the battle.</p>
 <p>“Alright, you guys can start your assault now.” Qing Shui hinted the old man that he could now make his move.</p>
 <p>The battle from before was already considered to have upset both side, especially the people from Dragon Palace. During this time, Qing Shui had also already probed the strength of the opponents who showed up. None of them were weaker than the Demon Lord. But compared to her, they came in short in terms of powerful weapons and the fearsome old turtle.</p>
 <p>Merely the front already had almost ten experts. However, there were five who went on to attack Qing Shui’s formation. Actually, there were also quite a lot of experts from Demon King Palace. Zhan Yu might have been injured in Battle Pavilion, but there were still two people who, though not as strong as Zhan Yu, were still powerful. They had already gained as much strength as twenty thousand sun. There were 12 branches in Demon King Palace. Counting it down, there were still those Elder Associations or even some of the well hidden warriors. All in all, the strength of Demon King Palace was still really powerful. When time had come to show up, not many of them would come. This was Demon King’s Palace confidence.</p>
 <p>Battle Pavilion was standing in a somewhat strange position mid-air. A blood-colored aura with pure strength contained within it began to scatter around the area, seeming as if it was a whole. Thread after thread of bloody strength mixed into the centre part of Qing Shui’s body.</p>
 <p>The people from Dragon Palace stopped not far away from Devil Slaying Battle Blood Formation. After that, they quickly set up their formations. In just a short while, they had already finished setting it up. Even Qing Shui was shocked about it.</p>
 <p>Ultimate Formation!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also knew about this formation. This formation had another name. It was known as the Buddha Formation, used specifically to restrain certain bloody demonic formations. If it had been the Battle Blood Formation, it was very likely that it would have been restrained completely. It seemed that the Dragon Palace has truly aimed their sight at Demon Lord Palace for a long time.</p>
 <p>But now, the Battle Blood Formation has been mixed with the Devil Slaying Formation. It was no longer something which the old Battle Blood Formation could compare against. It’s only downfall was that they had only practiced it for a short period of time.</p>
 <p>“Everyone, stay cool. Operate it like how you usually do.” Qing Shui said gently to assure the heart of the people around him. It was so that they would not feel too pressured and nervous.</p>
 <p>Ultimate Light!</p>
 <p>The old man yelled. A layer of light spread out like waves from the Ultimate Formation. It was mainly spreading towards the people from Demon Lord Palace.</p>
 <p>“Don’t block it!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui yelled. This kind of light specifically aimed at evil spirits and heretics. The more one tried to block it, the more powerful it would become. It’s best to not block it. Besides, the Devil Slaying Qi of the formation was also able to block some of them.</p>
 <p>Ultimate Slash!</p>
 <p>The old man once again yelled. After that, he condensed a battle sword on top. The battle sword was really huge. When looked carefully, it looked really similar to a dragon. After that, he violently charged himself towards Qing Shui with the sword in hand.</p>
 <p>Devil Slaying Sword!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui condensed the strength which he gathered into a bloody red colored long sword. It was so sharp, it seemed like it could cut through the sky itself.</p>
 <p>Hong!</p>
 <p>The Devil Slaying Sword clashed against the Huge Dragon Battle Sword. The collision gave out a heavy and depressing noise. An energy visible by the naked eye caused chaos to the air around the area. It disrupted even the five elements themselves.</p>
 <p>After holding it on for the span of a few breathes and clashing with each other for no less than a thousand times, the energy disappeared. Even the formation has been influenced to a certain extent. It was powerful to use these kinds of attacks in the formation. Unfortunately, it could not last long. Hence, it was best to settle the battle fast while using this kind of formations to attack. Otherwise, the only outcome which awaited them would either be both sides being exhausted or both sides being severely injured.</p>
 <p>Despite the huge amount of people Dragon Palace had, they did not manage to take even the slightest advantage. This has caused the old man to reveal a weird expression. However, Qing Shui was the only one who was aware of what was going on.</p>
 <p>Formation Eye Stone!</p>
 <p>The current Formation Eye Stone could raise up the strength of the formation and Nine Palace Steps by two times. This was indeed a fearsome existence, so even if Dragon Palace had twice the amount of people and strength, they could at most only end things with a draw.</p>
 <p>The people from Battle Pavilion were really upset. They suddenly felt really powerful within the formation, their strength increased significantly, but these weren’t individual strength boost. It only raised the strength of the formation by two times, not the strength of each of the individuals within the formation by two times.</p>
 <p>This was also why Qing Shui was confident in competing with them in formations.</p>
 <p>The Demon Lord also revealed a shocked expression. Qing Shui’s abilities in formations were too strong. It was so strong to the point it has become unpredictable, so much so that it has become a bit unbelievable. Obviously, they stood at a disadvantage in terms of manpower, but merely one formation has actually managed to make them so much stronger. From what everyone had witnessed, they were already able to hold their own against the strength of so many people from Dragon Palace. If they were to truly engage in a fight, Demon Lord was aware that the Dragon Palace would definitely not be a match against them.</p>
 <p>Second Rites, Forceful Kill!</p>
 <p>As the elderly man waved his hand, the formation abruptly turned into two huge dragons and charged towards the Devil Slaying Battle Blood Formation.</p>
 <p>Fourth Division, Bloody Kill!</p>
 <p>This was the sure kill technique of Devil Slaying Formation. The people all around immediately gathered together into “Four Divisions. Looking at it roughly, it was the form of the Ancient Divine Beast. It was only a sort of form, but it possessed formidable strength. They each paired up in two as they charged towards their opponents.</p>
 <p>The confrontation this time has led on to a series of massacres. Qing Shui was going along with the formation. Each time he held up his hand, a golden sword would be unleashed. The Golden Sword was extremely fast and sharp. Each time Qing Shui swung it, it would take away one life, or at the very least, it would severely injure the victim. Something worth noting was that the spot where Qing Shui stood on was the eye of the formation, therefore each of his abilities would receive significant boost.</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately unleashed the Emperor’s Qi twice in a row at the enemies opposite him. This time, the strength of the people standing against the people from his side would have been reduced significantly. The enemies has experienced a reduction in strength whereas the people from his side, under the influence of Phoenix Battle Intent, managed to experience boost in strength. Not only that, but the effect of the Formation Eye Stone also contributed to it.</p>
 <p>Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui noticed that the two formidable old men were about to make their moves and immediately unleashed his Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines.</p>
 <p>Not only had the strength of the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines been increased greatly, the time at which it could be used has now been reduced greatly.</p>
 <p>Two enormous Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines soared up high into the sky at the same time. They surrounded a lot of people in them.</p>
 <p>Ultimate Golden Light Slash!</p>
 <p>Perhaps because the old man has gotten frustrated battling Qing Shui, he clenched his teeth and yelled out loudly.</p>
 <p>On top of the formation which the elderly man was at, a large golden buddha was condensed. The golden buddha was really large. Furthermore, it had three heads and six arms. Its entire body resembled that of a Vajrapani.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, an enormous spinning Buddha was charging its way towards Qing Shui. For a moment, the entire area fell into a complete mess. Very quickly, almost ten people got twisted by it and vanished on the spot.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui witnessed the whole thing. He quickly summoned the Nine Continents Mountain and collided it against the Buddha. Qing Shui felt really uncomfortable as a result of losing around ten people from Battle Pavilion.</p>
 <p>Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm! Lotus Seal!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was aware that he could only use Mental Energy to counter, block or return energy attacks like these. The Nine Continents Mountain was an exception. Despite it being a physical attack, it could still be struck against Spirit Energy Attack. This was why it was a Supreme Treasure.</p>
 <p>Luckily, it dissipated very quickly.</p>
 <p>The massacre from below has become even more bloody!</p>
 <p>“Die! Violent King Strike!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, an elderly man unleashed a Sure Kill Heavenly Technique at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>It was a tyrannical and enormous fist seal. It was emitting intense surging aura.</p>
 <p>Beng!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui clenched his teeth and took the initiative to rise up. He was running short of time. The only way he could counter it was by quickly moving the Nine Continents Mountain in front of him to block it. A loud noise rung. Qing Shui immediately got blown outwards.</p>
 <p>But the opponent has underestimated Qing Shui’s defense. The Paragon Golden Armor has enabled Qing Shui to easily fend off attacks like this.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was trying his hardest!</p>
 <p>Paragon Strike!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately thrusted out a punch towards the elderly man.</p>
 <p>Hong!</p>
 <p>The elderly man died. Even the group of people around him had not managed to escape their fate of death.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Step!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s figure swiftly whipped to the frontline.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Finger!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly unleashed the technique with both of his hands. He was enraged by the ten or more casualties the Battle Pavilion had suffered. He was unleashing Phoenix Fingers at a very fast speed. Each and every one of them could cause fatal injuries.</p>
