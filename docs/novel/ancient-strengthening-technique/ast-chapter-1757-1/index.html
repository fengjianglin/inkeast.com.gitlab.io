 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“Well, I can clearly say that I am not one of those which you just mentioned. I am only curious about you.” Muyun Qingge was a bit shy when she said it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“If things are really as you say, then wouldn’t that mean things would be dangerous for you? Could it be that… You have fallen for me?” Qing Shui smiled and looked at Muyun Qingge.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Upon hearing what Qing Shui said, Muyun Qingge immediately blushed, “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? As if I would fall for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“You don’t have to be so embarrassed about it. It’s perfectly normal for a woman to start seeking a man at a certain point in their life. Be it, men or women, they are born with emotions.” Qing Shui said in a serious tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“You are the one seeking for women!…... And you are the one who is born with emotions!” For a moment, Muyun Qingge felt extremely embarrassed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No men had ever said things like that to her throughout her whole life. Her face instantly turned red. She didn’t know what to do, even her heartbeat has gotten many times faster. She didn't dare to look at Qing Shui, yet she continuously hammered Qing Shui’s chest with her fist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Seeing her like that, Qing Shui felt that this could possibly be one of the happiest moment in his life. It was a kind of happiness which came deep down from one’s heart. The scene he was seeing at the moment was the most beautiful scenes to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;At the moment when Muyun Qingge stopped, she realized that she was already hugging Qing Shui’s neck with her head buried in Qing Shui’s chest. Qing Shui on the other hand already had his hands around her waist. But he didn’t actually do anything that’s beyond the line.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She lifted her head and looked at Qing Shui. The only thing she saw was a warm smile. Also, she felt a kind of peace which words couldn’t describe. He wasn’t her blood-relative, but deep down, she has started treating him like one.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;This was also why she would have some close interactions with him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qingge, before you get married, treat me like your own man. You don’t have to be so formal with me.” At the moment when Qing Shui finished speaking, he felt a bit awkward. Despite everything, he never once thought about anything that’s too excessive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In response, Muyun Qingge happily lifted up her head, “I won’t be so formal around you, but you mustn’t bully me. I still plan on getting married.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Qing Shui nodded. For some unknown reason, he felt a bit upset. This kind of feeling made him realize that he was very possessive. Prior to this, the reason why he never did anything to her, was because she has been single her whole life, but now that he heard, that she planned on getting married, he felt a bit uncomfortable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Qing Shui looked at the ring he gave her, which he once used to wear for a long time. Be it his past or current life, in both the world, a ring was considered to be a symbol to pledge one’s love. Back then, when he was handing her the ring, she had already hesitated for a while. But she actually stretched her hand out and let Qing Shui put it into her finger. ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;On the second day, Qing Shui immediately entered the boundless mountain regions with Muyun Qingge. After continuous uses of the Nine Continents Step Effect, they found themselves deep inside the mountain regions. Qing Shui’s current Nine Continents Step enabled him to travel millions of Lis in one go. But even after using it a hundred times, he was still unable to go out of this mountain regions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This vastness of this world wasn’t something which could be described in words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were also villages as well as castles across the mountain regions. Some of the mountain regions were flattened to build castles on it. Certainly, there were also the earth and the sky as a part of the scenery. But when he looked from far away, the only thing that could be seen, was the boundless mountain regions. Only those who actually went into the region would learn, that there were also sects, aristocrats as well as dynasties in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;However, the deeper one advanced into the region, the fewer people they would find. This was near the bottom of the sea. Deep within it, there would be even more ferocious beasts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, the Sacred Ocean Sound Cave should be somewhere around here. I wonder if that place will be easy to look for.” Muyun Qingge followed Qing Shui as they continued to search for the place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“The Sacred Ocean Sound Cave is located even deeper within the inner ocean. The area we need to look for is quite large. Let’s just continue searching for it.” Qing Shui was also a bit puzzled, after all, the target area was too large. Though it wasn’t to the extent like he was searching for a needle in the ocean, it was still considerably hard to find.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Yet another half a day passed. According to what’s shown on the map, they should be quite close to the destination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“Hm, Qing Shui, try sensing the aura around you, I feel something.” Muyun Qingge smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Qing Shui also managed to sense some sacred aura. Though it was just a tiny bit of it, the aura was thick and strong. Qing Shui immediately told Muyun Qingge, “We should be able to find the Sacred Ocean Sound Cave if we follow this aura.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;They spent hours continuously drifting back and forth the mountain. After that, they immediately traveled in a straight line across the air. Upon seeing what’s in front of them, they were shocked. As it seemed, this place was an ocean that’s in the middle of an ocean.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an area of ocean domains. There was yet another sea at the bottom of the ocean. The water here was even clearer. Furthermore, they also gave out powerful and sacred aura. If it’s not mistaken, this place should be the Sacred Ocean.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Sacred Ocean, the Sacred Ocean Sound Cave should be around here somewhere.” Qing Shui was examining the surroundings. In the distance, there was an unusually tall mountain. The sacred aura which it was giving out attracted Qing Shui’s attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The Sacred Mountain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The tall and elegant-looking mountain peak, the powerful aura which it was emitting was comparable to the whole Sacred Ocean! Legend said, that the Sacred Ocean was the backyard of the Sacred Mountain. From the way it seemed, the Sacred Ocean Sound Cave should be within the Sacred Ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“That should be the Sacred Mountain, do you think we should greet the people of Sacred Mountain since we are in the Sacred Ocean?” Qing Shui asked Muyun Qingge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Actually, he was aware that the people from Sacred Mountain might not allow them into the Sacred Ocean Sound Cave once they greeted them. But if they were noticed without greeting them first, things also wouldn’t seem that great.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“We might not be allowed into the cave if we greet them. We can try going down first. If we really are noticed, we can use the excuse that we are not aware of the existence of the Sacred Mountain.” Muyun Qingge said after a moment of thought.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“Yes, as it seemed, Qingge is indeed a cunning person. Alright then, I will do as you say.” Qing Shui nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“Just die already.” Muyun Qingge was speechless. As of now, she was also unclear about her feeling right now. It’s not anger, she just behaved this way because she couldn’t stand it. She felt this way whenever he was in front of her…… In fact, she didn’t even know how to express it… Basically, she felt like a woman in front of him.</span></p>

For the sake of not getting caught, Qing Shui immediately used the Nine Continents Step. However, the distance traveled was insignificant. Qing Shui followed along the direction with the most abundant Spiritual Qi. He felt that the Sacred Ocean Sound Cave should be one of the places with the most abundant Spiritual Qi.&nbsp;</span></p>

However, the distance he traveled each time was very insignificant. It should only be around twenty million Li.&nbsp;</span></p>

He couldn’t help but said it out.&nbsp;</span></p>

There were a huge number of them. Even medicinal herbs with the age of a few hundred thousand or millions of years were quite common around here.&nbsp;</span></p>

After that, he immediately threw them into the realm. For all he knew, he might be able to find a few life-saving herbs even if he couldn’t manage to find the Sacred Mudra Flower.</span></p>

Actually, Qing Shui was also unaware of it, with his powerful Spiritual Sense he followed along the sacred aura and entered the Sacred Ocean Sound Cave. The entire sacred aura of the Sacred Ocean originated from this enormous stone cave. Hence, the medicinal herbs here were aged around a hundred thousand, or even millions of years. Actually, it hasn’t been around for that long. But the medical effect could stand up to the equivalent age stated.</span></p>

There was, however, a huge pond of milky white liquid. They were emitting powerful Spiritual Qi. Qing Shui then lifted up his head only to find that just like before, the entire place seems to be boundless. Similarly, the roof around this area was also very very tall.&nbsp;</span></p>
