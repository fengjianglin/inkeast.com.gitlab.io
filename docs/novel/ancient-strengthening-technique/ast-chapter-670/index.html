 <p><strong>AST 670 - Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death (8)</strong></p>
 <p>The black-haired man was able to sense the strength of the old man, who found himself in a perilous situation after he was weakened by Qing Shui. Now, he saw Qing Shui ferociously pouncing towards Qianxi Hu. Qing Shui's speed, who had swallowed the Gale Pellet, was not fast only in the regular meaning of the word.</p>
 <p>Zi Zi!</p>
 <p>Ji Ji!</p>
 <p>The Six-Eared Poisonous Heavenly Mouse and the two Icy Martens ferociously pounced towards Qing Shui, their speed was inconceivably fast. Qing Shui saw them out of the corner of his eyes. Earlier, he was quite puzzled about how could the Six-Eared Poisonous Heavenly Mouse and the two Icy Martens Skywalk despite not being Martial Saints. The Phantom Fire Wolf was a mutated beast, although it did not have wings and wasn't a Martial Saint, it could Skywalk at an incredible speed. This was the innate ability of the Phantom Fire Wolf.</p>
 <p>Now, after he moved, he discovered that the two Icy Martens actually had tiny wings. If he did not look carefully, he would not have been able to tell, that those things were actually wings. The Six-Eared Poisonous Heavenly Mouse had three pairs of tiny meaty wings, they were very small, but its speed was unexpectedly fast. Its movements were very sharp.</p>
 <p>At this moment, these few poison beasts quickly appeared, looking at the situation, Qing Shui didn't have enough time to make a move before getting attacked by the opponents. If there was only a single poison beast, Qing Shui’s Demon Binding Ropes could render it completely useless. Maybe because the opponent expected him to have some limited countermeasures available, when he made a move, he sent out three highly toxic poison beasts.</p>
 <p>If he could eliminate Qing Shui, then, even if the three poison beasts all died, it would be worth it. They did not expect that this youth would become their nemesis.</p>
 <p>Hu!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could feel streams of cold air behind his back, he stretched out his left hand!</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb instantly expanded and suddenly appeared in front of the three poison beasts. Qing Shui did not intend to use the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb to kill the poison beasts, he just wanted to ensnare them for a while.</p>
 <p>When this happened, the three poison beasts were unable to evade in time!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not slow down at all as he rushed at the old man, he ferociously struck out will all his might. He used the Violet Gold Divine Shield in his hand to block the opponent’s attack. At the same time, the Big Dipper Sword in his other hand silently sent out a plain-looking slash.</p>
 <p>Critical Damage!</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui's power was slightly inferior to his opponent's, as the result of ignoring half of the opponent's defensive power, he was able to deliver a fatal blow. It was comparable to clashing with the strength of 4000 countries again that of 200 countries, the target exploded on the spot.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui originally wanted to use a sneak attack to disable of them, that way, his chances of victory would have been higher. The most important thing was, that Qing Shui did not want the people on his side to be injured too gravely. He had the Ancient Strengthening Technique and perversely strong recovery abilities but Old Madam Mo and Di Xuan were different. In addition, Old Madam Mo was already quite old, relatively speaking, her body was strong for a cultivator, but it was not as healthy and capable of swift recovery as in her youth.</p>
 <p>He fell!</p>
 <p>A Grade 10 Martial Saint Ten Thousand Poisons Sect protector with the abilities of 7500 countries exploded to death by the most tyrannical of methods. His death represented, that the Di Clan was aiming to be the strongest power in the Seven Stars Country, it already possessed the strength to compete with the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect.</p>
 <p>“Third Brother!”</p>
 <p>“Third Brother!”</p>
 <p>The remaining black-haired man and the other old man both roared in anger, they rushed towards Qing Shui, at the same time, the Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies rushed over.</p>
 <p>The situation developed rapidly, the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb actually managed to trap those three poison beasts within it. They were now tightly wrapped up and were not able to fly, which resulted in them falling to the ground. Qing Shui felt that the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb was not able to kill the three poison beasts within a short period of time, but he wasn't sure whether some of them might just suffer fatal injuries from the hard landing.</p>
 <p>After they fell, Qing Shui felt a little relieved in his heart, Old Madam Mo already tangled up the remaining old man while Di Xuan was also assisting her.</p>
 <p>Right now, the only ones rushing at Qing Shui were the black-haired man and the Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies.</p>
 <p>At this moment, with the protection of the Seven Star Armored Vest, Qing Shui could barely withstand the assault, if this dragged on, he might eventually get injured, a careless mistake might even cause his death.</p>
 <p>Ming!</p>
 <p>A strange clear cry resounded in the surroundings, suddenly Qing Shui felt that his whole body was solidifying, as though it was trying to restrain him, he felt like he was turning into stone.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui cursed in his heart, he did not expect that the Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies could attack from such a distance, furthermore, the attack seemed so tyrannical. In a moment, Qing Shui felt that the surface of his body had already turned into a golden rock, it was one inch thick and it encompassed his whole body. All the bones in his body were compressed till creaking sounds could be heard echoing out from them.</p>
 <p>Just at this moment, the black-haired old man used the Evil Dragon Tooth to slash at Qing Shui’s neck, that huge sickle was like the scythe of the death god.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was not able to move, but his consciousness was incomparably clear. Watching as at the sickle kept on getting closer, he felt like his death was coming along with it, but he was still unable to make the slightest movement.</p>
 <p>Nature Energy!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui discovered, that he could slowly circulate it. If he had enough time it would not be a problem to free himself this way. However, time was running out, Qing Shui did not want to die. If he died here, then everything would be finished.</p>
 <p>Divinity Protection!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui activated this life-protecting technique, it was a pity that there was no effect. The Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique in his body was circulating very slowly, at the speed of a crawling snail.</p>
 <p>All of this happened in an instant, Qing Shui could already see the opponent’s sinister expression and feel the cold Qi of the Evil Dragon Tooth, Qing Shui slowly closed his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui……”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui perceived a call, what he sensed was the voice of his mother. Soon, it became the voice of Di Chen, then, Canghai Mingyue, Huoyun Liu-Li, Mingyue Gelou, Shi Qingzhuang …...</p>
 <p>Finally, it became Lady Duanmu’s voice. This time, Qing Shui could hear it clearly. He could feel the anxious expressions of the nearby Lady Duanmu, Di Chen, and Di Qing. He could even see the tears in Di Chen's eyes.</p>
 <p>“Father, father……”</p>
 <p>“It’s the voice of Luan Luan, Yuchang, Zun`er, and Yin`er!” Qing Shui felt his consciousness go blurry. As death approached, Qing Shui’s body felt dissatisfied, he suddenly felt helpless and full of grief, the grief of lacking abilities.</p>
 <p>His earlier attempt to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal failed.</p>
 <p>An, Ma, Ne, Ba, Mi, Hou……</p>
 <p>[TL notes: Buddhist chant]</p>
 <p>Suddenly Qing Shui heard the familiar Buddhist chant, his previously resigned heart started to get excited. He felt his body relax, the solidification of his body also disappeared.</p>
 <p>Just at this moment, the Evil Dragon Tooth came in contact with Qing Shui’s body. Simultaneously, a golden light radiated off of the place of contact, spreading to his whole body.</p>
 <p>The blinding light slammed into the attacker. Qing Shui turned his head to see the slowly disappearing Buddha Image. He remembered that this was the third time it had appeared, every time it did, something that would cause him to be ecstatic would occur.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked in shock at the black-haired old man, his eyes had the expression of bewilderment but he did not notice the Buddha Image behind Qing Shui. Qing Shui felt that this Buddha Image could only be seen by himself.</p>
 <p>The beautiful wings of the Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies flapped and they quickly headed towards Qing Shui. Before they arrived, they gave off a clear cry, following that, the familiar feeling came again.</p>
 <p>This time, Qing Shui was prepared, he had already circulated the energy in his body to its maximum, he even quickly summoned three Golden Lotus Flowers to protect himself.</p>
 <p>This way, he felt very little discomfort from the butterflies' ability. These Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies were immensely strong, they put him under a lot of pressure.</p>
 <p>“Poison beast, poison beast and another poison beast yet again, I have them too.” Qing Shui truly started to get anxious, from the start till now, there were multiple times when he was almost killed. The more he thought about it, the angrier he got. He directly summoned the Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee and hundreds of Jade Emperor Bees from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He could not be bothered with anything else, he had to kill these Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies, or else, only death awaited him.</p>
 <p>Suddenly a few hundred Jade Emperor Bees appeared, although they were not big, there were hundreds of them. In a short moment, they filled the surrounding space.</p>
 <p>Weng Weng……</p>
 <p>With just one Jade Emperor Bee, maybe one would feel that it was noisy. With hundreds of Jade Emperor Bees, it was not just noise anymore, it caused an unsettling feeling that would cause one’s scalp to go numb.</p>
 <p>The Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee flew above Qing Shui, Qing Shui didn't have the opportunity to order the Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee and Jade Emperor Bees to attack yet, but he discovered, that the nearby Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies had stopped and started flapping its wings uneasily.</p>
 <p>Suddenly the Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies let out an explosive buzzing sound.</p>
 <p>Afterward, under the incredulous gazes of Qing Shui and the black-haired man, the Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies actually slowly flew towards the Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee. Then the Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies surrounded the Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee and danced.</p>
 <p>Out of the millions of Colored Butterflies, there would only be a single pair of Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies. Some people said, that they were a pair of ‘husband and wife’, some said that they were sisters.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was not sure about this, but he was sure that the Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies were of the bugs category. Or perhaps they were some branch of the bee species. Now a situation that would cause people to be dumbstruck appeared.</p>
 <p>Defecting? Poison beast defecting?</p>
 <p>The Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee was above Qing Shui, the Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies were flying beside it. The Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee looked like a ruler. Qing Shui was speechless at this situation, the ruler of bees was the queen bee. Qing Shui was not too clear on this, he only remembered that in his previous life, the ruler of bees was the queen bee, the queen was the one, who laid the eggs. Qing Shui felt that this situation was a little messy…...</p>
 <p>Shaking his head, Qing Shui stopped thinking about it. After all, after this Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee swallowed the Poison Dragon Pearl, it mutated, what exactly it was now, even he didn't really know. Furthermore, this Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee had the ability to tame and command bee-type demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>“Had I known earlier that this would happen, I would have summoned the Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee immediately.” Qing Shui was annoyed, earlier, he almost lost his life because of these Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies.</p>
 <p>Using his consciousness to communicate with the Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee, he tried to direct the Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies to attack the black-haired man. In response, he only heard some clear cries and buzzing sounds.</p>
 <p>Finally, Qing Shui was quite shocked, from his consciousness, he received a message that the Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies will not attack the black-haired man, but they can attack anyone else.</p>
 <p>This caused Qing Shui to believe that these Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies had better ‘morals and principles’ than some humans……</p>
 <p>“All of you, die!”</p>
 <p>The black-haired man suddenly used the huge Evil Dragon Tooth and slashed with it, the crescent shaped blade swept towards the group of Jade Emperor Bees and Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>This attack created a two meters wide black shadow, the possibility of the Martial King realm Jade Emperor Bees surviving this attack was null.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui waved his hands and retrieved the Jade Emperor Bees, in his panic, he also retrieved the Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies. However, he left the Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee outside, it had casually evaded the attack of the black-haired man.</p>
 <p>This was the extreme speed of the Jade Emperor Poison Queen Bee.</p>
 <p>It flapped its wings and a pink object shot towards the black-haired man.</p>
