 <p><strong>Chapter 520 The Great Perfection Stage of the 5th Heavenly Layer, Unexpected Recovery of the Heart.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 520 - The Great Perfection Stage of the 5th Heavenly Layer, Unexpected Recovery of the Heart</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Aggressiveness!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It lacked the aggressiveness of the hammer!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was also the power used to overwhelm others!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stood there silently. There were many different kinds of weapons in the world, each with different types of uses. Some weapons were light and agile, some were extremely heavy, some were menacing, some were cunning, and some were poisonous…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It should be possible to use one type of weapon to unleash the effectiveness of another type, just like how one would be able to use their feet to write instead of using their hands.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, it would require a massive amount of energy, perhaps dozen folds of energy to make it possible. In other words, using a sword to unleash the effectiveness of the hammer would seem as if one had to use their feet to write, even though they still have two hands on their body.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">No one would be willing to sacrifice an enormous amount of energy for that purpose. However, if one managed to conveniently obtain a melee weapon, it would make sense that one should exploit its uniqueness.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the case of Qing Shui’s Big Dipper Sword, he felt that he could add an additional 50% to the overall power by strengthening his strongest technique, the Thousand Hammer Technique.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But after a train of deep thoughts, Qing Shui realized the unnecessity of the complex method. Since Big Dipper Sword was powerful, it would be better to expand its own ability as a sword rather than using it as a way to strengthen the hammer’s ability.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It would be even better if he could find a suitable hammer to put the Thousand Hammer Technique to good use!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After much consideration, Qing Shui decided to give up the thoughts of using Big Dipper Sword as a substitute for maul weapons!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Five days had passed inside the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, which meant that Qing Shui had one day left to spend in the Realm. He had since recovered after entering the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal twice each day; once during midnight spending half of his time inside, and once during dawn for the remaining time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Each time he would spend three hours inside the realm. Qing Shui felt that it would be a waste of time if he spent six hours of time in one go.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The things he had collected over time in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal put Qing Shui at ease. He felt that he was actually an insecure person, which was why he was willing to put anything under his control as long as it was possible for him to do it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui walked to the lake and noticed a 6000-year Golden Medicinal Turtle swimming about. There were also about 200 or more Golden Horn Firetail Fishes around the turtle.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“They are almost ready to be eaten!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But the amount of the fishes was still a bit too little. It would take about a hundred years for a pair of Golden Horn Firetail Fishes to give birth to another pair of offsprings. After that, it would take another hundred years for the fishes to mature, and only then could they reproduce.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The last time he had seen these Golden Horn Firetail Fishes, there were about twenty of them. In two and a half years, the amount had jumped from twenty to two hundred.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It had been one year in the real world during the 150 years he had spent in the Realm of Violet Immortal. The gigantic lotus flower in the middle of the lake had sped up the growth of the marine life by 20%, which in turn had saved up a lot of time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was content seeing the excellent growth of living things in the lake. Everything he could see belonged to him, and the last thing he could see was the Vermillion Fruit at the far end.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The fruit had the ability to increase the strength of one’s meridians by 1%. One person was only allowed to eat at most 100 pieces of the fruit in their lifetime...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Up until now, Qing Shui had eaten about a dozen pieces of the Vermillion Fruit. Thinking that he still had eight more fruits in his inventory, he decided to eat some of them first and leave one or two of the fruits for wine brewing.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Without hesitation, Qing Shui finished one of the fruits in one go. The meridians in his body slightly contracted but promptly returned to normal after a while.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the same time, he could feel his Ancient Strengthening Technique had begun circulating in his body. His strength had increased, which meant the 199th Cycle of Circulate Qi was progressing, albeit by a little bit.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If he had enough Vermillion Fruits to spare, he would eat all of them until he had reached a full 199th Cycle of Circulate Qi, which in turn, would complete the 5th Heavenly Layer of Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, Qing Shui only had eight fruits, but he had already eaten five of them just now. His meridians were growing stronger, which he could clearly sense in his body. Qing Shui planned to take whatever he could in order to grow stronger. After all, it would prove to be an ultimate test of the strength of his body once he was able to break through the 6th Layer of Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With that thought, Qing Shui felt that it was worth harvesting the results of the last two years. The ancient book &lt;Rebirth&gt; had given him twice the strength he’d initially had during this period of time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After he got out from the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, he could still hear the sounds of children playing nearby. If it was in the big cities, the night market would have just begun their business in the lively streets.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui walked out of the room spontaneously and observed the moon’s glow. As he gazed the moon, he thought about the ups and downs of his life, which only brought him pain the more he thought about it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When he was complacent, things were looking up and he was radiated with happiness. But when he was dejected, he was instead cast to the bottomless pit of despair.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everyone had worked hard in their life and strived towards their goals. As long as one would not falter against danger and temptations, they would be able to reach towards the end!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, he saw a faint light flickering inside Huoyun Liu-Li’s room. He knew the source of the subtle light was from the covered light stones in her room.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He was moved when he thought about the things that had happened during the day. When he remembered her charming expression, he was instantly reminded of the words she had said one year ago.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You, Qing Shui, will be mine this year...”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though he wasn’t the brightest bulb in the world, he knew what she meant exactly. For a woman to say that, it meant she had prepared herself to wait for him forever. She was indeed deeply in love with Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But he hadn’t touched her for one year, this gesture was an insult to her pride!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt extremely guilty for the lack of intimacy with her, so he made up his mind and went towards her room. He was about to knock her door when he realized her door was closed, but it wasn’t locked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He pushed the door open gently and saw a muslin bed inside. It was purple, which was the same color scheme for the decorations in the room.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although the decorations were simple, and he had only been living here for a month during the new year, Qing Shui was able to navigate the room easily. He spotted a woman covered in a blanket on the bed, her hair spilled over the pillow like a souffle of clouds. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, the blanket wasn’t able to cover her graceful figure from peeking through! Moreover, the blanket was white!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I thought Liu-Li would not use any color other than purple?” Qing Shui realized the blanket was white as he walked closer to the bed. However, all the decorations and the bed were purple in color.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui closed the door behind him gently. He noticed that the woman did not fidget the slightest!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Could it be that Liu-Li knew I was coming so she left the door unlocked?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was thinking too much. Now that his body had mostly recovered except for the heart, he felt that his confidence had recovered as well.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even if he had a few years to live, Qing Shui would never abandon them. He felt like he understood a lot of things after he was reborn again.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Treasure everything, especially the people around us.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was only able to understand the real meaning behind these words now.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As he was getting closer, he heart was beating faster. Qing Shui was even a little bit nervous. He wasn’t even nervous during his first time having intercourse with Shi Qingzhuang. She was able to let loose of herself due to the influence of medicines.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although Mingyue Gelou had bore a child before, she was still a woman of dignity and purity. She would not talk during intercourse, only letting out a few subtle moans. Mingyue Gelou was a living example of a traditional woman.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As for that time with Zhu Qing, he was the victim…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The woman from Feng Clan was only a bargain exchange between him and Feng Clan. But after everything with Feng Clan, Qing Shui wished he could forget about her sometime soon.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But this time, Qing Shui felt a bit nervous. The woman on the bed was the longest one he had been with during his lifetime. It was as if their hearts were connected to each other. Their relationship was very close and intimate, much like soul mates.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After a moment of hesitation, Qing Shui slowly took off his clothes except for a thin layer of undergarments. He pushed back the canopy bed drapes, lifted up the corner of the blanket, and slipped into the bed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The room was dimly lit, so Qing Shui quickly laid down beside Liu-Li. As he was about to wrap his arms around Huoyun Liu-Li, she suddenly rolled over, pressing their bodies against each other.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li, I don’t feel like sleeping alone…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At that moment, two people became confused!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue was the one lying on the bed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui instantly went blank, and so did Canghai Mingyue!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You came to look for Liu-Li, didn’t you?” Canghai Mingyue said softly after a moment of shock.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Do you know how bad you are at lying?” Canghai Mingyue stared at Qing Shui, who was just within her reach.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sigh, yes. I came to look for her…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not lie to her as he gazed at her deep beautiful eyes and alluring expression. He wanted to hug her and tell her that he came to look for her, but he couldn’t.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If he did, it would be out of his character.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Real men were essentially born to be bold and courageous in taking responsibilities and everything they have done!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Do you even think about me, even after all this time?” Canghai Mingyue titled her head down slightly!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought about the time he had more or less confessed his love for Canghai Mingyue at the Heavenly Palace. But he’d never got a reply from her, and with the circumstances of his condition after that, they eventually became a bit reserved with each other.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If it wasn’t for Huoyun Liu-Li’s persistent personality, he would have isolated himself from both of them a long time ago. Qing Shui would have isolated himself from other people too.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I do!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gave a firm reply!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I have always been thinking about you. You and Liu-Li will always be in my heart. Did you forget what I told you at Heavenly Palace?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I did not forget that. Maybe you have forgotten about it. I believed in everything you said to me, I really do. I really felt that you actually like me. But after a long while, we never spoke to each other for more than a few words, and you never came to look for me…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue’s tone was fading the longer she talked…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui mustered his courage and embraced the alluring woman wearing a thin layer of nightgown in his arms. He had always thought about their first meeting when he saw how beautiful she was, and how she would always react to him with haughty remarks. Qing Shui would never dream that one day he could embrace her like this….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He could feel her slender body trembled a little. Qing Shui did not do anything else except embracing her in his arms. He hugged her a gentle tightness so that her tender body would press against his chest.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could smell a faint sweet scent of orchid and musk as he leaned closer. It was a nice smell of a woman. He wondered if the subtle sweet scent was naturally from her body or from the perfumed cosmetics.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With a beauty such as herself, she was as dazzling as the women from the Portrait of Beauty!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">And that Divine body!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As he continued to embrace her, he could clearly feel every sense and touch of her skin. It was as smooth as a pristine Jade with a hint of supple tenderness to it…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Their faces were only an inch apart from each other.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt incredible by the closeness of their body. The room was dimly illuminated by the light stones, which resembled the faint light of the moon. She had a supple skin as pale as a White Jade. There was also a hint of shyness from her gaze as she looked deeply into Qing Shui’s eyes. Her straight jade-skin nose almost touched with Qing Shui’s nose due to their close distance.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui leaned forward slightly, touching Canghai Mingyue’s nose with his.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She seemed like she wanted to evade Qing Shui’s touch, but ultimately, she didn’t.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Her cheeks were flushed in a subtle red color, much like the color of a peach blossom. The amorous atmosphere overwhelmed the entire room.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I want to kiss your lips….”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui said in a delicate tone!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue was unsure if Qing Shui was intentionally teasing her or if he really wanted to kiss her…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She squinted her eyes with grace and moved her lips forward to touch Qing Shui’s lips marginally. Although it was a light kiss, her face was flushed with deeper red color, and she quickly closed her eyes from embarrassment.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui pulled her closer to his arms and embraced her tightly. He proceeded forwards and kissed her lips while skillfully slithered in his tongue into her mouth.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Both his hands were gently caressing her back while her heavily erected nipples were pressed against his chest. Qing Shui was not satisfied with just touching her back, so he slipped them inside her gown and groped her firm buttocks as hard as he could.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue’s breathing was getting heavier as her body jolted by his touch. Qing Shui also quivered for a moment when he felt the extraordinary softness of buttocks.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She could feel something changing on Qing Shui’s body, and she wasn’t able to control her body from shivering. Canghai Mingyue was unsure whether it was caused by her nervousness or from being stimulated by Qing Shui’s hands…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, I am scared!” Canghai Mingyue panted heavily as she cried.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui held her in his arms and calmly patted her back: “Don’t be nervous, just relax. What are you nervous about? You should be nervous about what we are going to do next.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He bit her ears gently and whispered.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue tried to hold in her voice as she held Qing Shui’s neck tightly!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Do you want to…” Qing Shui felt like he was in a haze when he asked that question.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I don’t…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Are you sure you don’t want it, or are you pretending not to want it?” Qing Shui relaxed his muscles as he scoffed at Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I really don’t want it…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I want it so bad. Can you feel it?” Qing Shui moved his body so that she could feel his passion for her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue kept her hands firmly on Qing Shui’s neck and buried her head on his chest. She was silent, but her body was trembling slightly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui laid on the bed on his back, allowing Canghai Mingyue to lean on top of his body. The neckline of the gown was very low, which allowed Qing Shui to peek at her bosoms.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He then put his arms around Canghai Mingyue’s slender waist. The hand that was still touching her buttocks slowly slipped into her gown.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He used the other hand to slowly unbutton her top!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s mind went blank for a moment. The Yin-Yang Image seemed to be alive in the sea of consciousness as it radiated a strong wave of energy that nourished every part of his body.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Huh, my heart is starting to heal…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Qing Shui was stupefied. Before he was able to express his surprise, the woman in his arms was also emitting a bright dazzling light from her body. A mysterious and strong energy was transmitting between the two of them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That phenomenon lasted for a whopping four hours!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was still in disbelief that he heart had actually recovered. Not only was it completely healed, the 199th Cycle of Circulate Qi had also finally reached its great perfection stage.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Could this be the energy resulted from the duo cultivation?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was also able to confirm Martial Saint Dan Qing’s absolute speculation about Canghai Mingyue having the Divine body. Because of her, his heart had finally recovered, and his 5th Layer of Ancient Strengthening Technique had reached its final cycle towards the Great Perfection Stage.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue also had a breakthrough - she had reached the 8th Grade Martial King!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Most importantly, her body system had undergone an enormous change, which meant she would be able to cultivate her skills a lot faster. Qing Shui wasn't sure whether it was the formidable power of the nameless Duo Cultivation Technique or some other reasons.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Duo Cultivation Technique was the main technique used by the members Misty Hall. Under the guidance of Qing Shui, Canghai Mingyue’s Duo Cultivation Technique was able to circulate itself automatically. This could be the first time that both of them were able to benefit from each other.</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 520 - The Great Perfection Stage of the 5th Heavenly Layer, Unexpected Recovery of the Heart</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Aggressiveness!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It lacked the aggressiveness of the hammer!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was also the power used to overwhelm others!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stood there silently. There were many different kinds of weapons in the world, each with different types of uses. Some weapons were light and agile, some were extremely heavy, some were menacing, some were cunning, and some were poisonous…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It should be possible to use one type of weapon to unleash the effectiveness of another type, just like how one would be able to use their feet to write instead of using their hands.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, it would require a massive amount of energy, perhaps dozen folds of energy to make it possible. In other words, using a sword to unleash the effectiveness of the hammer would seem as if one had to use their feet to write, even though they still have two hands on their body.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">No one would be willing to sacrifice an enormous amount of energy for that purpose. However, if one managed to conveniently obtain a melee weapon, it would make sense that one should exploit its uniqueness.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the case of Qing Shui’s Big Dipper Sword, he felt that he could add an additional 50% to the overall power by strengthening his strongest technique, the Thousand Hammer Technique.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But after a train of deep thoughts, Qing Shui realized the unnecessity of the complex method. Since Big Dipper Sword was powerful, it would be better to expand its own ability as a sword rather than using it as a way to strengthen the hammer’s ability.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It would be even better if he could find a suitable hammer to put the Thousand Hammer Technique to good use!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After much consideration, Qing Shui decided to give up the thoughts of using Big Dipper Sword as a substitute for maul weapons!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Five days had passed inside the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, which meant that Qing Shui had one day left to spend in the Realm. He had since recovered after entering the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal twice each day; once during midnight spending half of his time inside, and once during dawn for the remaining time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Each time he would spend three hours inside the realm. Qing Shui felt that it would be a waste of time if he spent six hours of time in one go.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The things he had collected over time in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal put Qing Shui at ease. He felt that he was actually an insecure person, which was why he was willing to put anything under his control as long as it was possible for him to do it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui walked to the lake and noticed a 6000-year Golden Medicinal Turtle swimming about. There were also about 200 or more Golden Horn Firetail Fishes around the turtle.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“They are almost ready to be eaten!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But the amount of the fishes was still a bit too little. It would take about a hundred years for a pair of Golden Horn Firetail Fishes to give birth to another pair of offsprings. After that, it would take another hundred years for the fishes to mature, and only then could they reproduce.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The last time he had seen these Golden Horn Firetail Fishes, there were about twenty of them. In two and a half years, the amount had jumped from twenty to two hundred.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It had been one year in the real world during the 150 years he had spent in the Realm of Violet Immortal. The gigantic lotus flower in the middle of the lake had sped up the growth of the marine life by 20%, which in turn had saved up a lot of time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was content seeing the excellent growth of living things in the lake. Everything he could see belonged to him, and the last thing he could see was the Vermillion Fruit at the far end.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The fruit had the ability to increase the strength of one’s meridians by 1%. One person was only allowed to eat at most 100 pieces of the fruit in their lifetime...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Up until now, Qing Shui had eaten about a dozen pieces of the Vermillion Fruit. Thinking that he still had eight more fruits in his inventory, he decided to eat some of them first and leave one or two of the fruits for wine brewing.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Without hesitation, Qing Shui finished one of the fruits in one go. The meridians in his body slightly contracted but promptly returned to normal after a while.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the same time, he could feel his Ancient Strengthening Technique had begun circulating in his body. His strength had increased, which meant the 199th Cycle of Circulate Qi was progressing, albeit by a little bit.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If he had enough Vermillion Fruits to spare, he would eat all of them until he had reached a full 199th Cycle of Circulate Qi, which in turn, would complete the 5th Heavenly Layer of Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, Qing Shui only had eight fruits, but he had already eaten five of them just now. His meridians were growing stronger, which he could clearly sense in his body. Qing Shui planned to take whatever he could in order to grow stronger. After all, it would prove to be an ultimate test of the strength of his body once he was able to break through the 6th Layer of Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With that thought, Qing Shui felt that it was worth harvesting the results of the last two years. The ancient book &lt;Rebirth&gt; had given him twice the strength he’d initially had during this period of time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After he got out from the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, he could still hear the sounds of children playing nearby. If it was in the big cities, the night market would have just begun their business in the lively streets.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui walked out of the room spontaneously and observed the moon’s glow. As he gazed the moon, he thought about the ups and downs of his life, which only brought him pain the more he thought about it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When he was complacent, things were looking up and he was radiated with happiness. But when he was dejected, he was instead cast to the bottomless pit of despair.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everyone had worked hard in their life and strived towards their goals. As long as one would not falter against danger and temptations, they would be able to reach towards the end!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, he saw a faint light flickering inside Huoyun Liu-Li’s room. He knew the source of the subtle light was from the covered light stones in her room.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He was moved when he thought about the things that had happened during the day. When he remembered her charming expression, he was instantly reminded of the words she had said one year ago.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You, Qing Shui, will be mine this year...”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though he wasn’t the brightest bulb in the world, he knew what she meant exactly. For a woman to say that, it meant she had prepared herself to wait for him forever. She was indeed deeply in love with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But he hadn’t touched her for one year, this gesture was an insult to her pride!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt extremely guilty for the lack of intimacy with her, so he made up his mind and went towards her room. He was about to knock her door when he realized her door was closed, but it wasn’t locked.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He pushed the door open gently and saw a muslin bed inside. It was purple, which was the same color scheme for the decorations in the room.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although the decorations were simple, and he had only been living here for a month during the new year, Qing Shui was able to navigate the room easily. He spotted a woman covered in a blanket on the bed, her hair spilled over the pillow like a souffle of clouds. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, the blanket wasn’t able to cover her graceful figure from peeking through! Moreover, the blanket was white!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I thought Liu-Li would not use any color other than purple?” Qing Shui realized the blanket was white as he walked closer to the bed. However, all the decorations and the bed were purple in color.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui closed the door behind him gently. He noticed that the woman did not fidget the slightest!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Could it be that Liu-Li knew I was coming so she left the door unlocked?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was thinking too much. Now that his body had mostly recovered except for the heart, he felt that his confidence had recovered as well.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even if he had a few years to live, Qing Shui would never abandon them. He felt like he understood a lot of things after he was reborn again.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Treasure everything, especially the people around us.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was only able to understand the real meaning behind these words now.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As he was getting closer, he heart was beating faster. Qing Shui was even a little bit nervous. He wasn’t even nervous during his first time having intercourse with Shi Qingzhuang. She was able to let loose of herself due to the influence of medicines.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although Mingyue Gelou had bore a child before, she was still a woman of dignity and purity. She would not talk during intercourse, only letting out a few subtle moans. Mingyue Gelou was a living example of a traditional woman.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As for that time with Zhu Qing, he was the victim…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The woman from Feng Clan was only a bargain exchange between him and Feng Clan. But after everything with Feng Clan, Qing Shui wished he could forget about her sometime soon.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But this time, Qing Shui felt a bit nervous. The woman on the bed was the longest one he had been with during his lifetime. It was as if their hearts were connected to each other. Their relationship was very close and intimate, much like soul mates.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After a moment of hesitation, Qing Shui slowly took off his clothes except for a thin layer of undergarments. He pushed back the canopy bed drapes, lifted up the corner of the blanket, and slipped into the bed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The room was dimly lit, so Qing Shui quickly laid down beside Liu-Li. As he was about to wrap his arms around Huoyun Liu-Li, she suddenly rolled over, pressing their bodies against each other.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li, I don’t feel like sleeping alone…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At that moment, two people became confused!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue was the one lying on the bed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui instantly went blank, and so did Canghai Mingyue!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You came to look for Liu-Li, didn’t you?” Canghai Mingyue said softly after a moment of shock.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Do you know how bad you are at lying?” Canghai Mingyue stared at Qing Shui, who was just within her reach.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sigh, yes. I came to look for her…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not lie to her as he gazed at her deep beautiful eyes and alluring expression. He wanted to hug her and tell her that he came to look for her, but he couldn’t.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If he did, it would be out of his character.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Real men were essentially born to be bold and courageous in taking responsibilities and everything they have done!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Do you even think about me, even after all this time?” Canghai Mingyue titled her head down slightly!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought about the time he had more or less confessed his love for Canghai Mingyue at the Heavenly Palace. But he’d never got a reply from her, and with the circumstances of his condition after that, they eventually became a bit reserved with each other.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If it wasn’t for Huoyun Liu-Li’s persistent personality, he would have isolated himself from both of them a long time ago. Qing Shui would have isolated himself from other people too.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I do!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gave a firm reply!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I have always been thinking about you. You and Liu-Li will always be in my heart. Did you forget what I told you at Heavenly Palace?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I did not forget that. Maybe you have forgotten about it. I believed in everything you said to me, I really do. I really felt that you actually like me. But after a long while, we never spoke to each other for more than a few words, and you never came to look for me…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue’s tone was fading the longer she talked…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui mustered his courage and embraced the alluring woman wearing a thin layer of nightgown in his arms. He had always thought about their first meeting when he saw how beautiful she was, and how she would always react to him with haughty remarks. Qing Shui would never dream that one day he could embrace her like this….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He could feel her slender body trembled a little. Qing Shui did not do anything else except embracing her in his arms. He hugged her a gentle tightness so that her tender body would press against his chest.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could smell a faint sweet scent of orchid and musk as he leaned closer. It was a nice smell of a woman. He wondered if the subtle sweet scent was naturally from her body or from the perfumed cosmetics.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With a beauty such as herself, she was as dazzling as the women from the Portrait of Beauty!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">And that Divine body!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As he continued to embrace her, he could clearly feel every sense and touch of her skin. It was as smooth as a pristine Jade with a hint of supple tenderness to it…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Their faces were only an inch apart from each other.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt incredible by the closeness of their body. The room was dimly illuminated by the light stones, which resembled the faint light of the moon. She had a supple skin as pale as a White Jade. There was also a hint of shyness from her gaze as she looked deeply into Qing Shui’s eyes. Her straight jade-skin nose almost touched with Qing Shui’s nose due to their close distance.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui leaned forward slightly, touching Canghai Mingyue’s nose with his.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She seemed like she wanted to evade Qing Shui’s touch, but ultimately, she didn’t.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Her cheeks were flushed in a subtle red color, much like the color of a peach blossom. The amorous atmosphere overwhelmed the entire room.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I want to kiss your lips….”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui said in a delicate tone!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue was unsure if Qing Shui was intentionally teasing her or if he really wanted to kiss her…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She squinted her eyes with grace and moved her lips forward to touch Qing Shui’s lips marginally. Although it was a light kiss, her face was flushed with deeper red color, and she quickly closed her eyes from embarrassment.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui pulled her closer to his arms and embraced her tightly. He proceeded forwards and kissed her lips while skillfully slithered in his tongue into her mouth.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Both his hands were gently caressing her back while her heavily erected nipples were pressed against his chest. Qing Shui was not satisfied with just touching her back, so he slipped them inside her gown and groped her firm buttocks as hard as he could.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue’s breathing was getting heavier as her body jolted by his touch. Qing Shui also quivered for a moment when he felt the extraordinary softness of buttocks.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She could feel something changing on Qing Shui’s body, and she wasn’t able to control her body from shivering. Canghai Mingyue was unsure whether it was caused by her nervousness or from being stimulated by Qing Shui’s hands…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, I am scared!” Canghai Mingyue panted heavily as she cried.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui held her in his arms and calmly patted her back: “Don’t be nervous, just relax. What are you nervous about? You should be nervous about what we are going to do next.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He bit her ears gently and whispered.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue tried to hold in her voice as she held Qing Shui’s neck tightly!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Do you want to…” Qing Shui felt like he was in a haze when he asked that question.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I don’t…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Are you sure you don’t want it, or are you pretending not to want it?” Qing Shui relaxed his muscles as he scoffed at Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I really don’t want it…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I want it so bad. Can you feel it?” Qing Shui moved his body so that she could feel his passion for her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue kept her hands firmly on Qing Shui’s neck and buried her head on his chest. She was silent, but her body was trembling slightly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui laid on the bed on his back, allowing Canghai Mingyue to lean on top of his body. The neckline of the gown was very low, which allowed Qing Shui to peek at her bosoms.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He then put his arms around Canghai Mingyue’s slender waist. The hand that was still touching her buttocks slowly slipped into her gown.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He used the other hand to slowly unbutton her top!</p>
