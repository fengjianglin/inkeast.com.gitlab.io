 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hi, I’m Yan Ziyun,” the male Ocean Demon nodded to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t expect him to be so assertive and thick-skinned. That sometimes symbolized strength and confidence. As the saying went, those who were brazen would attain luxury. Those who were sensitive would remain in poverty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was speechless. Though the Mistresses weren’t his women, he wouldn’t allow others to take a share. For sure, he wouldn’t interfere their affairs if it wasn’t of their own wills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What can I do for you?” Qing Shui’s expression remained the same. Though it wasn’t pure hatred, it was absolutely far from fondness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are they your women?” The male Ocean Demon was apparently not interested in Qing Shui’s name. All he wanted to know was the relationship between the Mistresses and Qing Shui. If they weren’t related, he wouldn’t have to fuss over it; if they’re directly related, then he would have to deal with Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We are his women,” replied the Sunset Palace Mistress immediately. That made Qing Shui, who initially wanted to deny anything, lose his words at once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge smiled, looking at Qing Shui’s expression as if he was in grief. However, after a second thought, she pouted in discontentment because Qing Shui felt that he was at a disadvantage for admitting that they as his women.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Ziyun was stunned. His dim light of hope vanished following that statement. Soon after, he displayed a gentle manner again since he noticed that both of them were inexperienced women.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking of that, the male Ocean Demon smiled and said, “Young man, they’re no ordinary women. You have yet to qualify to live with them. Their constitutions would take your life away. What if we make a deal? I can give you what you want and you give them to me, alright?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was at loss for words. He hated being unable to beat this man up. Yet, he recalled that the women in Main Continents and the Ocean Domains usually didn’t stand in high positions unless they were extremely powerful. Gender equality had been debated here, however, in this strength-prioritized world, women were physically weaker than men. Of course, there were also many stronger women, though they were the minority</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s similar or even worse in the world of Ocean Demons. Snatching and changing women were allowed as long as one had the strength. Hence, Yan Ziyun’s reaction was not surprising. Nevertheless, Qing Shui frowned as he disliked such trouble the most.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What about this? You offer a price and I’ll buy you!” Qing Shui said to Yan Ziyun after pondering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Ziyun gave a happy smile initially upon listening to Qing Shui’s bargain. As long as Qing Shui dared to bid, then negotiation was possible. Plus, he had a lot of treasures. Any one or two of them could make the deal. He was delighted to think of that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Yan Ziyun startled when he heard Qing Shui’s last few lines, and he progressed into fury instantly. The Ocean Demons regarded themselves to be very elegant, ranking higher than most of the tribes. Although the Mermaids and the Drakainas were the most honorable, they were only royals in decline, with spied-on identities. If Yan Ziyun was able to have a women from the Mermaids and the Drakainas as his concubines, the satisfaction would be beyond words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides, it was well-known among the tribes that the Yin constitution of the Drakainas and Mermaids could enhance warriors’ cultivation and stabilize their foundation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you know what you’re saying? How dare you humiliate the Ocean Demons.” Yan Ziyun turned ice cold at once, a sharp and tense aura attacking Qing Shui head-on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A ridiculing smile crept onto Qing Shui’s face. Looking at Yan Ziyun before him, he said, “Did you just say bullshit? To exchange for my women? Wouldn’t your mother choke you to death if she finds out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew the unspoken rules in this world. Despite the fact that there were many similar cases, nobody would like it. Everyone talked about equalities yet continued the inequalities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui couldn’t deny that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xuan Yun from the Xu Clan and Huang Wu from the Wavemoon Cavern smiled as they watched how reckless Qing Shui was. To go against the Ocean Demons was life-threatening and out of his youthful vigor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Yunfeng pulled on Qing Shui and said softly, “Little brother, do not have conflicts with them. They’re hard to deal with.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui acknowledged Shui Yunfeng’s kindness and nodded with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kid, there’s no one to save you in this world now.” Yan Ziyun’s face flushed red out of extreme rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui grinned, “The Ocean Demon Palace, if I’m not mistaken, should be ruled by the Mistress. What would they do if they find out what you’ve said today?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a strange world. The women were inferior in social status, yet, they held the most important positions. The Ocean Demon Mistress inheritance was continued for generations. They were at the top of the Ocean Demons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ocean Demon Mistress would definitely make some approaches to uphold the status of the females. The status of the females was high enough, but little cases of snatching were not subject to the death sentence. For the sake of benefits, exchanging with treasures was allowed. Somehow, this world was full of temptations. Just like the gold-diggers in past life, it’s worse in this current world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A failed temptation was a due to a lack of resources. As long as the bidding cost was sufficient, there’s no man who could resist temptations. Even if the process and the outcome were imperfect, it would be a definite success.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Ziyun smiled reluctantly, “You can meet our Mistress but you don’t know the world of Ocean Demons. All I know is that you’re dying soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I could only tell you that there are tons of them who wanted to kill me, but they’re all dead. Anyone who wants to kill me will have to take its price, so think wisely before you act and consider whether you can bear the consequences.” Qing Shui was not anxious at all. His calm-looking face made him seem mysterious and unpredictable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Ziyun wasn’t a brutal man. He had his ways to judge people. Plus, from Qing Shui’s eyes and spiritual sense, he wasn’t forcing a struggle. Instead, he seemed to have massive cultivation deposits and was not worried for a single bit. Yan Ziyun was curious about the reason behind this composure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will certainly put my words into reality. The gate will be open soon, be careful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Goodbye two ladies, hmm, we’ll surely meet again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Ziyun didn’t forget to greet the Sunset Palace Mistress and Muyun Qingge before leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui held the same expression, looking at Yun Ziyun who had gone too far. There was a slight sharpness in his eyes. He was not a man who feared the threats. These Ocean Demons were powerful yet he wasn’t afraid. He was capable of retaliation. With the help of so many killer-moves, he would make them feel regret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little brother, we have to beware. These Ocean Demons are terrifying. Frankly, regardless if we could kill them, they’ve forced us into a dead end,” Shui Yunfeng sighed and smiled bitterly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder brother, you don’t have to interrupt in this matter. I’ll take it on my own,” said Qing Shui in a serious tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you talking about? You really took my words lightly. No worries, I would indeed die in front of you,” Shui Yunfeng looked determined as he stared at the direction of the Ocean Demons.</span></p>
