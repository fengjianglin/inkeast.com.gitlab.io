 <p><strong>AST 733 - Heading for Pingyang Country's Zuoshi Clan, Start of the Killing Spree</strong></p>
 <p>As he sat there, letting his thoughts run wild, time passed by and it was soon dark. Qing Shui directly entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, starting his cultivation as usual.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui walked up to the Poison Refining Furnance and saw that there was only a small amount of the poison used to soak the Frosted Iron Balls and Coldsteel Needles left. The Frosted Iron Balls and Coldsteel Needles were now so black that it looked scary.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui tried sensing them with his Spiritual Sense and felt very satisfied. These things should be able to kill quite a number of people. This is even when there was no breakthrough in the Ancient Strengthening Technique nor in the State of One with Elephant.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's State of One with Elephant was only at the small success stage and could only merge with 20% of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's abilities. This 20% was based on the current abilities of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. For example, if under normal conditions, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's attack prowess with its Diamond Protection and Diamond Crossing Rivers was at 5000 countries, he would be able to merge with 20% of this strength. Under the State of One with Elephant, his Ferocious Diamond Attack would be able to reach 10,000 countries of strength. However, Qing Shui had made a few attempts but could not merge with its attacking prowess in just an instant.</p>
 <p>Therefore, at the small success stage, Qing Shui's State of One with Elephant could increase his strength by 1000 countries. Although he felt that he was about to attain a breakthrough soon, this breakthrough was not within his control and more haste, less speed. He would still require a small opportunity.</p>
 <p>In the middle of the night, Qing Shui came out from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and called for the Fire Bird, before flying into the distance. His goal: Pingyang Country.</p>
 <p>Since they had come to look for him to find trouble, Qing Shui decided to head to Pingyang Country himself this time around. This so-called great reputable clan was now at bitter odds with him, and one of them must definitely disappear.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew the map of Greencloud Continent. Now, without having to worry for the Qing Clan, Qing Shui could leave without any worries. Thinking of Zuoshi Long's viciousness, Qing Shui had no choice but to be wary against the Zuoshi Clan's unscrupulous means.</p>
 <p>Nine Continent Steps!</p>
 <p>He appeared 100,000 li away in an instant before continuing toward Pingyang Country on the Fire Bird. The Fire Bird's speed was considerably fast. With the Phoenix Dance, there was zero depletion of energy and its abilities were now two times stronger.</p>
 <p>This increased the Fire Bird's flying speed to be two times faster. The rapid progress was very comfortable. This should be the feeling of exhilaration. It feels good to have speed.</p>
 <p>The Greencloud Continent was located to the east of the Nine Continents while Pingyang Country was toward the southeast direction of the Greencloud Continent. They were not very far from each other, but it would still take a week's time to travel.</p>
 <p>After three days of flying on the Fire Bird and the usage of the Nine Continent Steps, Qing Shui was nearing Pingyang Country. He didn't know if the people from the Zuoshi Clan had headed out toward Greencloud Continent. He had not met them along the way.</p>
 <p>Regardless if they did or not, Qing Shui was not concerned. It would be better if they had. This way, their forces would be divided and it would be a pretty good idea to tackle them separately.</p>
 <p>The Zuoshi Clan was the symbol of Pingyang Country and it was easy to look for them. After asking around to know where the Zuoshi Clan was, Qing Shui directly flew there on the Fire Bird.</p>
 <p>Pingyang Country was about the same as Cang Lang Country, being the weakest countries. However, it was these two countries where Qing Shui and the great reputable clan Zuoshi Clan had emerged from respectively.</p>
 <p>The Zuoshi Clan was in Pingyang City and when Qing Shui saw the Zuoshi Clan's manor, he was astonished. It was too luxurious. It took up a large amount of land and the pavilions and buildings were all of a violet color which nobles used. Under the sunlight, it reflected the riches of the owner.</p>
 <p>The violet-colored glazed roof tiles and exquisite structure of the buildings were clearly the work of renowned masters. The wide front door, walls, artificial mountains, small lakes...</p>
 <p>Everything here stood out from the other buildings in the area and were things they could not be compared with. However, those who could stay near the Zuoshi Clan were no ordinary people either. They were reputable characters in Pingyang City as well.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gradually landed before the Zuoshi Clan and retrieved the Fire Bird. He lifted his head to look at the majesty of the Zuoshi Clan's manor before calling out the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>Prrrrttt!</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>The Diamond Gigantic Elephant let out a tremendous cry, before unleashing a Mighty Elephant Stomp. The Mighty Elephant Stomp, which was at the great perfection stage, had the prowess to turn this place into a flat land.</p>
 <p>Countless cracks reached out toward the Zuoshi Clan like slithering snakes . Everywhere they passed by, there would be loud booms and explosions. In just an instant, the place was filled with dust and sand, and everywhere within a one hundred meter radius had turned into a wasteland.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rose into the air on the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and looked down on the wasteland. Not long later, some people walked out from the buildings that had yet to collapse. There were people of all ages, both young and old, and there were about a hundred of them.</p>
 <p>The ones in the lead were three old men. Their white brows were so long that they reached their chests, and with their long white hair, they gave off the feeling of an immortal. It was just that the vicious gazes in their eyes had ruined their image.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gave it some thought and could understand why. Ordinary people would definitely not create such a luxurious manor like how the Zuoshi Clan did. The Zuoshi Clan had the resources, and was a great reputable clan who had stayed away from conflicts with the rest of the world. In Greencloud Continent, it was one of the top existences and even if they were to do anything in Greencloud Continent, no one would be able to do anything to them, nor would they dare to. The feeling of superiority in such a great clan was something that was incomparable.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sensed that the first three elderly and the four behind them were of Martial Saint level, with the strength of one star to three stars. The three in front were all at two stars of strength with the old man with a strong build in the middle closer to three stars. (One star is equivalent to 10,000 countries of strength.)</p>
 <p>There were seven of them here. Including the four who had died in the Qing Clan, there were eleven of them. From the looks of it, it seemed like they viewed Qing Shui in high regard. This should be about a third of the Zuoshi Clan's powers. When Qing Shui recalled the number of experts they had sent to Greencloud City, he was still very astonished.</p>
 <p>"You're Qing Shui?" The old man stared at Qing Shui, his deep eyes were cold like blades. His gaze appeared to be very complicated when he looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was not surprised that they could guess who he was. Zuoshi Yun must have said everything when he came back, Moreover, he would probably be the only one who dared to come looking for trouble.</p>
 <p>Zuoshi Hu looked at Qing Shui. Till now, he couldn't understand why he was here. No matter what, he couldn't believe that Qing Shui was here to kill them.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was very happy. Seven. He can just kill the seven of them first. At least this wouldn't have been a wasted trip. After avoiding their strongest people, he can return to catch them unaware after cleaning up here.</p>
 <p>"That's right. The Zuoshi Clan is truly something. To think that only the few of you are here to guard the place." Qing Shui smiled in the air and said.</p>
 <p>Zuoshi Hu and the others leaped into the air to Qing Shui's height. They stared at Qing Shui, not daring to be careless. Zuoshi Yun had said that Zuoshi Long's death was very simple and took only a short moment. This information had made them feel overwhelmed.</p>
 <p>To be able to beat up Zuoshi Long to that extent, it would require at least a strength of two and a half stars. It was because Zuoshi Long had an amulet which could allow him to fend off at most 2000 countries of strength when he received damage.</p>
 <p>"Young man, you must die today." The old man looked at Qing Shui and drew out his greatsword. The sword was five feet in length, four inches wide, and flashing a silvery light all over.</p>
 <p>The rest of the people had also drawn their weapons. There were also two old men who called out two "Black Ember Demonic Tigers". They were a type of mutated beast which were originally "Whitecloud Tigers" and had a 10% chance of mutating into Black Ember Demonic Tigers after taking the "Black-flame Devil Flower". If they didn't succeed in the mutation, what awaited them would only be death.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could sense that these two "Black Ember Demonic Tigers" had the abilities of about 10,000 countries of strength. Furthermore, they could spew out Black-flame Devil Fire to attack. Although the prowess would be slightly weaker than the Fire Bird's Hell's Inferno, it was still a horrifying attack.</p>
 <p>He held the Thunder God and Violet Gold Divine Shield in his hands as he gradually increased his level. These two items were like divine artifacts to Qing Shui. As long as he had them, he would have the confidence to create a whole new world.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't apply any poison on the Thunder God. Poison would damage weapons. Natural poison weapons were the exception. Using poison to temper them would be a great nourishment to them.</p>
 <p>The 1000 Years Coldsteel had cold poison in it and poison could be used to temper it. Qing Shui felt that if he were to come across 10,000 Years Coldsteel in the future, he could consider making poison weapons from it and then nurture and temper them with poison. With the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and his [Poison Scriptures], he would be able to stand his ground just with poison weapons and poison alone.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out the card he had obtained from refining the White Jade Jiao and slapped it on himself. A cool feeling surge through his body and his limbs gradually turned icy cold, but it was as if Qing Shui had not felt anything. On the contrary, he felt that it was very comfortable.</p>
 <p>Even the Violet Gold Divine Shield and the Thunder God had become piercingly cold.</p>
 <p>"Everyone, attack! To think that he's also a Demon Refiner..." The old man in the lead bellowed out anxiously before dashing toward Qing Shui, slashing down with his great sword.</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demons!</p>
 <p>The Diamond Gigantic Elephant attacked with its Vajra Subdues Demons while Qing Shui's Fiery Golden Eyes and Emperor's Qi were activated in an instant. He then smashed down hard with his Thunder God.</p>
 <p>State of One with Elephant!</p>
 <p>Thunder Strike！</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The elder was sent flying by Qing Shui's attack and Qing Shui could see that a thin layer of ice fog had appeared on the old man's body, slowing down his speed. He recalled that this was the effect of the crystal card he got from refining the White Jade Jiao.</p>
 <p>Additional effect: Speed reduction, frozen state. After using it, within an hour, the user's attacks would result in an opponent's speed reduction and has the chance to freeze the opponent. The duration of the frozen state would be affected by the opponent's level.</p>
 <p>Earlier, their exchange was only for a moment. Seeing how the old man was sent flying, Qing Shui had wanted to give chase. However, the other six had already surrounded him. Qing Shui was speechless. The Zuoshi Clan was truly despicable.</p>
 <p>Godly Armor Shield!</p>
 <p>Without the Big Dipper Sword, Qing Shui couldn't use the Seven Star Armored Vest. However, the Thunder God's enhancement could allow Qing Shui to have the same effect as if he was still using the Seven Star Armored Vest.</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui dashed toward the weakest person in the Zuoshi Clan. The Diamond Gigantic Elephant's Instantaneous Diamond Evasion once again demonstrated its prowess.</p>
 <p>Heaven-Shaking Attack！</p>
 <p>With a loud boom, the old man was sent flying by Qing Shui. And in that instant, a one foot thick ice layer had formed on his body.</p>
 <p>Through the ice, Qing Shui was still able to see the panic in the old man's eyes. How could he let go of this great chance?</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion!</p>
 <p>Mountain Splitting Strike！</p>
 <p>Qing Shui grabbed the opportunity, appearing next to the old man with an Instantaneous Diamond Evasion. His Thunder God smashed down on the ice block, causing the old man to disappear into thin air, not even leaving his weapon behind. Earlier, his opponents could dodge and through attacking in a group, Qing Shui had to split up his power.</p>
 <p>Now, it was not the same!</p>
 <p>When experts spar, victory would be decided in just an instant! That was a moment of life and death!</p>
