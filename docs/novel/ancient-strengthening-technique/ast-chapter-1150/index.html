 <p><strong>AST 1150 - Wish To Become Stronger, Taking the Mysterious Fruit, Danger</strong></p>
 <p>Bai Rilong looked at Qing Shui and made himself very clear. There was an indescribable arrogance to his expression that came from the deeply rooted sense of superiority he has felt as a young master from a great clan.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui didn't wish to say anything else. He had no interest in talking to people like this and compared to Bai Riyi, he detested this guy even more. However, Qing Shui continued to say calmly, "If there's nothing else, you guys can leave. I've made myself very clear. Don't easily say that you hold the reins to another person's life or death. The people who can really do that wouldn't say it all the time."</p>
 <p>"Alright, this is something you've chosen for yourself. Don't regret it. Bring him back!" Bai Rilong waved his hand, signaling the people behind him.</p>
 <p>The two middle-aged man behind him pounced toward Qing Shui directly. They were extremely fast and with just a flash, appeared before Qing Shui. There was also a faint a sharp sound of them cutting through the air.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Although they charged forth fast, they were even faster on their way back. Qing Shui casually lifted up his hands and using the Taichi Cloud Hands, sent them both flying. He was in a bad mood right now. It wasn't that he didn't dare to kill but if he were to kill, a clan like this would probably really be able to force him out of this place. There could even be people who were more powerful who could get involved in this.</p>
 <p>Right now, he didn't wish to let himself land in a fix. After all, he was an outsider and didn't know anyone here. No matter where the place was, people would work together to eliminate external forces. Right now, he had already affected the interests of many people and if the matter were to blow up, there would definitely be a lot of people who would take the opportunity to deal him an additional blow.</p>
 <p>It would be to the extent that even old man Wang and his grandson would get into trouble as well!</p>
 <p>After defeating the two men, Qing Shui directly dashed out toward Bai Rilong. In that instant, his gaze was overwhelmed with killing intent. The moment he moved, a hunchback figure next to Bai Rilong took a diagonal step forth and put out his hands to block Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>They collided and Qing Shui was forced to retreat two steps backward. The old man who had blocked Qing Shui had also retreated one step back. Right now, the tension was very tight and the air was filled with a violent aura.</p>
 <p>"If people don't offend me, I won't offend them. People who wish to take my life will definitely die before me. Bai Rilong, if I wish to kill you, I have countless ways to do so." Qing Shui's voice continued to be very calm. After he had said his piece, his figure flashed once again.</p>
 <p>Fish in Water!</p>
 <p>Taichi Golden Chi!</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Confusion Steps!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's silhouette was elusive yet was also like a falling leave that followed the direction of the wind. When the old man saw Qing Shui's movements, his expression turned grim, "Stop, stop! Let's sit down and have a good talk!"</p>
 <p>By the time Qing Shui came to a stop, he had already arrived next to Bai Rilong. With a slight brush that was fast as lightning and causing a cold gust of wind to blow, a wisp of hair floated in the air!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't say anything. Everyone's countenance turned pale and they didn't dare to move. Bai Rilong turned completely pale and he looked at Qing Shui with wide-open eyes. He wasn't able to say a single word.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gradually walked back and looked at the old man who was still stunned. "I won't kill anyone now but it doesn't mean that I won't kill in the future. I hope that you guys don't let me remember you."</p>
 <p>Bai Rilong was very resentful. Bai Riyi had told him that this young man who had came from somewhere else had great potential in blacksmithing. If he were to be brought to Bai Clan, in the future, he would definitely be of great use to Bai Clan. This person was alone by himself and was an outsider.</p>
 <p>At the mention of this guy's strength, his brother only mentioned that he was very young...</p>
 <p>Wasn't that just setting a trap for him? Bai Rilong didn't know that his younger brother's trap was for both parties while he watched from the back. No matter if the result was such that Qing Shui was brought away or killed or if Bai Rilong was the one who was hurt, crippled or even died, Bai Riyi would stand to gain from the situation.</p>
 <p>However, he must not have expected for the situation to be like this. This was the effect that Qing Shui had wanted to achieve. As for the ending result between Bai Rilong and Bai Riyi... Qing Shui had no interest in that. Right now, he only wanted to do the things before him properly.</p>
 <p>"Young lad, this is a misunderstanding..."</p>
 <p>The old man laughed awkwardly. They had pestered him and even proclaimed that his life and death were in their hands. However, the situation had gone through a complete turnaround. He hadn't expected there to be such a strong person amongst the young people. He should be considered a genius. However, he still was a little far off from the top notch geniuses in the dynasty.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at this inconspicuous old man. This old man wasn't weaker than him but was a far cry apart in terms of their speed and movements. Qing Shui was confident that against someone of a similar level, even if he couldn't kill the person instantly, he would be able to wipe them out within 3 moves.</p>
 <p>"I'm not going to say much. I don't care how powerful Bai Clan is and I don't wish to get involved with you guys but I hope that you guys won't come and bother me either. You should know what it means for someone barefooted to not be scared of a person who wears shoes. I'm still going to say the same thing. I don't wish for there to be a next time. If you don't have absolute confidence in killing me before you act, then don't. Otherwise, you'll only be left with one ending. I'll use all the means I have to kill you guys. Right, I forgot to tell you, I'm a poison master as well."</p>
 <p>As he spoke, a Five-Colored Poison Sky Python appeared in his hand. This was also considered to be quite notable amongst poisonous creatures. As the others had their faces turn pale, he put it away.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's gaze had continued to stay on Bai Rilong on the time. He didn't use his spirit energy but his gaze was extremely cold, letting people have no doubt over what he said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's earlier attack had caused Bai Rilong to have a close call with the gates of hell. The latter hadn't reached the stage where he wasn't afraid to die. If he were to die in Qing Shui's hands, he would probably be full of regret.</p>
 <p>"If you don't have anything else to say, then please leave," Qing Shui waved his hand and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had made himself very clear. They didn't stay for long. The old man turned back to have a final look before he left and was the last to go.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his temples and sat down on a chair where there was a small table right in front. Usually when he got tired from forging, it wouldn't be bad for him to sit here and have a rest.</p>
 <p>Right now, even though he had powerful forging skills, he couldn't show them off. Right now, other than Miss Yan, the others who had came by were not significant enough. If he were to really reveal his skills, he would probably have to find someone to hire him and back him up. Otherwise, it wouldn't end well.</p>
 <p>At night, Qing Shui returned to the manor. The place was very quiet and he directly entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>He continued with his cultivation daily as usual. His strength was gradually increasing and his Ancient Strengthening Technique had already entered the state where it could circulate on the spot. If he couldn't attain a breakthrough, he wouldn't be able to enter the 8th heavenly layer.</p>
 <p>He slowly circulated his Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique, which was like powerful mountains in his body, pushing forward with great strength. It was now much faster than before and very soon, it came to a stop at the 799th cycle.</p>
 <p>Ever since he reached the peak of the 7th heavenly layer, the power and speed of the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique kept on progressing. Right now, its speed and strength was many times stronger than when he had just reached the 7th heavenly layer.</p>
 <p>However, despite this, the barrier between peak of 7th heavenly layer and the 8th heavenly layer was still so sturdy that it was like a great mountain which couldn't be crossed. With its steep cliffs, it wouldn't be easy for ordinary people to be able to cross it.</p>
 <p>However, right now, Qing Shui felt that the power in his body was still insufficient. If he wished to breakthrough to the 8th heavenly layer, he would need to accumulate the powers in his body, letting them merge and flow together. When they reached the phase when they could breakthrough the barrier to the 8th heavenly layer, it would be when Qing Shui attained a new breakthrough.</p>
 <p>These days, the one thing which made Qing Shui feel the happiest was that the number of violet spots in his blood had grown increasingly. There were many more compared to the beginning. The violet colored spots connected to form something like a thin like and although the line was very thin, it held ferocious power within. The power of the Violet Bloodline was truly violent.</p>
 <p>The violet colored spots in his blood which formed a line had already extended very long throughout his body. The start and the end of the line were going to reach each other soon.</p>
 <p>This gave Qing Shui a new thought. What would happen if the line connected into one? It looked like there would be a cycle.</p>
 <p>He felt that after the two ends were connected, he might gain surprising rewards. It was just a little bit away. They would probably get connected very soon.</p>
 <p>The things which had happened for the past few days made Qing Shui feel that there was a need for him to rapidly grow stronger to the best of his abilities.</p>
 <p>Getting stronger required one to improve progressively. However, there were also things which would allow one to get stronger rapidly. It was just that such things were precious and the success rate wasn't high. Therefore, Qing Shui planned to take on the two Mysterious Fruits.</p>
 <p>The Mysterious Fruit could provide one with a small chance of going through mysterious changes, letting the body go through a qualitative change. This was what was amazing about the Mysterious Fruit. The Mysterious Fruit was also known as the Fate Fruit. If it worked out well, it would be the equivalent of giving a person a new fate.</p>
 <p>It was a pity that the Mysterious Fruit took an extremely long time to grow and the success rate was far too low. It was considered an extremely rare treasure. Even with the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui still didn't have enough of them. They were extremely rare.</p>
 <p>He had two with him this time and Qing Shui hoped that at least one of them would succeed. However, he knew that the success rate when he used the Mysterious Fruit was still very high and the few he had taken previously had all succeeded. Therefore, he felt a little more confident.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui only took the Mysterious Fruit after having adjusting his condition to its best. He then sat down cross-legged on the floor, circulating his Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. In this moment, he did his best to calm his mind down and fully absorb the powers of the Mysterious Fruit.</p>
 <p>Time passed by slowly!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui unconsciously looked into himself. The flow of his blood had become many times faster than before. Even the violet gold colored line of blood in his body was starting to spin. However, since it had yet to form a circle, a complete cycle, it was like a red line, swimming at great speed in his body. Wherever it passed by, the surrounding blood would be as if it were boiling.</p>
 <p>Nature Energy, State of Immovable as Mountains, Diamond Protection, Diamond Sword Qi, Diamond Crossing Rivers...</p>
 <p>All the martial techniques Qing Shui knew automatically circulated themselves. The feeling was very complicated. However, they circulated orderly. He felt a little anxious. At this moment, it felt as if his body was going to explode, as if many things that were not related to each other were being put and merged together.</p>
 <p>In his Dantian, there were the Emperor's Qi Pellet, Nature Energy Pellet, State of Immovable as Mountains Pellet... All these also started to circulate at great speed. They weren't just spinning very rapidly. Even their locations had changed. This caused Qing Shui to be no longer able to calm himself down.</p>
 <p>It was as if his body was going to explode at anytime. A series of tearing pains went through his body, going down to his bone marrow and then his consciousness. It was such immense pain that he couldn't even fall into a state of unconscious.</p>
 <p>Eyes closed, Qing Shui was drenched. It wasn't just from his perspiration since right now, it was as if Qing Shui was in a pool of blood.</p>
