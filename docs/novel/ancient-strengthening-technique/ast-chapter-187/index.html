 <p><strong>Chapter 187 Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 187 – Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange</strong></p>
  <p>“Master, are the sects in the competitions always the same? How do they compete?” Qing Shui dodged the playful look in Yiye’s eyes as he asked, while embracing Luan Luan who dashed over.</p>
  <p>“They are all other powerful sects and clans of Cang Lang Country. Usually, as long as they have some power, they would join and have an exchange. Initially, it was just discussions and a simple exchange of pointers. Soon, it somehow became a competition. However, there’s a limit to the number of sects who wanted to take part. The majority of those were sects or clans that brought their younger generations along to learn from the experience.</p>
  <p>Pausing for a while, Yiye once again continued, “Actually, there were only over ten sects that would compete, and all of them were the strongest powers in Cang Lang Country. For example, Torrid Fragrance Valley, Joyous Forest Sect, Giant Sword Sect, Single Sword Pavilion, and Silver Spear Luo Clan…”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui secretly took note of these names, but when he heard the names of Torrid Fragrance Sect and Joyous Forest Sect, he couldn’t help but feel weird. Involuntarily, he asked, “How did they get these names? They’re so bizarre.”</p>
  <p>“There’s always a fragrance of burning incense in the Torrid Fragrance Valley during the middle of the year. Coincidently, the sect situated there changed their name to match it.” Yiye carried the little girl as she walked together with Qing Shui towards the grand hall.</p>
  <p>“What about the Joyous Sect and the Joyous Forest Sect? Why do they have such names?” Qing Shui curiously gazed at Yiye Jiange.</p>
  <p>“Are you ignorant or pretending to be ignorant? Don’t you know what the words Joyous (??) mean?” The extraordinary beautiful visage of Yiye reddened as her pace quickened, leaving Qing Shui standing dumbly behind her.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was dumbstruck because of Yiye’s beauty as it was even more apparent and accentuated by the redness of her cheeks. Under a veil of mesmerization, Qing Shui cheekily added, “Does the word Joyous (??) mean “duo cultivation” between a male and a female?”</p>
  <p>“Hmph, you did that on purpose.” Yiye frantically rushed ahead, not turning her head back.”</p>
  <p>“I don’t have any other intentions. I’m merely curious. But is that really true? Duo-cultivation. Aren’t those sacred texts the most powerful cultivation arts…? Do we have them?”</p>
  <p>Yiye Jiange unexpectedly laughed as she heard the first part of the sentence, but even before he completed the sentence, she hurriedly used her hands to cover his mouth. Qing Shui immediately took the chance to sniff her hands, smelling the faint fragrance that was similar to that of orchids. As her soft white hands were pressed into his lips, he widened his eyes to take in the adorable shyness of Yiye Jiange.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui unconsciously stuck out his tongue and lightly licked against the surface of Yiye’s palm. Yiye gasped in shock as she retracted her hand in a panic before lightly smacking down on Qing Shui’s head.</p>
  <p>Their little movements were actually noted by Luan Luan who was in Qing Shui’s embrace. Laughing out loud, Luan Luan giggled, “Daddy is not obedient, Daddy got beaten…”</p>
  <p>After Luan Luan’s arrival, she brought a sense of vitality to the misty peak. Wherever she went, she would be surrounded by laughter. Yiye Jiange acted as though she had placed her entire hope onto this little kin of hers, and extremely doted on Luan Luan.</p>
  <p>“Master, does Luan Luan follow me to cultivate or follow you?” Qing Shui felt if Luan Luan followed him to nurture her body, there may be some additional effects such as the increment of her lifespan.</p>
  <p>After a moment of contemplation, Yiye Jiange replied, “I think it would be better if you taught her.”</p>
  <p>Time flowed by, and Qing Shui had already returned for five days. He didn’t even take a step out of Cloud Mist Peak. As for the rumors floating about in the sect, Qing Shui couldn’t be bothered by them. To him, they were nothing but a bunch of nonsense being spread by inconsiderate people.</p>
  <p>On the 5th day, there were some visitors in the mountains. Those sect members that were in charge of receiving the guests arranged for them to be on other unoccupied mountain peaks. Qing Shui sometimes would also bring the little lass to take a look.</p>
  <p>In the afternoon, a team of more than twenty visitors arrived. What attracted Qing Shui’s attention was that every one of them had a gigantic sword on their back. The sword was about five feet long, and half a foot wide. It seemed extremely clumsy and difficult to wield.</p>
  <p>The Giant Sword Sect. Qing Shui inferred that they should be from the Giant Sword Sect. The moment the Giant Sword Sect was brought up, Qing Shui was instantly reminded of the guy from the Hu Clan that fought with him for the Potential Fruit, as well as the Elder Hu from the Giant Sword Sect.</p>
  <p>In the lead, Qing Shui saw an old man with a head full of white hair, but whether or not he was the Hu Clan Elder, Qing Shui had no idea. In any case, he didn’t really like those who doted on losers. If you had the capabilities, you shouldn’t depend on the backing of your elders.</p>
  <p>The visitors came in unbroken streams, and there were many good-looking people in the crowd as well. Qing Shui unblinkingly stared at the various types of beautiful girls. There were tall girls, short girls, fleshly girls, and slim girls. As for the men, he immediately eliminated them from his line of sight because there hadn’t been someone of the younger generation who was stronger or as strong as him. At the very least, there were none in Cang Lang Country. That was why he couldn’t be bothered and would rather spend his time gazing at the pretty girls instead.</p>
  <p>A day’s worth of time passed in a hurry. Qing Shui and the little girl sat atop of the White-Feathered Condor and returned to Cloud Mist Peak on time. Currently, the White-Feathered Condor could enter and depart the Skysword Sect at will, which made it much more convenient for Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>On the 6th day, Qing Shui stood on the peak of the Skysword Sect as he observed those from the other sects. His sharp senses gave him an inconceivable ability. Especially after the Potential Fruit elevated his spiritual sense to another realm, Qing Shui used his ability with his eyes and ears to allow him to observe the speech and movements of others without being hindered. It was extremely marvelous.</p>
  <p>“How many days have you been back already? Have you forgotten about me?” A melodious voice interrupted Qing Shui. Qing Shui bitterly smiled as he gazed at Wenren Wu-Shuang. Despite not meeting her for half a year, her beauty was still unmatched as before. But now, there was a hint of pity mixed within.</p>
  <p>“Nonsense, no matter what, I would never forget my little Shuangshuang. You are one of my wifes-to-be. It’s just that we haven’t undergone the marriage ceremony. Don’t even think that I would forget about you.” After speaking, Qing Shui walked to the side of Wenren Wu-Shuang. Through their interactions, Qing Shui discovered the technique to “deal” with Wu-Shuang. He would have to be as ‘disgusting’ as possible and there would usually be unimaginably positive effects.</p>
  <p>Wenren Wu-Shuang, “…”</p>
  <p>Wenren Wu-Shuang smiled, pouting playfully as she reddened. She didn’t know how to react to the intimate term that Qing Shui called her by earlier. She felt something in between happiness and helplessness.</p>
  <p>“That little girl…”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was speechless. “Others may not know me, but you should know me better than that. In any case, how would I have such a big daughter?” Qing Shui had a bitter expression on his countenance.</p>
  <p>The expression on his face caused Wu-shuang to burst out laughing.</p>
  <p>“Wu-shuang, let’s go take a look at the visitors.” Qing Shui pulled Wu-shuang along as he returned back to his original position.</p>
  <p>Wenren Wu-shuang casted a glare at Qing Shui, but didn’t resist as she willingly allowed herself to be pulled by him.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui once again glanced down at the mountain path. At this moment, there were over ten young male and female cultivators. The females were all dressed in court attire, their tight fitting dresses accentuated their beautiful figures, and exuded tremendous charm with every step they took. Their full and rounded bums created swish-swaying motions from each step which seemed to be filled with a demonic grace.</p>
  <p>“Wu-Shuang, which sect do all these males and females come from?” Qing Shui inquired.”</p>
  <p>“Joyous Forest Sect and Joyous Sect.” Wenren Wu-shuang gently replied.</p>
  <p>He didn’t get the answer he sought after from his goddess master. Now that they were in his sights, how could he let this chance slip away?</p>
  <p>To his surprise, the looks of the females could all be considered top-class, but especially their figures. They were bewitchingly attractive while the guys were all masculine and handsome.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui bewilderedly glanced at Wu-Shuang as he inquired, “Why are they named the Joyous Forest Sect and the Joyous Sect?”</p>
  <p>Wenren Wu-shuang went red, and didn’t explained. As she felt Qing Shui’s gaze on her, the young and innocent Wu-shuang didn’t know how to lie, and lightly explained, “I don’t know!”</p>
  <p>“Little Shuangshuang, you are so naughty! You better tell me. If not, your husband lord wouldn’t mind detoxifying poison for you once again.” Qing Shui playfully teased Wu-shuang. He loved to see the expressions on this peerless beauty’s face every time she was teased.</p>
  <p>“Are you asking for a beating!?” Wu-shuang bashfully exclaimed.</p>
  <p>“Okay, okay. I really have no idea.” Qing Shui caught ahold of her other hand, as he faced her. Both of his hands held onto Wu-shuang’s.</p>
  <p>“The Joyous Sect is located in the depths of the Joyous Forest. In the past, this place wasn’t called the Joyous Forest. Because there were many disciples of the Joyous Sect who loved to frequent the forest to have se…seek joy, the forest was eventually named the Joyous Forest. That was also why the Joyous Forest became the location of the Joyous Sect, and why all outsiders are forbidden entry.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui gazed at the extremely shy Wenren Wu-Shuang, and felt that the Joyous Sect was really dramatic. A normal forest actually got turned into a place for their disciples to engage in public s*x…</p>

Despite not meeting her for half a year, her beauty was still unmatched as before. But now, there was a hint of pity mixed within.</p>
 <p>“Nonsense, no matter what, I would never forget my little Shuangshuang. You are one of my wifes-to-be. It’s just that we haven’t undergone the marriage ceremony. Don’t even think that I would forget about you.” After speaking, Qing Shui walked to the side of Wenren Wu-Shuang. Through their interactions, Qing Shui discovered the technique to “deal” with Wu-Shuang. He would have to be as ‘disgusting’ as possible and there would usually be unimaginably positive effects.</p>
 <p>Wenren Wu-Shuang, “…”</p>
 <p>Wenren Wu-Shuang smiled, pouting playfully as she reddened. She didn’t know how to react to the intimate term that Qing Shui called her by earlier. She felt something in between happiness and helplessness.</p>
 <p>“That little girl…”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was speechless. “Others may not know me, but you should know me better than that. In any case, how would I have such a big daughter?” Qing Shui had a bitter expression on his countenance.</p>
 <p>The expression on his face caused Wu-shuang to burst out laughing.</p>
 <p>“Wu-shuang, let’s go take a look at the visitors.” Qing Shui pulled Wu-shuang along as he returned back to his original position.</p>
 <p>Wenren Wu-shuang casted a glare at Qing Shui, but didn’t resist as she willingly allowed herself to be pulled by him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui once again glanced down at the mountain path. At this moment, there were over ten young male and female cultivators. The females were all dressed in court attire, their tight fitting dresses accentuated their beautiful figures, and exuded tremendous charm with every step they took. Their full and rounded bums created swish-swaying motions from each step which seemed to be filled with a demonic grace.</p>
 <p>“Wu-Shuang, which sect do all these males and females come from?” Qing Shui inquired.”</p>
 <p>“Joyous Forest Sect and Joyous Sect.” Wenren Wu-shuang gently replied.</p>
 <p>He didn’t get the answer he sought after from his goddess master. Now that they were in his sights, how could he let this chance slip away?</p>
 <p>To his surprise, the looks of the females could all be considered top-class, but especially their figures. They were bewitchingly attractive while the guys were all masculine and handsome.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui bewilderedly glanced at Wu-Shuang as he inquired, “Why are they named the Joyous Forest Sect and the Joyous Sect?”</p>
 <p>Wenren Wu-shuang went red, and didn’t explained. As she felt Qing Shui’s gaze on her, the young and innocent Wu-shuang didn’t know how to lie, and lightly explained, “I don’t know!”</p>
 <p>“Little Shuangshuang, you are so naughty! You better tell me. If not, your husband lord wouldn’t mind detoxifying poison for you once again.” Qing Shui playfully teased Wu-shuang. He loved to see the expressions on this peerless beauty’s face every time she was teased.</p>
 <p>“Are you asking for a beating!?” Wu-shuang bashfully exclaimed.</p>
 <p>“Okay, okay. I really have no idea.” Qing Shui caught ahold of her other hand, as he faced her. Both of his hands held onto Wu-shuang’s.</p>
 <p>“The Joyous Sect is located in the depths of the Joyous Forest. In the past, this place wasn’t called the Joyous Forest. Because there were many disciples of the Joyous Sect who loved to frequent the forest to have se…seek joy, the forest was eventually named the Joyous Forest. That was also why the Joyous Forest became the location of the Joyous Sect, and why all outsiders are forbidden entry.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gazed at the extremely shy Wenren Wu-Shuang, and felt that the Joyous Sect was really dramatic. A normal forest actually got turned into a place for their disciples to engage in public s*x…</p>
