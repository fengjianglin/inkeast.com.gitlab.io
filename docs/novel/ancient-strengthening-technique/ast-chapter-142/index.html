  <p><strong>AST 0142 – Heading to Shi Clan to Bring Up A Marriage Proposal?</strong></p>
  <p><span style>The two of them quickly finished the soup, and couldn’t help but ask for two more. The feeling of being unable to stop was too tough to bear, one couldn’t hold it in!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Yu He touched her slightly bulging little stomach and stretched lazily, very satisfied. “To think that it is really such an enjoyment to have good food. No wonder everyone likes to eat delicacies!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The saints have said, food and sex is man’s nature! This shows that eating and having sex are the most enjoyable!” Qing Shui smacked his lips in satisfaction as he said.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Shameless. You just can’t stop thinking about that!” Yu He protested coquettishly!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Right, this soup, does it have the same effects of the All Aspects Nourishment Soup?” Yu He hesitated and asked Qing Shui. After all, while it was delicious, many men had come specifically for that effect.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What effect?” Qing Shui asked, puzzled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You rascal, you’ll only be satisfied after making me say it out loud. I was asking if it had the effect of making sex feel even better.” Yu He spoke so shyly that it was so charming that he was turning numb!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hehe, turtles originally did provide a boost to a man’s sexual drive. While a normal turtle is not as effective as the All Aspects Nourishment Soup, it is still nourishing. Now it is more delicious than ever. Like the black fish, while it does not have the same impact, the demand is more than the supply. But after all, not everyone wants to have the nourishment daily. Too much of the same activity will make one feel bored…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You seemed to have done it very often, knowing it so well.” Yu He threw a sideways glance toward the lad who had made a fool of her before she blinked her beautiful eyes mischievously.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Cough cough! I read from books, from books!” Qing Shui rubbed his nose awkwardly and said.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Seeing Qing Shui’s embarrassed state, Yu He smiled happily. The mature charm, added to the poised extreme beauty, it was so beautiful that it would make one go crazy and feel very tempted!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Damn it, I failed. To think that I had lost!” Qing Shui mumbled!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui, what’s the name of the fruit again? I forgot.” Yu He looked at Qing Shui with a yearning look in her eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Drunken Fragrance Fruit!” Qing Shui said as he looked towards Yu He.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do you still have any? Leave a few for sister to satisfy my craving when I have nothing better to do!” Yu He guessed that he would not have much of such good stuff!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I do, but not a lot right now!” Qing Shui gave it some thought and felt that 100 was not enough at all. He could barely supply 2 per day. After all, it would take about a month before they would ripen again. At this rate, he would not be able to keep much stock before he left next year. It was not a long term solution.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It’s good enough if there’s enough for me to eat. I’ve thought it through, once you leave, I will close down Yu He Inn!” Yu He smiled and said.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Close down? Why? Don’t you care a lot for this Yu He Inn?” Qing Shui said in surprise. He would feel guilty if he was the cause for the Yu He Inn to close down.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ve thought it through. I want to train, I want to reach Xiantian as well. When I do, I will go look for you!” Yu He seemed to be joking as she said this, but Qing Shui could sense the determination in her eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui didn’t say anything, but left the remaining two Defense-Enhancing Fruit for Yu He before he bade her goodbye. Walking out of the Yu He Inn, Qing Shui got himself a carriage!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sir, send me to Shi Clan!” Qing Shui told the middle-aged guy who had greying hair on both sides of his temples.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Alright!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>About an hour later, the horse carriage stopped outside a glorious mansion. Qing Shui stepped down from the carriage and paid the driver before taking a good look at the most luxurious mansion in all of Hundred Miles City.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Regardless whether it was the amount of land it took up, or the color it was in, they were all the most luxurious. The Shi Clan was in name, the ones in charged with Hundred Miles City. They were a reputable clan in Hundred Miles City, and even Situ Clan could not compare. However, the number of people they had who had reached Houtian was not as many as the Situ Clan.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The wide black door had a width of about 10 meters. Looking from outside, the building was in a purplish color, giving off a very grand feeling. At the two sides of the door, there were tens of guards in grey armor!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Who goes there? This is the city lord’s residence!” A lean strong man at one end who was about 30 years old stopped Qing Shui and said.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was stunned. He had always thought of the Shi Clan as the Shi Clan, and had forgotten that the Shi Clan was also the city lord’s residence. That was why there were so many guards on standby, no wonder the Shi Clan seemed so impressive. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Brother, please help me pass a message to say that Qing Clan’s Qing Shui is here to pay his respects to the Shi Clan!” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You are Qing Clan’s Qing Shui? Please hold on. The young man was also stunned, and then he quickly entered the Shi Clan.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Only then did Qing Shui discovered just how much he had become renowned, at least in Hundred Miles City! Although being renowned could be tiring, reputable people were saved a lot of trouble when they did things.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Very soon, the young man returned. “This way please, the city lord is already awaiting in the lounge!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Under the young man’s lead, Qing Shui entered the Shi Clan. Once inside, he felt that it was so spacious that it would make one puke. Artificial mountains, ponds, pavilions, statues, there was everything here!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Rows of guards kept passing by, with most of them holding swords. They looked quite impressive, as each of them stood tall and upright. After all, they were working in the name of the city lord. Each of them carried an impressive aura, leading to Qing Shui having the thought to have a look for himself one day to see how impressive the residence of Cang Lang Country’s city lord was as well.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It’s right ahead, this way please!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Hearing the young man’s words, Qing Shui raised his head, and realized that they had already reached the entrance to the lounge!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Brother, please feel free to go back to your work!” Qing Shui smiled and said this before he entered the lounge!</span></p>
  <p><span style>The furniture in the lounge was very simple. In the spacious lounge, there were only some tables and chairs, and at the very top, there was an elongated table. At that moment, there was an old man seated behind it, looking through some scrolls!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Having heard some sounds, the old man raised his head and a pair of bright and intelligent eyes looked at Qing Shui!</span></p>
  <p><span style>When Qing Shui saw the old man, he recognized him as the senior from Shi Clan who was seated at the same table with his grandpa at Qing Zi’s wedding. Therefore, when Qing Shui saw him, he immediately recognized him at one glance as the Old Master of Shi Clan, Shi Dingtian!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What a rare guest, Qing Shui, I never would have thought that you would come here!” Shi Dingtian seemed exceptionally happy when he saw Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Old Master, I’m actually here today to discuss an issue with your esteemed self.” Qing Shui bowed at Shi Dingtian in the capacity of a junior.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I dare not accept this, you are already a Xiantian cultivator, there is no need to follow such customs!” Shi Dingtian quickly said.</span></p>
  <p><span style>There was a saying in the world of the nine continents. Once a person attains Xiantian, only his elders would be able to accept his respects. As for other people, even if they were older than him, so long as they were not Xiantian, they would not be able to accept it. Otherwise their lifespan would be shortened!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui knew about all this, but to a person who would soon become his elder, he would definitely be able to accept these customary rules!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m not sure what matter Qing Shui has to discuss with this old man here?” Shi Dingtian smiled as he spoke. It was just that Qing Shui did not notice the tinge of joy in the old man’s eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I came to make make a marriage proposal!” Qing Shui raised his head to look at Shi Dingtian and slowly said.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Shi Dingtian was stunned. “My daughters are all married and have children of their own, and eight of my granddaughters are married as well, leaving two. One of them has been betrothed to someone else, and the only other one left is still a toddler. Are you mistaken?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>If Qing Shui knew that Shi Dingtian was saying all this on purpose, he would definitely say that the old man was crafty fox!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I would like for you to give me Shi Qingzhuang’s hand in marriage!”</span></p>

 <p><span style>“It’s right ahead, this way please!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing the young man’s words, Qing Shui raised his head, and realized that they had already reached the entrance to the lounge!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother, please feel free to go back to your work!” Qing Shui smiled and said this before he entered the lounge!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The furniture in the lounge was very simple. In the spacious lounge, there were only some tables and chairs, and at the very top, there was an elongated table. At that moment, there was an old man seated behind it, looking through some scrolls!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Having heard some sounds, the old man raised his head and a pair of bright and intelligent eyes looked at Qing Shui!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Qing Shui saw the old man, he recognized him as the senior from Shi Clan who was seated at the same table with his grandpa at Qing Zi’s wedding. Therefore, when Qing Shui saw him, he immediately recognized him at one glance as the Old Master of Shi Clan, Shi Dingtian!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a rare guest, Qing Shui, I never would have thought that you would come here!” Shi Dingtian seemed exceptionally happy when he saw Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Master, I’m actually here today to discuss an issue with your esteemed self.” Qing Shui bowed at Shi Dingtian in the capacity of a junior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I dare not accept this, you are already a Xiantian cultivator, there is no need to follow such customs!” Shi Dingtian quickly said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a saying in the world of the nine continents. Once a person attains Xiantian, only his elders would be able to accept his respects. As for other people, even if they were older than him, so long as they were not Xiantian, they would not be able to accept it. Otherwise their lifespan would be shortened!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui knew about all this, but to a person who would soon become his elder, he would definitely be able to accept these customary rules!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not sure what matter Qing Shui has to discuss with this old man here?” Shi Dingtian smiled as he spoke. It was just that Qing Shui did not notice the tinge of joy in the old man’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I came to make make a marriage proposal!” Qing Shui raised his head to look at Shi Dingtian and slowly said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Dingtian was stunned. “My daughters are all married and have children of their own, and eight of my granddaughters are married as well, leaving two. One of them has been betrothed to someone else, and the only other one left is still a toddler. Are you mistaken?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Qing Shui knew that Shi Dingtian was saying all this on purpose, he would definitely say that the old man was crafty fox!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I would like for you to give me Shi Qingzhuang’s hand in marriage!”</span></p>
