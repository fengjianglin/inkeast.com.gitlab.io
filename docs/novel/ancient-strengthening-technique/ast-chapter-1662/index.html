Chose Not to Stay, Lord of The Dragon King Palace</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The men of the Sunset Sea King Palace were fired up after watching the loss of another old man. All of them were strong warriors and the previous old men were apparently Divine warriors. Yet, such warriors were defeated by a single hit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Divine Grade warriors, killed in one move!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, the purple-robed old man could no longer hold himself back. He couldn't even fake his calmness anymore. Even so, he knew that himself and his men could never make it back alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the saying goes, a cornered dog would jump over the wall, let alone men who were driven to desperation. Two old men rushed towards Qing Shui simultaneously. Both of them were ancient golden-scale jiao. In fact, they ranked the highest among the rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up in the air, they transformed into the primitive state. A 1000-meter-long golden-scale jiao presented its awe-inspiring dignity. Their strength increased one half after transforming into the primitive state. This was the ability of the golden-scale jiao’s Divinity Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It's a ride or die battle. However, the discrepancy in strength was way too prominent. They were not even on the same level. The gap was still very wide despite the increase their in strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ancient golden-scale jiao’s Divinity Spirit was extremely formidable. Initially, the strength had already boosted. After changing into the primitive state, the strength improved yet another one half. Hence, the Divinity Spirit right now was not any weaker than Muyun Qingge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stretched out his body suddenly and gave out Tiger Laceration from his right hand. An enormous tiger’s claw captured an old man abruptly. Terrified, old man quickly defended himself with weapons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he had successfully blocked it, this stunning strength was not something he could withstand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't even turn around as he bluntly gave a kick from his left leg. A solid, powerful stream of vital energy came along with the shadows and left a mark on old man’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tiger Tailwhip Kick!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Qing Shui didn't practice Tiger Form until the stage of transforming change, it was still comparable to the realm of Mingyue Pavilion. Yehuang Guwu already practiced transforming change, so he's out of the context.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, everything returned back to normal. It took only 15 minutes from the moment Qing Shui appeared until the disaster happened. Within that time, three warriors of Divine grade and more than 40 formidable men vanished into ashes. How powerful the strength was. How great the scale and resolution were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Qing Shui incurred hatred with North Sea Dragon King Palace. Even if Qing Shui did not make his moves, any one of the three women could have settled the mess. Thinking of it, he wondered if he had made the wrong move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anyway, the Dragon King Palace wouldn't let go of this matter and by that time, three of them would have vast opportunities in the battle. Their current strengths had attained the next level, a truly higher level. They had totally entered the world of Divines, the circle of Divines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Mistresses didn't get involved in this battle, Qing Shui was still the Guardian of Sunset Sea King Palace. Thus, the result would still be the same. Sunset Sea King Palace had lost tens of their men but this was how unpredictably dangerous their lives were in the blood-spilling world of warriors. Hence, the situation today didn't upset the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This time for sure, we’ve incurred hatred with the North Sea Dragon King Palace,” Sunset Palace Mistress smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui grinned, “The Dragon King Palace shouldn’t be too scary. What’s intimidating is the patron behind the North Sea Dragon Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every sect should have its own patron. Although most of them had one, there was a surprising amount of them which didn’t have one. Qing Shui was only making presumption now. If there was no patron behind North Sea Dragon King Palace, then it’d be a lot easier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since there was Divine’s theory in this world, there was the existence of Divine. The existence of a lot of Divines would be unknown if the Divine’s world was left undiscovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a natural phenomenon. An ordinary man was surrounded by ordinary men in his last life. Those who worked for the authority would be surrounded by the executives. Rich merchants would meet friends. Only the warriors of Divine would meet the Divines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“North Sea Dragon King Palace’s own strength is daunting. The Dragon King is an actual dragon and it’s the branch of North Sea Dragon King. However, it’s basically just a vacant title now,” Muyun Qingge smirked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“North Sea Dragon King?”, Qing Shui pondered. North Sea Dragon King was reckoned to be one of the very best and the most powerful in North Ocean Domain. Since they run in inheritance, this North Sea Dragon King Palace should be a branch of it. Their ancestor should be North Sea Dragon King. Yet, throughout the years of passing on to the younger generations, these branches couldn’t find their settlements. Hence, they’re unable to remain in the actual North Sea Dragon Palace by the North Sea Dragon King!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dragon King of the Four Seas were no ordinary people. Each of them was at the abyss of their own Ocean Domain. Their strengths were enormous and extensive. They were the rulers of the waters, empowered the power of Five Elements Water to the ultimate level. Their influences were not to be neglected no matter where they were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry. The North Ocean Domain is vast and boundless. There are thousands and more of capable later generations of North Sea Dragon Palace. Every single day, they lost some of their men from the North Sea Dragon King Palace. They wouldn’t mind such loss. They wouldn’t even notice it.” Sunset Palace Mistress was confident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then, do you think North Sea Dragon King Palace would send their men here again?” Qing Shui contemplated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can’t be sure of that. After all, they lost three warriors of Divine. Regardless of their strengths, they’re still warriors of Divine. Logically, they would still come,” Yiye Jiange speculated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui agreed. At the level of the North Sea Dragon King Palace, they’re more willing to die than to be cowards. Moreover, they should have stronger warriors, maybe not too powerful, or else they wouldn’t have separated from the North Sea Dragon Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ll wait and see then. This time, we’d know what to do,” Qing Shui smirked at the three Mistresses. Deep down, he was overjoyed that things had settled down and essentially out of danger now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three Mistresses decided not to go to the North Ocean Domain and remained at this Ice Ocean Domain. They wanted to expand their strengths here and rule the whole Ice Ocean Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui agreed as well. After all, there were only a few capable men in Sunset Sea King Palace aside from the three Mistresses. The Divine warriors could only suppress the condition. The False God warriors were the ones who truly risked their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Especially the Peak False God warriors!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui really wished that the men from the Dragon King Palace would come and solve the things here earlier. The strengths of three Mistresses wouldn’t come to a pause. Nevertheless, Qing Shui only wanted them to focus on preservation and stabilization during this period, needless to force on pursuing breakthroughs.</span></p>

This time, not many men came, only five of them. Also, they didn’t just come and kill people at once like before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We are from North Sea Dragon Palace. Please meet us!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A deep voice filled the air. That was when Qing Shui and the three Mistresses felt the opponent’s vigor. As the voice was about to continue, four of them had already come out to face five men from the counterpart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Four old men and one middle-aged man were here. The middle-aged man was good-looking and mature, giving out a sense of awe and generosity. This man stood in the middle, indicating his high ranking in Dragon King Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui initially didn’t plan to speak. Likewise, the Mistresses didn’t either. They only stared at Qing Shui, their intentions were implied by their slight smiling expressions. Qing Shui shook his head helplessly, “Why did you come to us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui held the initiatives as the way they approached signified that they were willing to give in. From that, Qing Shui could verify that perhaps they didn’t have a patron behind them. Also, the Dragon King Palace’s strength might be limited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most realistic possibility was that they came to scout for the actual strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You must be Qing Shui. We came with the deepest sincerity, as you could probably see.” The man put on a joyful expression. Apparently, the loss of Dragon King Palace warriors didn’t infuriate him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked pleased too. Looking at the man across, he could still sense their strengths. The most compelling one was the middle-aged man, whose strength was 3000 Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was startled. This man would definitely be extremely powerful and daunting in the future, and perhaps even return to North Sea Dragon Palace. Qing Shui plotted his strategy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes. I could see that, but what made you come here?” Qing Shui gazed at the man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Speaking of that, I would like to have a duel with Mr. Qing. Regardless of the result, everything between Dragon King Palace and Sunset Sea King Palace would be written off with one stroke. What do you think?” The man was full of uncertainty and yet, he had to step forward. Nevertheless, he was quite confident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui would not believe his words. That was his way of offense and defense at the same time. They didn’t say to quit upon deaths. In the case of victory, they would probably neglect their previous words and demolish Sunset Sea King Palace. In the case of defeat, they could have the chance to return. It was never too late to take revenge even if it were to take ten years, a hundred years or even a thousand years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was actually eager for a fight. It’s not easy to meet a competitor who absolutely had known himself, or at least had known a little bit through the previous experience of fifty men being killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, Qing Shui had his own plans too. He smiled and said, “Sure. Swords have no eyes, so everyone better watch out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui spurted out his statement before the opponent could say anything. The man couldn’t repeat what Qing Shui had said, so he could only smile, “You too, have to watch out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man’s name was Ao Xuri. He was the Lord of Dragon King Palace. God blessed the innate talents as he had been ruling the Dragon King Palace for some time. This time, he met the most intractable case, which gave him no choice but to give in. If his competitor was much stronger than himself, it was acceptable to just surrender. However, if the competitor was weaker, then he shouldn’t give in. He should benefit the most by risking all that he had.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was also because he had seen the three Mistresses. He was also a man who couldn’t escape from the customs. The stronger a man was, the stronger his possessive desire was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui certainly noticed his intentions. Also, because of that, Qing Shui decided his further plans. He didn’t show it on his face and remained calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took out his Golden Battle Halberd. He wouldn’t underestimate his opponents the slightest bit this time. He gave it his all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Phoenix Battle Intent, Battle God Halo!</span></p>

His aura was upgraded. His hand was holding a Silver Halberd, which was similar to Qing Shui’s Golden Battle Halberd and it was shining moonlight halo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A weapon that existed beyond the legends. Qing Shui wasn't surprised since he was the Lord of Dragon King Palace.</span></p>
