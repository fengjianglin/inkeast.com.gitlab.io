 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, Qing Shui used it this time in order to test it, rather than expecting that it would work. He was not that clear about the actual strength of Seal of Xuantian, or at least he didn’t know if it would work against the Ghostly Fire that was currently in front of him. He has already got the Nine Continents Mountain prepared for emergencies. Once the Seal of Xuantian failed to block it, he would immediately unleash the Nine Continents Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Speaking of the Nine Continents Mountain, ever since it went up to its third level, its progress has halted. It also took a long time for it to break through from its second level up to its third level. However, after so many years, it eventually managed to break through a number of stages and achieved its current sixth level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The realm of the Nine Continents Mountain was related to Qing Shui’s strength. The strength of the Nine Continents Mountain was always three times Qing Shui’s overall strength. This was its power when it reached its sixth level. Though this could already be considered a fearsome progress, Qing Shui was still not satisfied with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Qing Shui’s current strength that was worth nearly four million Dao Force, the strength of the Nine Continents Mountain was already worth almost twelve million Dao Force. Not only so, but the Nine Continents Mountain also contained the power of multiple Shield Attacks. It could be said that even the Grand State Master prior to being weakened might not be able to block the Shield Attack of the Nine Continents Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He would definitely be pushed back once he encountered it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also one of Qing Shui’s main sure-kill move. Not only could he use it to go head to head against his opponents, but it could also act as a defense for him. The actual strength of the Nine Continents Mountain when being controlled definitely surpassed the strength that was only seen from the surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also one of the factors why Qing Shui was confident that he could face off against the Grand State Master and maybe even kill him here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui really appreciated the time he got to battle. He wanted to stabilize his own strength. He also didn’t wish to expose too many of his weapons so soon to make sure he didn’t inadvertently alert the enemies. For example, the Nine Continents Mountain… Actually, it would require him to luck up to a certain extent in order to push back the Grand State Master or even injure him. After all, the opponent’s strength still surpassed the Nine Continents Mountain. The most important function of the Shield Attack was to push back the opponent. It only increased the damage caused by a small amount. Nevertheless, if the opponent released his strength outwards but got pushed back by the Nine Continents Mountain, it would be hard to say whether or not it could deal serious injuries to the opponent. This would depend on how well the opponent was controlling his power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Seal of Xuantian immediately bombarded the Ghostly Fire and caused them to disappear. Qing Shui felt very delighted after seeing that. It seemed that the Seal of Xuantian was still quite a dominant technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, the Grand State Master didn’t seem all that surprised with the fact that his Ghostly Fire was destroyed. He once again swung his sword and charged his way towards Qing Shui. It seemed a close distance fight was about to unravel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ha!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Grand State Master let out a short yell. His voice sounded heavy and sharp. Followed by his yell, the body of the Grand State Master extended by about half a meter. As of now, he was almost the same height as Qing Shui. Not only has he grown significantly taller, but his body figure has also started to resemble that of an ape. Compared to before, his body has gotten half a meter wider and thicker. His entire body was pitch black in color just like a black ape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Diamond Ghost King!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, so you are the Diamond Ghost King.” Some details and techniques of the Diamond Ghost King appeared within Qing Shui’s consciousness. These were all passed onto him by the Golden Battle God. All of these flashed through his mind like lightning, yet they were all imprinted clearly within his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a moment, Qing Shui really wanted to thank the Golden Battle God whom he received his inheritance from. He has given him too much, particularly the informations which he gave him now, it played a very huge importance, for example, Qing Shui would know what the Diamond Ghost King specialized in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Golden Battle God Inheritor, there will eventually come a time when we will have to battle against each other, let’s put an end to this today!” The huge man’s heavy noise sounded just like a thunder strike. His entire body was black in color.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the informations which appeared in Qing Shui’s head, he was able to interpret that the huge guy wasn’t as simple as its name implied. Diamond… Its entire body was incomparably tough. Furthermore, it also possessed a poisonous body. Its body was the greatest storage for poisons. It was capable of constantly releasing toxic. Furthermore, the Diamond Ghost King’s speed and power was also very aggressive and dominant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman’s eyes turned bright upon hearing what they said. However, she remained silent and only looked at Qing Shui curiously before moving her sight onto the Black Diamond monster opposite of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was also aware of the things which revolved around the Battle God Inheritance and also the Demon Lord and Ghost King Inheritances respectively. Back in ancient times, fights would constantly break out between the Battle Gods against both the Demon Lords and Ghost Kings. Their inheritance was passed down through battles. Apparently, the cultivations of many Ghost Kings and Demon Lords were very ruthless. They even carry out massacre across an entire city for their own cultivations. The Battle Gods, on the other hand, were tasked with the mission to stop them. Just like that, they became enemies. It was unknown how many years have passed since then, but until now, the mission still existed across the continents. Each of the warriors who received the Battle God Inheritance would inherit the mission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Today, even if you don’t wish to put an end to this, you will still have no choice but to do it.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brat, don’t just know how to talk nonsense.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You will know later, whether or not it’s nonsense.” Qing Shui’s body began emitting intense battle intention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If that’s the case, I will show you, the difference between us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment when the Grand State Master finished speaking, his figure sprung out. His movement didn’t contain any sense of beauty. However, it was able to give people a strong feeling that it was incomparably aggressive. He immediately unleashed a deadly tornado with both of the blades in his hands and covered Qing Shui and the woman within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Qing Shui was able to clearly detect that the Grand State Master’s strength has increased drastically, it might have recovered back his strength, which left Qing Shui unable to imagine how strong exactly he would have become if he hadn’t weakened his opponent. Without a doubt, it would have definitely gone beyond twenty million Dao Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The speed of the Grand State Master at the moment was very fast. This speed was still his speed after half of it was reduced. Qing Shui raised the aura around his body to its peak. He unleashed the Golden Battle Halberd in his hand with techniques from the Nine Stances of Ancient Divine Battle Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A loud and heavy ear-splitting noise came through. Qing Shui immediately got blown away by the heavy force. At the moment he got blown away, he grabbed the woman along.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, it was a very aggressive force!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui might have been blown away, but due to his formidable resistance towards attacks, he managed to withstand the attack without being inflicted with any damage. It was like when an enormous bear clashed against a tree, the tree wouldn’t be damaged. Nevertheless, he must still admit that his opponent was bold and powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following on, the Grand State Master began unleashing his strength like an endless storm. He continuously swung both of the blades in his arms, leaving behind waves after waves of sword afterimages.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui never expected the Grand State Master to still possess speed like this. For a moment, he was only able to withstand the attacks up to a certain extent. At the same time, he also needed to look after the woman. After all, he would still need to rely on her if he truly wanted to beat the Black Diamond Ghost King. He has even unleashed his Paragon Strike only to realize that it didn’t work. From here, it could be concluded that the Nine Continents Mountain could only help to ensure that he stayed alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, Qing Shui wasn’t really worried about it. He felt that he was currently in a position where he wouldn’t lose.</span></p>

While being grabbed by Qing Shui, she was constantly dodging away from the attacks and occasionally being blown away. The power of the Grand State Master was too aggressive. Also, his black body which resembled a diamond, the woman wondered if she could cut open the opponent’s body with the Poison Dragon Dagger in her hand.</span></p>

Initially, Qing Shui had planned to use his poison, but then he knew that if he didn’t break open the body of the Diamond Ghost King, no poison would work against it.</span></p>

The current Bloodthirsty Demonic Vine was no doubt also quite fearsome. The bloody red vines with the thickness comparable to that of an elephant, along with the sharp barbs across its body, were tightly wrapped around the Grand State Master.</span></p>

He seemed to be unable to break free from the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines. Something worth noting was that the binding force of the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines was not in the least inferior to the current Grand State Master. Prior to this, Qing Shui had thought about using the Thunderous Beast to provide aids for the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines, but he never expected for such a coincidence to happen, that he would lose his focus and allowed the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines to succeed in capturing him.</span></p>

And right at this moment, his figure suddenly disappeared from the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines.</span></p>
