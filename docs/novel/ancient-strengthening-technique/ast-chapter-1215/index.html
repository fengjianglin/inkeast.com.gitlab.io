 <p><strong>AST 1215 - Qing Shui's Guess, Meeting Tian Jiange Once Again, Lord Sect</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui was like a very famished person right now. He felt like he was looking at a table of delicacies but was unable to eat it. Because he was too hungry, if he were to eat, he would die from overstuffing himself. However, the temptation kept coming at him, and he would even be willing to accept the fate of being stuffed to death.</p>
 <p>Thankfully, Qing Shui had yet to reach the phase where he was going to die of hunger. Furthermore, he already had the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and that could be considered as a very big step forward. Therefore, he wanted to suppress his urges. Unless there were special circumstances, he would not refine it for now. Qing Shui had a feeling that he would be able to refine it very soon, but he needed to reach a turning point.</p>
 <p>The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant could already handle many situations right now. Moreover, Qing Shui's own abilities weren't weak. For someone his age, he was definitely one of the top. However, it was a pity that those in the range of a hundred to two hundred years old were also considered to be young. To people with very long life spans, Qing Shui's age wasn't his only heaven-defying advantage.</p>
 <p>Cultivation, boring cultivation. Qing Shui had spent a lot of his time on the Seal of Roc and on Taichi. Right now, Qing Shui's primary mission was to focus on confining and tempering his body.</p>
 <p>The reason he didn't dare to refine was because he was afraid that his body and spirit energy would be unable to handle it. However, when he thought of the Violet Golden Bloodline, Nine Yang Golden Body, Golden Star, his consciousness, and the Yin-Yang Image, Qing Shui still felt very consoled. At the very least, he felt that the success rate was still very high. As long as the required time arrived, he would be able to just refine it directly. At that moment, he would feel his abilities soar tremendously.</p>
 <p>He would still require a very long time before the Eight-Eight Divine Nebula Formation. Qing Shui wasn't anxious right now. He would guard the treasure cover until the opportunity to harvest arrived. When the time came, he might just become a god in the human world.</p>
 <p>False God!</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui thought of this, he sensed a rustic feeling. They said that a False God was a god on earth, but he wasn't astonished by this at all. He had always held an admiration for this realm, finding it especially mysterious.</p>
 <p>At the very least, he hadn't heard of anyone who was a False God. It was a legendary existence that was at the same level as a Demon Immortal. The other thing that Qing Shui didn't know was if he could reach the False God realm if he were to refine that powerful energy.</p>
 <p>He kept getting the feeling that he wouldn't!</p>
 <p>It was because he felt that the False God realm wasn't something which could be attained so easily!</p>
 <p>8th heavenly layer... The 8th heavenly layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique... Qing Shui felt that he might have to attain a breakthrough to the 8th heavenly layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique before he could reach the False God realm. However, the doors to the 8th heavenly layer had remained tightly shut for all this time, with no signs of loosening up.</p>
 <p>Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p>Perhaps it could be the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Qing Shui seemed to have understood something. It was only a guess, but he had a very strong feeling that he would only have a chance of attaining the 8th heavenly layer after the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had leveled up.</p>
 <p>"Forget it. I better work hard in my cultivation. Maybe everything will just fall into place when the time comes." Qing Shui gently rubbed his head, which was starting to swell up from all these thoughts.</p>
 <p>"Even if I can't reach the 8th heavenly layer, I must try to absorb that powerful energy as soon as possible. Even if it is relying on the powering up of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's abilities, I must reach the top of the world." Qing Shui gritted his teeth as he seemed to have found his direction.</p>
 <p>It was because of Di Chen, it was because he needed to look for that man. He might even have to look for the Demon Lord...</p>
 <p>The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was a Heaven and Earth Battle Beast and its progress in the future would still be very fast. When the time came, with his unique physique, he would just need to refine the powers he got from the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant in order to increase his prowess by a lot.</p>
 <p>Usually, he would only need to cultivate Taichi and train up his body. His bones and physique were considered quite good as it was. After all, his Nine Yang Golden Body was at the large success stage and he also had the Violet Golden Bloodline and other things.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui only came out when the time he could use in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was up. The day was just starting to light up and he got up, planning to head out to do his morning practice. He saw from a distance that the girl was practicing.</p>
 <p>She should have just woken up not long ago. When she saw Qing Shui, she greeted him with 'Master' before she continued to practice her Taichi Fist.</p>
 <p>As she swung her arms, she created a black-reddish whirlpool which exuded a terrifying engulfing power and a very rustic feeling. She was using the Duality Steps and seemed to be extremely familiar with the skill.</p>
 <p>As the saying went, practice makes perfect. When one had achieved a level of mastery, one would be able to incorporate their own style. It was same for arts in Qing Shui's previous life.</p>
 <p>The girl had only picked up the Taichi and could be considered to have reached quite a good level. Qing Shui felt that he could teach her other things, but she mustn't be lax in her Taichi training either since it was required to suppress that pernicious aura within her. It was basically something that mustn't be discarded in her entire life.</p>
 <p>They finished up their morning practice, but they didn't just stop there. They merely finished up the Taichi Fist practice. Qing Shui started to teach her the Tiger Form. When one cultivated this to a great height, one would be able to establish a foothold in the world just with the Tiger Form alone.</p>
 <p>The girl seemed to have a great interest in the Tiger Form as well. She learned it very seriously. When Qing Shui saw her occasional eagerness to learn, he felt happy as well. After all, she was just a kid. He hoped that she could become happy just like any other people, having people and things that she loved.</p>
 <p>In the late afternoon, the four of them rode on the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and headed for the deeper area of the Huge Desolated City. Qing Shui felt that a great boost to his courage now that he had the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. Even Yan Jinyu and the Seventh Princess felt a lot more courageous.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui still let them work together to kill off the enemies for training and for gaining battle experience, It was also for them to practice the combination attacks. If they could acquire Qing Shui's unique combination attacks, they would be able to work together with others even if they didn't know of this. For example, in a chaotic battle situation, they could move through the crowd with ease, occasionally working with others to deal a killer move.</p>
 <p>This was the effect that Qing Shui wanted. Therefore, he got them to work together and kept on practicing.</p>
 <p>When they encounter powerful demonic beasts, Qing Shui would let the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant take action. He kept on getting Demon Nuclei.</p>
 <p>There were many uses for Demon Nuclei. They could be used for forging tools, refining demons, setting up formations, or be taken by demonic beasts directly. Sometimes, they could even be taken directly by humans. However, there were many restrictions to having either demonic beasts or humans taking them directly. For example, demonic beasts could only eat the Demon Nuclei of demonic beasts which were of the same type. Furthermore, there were high risks and low chances of success.</p>
 <p>It was even more dangerous for humans. Basically, no one would even dare to try. There were only records of legends which had been passed down. Demon Nuclei were generally used for refining demons, forging, and setting up formations.</p>
 <p>They had also encountered two demonic beasts with the strength of about 400,000 stars. Qing Shui had dealt with the two of them himself. He first weakened them with his Emperor's Qi and then engaged them in a long battle with his battle techniques. These two demonic beasts were incomparable to the Fire Dragon. Even an adolescent Fire Dragon was very powerful. if not for the fact that he had the Demon Refining Furnace, even if it was poisoned and blinded, Qing Shui might not have confidence in killing it. It was because he wasn't sure if the poison could get into the Fire Dragon's brain and if it would be lethal.</p>
 <p>Dragon species had a strong resistance to poison. If it hadn't been attacked through its eyes, thus inflicting damage to its brain, probably nothing would work.</p>
 <p>If it was a mature dragon, Qing Shui's Coldsteel Beads wouldn't even be able to penetrate its eyelid, let alone its reverse scale. It would be able to kill Qing Shui instantly.</p>
 <p>This was also the greatest level Qing Shui could manage to fight against at the moment. As long as it was a level he could manage, he wouldn't let the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant handle it. He would only get its help to deal with those he was unable to manage.</p>
 <p>The Huge Desolated City was too big. On the way, Qing Shui didn't encounter that many people from the Heaven Secrets Academy. Qing Shui wasn't sure how many of them had come but it was really nothing to put in several hundreds of thousand people into the Huge Desolated City.</p>
 <p>The four of them gradually got closer to the extreme southwest location in Huge Desolated City. It was also the closest spot to theDesolate Mountain Regions, and the demonic beasts they encountered also got increasingly strong.</p>
 <p>There also encountered ten demonic beasts once, each with a strength of close to 500,000 nimbus. Without any hesitation, Qing Shui let the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant use the Mighty Dragon Elephant’s Recklessness to go on a killing spree. This was when he was glad he had the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. If he didn't have it, even escaping might pose a problem. If the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant wasn't as strong as it was now, Qing Shui wouldn't dare to enter so deep into area either.</p>
 <p>The city walls had long been turned into flat land. There was not a single person to be seen. People who could reach this place were all strong experts, or at the very least, a group of core disciples or teachers.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui now knew why there was a reason to get people to join groups. In such an environment, if they didn't form teams, their progress would be very slow. Moreover, if it was just a few, over ten of them, or even up to a hundred of them encountered such a mission, they wouldn't dare to come here either since there was no assurance for their lives.</p>
 <p>After storing the Demon Nuclei, Qing Shui tossed the corpses into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal as well. After all, there was plenty of space there and these corpses were filled with treasures. At the very least, they were useful to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had just cleaned up the place when several tens of people appeared. When they saw Qing Shui, they flew over rapidly.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange!</p>
 <p>With his first glance, Qing Shui saw Tian Jiange at the back of the group. He still remained as handsome. Qing Shui hadn't expected to meet Tian Jiange here and Tian Jiange was also very surprised to see Qing Shui here. However, he still smiled and walked over.</p>
 <p>"We meet again. I knew that you'd come to the Heaven Secrets Academy. I just didn't expect it to be so soon. Are we considered friends now?" Tian Jiange seemed very happy to see Qing Shui. He didn't seem to be affected by his defeat under Qing Shui’s hands previously.</p>
 <p>"Of course. As long as you're willing, we're friends, true friends." Qing Shui smiled and said. He then turned to look at the other people. They were all middle-aged men who seemed slightly older. However, Qing Shui knew that they were definitely not young. Those people who had the ability to come here were definitely not to be underestimated.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess had said that people with the strength of 800,000 nimbus were Grade Four State Masters. Qing Shui wasn't sure what the strength of a Peak Grade Four State Master was. The Eldest Princess didn't say anything and Qing Shui didn't know if she was aware of it either.</p>
 <p>The people on the opposite side seemed to be very taken aback to see Qing Shui and the others here as well. They could sense that their abilities were definitely insufficient for them to be here. However, they didn't ask but just looked on happily.</p>
 <p>"Brother Qing Shui. It's dangerous for you guys to be here. Why don't you join us?" Tian Jiange frowned as he looked at them seriously and said.</p>
 <p>This time around, Qing Shui smiled and agreed. He could see the sincerity in Tian Jiange's eyes and that there were no other hidden intentions. Tian Jiange was either an intelligent person or a broadminded one.</p>
 <p>"Alright, then I'll trouble Brother." Qing Shui wasn't worried. With the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, he could now handle many situations.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui found the feeling of being a Beast Tamer once again. He had a strong yearning to be able to stand behind a myriad of demonic beasts, and with a wave of his hand, send them forward like a wave of beasts. It would definitely be an exhilarated feeling!</p>
 <p>Working together to kill demonic beasts, killing Qing Shui discovered as they chatted that Tian Jiange was a person with great magnanimity. Furthermore, he also got to know that Tian Jiange belonged to the other great faction in the Heaven Secrets Academy, the Lord Sect.</p>
 <p>Lord Sect was a sect that was of equal standing with Saint Child Band and was also quite strong within the Heaven Secrets Academy. They had close to 100,000 members and Tian Jiange was one of Lord Sect's elite disciples. Although he was only an elite disciple now, he would become a core disciple very soon.</p>
