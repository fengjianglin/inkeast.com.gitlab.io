After a long while, Hu Jiang said, “You said your friend is a Battle God and he wants to join the Divine Palace?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded, “Is there anything wrong?”</span></p>

I wonder when can your friend come?” Hu Jiang was excited to hear Qing Shui’s reply. He was more excited than Qing Shui. The reward was abundant to invite a Battle God to join the Divine Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My friend stays a bit further from here, but he should be here soon. I will fetch him over in a few days, but I wonder if I could visit the Divine Palace now. Can I join the Divine Palace?” Qing Shui looked at Hu Jiang. He could not confirm if this was the Divine Palace he was searching for, but it felt right. It must be closely related even if it was not the right one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course you can, let’s go back together. I’ll introduce my leader to you,” Hu Jiang nodded.</span></p>

There should be Redcloud Grass here. He could collect it together with the Tilted Moon Branch and Lightning Fruit. If he failed, he could only search on his own later. Once decided, Qing Shui headed to the Divine Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Divine Palace was located in the Northern Emperor Domain, in the Northern Emperor City. The Taiyi Immortal Palace was here too. They were the two biggest forces in the Northern Emperor Domain, their relationship was also good. The situation of ‘a man cannot brook a rival’ did not happen to the Taiyi Immortal Palace and Divine Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were located far apart, at two different directions of the Northern Emperor City. However, they were both positioned at the North. Besides, they were situated on the same mountain across the Northern Emperor City, the Northern Emperor Mountain. Though they were both based in the mountain, they were far away as the Northern Emperor City was too big.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Battle God Team was capable and had special rides, Qing Shui rode on the mutated White Tiger Eagle King and headed to the Northern Emperor Mountain.</span></p>

There was no exact origin of the name. However, it was changed to Northern Emperor Mountain because of the Northern Emperor Domain and Northern Emperor. This was the pride of the Northern Emperor Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Northern Emperor Mountain was the largest mountain range in the Northern Emperor City and also the Northern Emperor Domain. It lied across the Northern Emperor City and occupied more than half of the Northern Emperor Domain.</span></p>

As he walked, a thumping vibrating sound was heard as if a hill was walking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Violent Battle God Inheritor! Violent Battle God!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The big guy had normal attire. He looked humble, honest, and gentle. It was hard to imagine a man like this to be violent. However, one should never judge a book from its cover, Qing Shui trusted his instinct more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Didn’t you say your friend is the Battle God? Isn’t that your own identity? It is so troublesome to twist the words. Oh, you must be worried about the Divine Palace. I can understand that,” The big guy was very honest, but his eyes were so agile as he spoke. This was an active big man who looked very humble when he kept quiet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was surprised that this guy could recognize that he was a Battle God at once. Listening to the big guy, the Battle God Team was extremely stunned. They looked at this young man in disbelief, how could he be the Battle God?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The big guy seemed to be interested in Qing Shui. He watched Qing Shui and said, “Do you wanna have a fight?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was not surprised. The Violent Battle God was the most warlike among the Battle Gods, that saying was true. Qing Shui was keen for a fight too, he nodded, “Okay!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the foot of the mountain, so it was very spacious here. The big guy gripped his fists and smiled at Qing Shui, “You can use your weapons, my fists are my weapons.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, I will use my weapons when I have to, please!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The big guy dashed towards Qing Shui directly. His steps were unique like a moving snake. It was weird for a big guy to do such moves, but he was extremely agile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A snake’s steps and speed! The Violent Battle God got his name for the strong and terrific strength. The combination of strength and speed was daunting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soaring Attack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The big guy was strangely fast. He gave out a fist attack like the lethal firecracker as he approached nearer to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s eyes brightened. This was similar to the Cannon Fist but not exactly the same. The violent strength was completely concentrated in this fist attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s figure flashed.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, the breakthrough of Heavenly Dao led to a transformation in the realm of Qing Shui’s Minute Subtlety. Previously, it was mentally consuming to use it. Now, it seemed to be very relaxing. At that moment, Qing Shui realized that a battle could be enjoyable too. He understood the feeling of a fish released into the water, everything was at his fingertips. Qing Shui was feeling that immensely now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The big guy noticed Qing Shui blocking his fist with bare hands. Though it was the wrist, the energy in his body came flooding out. He had to blast off the opponent’s palm with his wrist. His muscles were as hard as metal. With a huge body, he had a terrifying resistance and explosive power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The big guy underestimated Qing Shui’s ability and his proficiency in Taichi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Snap snap snap!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon contact, three loud and rapid snaps were heard. It was only a loud snap to the outsiders, but Qing Shui and the big guy knew there were three snaps. The unbelievable part was that the big guy was blasted off. As that happened, Qing Shui rushed over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Taichi Repulsion! Repulsion Move!</span></p>
