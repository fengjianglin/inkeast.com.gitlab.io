 <p><strong>Chapter 155 Kissing Shi Qingzhuang.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 0155 – Kissing Shi Qingzhuang</strong></p>
  <p>The new year was approaching. Qing Shui and company went back to Qing Clan Village to celebrate the coming of the new year!</p>
  <p>The Agility-Enhancing Fruits had also matured. After giving two of them to Mingyue Gelou, Qing Shui finished his breakfast and set out for the Shi Clan.</p>
  <p>“Mother, if I’m not back by noon, you guys head back to Qing Village first. Don’t wait for me. I will go there on my own!” Qing Shui instructed before he left.</p>
  <p>“Going to the Shi Clan to look for Qingzhuang?” Qing Yi smiled as she inquired.</p>
  <p>“En!” Qing Shui embarrassedly smiled as he thought back to that day when he went over to propose marriage. On that day that Qing Yi had met Shi Qingzhuang, she removed a shiny crystal bracelet from her own hand and passed it over to Qingzhuang. She added a sentence, “You are already a member of our Qing Clan.”</p>
  <p>Qing Yi’s words were wise, and caused Shi Qingzhuang to be slightly shy and happy. By giving the bracelet to Qingzhuang, no one would gossip about her in the future.</p>
  <p>“We will wait for your return, and if you are not back by noon, we will just go back tomorrow!” Qing Yi smiled. Since Qing Shui was going to depart after the new year, she wished to prolong the amount of time spent with him during this period.</p>
  <p>“That’s fine too.” Qing Shui laughed, and quickly set off amidst the teasing laughter of the others.</p>
  <p>This time around, , the sentry did not stop Qing Shui when Qing Shui stepped into the Shi Family’s threshold. Not even a guard blocked his way as he walked straight for the backyard!</p>
  <p>A beautiful and fiery red figure who moved with the nimbleness and grace of a butterfly was seen as Qing Shui arrived at the backyard. He became numb. The stance and the effect of Deer Cantering differed according to each individual. Although Deer Cantering was only a supporting technique, and lacked a complete set of footwork, the multifarious effects of combining it with a stance was displayed in full by the stunning figure before Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>The most natural practitioner of Deer Cantering was Mingyue Gelou. She was not acquainted with any movement techniques. Yet with practice, she was eventually able to create her own footwork by following the movements of Deer Cantering. This left Qing Shui speechless. At the same time, he marveled by her genuine talent, perceptiveness, and potential to excel!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui stood afar and kept his gaze on Shi Qingzhuang. It was only when Shi Qingzhuang unintentionally noticed him did she stop her practice and walk towards Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Wifey, your hubby is here to see you!” Although Shi Qingzhuang’s attitude was not very cold, Qing Shui couldn’t help but tease her with his words after noticing her calm attitude.</p>
  <p>“You misbehave the moment you arrive. Why are you here?” Shi Qingzhuang stated, in somewhat of a bad mood as she silently glanced at Qing Shui from the corner of her eyes.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui passed two Energy-Enhancing and Agility-Enhancing Fruits to her. “These are for you. These two fruits are capable of increasing your strength by a thousand jin, while these other two fruits can increase your speed by 1x.”</p>
  <p>After he spoke, Qing Shui noticed that Shi Qingzhuang was staring at the fruits dumbly. Involuntarily, he asked, “What? You know what these fruits are?”</p>
  <p>“100 Year Fiery Power Fruit and the Clear Wind Fruit?” Shi Qingzhuang cast a weird glance at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Why didn’t you say so earlier? I was still thinking about how to explain them to you, haha.” Qing Shui felt as though he had shown off for nothing as he smiled awkwardly.</p>
  <p>“I don’t want them!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was stunned after hearing Shi Qingzhuang’s reply. “Why? I said I would prepare a present for you. Could it be that these fruits weren’t good enough to catch the eyes of our great mistress?”</p>
  <p>“They are too valuable! It would be a waste if I ate them.” Shi Qingzhuang said.</p>
  <p>“Ah, I thought it was too common to attract your attention. It’s fine, take them. They are only something slightly valuable. It’s a pity that you are not at Xiantian yet. If you were, I could give you even more valuable items.” Qing Shui thought of the Small-Revitalizing Pellets and stated somewhat regretfully.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s words caused Shi Qingzhuang to be speechless. She directly took the fruits from Qing Shui and bit swiftly into one of the fruits in her hands, devouring it in an instant. Although her action was quick, her demeanor was still elegant. </p>
  <p>What could one do? No matter what action a beautiful woman did, she would still look beautiful. Not only were their actions elegant, they were adorable as well. However, the same held true for the other end as well. For ugly women, no matter what they did, their actions would still appear ugly, clumsy, and even reach the point of being disgusting!</p>
  <p>A moment later, Shi Qingzhuang’s cheeks grew red from the effects of devouring the Energy-Enhancing Fruit. Holding her hand tightly, Qing Shui directed a gentle stream of Ancient Strengthening Qi to aid her in the digestion of the fruit. It was unknown if the redness of her cheeks was caused by the devouring of the Energy-Enhancing Fruits or the act of Qing Shui tightly holding on to her hands. Maybe it was a combination of both factors.</p>
  <p>“Thank you.”</p>
  <p>Those two words that Shi Qingzhuang uttered caused Qing Shui to feel extremely warm in his heart. Looking with disbelief at Shi Qingzhuang, Qing Shui stated, “I didn’t know that our great mistress would actually know these two words, hahaha!”</p>
  <p>“Pfft!” Shi Qingzhuang laughed. Qing Shui saw her jade-like, snow-white teeth once again. They were as beautiful as a work of art!</p>
  <p>“Qingzhuang, your teeth are so beautiful! I wouldn’t even dare to believe that I’ve touched them before!” Qing Shui smiled somewhat naughtily as he enjoyed the shy expression on Shi Qingzhuang’s countenance.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui kept his hold on Shi Qingzhuang’s hands. Having the chance to hold her hands didn’t come easily, so Qing Shui treasured every chance he got. Shi Qingzhuang squirmed a bit, but failed to break hold of his grasp. It was as though she was already used to the shameless actions of Qing Shui. She did not react any further, and could only allow him to pull her along.</p>
  <p>“After the new year celebrations pass,, I will leave for Cang Lang Country. I may not be able to see you again. If you want to find me, you can go to the Skysword Sect in your free time. I will be there.” Qing Shui lightly said.</p>
  <p>“En!” Shi Qingzhuang whispered in a low voice.</p>
  <p>“Qingzhuang, I’m leaving first!”</p>
  <p>“En!”</p>
  <p>“I will miss you and think of you!” Qing Shui smiled as he gazed at Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
  <p>“En!” Shi Qingzhuang lowered her head, but Qing Shui could still see that her cheeks had turned the color of a rosy red.</p>
  <p>“Can you grant me a very small wish?” Shi Qingzhuang didn’t notice the naughty looking smile of Qing Shui!</p>
  <p>“En?” Shi Qingzhuang inclined her head as she shyly glanced at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Can you give me a kiss? Just one! I’m leaving here soon, and I don’t know when I will see you again. I’m afraid I would go crazy just thinking about you!” Qing Shui bitterly exclaimed.</p>
  <p>Maybe it was because something intimate happened between the two of them before and the fact that he was her fiance that, not only did she not refute Qing Shui’s words, but even her ears grew red from the burning sensation of her shyness.</p>
  <p>Looking at her bashful expression, Qing Shui knew that as long as she did not say otherwise, she agreed. After all, if Shi Qingzhuang really spoke out her compliance, she would no longer be an ice princess!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui wasn’t a hypocrite. Inching forward, he slowly began to embrace that soft, willowy waist as his head gradually approached that incomparable, desirable, and aloof little mouth that he had tasted before.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui refused to close his eyes as their lips locked. He was enjoying the gentleness and numbness of that kiss as he stared at the beautiful countenance of Shi Qingzhuang, who made a look similar to ice on fire!</p>
  <p>Maybe it was only in moments like these that she would be willing to discard her outer layer of ice.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s hands were roaming all over her back, and eventually grabbed onto that full, perky butt. Even with her clothes on, he could feel the smoothness and that sensuous elasticity of her butt!</p>
  <p>As he grabbed that butt of hers, Shi Qingzhuang’s mouth opened slightly as she gave a gasp of surprise. Qing Shui’s tongue immediately snaked into her mouth, gently licking her tongue and savouring the sweetness of her saliva. Shi Qingzhuang’s body shuddered slightly as she experienced the mind-numbing sensation of Qing Shui’s skill.</p>
  <p>Time seemed to pause momentarily, as only sounds of breathing and the occasional light moan could be heard.</p>
  <p>It was unknown how much time had passed. Only after Qing Shui had fondled Shi Qingzhuang one more time over her entire body did he break the kiss apart. Teasingly, he glanced at the Shi Qingzhuang’s face. Her eyes were tightly closed, as though she was also enjoying that rare moment of passion.</p>
  <p>“You are so beautiful like this. Qingzhuang, I love you!”</p>
  <p>If it were some other woman, Qing Shui would not have been able to say those three words that easily. However, he had no qualms about saying that when it came to Shi Qingzhuang. After all, he really did love her, and especially liked to see that passionate expression on her face.</p>
  <p>When Qing Shui returned to the Qing Clan Medical Store, it was already noon. Other than Uncle Qing Hu and Auntie Yuan Ying, the rest of the Qing Clan members had already prepared to leave to celebrate the new year over at the Qing Clan Village!</p>
  <p>“Brother Qing Shui, why are your lips so swollen? Where did you spend the day!” Qing You laughed after he saw Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Enough. Let us be on our way, we can still reach the Qing Clan Village before the day ends!”</p>

 <p>“After the new year celebrations pass,, I will leave for Cang Lang Country. I may not be able to see you again. If you want to find me, you can go to the Skysword Sect in your free time. I will be there.” Qing Shui lightly said.</p>
 <p>“En!” Shi Qingzhuang whispered in a low voice.</p>
 <p>“Qingzhuang, I’m leaving first!”</p>
 <p>“En!”</p>
 <p>“I will miss you and think of you!” Qing Shui smiled as he gazed at Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
 <p>“En!” Shi Qingzhuang lowered her head, but Qing Shui could still see that her cheeks had turned the color of a rosy red.</p>
 <p>“Can you grant me a very small wish?” Shi Qingzhuang didn’t notice the naughty looking smile of Qing Shui!</p>
 <p>“En?” Shi Qingzhuang inclined her head as she shyly glanced at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Can you give me a kiss? Just one! I’m leaving here soon, and I don’t know when I will see you again. I’m afraid I would go crazy just thinking about you!” Qing Shui bitterly exclaimed.</p>
 <p>Maybe it was because something intimate happened between the two of them before and the fact that he was her fiance that, not only did she not refute Qing Shui’s words, but even her ears grew red from the burning sensation of her shyness.</p>
 <p>Looking at her bashful expression, Qing Shui knew that as long as she did not say otherwise, she agreed. After all, if Shi Qingzhuang really spoke out her compliance, she would no longer be an ice princess!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn’t a hypocrite. Inching forward, he slowly began to embrace that soft, willowy waist as his head gradually approached that incomparable, desirable, and aloof little mouth that he had tasted before.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui refused to close his eyes as their lips locked. He was enjoying the gentleness and numbness of that kiss as he stared at the beautiful countenance of Shi Qingzhuang, who made a look similar to ice on fire!</p>
 <p>Maybe it was only in moments like these that she would be willing to discard her outer layer of ice.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s hands were roaming all over her back, and eventually grabbed onto that full, perky butt. Even with her clothes on, he could feel the smoothness and that sensuous elasticity of her butt!</p>
 <p>As he grabbed that butt of hers, Shi Qingzhuang’s mouth opened slightly as she gave a gasp of surprise. Qing Shui’s tongue immediately snaked into her mouth, gently licking her tongue and savouring the sweetness of her saliva. Shi Qingzhuang’s body shuddered slightly as she experienced the mind-numbing sensation of Qing Shui’s skill.</p>
 <p>Time seemed to pause momentarily, as only sounds of breathing and the occasional light moan could be heard.</p>
 <p>It was unknown how much time had passed. Only after Qing Shui had fondled Shi Qingzhuang one more time over her entire body did he break the kiss apart. Teasingly, he glanced at the Shi Qingzhuang’s face. Her eyes were tightly closed, as though she was also enjoying that rare moment of passion.</p>
 <p>“You are so beautiful like this. Qingzhuang, I love you!”</p>
 <p>If it were some other woman, Qing Shui would not have been able to say those three words that easily. However, he had no qualms about saying that when it came to Shi Qingzhuang. After all, he really did love her, and especially liked to see that passionate expression on her face.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui returned to the Qing Clan Medical Store, it was already noon. Other than Uncle Qing Hu and Auntie Yuan Ying, the rest of the Qing Clan members had already prepared to leave to celebrate the new year over at the Qing Clan Village!</p>
 <p>“Brother Qing Shui, why are your lips so swollen? Where did you spend the day!” Qing You laughed after he saw Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Enough. Let us be on our way, we can still reach the Qing Clan Village before the day ends!”</p>
