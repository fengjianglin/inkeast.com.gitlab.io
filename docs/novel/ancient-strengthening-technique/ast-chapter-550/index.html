 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 550 - Nirvana Rebirth! The formidable Tiger form at the Great Perfection Stage</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hellfire!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was a powerful flame element attack. It’s burning ability was extremely insane! If one ever came into contact with it, the only option left would be to cut off the part of their body which it touched. Of course, that only referred to the strongest level of the Hellfire. It was capable of burning everything.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But Qing Shui knew that with the Fire Bird’s current strength, it most definitely won’t be able to achieve this kind of power. But when it came to facing off against warriors or demonic beasts at the Martial King Grade, this ‘Hellfire’ would definitely be an insane technique.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But all of these weren’t important. The Fire Bird had finally acquired an insanely strong skill. Prior to this, without any powerful techniques, the Fire Bird had always been his biggest shortcoming.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The current Fire Bird was definitely at the Martial King Grade. Other than Demonic Beasts at the Martial Saint Grade, it would be a nightmare for both peak Martial King Warriors and Demonic Beasts. For a moment, even Qing Shui felt agitated.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After checking out the Hellfire skill, Qing Shui’s eyes moved on to the skill lower down.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nirvana Rebirth!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was the formidable skill of the legendary phoenix. Under certain circumstances, it would fall into the state of nirvana within a fire bath. When it was reborn, it’s strength would be multiplied by many folds.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“So previously, it really was the Nirvana Rebirth……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui glanced towards the godly Fire Bird in the sky. It had become a few times bigger than before. When it opened up both of its wings, even though it wasn’t really omnipotent, the godly might it emitted was still incomparably powerful.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At present, even more of its phoenix meridians should have awakened after the Nirvana Rebirth. Even though it’s not obvious, it was already starting to have the elegance of a phoenix.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Minggg!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The reverberating whistle sounded really arrogant. It was the kind of chirp which would be acknowledged by all kinds of birds. After it flew around in circles a few times in the sky, it flew towards Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui joyfully hopped towards it and dropped down onto its unusually wide back. At that moment, an indescribable feeling emerged from deep within him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a feeling of confidence. Other than that, it was also because he had a feeling that he just got a really powerful helping hand.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It slowly descended to the ground. At this moment, the others from Qing Clan were already outside.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Daddy!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Luan Luan immediately threw herself at Qing Shui and attached herself to his chest. Frankly speaking, this time, Luan Luan’s ‘Bai Bai’ also helped a lot. Without it, things might have turned out really ugly. Not only would they be unable to kill the old man from the Soulreaper Valley, the Fire Bird might even lose its life.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The others remained silent. Qing Yi, Qing Qing, and the girls, on the other hand, their eyes looked really teary. They were uncertain about whether they were feeling happy or worried for him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Shui! Take a look at this. What do you think it is?” Qing Bei picked up a rock which was sparkling with a green translucent light. It was almost the size of a baby’s fist.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It wasn’t the physical appearance of the stone which attracted Qing Shui. What he was truly interested in was the spiritual energy it emitted. Just by this, Qing Shui could already confirm that this was some really good stuff.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He took over the stone and tried to feel it. After not discovering much, he released his Spiritual Sense and took a peek into the green stone.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Dark Green Divine Stone!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It actually has a name?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was a rule which Qing Shui discovered himself. For the objects across the World of the Nine Continents, Qing Shui’s spiritual sense would be able to detect their names if they were really outstanding objects.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For example, the Violet Gold Divine Shield!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui continued reading. Dark Green Divine Stone, a mysterious stone from the ancient era. Usage: Undo certain special seals.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">State of the Dark Green Divine Stone: Damaged!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui chuckled and said: “This is a Dark Green Divine Stone. It can be used to undo seals!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Oh! And I thought it’s some good stuff. It does look quite beautiful from the outside. Brother Shui, why don’t you forge a bracelet with it for me?” Qing Bei looked at Qing Shui and smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This thing isn’t really that suitable for it. Don’t worry, I’ll help you forge a bracelet later with other materials. In fact, haven’t I made more than five bracelets for you? What do you need so many of them for?” Qing Shui was puzzled as he placed the Dark Green Divine Stone into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I want bracelets of every colour so that I will be able to rotate and take turns wearing different ones!” Qing Bei smiled joyfully.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was speechless. This little brat truly saw him as a man with lots of free time. He grumpily extended his hand and rubbed Qing Bei’s head violently.: “No wonder your cultivation level improves so slowly! Otherwise, you would have been able to advance into Xiantian Realm a year earlier! Are you already starting to feel arrogant just because you made it into Xiantian!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No, I’m not!” Qing Bei pouted.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The gang continued on with their journey. The enormous Fire Bird in the sky was extremely attractive. Qing Shui had really high expectations for it. Since a Fire Bird could already be like this, what kind of godly might would a phoenix possess?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As for the previous old man, he had already been completely destroyed by Qing Shui. There wasn’t anyone around him when he killed the old man. Naturally, most people would try to escape if they ran into a murder to avoid getting themselves associated with it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Shui! Is the Fire Bird even stronger now? Can you let me sit on it and see?” said Qing Bei. It’s very rare to see Qing Bei acting this freely.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, it has made another breakthrough and has become a lot stronger now.” replied Qing Shui. After that, he summoned the Fire Bird.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the end, Qing Yi, Qing Bei, Shi Qingzhuang, Mingyue Gelou, Little Yu Chang and Luan Luan all climbed onto the back of the Fire Bird. Meanwhile, ‘Bai Bai’ also flew beside the Fire Bird.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange’s ‘Snow White Crane’ was also flying in the air.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After the Fire Bird broke through and evolved, it became the biggest flying beast among the three. It has gotten two to three times bigger than before. And when it flapped both of its wings, it looked like a champion.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When night time arrived, they had barely made it out of Kaiyang Country only to find themselves at the edge of a really thick forest. Their left-hand side was a mountain whereas their right-hand side was an enormous surging river.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were mountains, waters, and forests. Furthermore, the spiritual energy here was also considerably abundant. Suddenly, Qing Shui felt like he remembered something, but he was unsure about what exactly it was.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui informed the others to set up camp and rest. In any case, they were already quite exhausted. Qing Shui also wanted to find out clearly what the thing which he remembered earlier was.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were a lot of people here. The place was incomparably noisy and the air was filled with the sounds of Luan Luan and Yu Chang playing, talking and laughing. The three generations of Qing Clan, on the other hand, were getting ready to head into the forest to hunt wild animals for dinner.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui released his spiritual sense and slowly walked towards the mountain following a path. The reason that Qing Shui followed this path was because he could feel the spiritual energy getting more and more abundant as he climbed up the mountain.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were mountains, waters and forests.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tiger!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tiger’s Mount, Tiger’s Descend.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tiger Laceration!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui used the Tiger Laceration.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pa-pa-pa!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A clear and loud explosive noise rang in the air. It seemed like this blow was much stronger than normal. However, Qing Shui didn’t stop just because of this. His expression also remained the same.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He moved forward by a step and once again used the Tiger Laceration.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s eyes turned bright!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tiger’s Mount!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He once again stepped out and moved forward.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He continued to head deeper into the mountains.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Tiger’s Roar started revolving fiercely. The Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique immediately formed a cycle inside his body in the form of the essence of the Tiger’s Roar.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The rumbling noises of the Tiger’s Roar rang out one after another.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Daddy is practicing Tiger Form!” Luan Luan explained seriously as she looked at Qing Shui who was in the distance.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A lot of people from Qing Clan also stopped to look at Qing Shui. Almost everyone in Qing Clan cultivated the Tiger Form. At the moment, the one who was the most engrossed in watching Qing Shui cultivate the Tiger Form was Mingyue Gelou.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She almost didn’t blink her eyes as she stared at Qing Shui’s body. It’s as if she was trying to imprint Qing Shui’s actions into her mind.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“He’s too hardworking… He never forgets to cultivate!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the thoughts of the people in Qing Clan. Even Qing Bei who was always active also quietly observed Qing Shui. She was well aware that Qing Shui’s achievements up to these days weren’t just by mere luck. It was something that he got from sacrificing a lot of things.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing You looked at Qing Shui. He too stopped hunting for wild animals. He just stood there blankly and thought to himself that if he could be like Qing Shui and have so many beautiful women around him, what’s the point in cultivating so hard? He could have just been a free man in Hundred Miles City.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s aura was still gradually increasing. Each and every step he took were incomparably firm and steady. On the mountain path, Qing Shui’s movements were like a heavy and slow turtle. But it looked really smooth.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tiger Lunge!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tiger Raise!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s movement became faster and faster. The skills which he used were all Tiger Form’s skills. He was like a butterfly diving back and forth atop the mountain path.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A halo even began to emerge from his body.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Slowly, from the point of view of the members from Qing Clan, Qing Shui’s body looked as if it turned into a fierce tiger. The might of the tiger affected his surroundings. It even generated a bit of wind in the air.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tiger’s Wind!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Slowly, Qing Shui entered the State of No Conscious. He closed his eyes and stopped thinking about other things. Ironically, at the same moment, he felt as if he could see everything around him.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As it turned out, when one reached a certain point of cultivation, it wasn’t only their eyes which could see things. They could do the same even with both their spiritual sense and their heart. Once again, his spiritual sense had improved significantly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ripping Tiger Claw!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui continuously threw out punches one after another. It felt like even the air itself was being torn apart. Slowly, a faint grey-colored line appeared.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Unknowingly, Qing Shui had already reached the mountain’s peak.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tiger’s Mount!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, the strength which Qing Shui had been accumulating all got released at once. It was released in a very natural way. For a moment, the heaven thrusting aura vigorously spread out into the surroundings.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A heaven shaking tiger’s roar rang out. It sounded as explosive as thunder. Qing Shui performed the Tiger Laceration. Soon after, a thread of clear shadow appeared in the air.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stopped there and looked at his hand.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After that, he once again threw out another punch.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The gray hand shadow continued to appear. No explosive noises were generated. He only felt an odd aura which felt like it could destroy everything.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The tiger form had actually reached the Great Perfection Stage! Merely an ordinary Tiger Laceration was already able to demonstrate a strength comparable to that of a Martial Saint Warrior. Even though it's still not as good compared to the Martial Saint warriors from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, it was still a blow which could only be performed by a Martial Saint warrior.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What’s the current state of Tiger Form?” wondered Qing Shui as he smiled.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This wasn't actually an important question, but Qing Shui still felt really happy. Never would he have thought that the Tiger Form would be able to display such a dramatic effect. As for the others, it reached the state of being One with Heaven. But without the strength of a Martial Saint, it still wouldn't be as effective.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’ll consider it to have reached the Great Perfection Stage!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After thinking for a while, Qing Shui settled down by concluding it was at the Great Perfection Stage. Though it was one of the most common stage, it was a term which people could understand very quickly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stood atop of the mountain as he looked at the mountains around him. After that, he moved his sight to the thick forests and the surging rivers. It was a really beautiful and precious land. It was also a place that’s really suitable for tigers to grow in. Who would have thought that he would be able to surpass the limit of the tiger form and reach a new level?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He looked up to the sky. Unknowingly, approximately an hour and a half had passed. Soon, he moved his sight to the members in Qing Clan and felt an instant joy.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">After checking out the Hellfire skill, Qing Shui’s eyes moved on to the skill lower down.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nirvana Rebirth!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was the formidable skill of the legendary phoenix. Under certain circumstances, it would fall into the state of nirvana within a fire bath. When it was reborn, it’s strength would be multiplied by many folds.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“So previously, it really was the Nirvana Rebirth……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui glanced towards the godly Fire Bird in the sky. It had become a few times bigger than before. When it opened up both of its wings, even though it wasn’t really omnipotent, the godly might it emitted was still incomparably powerful.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At present, even more of its phoenix meridians should have awakened after the Nirvana Rebirth. Even though it’s not obvious, it was already starting to have the elegance of a phoenix.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Minggg!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The reverberating whistle sounded really arrogant. It was the kind of chirp which would be acknowledged by all kinds of birds. After it flew around in circles a few times in the sky, it flew towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui joyfully hopped towards it and dropped down onto its unusually wide back. At that moment, an indescribable feeling emerged from deep within him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was a feeling of confidence. Other than that, it was also because he had a feeling that he just got a really powerful helping hand.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It slowly descended to the ground. At this moment, the others from Qing Clan were already outside.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Daddy!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Luan Luan immediately threw herself at Qing Shui and attached herself to his chest. Frankly speaking, this time, Luan Luan’s ‘Bai Bai’ also helped a lot. Without it, things might have turned out really ugly. Not only would they be unable to kill the old man from the Soulreaper Valley, the Fire Bird might even lose its life.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The others remained silent. Qing Yi, Qing Qing, and the girls, on the other hand, their eyes looked really teary. They were uncertain about whether they were feeling happy or worried for him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Shui! Take a look at this. What do you think it is?” Qing Bei picked up a rock which was sparkling with a green translucent light. It was almost the size of a baby’s fist.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It wasn’t the physical appearance of the stone which attracted Qing Shui. What he was truly interested in was the spiritual energy it emitted. Just by this, Qing Shui could already confirm that this was some really good stuff.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He took over the stone and tried to feel it. After not discovering much, he released his Spiritual Sense and took a peek into the green stone.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Dark Green Divine Stone!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It actually has a name?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was a rule which Qing Shui discovered himself. For the objects across the World of the Nine Continents, Qing Shui’s spiritual sense would be able to detect their names if they were really outstanding objects.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">For example, the Violet Gold Divine Shield!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui continued reading. Dark Green Divine Stone, a mysterious stone from the ancient era. Usage: Undo certain special seals.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">State of the Dark Green Divine Stone: Damaged!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui chuckled and said: “This is a Dark Green Divine Stone. It can be used to undo seals!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Oh! And I thought it’s some good stuff. It does look quite beautiful from the outside. Brother Shui, why don’t you forge a bracelet with it for me?” Qing Bei looked at Qing Shui and smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This thing isn’t really that suitable for it. Don’t worry, I’ll help you forge a bracelet later with other materials. In fact, haven’t I made more than five bracelets for you? What do you need so many of them for?” Qing Shui was puzzled as he placed the Dark Green Divine Stone into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I want bracelets of every colour so that I will be able to rotate and take turns wearing different ones!” Qing Bei smiled joyfully.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was speechless. This little brat truly saw him as a man with lots of free time. He grumpily extended his hand and rubbed Qing Bei’s head violently.: “No wonder your cultivation level improves so slowly! Otherwise, you would have been able to advance into Xiantian Realm a year earlier! Are you already starting to feel arrogant just because you made it into Xiantian!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No, I’m not!” Qing Bei pouted.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The gang continued on with their journey. The enormous Fire Bird in the sky was extremely attractive. Qing Shui had really high expectations for it. Since a Fire Bird could already be like this, what kind of godly might would a phoenix possess?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As for the previous old man, he had already been completely destroyed by Qing Shui. There wasn’t anyone around him when he killed the old man. Naturally, most people would try to escape if they ran into a murder to avoid getting themselves associated with it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Shui! Is the Fire Bird even stronger now? Can you let me sit on it and see?” said Qing Bei. It’s very rare to see Qing Bei acting this freely.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, it has made another breakthrough and has become a lot stronger now.” replied Qing Shui. After that, he summoned the Fire Bird.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the end, Qing Yi, Qing Bei, Shi Qingzhuang, Mingyue Gelou, Little Yu Chang and Luan Luan all climbed onto the back of the Fire Bird. Meanwhile, ‘Bai Bai’ also flew beside the Fire Bird.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange’s ‘Snow White Crane’ was also flying in the air.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After the Fire Bird broke through and evolved, it became the biggest flying beast among the three. It has gotten two to three times bigger than before. And when it flapped both of its wings, it looked like a champion.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When night time arrived, they had barely made it out of Kaiyang Country only to find themselves at the edge of a really thick forest. Their left-hand side was a mountain whereas their right-hand side was an enormous surging river.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There were mountains, waters, and forests. Furthermore, the spiritual energy here was also considerably abundant. Suddenly, Qing Shui felt like he remembered something, but he was unsure about what exactly it was.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui informed the others to set up camp and rest. In any case, they were already quite exhausted. Qing Shui also wanted to find out clearly what the thing which he remembered earlier was.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There were a lot of people here. The place was incomparably noisy and the air was filled with the sounds of Luan Luan and Yu Chang playing, talking and laughing. The three generations of Qing Clan, on the other hand, were getting ready to head into the forest to hunt wild animals for dinner.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui released his spiritual sense and slowly walked towards the mountain following a path. The reason that Qing Shui followed this path was because he could feel the spiritual energy getting more and more abundant as he climbed up the mountain.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There were mountains, waters and forests.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tiger!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tiger’s Mount, Tiger’s Descend.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tiger Laceration!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui used the Tiger Laceration.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pa-pa-pa!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A clear and loud explosive noise rang in the air. It seemed like this blow was much stronger than normal. However, Qing Shui didn’t stop just because of this. His expression also remained the same.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He moved forward by a step and once again used the Tiger Laceration.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s eyes turned bright!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tiger’s Mount!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He once again stepped out and moved forward.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He continued to head deeper into the mountains.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Tiger’s Roar started revolving fiercely. The Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique immediately formed a cycle inside his body in the form of the essence of the Tiger’s Roar.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The rumbling noises of the Tiger’s Roar rang out one after another.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Daddy is practicing Tiger Form!” Luan Luan explained seriously as she looked at Qing Shui who was in the distance.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A lot of people from Qing Clan also stopped to look at Qing Shui. Almost everyone in Qing Clan cultivated the Tiger Form. At the moment, the one who was the most engrossed in watching Qing Shui cultivate the Tiger Form was Mingyue Gelou.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She almost didn’t blink her eyes as she stared at Qing Shui’s body. It’s as if she was trying to imprint Qing Shui’s actions into her mind.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“He’s too hardworking… He never forgets to cultivate!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was the thoughts of the people in Qing Clan. Even Qing Bei who was always active also quietly observed Qing Shui. She was well aware that Qing Shui’s achievements up to these days weren’t just by mere luck. It was something that he got from sacrificing a lot of things.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing You looked at Qing Shui. He too stopped hunting for wild animals. He just stood there blankly and thought to himself that if he could be like Qing Shui and have so many beautiful women around him, what’s the point in cultivating so hard? He could have just been a free man in Hundred Miles City.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s aura was still gradually increasing. Each and every step he took were incomparably firm and steady. On the mountain path, Qing Shui’s movements were like a heavy and slow turtle. But it looked really smooth.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tiger Lunge!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tiger Raise!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s movement became faster and faster. The skills which he used were all Tiger Form’s skills. He was like a butterfly diving back and forth atop the mountain path.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A halo even began to emerge from his body.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Slowly, from the point of view of the members from Qing Clan, Qing Shui’s body looked as if it turned into a fierce tiger. The might of the tiger affected his surroundings. It even generated a bit of wind in the air.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tiger’s Wind!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Slowly, Qing Shui entered the State of No Conscious. He closed his eyes and stopped thinking about other things. Ironically, at the same moment, he felt as if he could see everything around him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As it turned out, when one reached a certain point of cultivation, it wasn’t only their eyes which could see things. They could do the same even with both their spiritual sense and their heart. Once again, his spiritual sense had improved significantly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ripping Tiger Claw!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui continuously threw out punches one after another. It felt like even the air itself was being torn apart. Slowly, a faint grey-colored line appeared.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Unknowingly, Qing Shui had already reached the mountain’s peak.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tiger’s Mount!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, the strength which Qing Shui had been accumulating all got released at once. It was released in a very natural way. For a moment, the heaven thrusting aura vigorously spread out into the surroundings.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A heaven shaking tiger’s roar rang out. It sounded as explosive as thunder. Qing Shui performed the Tiger Laceration. Soon after, a thread of clear shadow appeared in the air.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stopped there and looked at his hand.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After that, he once again threw out another punch.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The gray hand shadow continued to appear. No explosive noises were generated. He only felt an odd aura which felt like it could destroy everything.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The tiger form had actually reached the Great Perfection Stage! Merely an ordinary Tiger Laceration was already able to demonstrate a strength comparable to that of a Martial Saint Warrior. Even though it's still not as good compared to the Martial Saint warriors from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, it was still a blow which could only be performed by a Martial Saint warrior.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What’s the current state of Tiger Form?” wondered Qing Shui as he smiled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This wasn't actually an important question, but Qing Shui still felt really happy. Never would he have thought that the Tiger Form would be able to display such a dramatic effect. As for the others, it reached the state of being One with Heaven. But without the strength of a Martial Saint, it still wouldn't be as effective.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’ll consider it to have reached the Great Perfection Stage!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After thinking for a while, Qing Shui settled down by concluding it was at the Great Perfection Stage. Though it was one of the most common stage, it was a term which people could understand very quickly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stood atop of the mountain as he looked at the mountains around him. After that, he moved his sight to the thick forests and the surging rivers. It was a really beautiful and precious land. It was also a place that’s really suitable for tigers to grow in. Who would have thought that he would be able to surpass the limit of the tiger form and reach a new level?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He looked up to the sky. Unknowingly, approximately an hour and a half had passed. Soon, he moved his sight to the members in Qing Clan and felt an instant joy.</p>
