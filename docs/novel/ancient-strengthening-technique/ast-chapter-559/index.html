  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 559 - Traveling with beauty, encountering a Three-Headed Dark Cloud Armored Beast</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">This also counted as an unexpected surprise. Qing Shui decided to check the usage of Triple-eyed Grass Green Frog when he had time. Qing Shui rejoiced at the fact that he got two frogs during their copulation period. If they could lay eggs this time, how wonderful would it be!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Triple-eyed Grass Green Frog had the ice-attribute, which made it quite slippery with its ability to turn water into ice. It could also live on land, thus Qing Shui did not need to worry about it getting eaten by the Rainbow Trout Fish or other species.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After collecting the Pure Gold Fishing Rod, Qing Shui walked toward Di Qing as he carried four grass carps in his bucket.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Sensing that Qing Shui was walking toward her, Di Qing rolled her eyes towards Qing Shui. Her jade-like face had a slight flush and was shockingly beautiful under the light of sunset.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt a little depressed. It’s not he was the one caught them! Besides, one could hardly see what was going on between those frogs. If they were a couple of giant beasts, that ‘thing’ could be seen much clearer. However, Qing Shui knew that this woman wanted to get rid of them as soon as possible.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Without any words, Qing Shui cleaned the fish, deciding to stew two of them for soup, and fry the rest.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Qing was not able to provide any help, and thus could only stay side and watch. She could not help but ask: “For a man, do you think it’s important that his spouse can cook?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui turns around in confusion, just to see Di Qing’s serious face. He shook his head and said: “I don’t know. I cannot represent all men.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Then represent yourself. Do you wish your wife to be able to cook?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stared at Di Qing in bewilderment, but found that she was dead serious, with the look of ‘give me an answer’. Qing Shui turned back and said: “If she is interested, then yes. I can cook, so it’s really not a necessity for her to be able to cook. Anyways, it’s good to obtain such a skill. What if she is somewhere alone and can’t buy anything to eat? Cooking is also a way of living.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Qing knew that he wasn’t wrong. When she came here, due to the fact that she could not make any food, she had to consume fruits for almost a full month after running out of dry rations.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Food was no longer an everyday necessity when one reached the level of Martial Emperor.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A tempting fish smell soon wafted into the air. Although it was partially because of the spices, Qing Shui’s own cooking skill contributed a lot to the great smell.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Then can you teach me…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just when the fish was done, Di Qing’s slightly submissive voice came into his ears.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Of course!” Qing Shui laughed, “I’ll teach you next time. But for now, just come and eat. We’ll stay here today, and start out journey again tomorrow morning.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“All right.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Delicious, I never thought that fish could be so delicious. If you open a fried fish shop selling only these, you would become famous all over the continent.” Di Qing laughed as she was eating.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Family and friends special, my cooking isn’t for anyone else.” Qing Shui whispered.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“So… Are we friends then?” Di Qing grinned.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I guess…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What do you mean? Yes is a yes, no is a no, what does ‘I guess’ even mean? As if I care?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui fell speechless.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After the meal, Qing Shui helped Di Qing to set up her tent. After saying goodnight, Qing Shui took care of his own tent, and let out the Fire Bird and Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he had more time while the time in real world remained the same. This was something that Qing Shui rejoice about. It takes a hundred days to arrive at the Central Continent, and converting it to the time in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, it’ll be two thousand days! That’s basically five and a half year.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ancient Strengthening technique, Talisman Drawing, Nine Animals Mimicry Technique, Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm, Basic Sword Techniques, Blue Lotus Art, Thousand Hammer Technique, Heavenly Palace Sword Art, Cloudmist Steps, Heavenly Thunder Slash, Divinity Protection, Taichi…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">What he was best in right now was his Tiger Form. He could now strike once with the attack of a Grade One Martial Saint. Qing Shui was thus a little more confident in going to Central Continent. At least he could fight back against some low-rank martial saints.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Five Elements Fruit!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui remembered the last 10 Five Element Fruits. Realizing that there was no other time to eat them, he decided to eat them without hesitation. Those fruits looked as hard as steel but were actually really soft. It didn’t feel like anything after he had 10 of them. Qing Shui now understood how his mother and those girls could finish 10 fruits in such a short while.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A vigorous power burst out from the vessels and his dantian. It felt like a breeze of cool wind on a heated summer night or the sweet mountain spring found by someone who was dying of thirst.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although his strength had not noticeably improved, Qing Shui found that his Dantian now had some more empty space. Even the mud-yellow mass became denser and denser.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Seems like my peak 5th heavenly layer can still be improved, and it is not yet time for huge changes to appear...”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui senses something that could help him with the breakthrough. If a bottle was filled with liquid and one wanted to make it heavier, except for changing to a larger bottle, one could also increase the density of the liquid.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui realized that the best thing about this earth-attribute Five Element Fruit was that it improved the intensity of his body. For example, a little kid could lift a 10 pound mass. The Five Element Fruit that fitted his attribute could improve the intensity of his bones and body so that he could bear a 30 pound mass, but without practice, he still wouldn’t be able to lift 30 pounds.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The new space in his dantian could still be considered as a little breakthrough, it’s just that the energy did not give Qing Shui the chance to break the barrier to becoming a Martial Saint. Qing Shui also knew about the 5 legendary fruits needed to increase the probability become martial saints.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had a feeling that those fruits were similar to his own Five Element Fruits, probably just with better effects. As the late Old Ancestor admitted themselves, the chances of becoming a martial saint were still low even after eating that fruit.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After a large cycle of cultivation of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, Qing Shui surprisingly realized that he was slowly improving.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">About half of the time allowed in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal quickly passed away.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Normally, Qing Shui would spend 3 hours before midnight and 3 hours early in the morning, and he would not change his routine today. Even if he wished to stay longer, Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal would still kick him out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Fully refreshed and changing into a new attire, Qing Shui went out of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He was not particularly sleepy, as he already rested in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Since he would be going back later, Qing Shui always prepared himself for any accidents that might happen.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Walking out of the tents, he saw that the moonlight still shined brightly. The night sky was beautiful as usual. Qing Shui had got used to it through all these years, but he still loved to just at the night sky. He also thought about some unrealistic questions, believing that everything was possible now after he had time-traveled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s Spiritual sense was suddenly touched, causing his countenance to change.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Chirp!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At almost the same instant, the Fire Bird and the Diamond Gigantic Elephant burst out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Several moments later, Di Qing walked out of the tent, all dressed, and walked toward Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What’s going on?” Qi Ding frowned.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Something very strong is approaching.” Qing Shui’s eyes did not stay on Di Qing for long before he gazed afar again.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The moonlight covered the whole earth with a silver silk-like light. The darkness of the night could not actually block Qing Shui’s sight.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Very strong? Can you deal with it?” Di Qing said worriedly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Don’t know what it is yet. It’s very fast indeed, and it will be a hard fight if it’s a flying demonic beast.” Qing Shui did not stop gazing toward where the beast might come from. He wished to make the best decisions as soon as he saw the beast.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If it was only Qing Shui, he could choose to hide in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. However, the presence of Di Qing forced him to fight.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“ If you don’t have confidence in killing it, run while you have any chance.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Qing’s sudden but calm words surprised Qing Shui. Qing Shui was actually just thinking about running. After all, if that actually happened, it made no sense for Qing Shui to die together with her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, I know.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Qing fell speechless. She thought to herself: “how honest could he be? At least he could say some gentle lies”.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yeah?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It is was my sister here today, what would you do?” Di Qing seemed to be curious about the answer to this in particular.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just at this moment, a loud roar came from far away. It was made by a beast, but sounded like a crashing mountain. Qing Shui stared at the root of the sound as hard as possible.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When he saw it, Qing Shui could not help but smiled bitterly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Very far away appeared a gargantuan demonic beast. This would be the largest demonic beast that Qing Shui had ever seen in his whole life. A beast with wings that could almost cover up the sky.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This beast had three heads. Its strength and power could even be felt from this far away.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Three-Headed Dark Cloud Armored Beast!” Di Qing yelled in amazement.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had known about this demonic beast. It can actually be counted as an exception, because no one in the continent could give it a proper rating. Thus Three-Headed Dark Cloud Armored Beast was considered as a martial-emperor level demonic beast upon its birth. It might spend its whole life in Martial emperor lever, or it might reach the peak of it. Chances are that it could even become Martial Saint level demonic beast.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looks at the Three-Headed Dark Cloud Armored Beast with its huge build and his heart drummed inside. Qing Shui has no idea if it was a Martial Saint leveled demonic beast already, but it sure felt a lot stronger than the saint from Heavenly Province.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That’s Qing Shui’s instinct.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although huge, the Three-Headed Dark Cloud Armored Beast was by no mean slow. Qing Shui drew out his Violet Gold Divine Shield and the Big Dipper Sword, he looked at Di Qing and said: “Hide as far as you can. Get your Heavenly Crane out and escape immediately when you have a chance. If you can escape, so can I.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Qing felt his sincerity and his determination. She nodded, and with the wave of a hand, a huge Heavenly Soaring Crane appeared right behind her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui hopped onto the back of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. It dashed toward the Three-Headed Dark Cloud Armored Beast with the Fire Bird, while Qing Shui turned back and told Di Qing: “Run! Meet me back here tomorrow!”</p>

 <p dir="ltr">“What do you mean? Yes is a yes, no is a no, what does ‘I guess’ even mean? As if I care?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui fell speechless.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After the meal, Qing Shui helped Di Qing to set up her tent. After saying goodnight, Qing Shui took care of his own tent, and let out the Fire Bird and Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he had more time while the time in real world remained the same. This was something that Qing Shui rejoice about. It takes a hundred days to arrive at the Central Continent, and converting it to the time in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, it’ll be two thousand days! That’s basically five and a half year.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ancient Strengthening technique, Talisman Drawing, Nine Animals Mimicry Technique, Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm, Basic Sword Techniques, Blue Lotus Art, Thousand Hammer Technique, Heavenly Palace Sword Art, Cloudmist Steps, Heavenly Thunder Slash, Divinity Protection, Taichi…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">What he was best in right now was his Tiger Form. He could now strike once with the attack of a Grade One Martial Saint. Qing Shui was thus a little more confident in going to Central Continent. At least he could fight back against some low-rank martial saints.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Five Elements Fruit!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui remembered the last 10 Five Element Fruits. Realizing that there was no other time to eat them, he decided to eat them without hesitation. Those fruits looked as hard as steel but were actually really soft. It didn’t feel like anything after he had 10 of them. Qing Shui now understood how his mother and those girls could finish 10 fruits in such a short while.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A vigorous power burst out from the vessels and his dantian. It felt like a breeze of cool wind on a heated summer night or the sweet mountain spring found by someone who was dying of thirst.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although his strength had not noticeably improved, Qing Shui found that his Dantian now had some more empty space. Even the mud-yellow mass became denser and denser.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Seems like my peak 5th heavenly layer can still be improved, and it is not yet time for huge changes to appear...”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui senses something that could help him with the breakthrough. If a bottle was filled with liquid and one wanted to make it heavier, except for changing to a larger bottle, one could also increase the density of the liquid.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui realized that the best thing about this earth-attribute Five Element Fruit was that it improved the intensity of his body. For example, a little kid could lift a 10 pound mass. The Five Element Fruit that fitted his attribute could improve the intensity of his bones and body so that he could bear a 30 pound mass, but without practice, he still wouldn’t be able to lift 30 pounds.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The new space in his dantian could still be considered as a little breakthrough, it’s just that the energy did not give Qing Shui the chance to break the barrier to becoming a Martial Saint. Qing Shui also knew about the 5 legendary fruits needed to increase the probability become martial saints.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had a feeling that those fruits were similar to his own Five Element Fruits, probably just with better effects. As the late Old Ancestor admitted themselves, the chances of becoming a martial saint were still low even after eating that fruit.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After a large cycle of cultivation of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, Qing Shui surprisingly realized that he was slowly improving.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">About half of the time allowed in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal quickly passed away.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Normally, Qing Shui would spend 3 hours before midnight and 3 hours early in the morning, and he would not change his routine today. Even if he wished to stay longer, Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal would still kick him out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Fully refreshed and changing into a new attire, Qing Shui went out of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He was not particularly sleepy, as he already rested in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Since he would be going back later, Qing Shui always prepared himself for any accidents that might happen.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Walking out of the tents, he saw that the moonlight still shined brightly. The night sky was beautiful as usual. Qing Shui had got used to it through all these years, but he still loved to just at the night sky. He also thought about some unrealistic questions, believing that everything was possible now after he had time-traveled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s Spiritual sense was suddenly touched, causing his countenance to change.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Chirp!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At almost the same instant, the Fire Bird and the Diamond Gigantic Elephant burst out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Several moments later, Di Qing walked out of the tent, all dressed, and walked toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What’s going on?” Qi Ding frowned.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Something very strong is approaching.” Qing Shui’s eyes did not stay on Di Qing for long before he gazed afar again.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The moonlight covered the whole earth with a silver silk-like light. The darkness of the night could not actually block Qing Shui’s sight.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Very strong? Can you deal with it?” Di Qing said worriedly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Don’t know what it is yet. It’s very fast indeed, and it will be a hard fight if it’s a flying demonic beast.” Qing Shui did not stop gazing toward where the beast might come from. He wished to make the best decisions as soon as he saw the beast.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If it was only Qing Shui, he could choose to hide in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. However, the presence of Di Qing forced him to fight.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“ If you don’t have confidence in killing it, run while you have any chance.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Di Qing’s sudden but calm words surprised Qing Shui. Qing Shui was actually just thinking about running. After all, if that actually happened, it made no sense for Qing Shui to die together with her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, I know.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Di Qing fell speechless. She thought to herself: “how honest could he be? At least he could say some gentle lies”.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yeah?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It is was my sister here today, what would you do?” Di Qing seemed to be curious about the answer to this in particular.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just at this moment, a loud roar came from far away. It was made by a beast, but sounded like a crashing mountain. Qing Shui stared at the root of the sound as hard as possible.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When he saw it, Qing Shui could not help but smiled bitterly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Very far away appeared a gargantuan demonic beast. This would be the largest demonic beast that Qing Shui had ever seen in his whole life. A beast with wings that could almost cover up the sky.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This beast had three heads. Its strength and power could even be felt from this far away.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Three-Headed Dark Cloud Armored Beast!” Di Qing yelled in amazement.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had known about this demonic beast. It can actually be counted as an exception, because no one in the continent could give it a proper rating. Thus Three-Headed Dark Cloud Armored Beast was considered as a martial-emperor level demonic beast upon its birth. It might spend its whole life in Martial emperor lever, or it might reach the peak of it. Chances are that it could even become Martial Saint level demonic beast.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looks at the Three-Headed Dark Cloud Armored Beast with its huge build and his heart drummed inside. Qing Shui has no idea if it was a Martial Saint leveled demonic beast already, but it sure felt a lot stronger than the saint from Heavenly Province.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">That’s Qing Shui’s instinct.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although huge, the Three-Headed Dark Cloud Armored Beast was by no mean slow. Qing Shui drew out his Violet Gold Divine Shield and the Big Dipper Sword, he looked at Di Qing and said: “Hide as far as you can. Get your Heavenly Crane out and escape immediately when you have a chance. If you can escape, so can I.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Di Qing felt his sincerity and his determination. She nodded, and with the wave of a hand, a huge Heavenly Soaring Crane appeared right behind her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui hopped onto the back of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. It dashed toward the Three-Headed Dark Cloud Armored Beast with the Fire Bird, while Qing Shui turned back and told Di Qing: “Run! Meet me back here tomorrow!”</p>
