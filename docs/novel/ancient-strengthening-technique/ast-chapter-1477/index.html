He could feel that his strength had increased a lot, and his raw strength should have reached around 4,000 sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Initially, his raw strength was about 3,300 sun, which had increased quite a lot during this period of time. Because Qing Shui’s elevation in strength resulted from special means, he considered solidifying his foundation during cultivation as an extremely important matter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that his raw strength reached 4,000 sun, the power he could unleash reached around 160 million sun. This increase in strength could be called heaven-defying. After all, given his current level, it wasn’t realistic to expect such a large increase in strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the benefit of connecting the ninth heavenly meridian. Initially, after the eighth meridian was connected, the benefit he received was already very great. But who would have thought that the truly terrifying rise in power would be after connecting the ninth heavenly meridian?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t know if the future sets of meridians would also give such godly improvement after becoming connected. But leaving aside that, after the initial shock passed, the only emotion left was joy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time passed slowly. He tenderly caressed the woman below him, enjoying the softness of her body. The moans she was making were like the most marvellous sound in the universe, causing Qing Shui’s hot blood to surge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Chen’s eyes were misty as she embraced Qing Shui tightly. Now, she was feeling like a boat on a vast ocean, drifting endlessly into the horizon. That ecstasy rushing into her soul seemed never ending.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When everything finally stopped, half a day had passed. Di Chen laid limply in Qing Shui’s embrace. Both of their bodies were still wrapped around each other as a musky fragrance could be smelt from the stains left on the bed sheets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your smell is so fragrant.” Qing Shui satisfiedly roamed his hands over her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Chen had a look of passion on her face as she stared at Qing Shui. She seemed a little surprised and it was like she was thinking of something before she slowly spoke, “Qing Shui, I’m very happy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t expect Di Chen to say such words. He felt very satisfied in his heart. Staring at the beauty leaning against him, he felt a throbbing sensation in his loins once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time around, Di Chen didn’t dare to say anything. After the action, she insisted on wearing her robes before lying down limply on the bed while hugging a pillow</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui laughed. He could also only put on his clothes and after getting dressed, he hugged her into his embrace and give her a kiss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My strength actually rose by so much. Doing this can actually help us increase our strength..?” Di Chen had a puzzled look on her face as she looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s a duo-cultivation technique, so both parties are able to benefit. Was that comfortable?” Qing Shui teased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No wonder there are Dao Companions in so many sects. So it turned out that there’s a cultivation method suited for this. However, aren’t these cultivation methods of the heretical path?” Di Chen directly ignored Qing Shui’s tease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Duo-cultivation techniques can be classified into different grades. For low-grade ones, only a single party will benefit, and the other party will suffer damage. These low-grade techniques are akin to cultivation furnaces, where one party drains the vital yin or vital yang from the other. Middle-grade duo-cultivation techniques allow one party to benefit while the other neither gains nor loses. This, in fact, can be considered already very good. At the very least, one doesn’t need to sacrifice others to advance in their cultivation. For high-grade duo-cultivation, both parties will benefit. The difference is in how much one benefits.” Qing Shui broke it down for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seems like the one you are using must be one of the excellent-grade ones.” Di Chen smiled lightly. Although she was still blushing, her actions were a lot more natural now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s true. Your husband dares to say that there isn’t another duo-cultivation technique that’s better than this.” Qing Shui also laughed. That nameless technique was truly great. But most probably, given how vast the world was, there might be something even better. However, Qing Shui wasn’t trying to get the best technique or be number one. There would always be humans beyond humans, heavens beyond heavens. Nothing was absolute. Today he might be number one, but ten years or even later, the glory would fade away to nothing as he might no longer be at the top in terms of strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Chen was very happy seeing Qing Shui like this. Her languid expression turned gentle. It was said that there would be a huge transformation to women once they broke through the last barrier doing “that” with men. They would give their hearts wholeheartedly to the guy they had done the deed with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could feel her emotions. He lowered his head and kissed her forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Chen’s original strength was very strong. Now, even if she couldn’t be compared to Tantai Lingyan, the difference wasn’t that great. This made Qing Shui exceptionally surprised. What was the Lotus Platform exactly, that it could actually allow her rate of progression to proceed at such a terrifying speed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since he couldn’t make heads or tails out of it, he decided to stop thinking. He used the Gold Needle Constitution Nurturing on her to stabilize her foundation. Being able to pass the tribulation of false god was already an indication that her foundation was stable enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those beside Qing Shui who easily passed the tribulation of the False God Realm would usually be very close to him. The tribulation was naturally terrifying, but several people had passed it before. The more False Gods a sect had, the more power it naturally would possess. In any case, their constitution had been strengthened by Qing Shui since a very long time ago. With sufficient resources to train the later generations, the number of False Gods would only increase in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Chen and Di Qing were sisters, both women from the Portraits of Beauty. However, their strength was quite far apart. &nbsp;Di Qing’s current strength was also improving at a rapid speed, but she would still need quite a long time to catch up to Di Chen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After awhile, they returned to the Lotus Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen`er. Isn’t it about time to relocate the Lotus Sect to either the Phoenix Dance or Soaring Dragon Continent?” Standing at the location outside the Lotus Sect, Qing Shui contemplated for a while before he spoke. He felt that the time was about right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the strength of the Lotus Sect wasn’t very powerful, Di Chen’s strength was able to prop it up. In the Phoenix Dance Continent, they could also be considered a major power and could ally with the Qing Clan and Great Yan Dynasty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhm, let me discuss with my people first. If there are no unexpected accidents, we will most likely relocate over within two to three years time.” The relocation of a sect was still a major event. It couldn’t be done instantly just by wanting to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhm, I will prepare everything for you there.” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How about the others? Let’s relocate together!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew she was talking about the Putuo Mountains and Heavenly Secrets Academy. Qing Shui instantly replied even without needing to think. “If you all choose to relocate, you all might as well relocate there together. It will be more lively and over there, all of us together can be considered the hegemon of a region.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Di Chen’s gaze, Qing Shui’s silhouette grew further and further. Qing Shui stayed at the Lotus Sect for three days to accompany her. After spending three days like an immortal couple, he then rushed towards the Putuo Mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Putuo Mountains couldn’t be considered far from here. Qing Shui used his Nine Continents Step and could reach it in a very short time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Things in the Southern Seas were the same. Yehuang Guwu was no longer here, and this place was left to Yu Ruyan and Tantai Xuan to manage. However, Yehuang Guwu would also come back to take a look occasionally. It was just that because she had been pregnant and had just given birth, it’d been quite some time since she had last been back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very swiftly, he saw Yu Ruyan and Tantai Xuan at the place where Yehuang Guwu had been at in the past. Now, the two beauties were staying here to cultivate as everything they needed was here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After seeing Qing Shui, the two girls were naturally extremely happy. Yu Ruyan stepped out and hugged him before pushing him to Tantai Xuan’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The relationship between Qing Shui and Tantai Xuan was actually already fixed. It was just that they didn’t make things clear at the last step. Tantai Xuan allowed Qing Shui to pursue her but only she could touch him, and he couldn’t touch her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that even with this arrangement, it wouldn’t take too long for her to become his. This destiny between them was already guaranteed, and the only thing lacking now was time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spreading her arms open, Tantai Xuan pouted while she hugged Qing Shui lightly. An adorable woman doing such an action truly had immense killing power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did you miss me?” Qing Shui smiled as he whispered into her ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haihz, you are good in all aspects, but you always don’t want to tell the truth. I know you say this because of good intentions. You are worried that if you say you miss me, I will be distracted and won’t be able to focus on my cultivation. Now, there’s no need to be afraid of this any more, and there’s no need to endure it.” Qing Shui seriously spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ai, Why is your skin so thick?” Tantai Xuan smiled and pushed Qing Shui away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them chatted with laughter as they ascended the bamboo building. Qing Shui told them the main important points. All major sects in the Western Oxhe Continent had a single-direction ancient teleportation array that was able to connect to the Phoenix Dance Continent or Soaring Dragon Continent. The only place where the teleportation array was restricted was the Haohan Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two women were very happy after they heard it. In fact, they were looking forward to going to the Dancing Phoenix Continent. Next, after knowing that Yehuang Guwu had given birth to a child, the two females started casting strange looks at Qing Shui. After all, Yehuang Guwu was their master. Although they had addressed each other as sisters since long ago and there was really no difference between them and real sisters, the custom of some places would still be unable to accept this. Only for some places would a man be able to marry as many wives as he wanted. There were very few cases of a woman married to many men. Usually, only very powerful women would succeed in a marriage consisting of one man and one woman. Naturally, the man they married was not allowed to have other women...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was somewhat embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two women were still very happy, wanting to head off and see Yehuang Guwu and the child. Qing Shui promised them that he would bring them over once he havd the time, allowing them to either prepare to relocate to the Putuo Mountain or open a branch in the Phoenix Dance Continent. A branch could also become the headquarters; it was just that this was a test to the Putuo Mountains in the Western Oxhe Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After some people left, the remaining ones would become the main characters within the sect. However, their overall strength would surely be diminished. Although the Putuo Mountains from the other continents had enough power to cause some threat, distant water is unable to save a near fire. Hence, it would all still depend on their choices.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In any case, Qing Shui stopped contemplating about all these issues. Although he stayed here for a few days, he didn’t managed to bed Tantai Xuan. He would never force her and there was also Yu Ruyan present. Every night after their action in bed, Tantai Xuan actually felt some torment...Yu Ruyan would be extremely embarrassed when she saw the hidden bitterness in Tantai Xuan’s eyes. Tantai Xuan asked her more than once if doing it really felt comfortable...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time they arrived at the Heavenly Secrets Academy, almost half the celebratory period for the new year had passed. However it couldn’t be considered late. The moment he arrived at the familiar manor, he saw the Eldest Princess, Yan Jingyu, the Seventh Princess and Qing Sha with her sister. They would occasionally let out peals of laughter while chatting and all of a sudden, the Eldest Princess turned her head and saw Qing Shui standing next to them, looking at them with a smile on his face.</span></p>
