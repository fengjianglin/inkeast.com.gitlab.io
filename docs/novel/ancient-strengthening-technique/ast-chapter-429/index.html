 <p><strong>Chapter 429 Canghai Mingyue Breakthrough, Martial King level Martial Warrior.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 429 - Canghai Mingyue Breakthrough, Martial King level Martial Warrior</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui rushed back to Earthly Paradise, it was already &nbsp;afternoon. He helped Canghai Mingyue reinforce her meridians once more. This time there was only a 10% increase in strength and tenacity.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After the three reinforcements, Canghai Mingyue’s meridians had improved by 60% in both aspects. &nbsp;Even though it did not mean that she would directly gain a breakthrough or suddenly gain a large boost in strength, reinforcing her meridians was akin to how increasing the volume of a vase would naturally allow it to hold more water.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time around, as he held the pair of jade-white legs, which were always so mind-blowing beautiful to him, he was moved spiritually. He was easily entranced as he felt that soft, gentle, satin-like skin.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue was also unsure about her feelings when she saw Qing Shui like this. While she felt delighted, the feeling was more ambiguous to her. She had been hugged by him, kissed by him, and now, both of her legs have even been touched by him.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s silhouette had unconsciously taken root in Canghai Mingyue’s heart. The Canghai couple might have been the precedent for her to despise all men in the past. She deeply loved and admired her parents. To a certain extent, the admiration and encouragement from her parents would also have an effect on her.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It has always been said that when a girl chooses her husband, she would often subconsciously compare them to her father. This was because in a girl’s heart, her father would always be their hero.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had the approval of the Canghai couple. In fact, they even went so far to match them together. It might also be because of this that Canghai Mingyue did not immediately neglect him like before.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">And also, at that time, Canghai Mingyue thought that Qing Shui was the man that Liu-Li chose. After all, back then, she was still Liu-Li’s master. Perhaps, it was also because of this that, later on, she started to slowly realize how special Qing Shui was compared to other people.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Once a woman who has never been in a relationship before fell in love, she would be very persistent. From the beginning to the end, Canghai Mingyue did not say anything. But in her heart, she had already decided for herself.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Otherwise, she wouldn’t allow Qing Shui to hug her and even let him touch most of her body parts. Just like now, when he had strengthened himself already the third time, Qing Shui was still reluctant to part with her legs.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He gently touched and toyed with the white legs that were like the sculpture of god. Actually, every time he finished strengthening a vein, he feigned the procedure being unfinished to toy with them a bit longer."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue understood it clearly in her heart. She felt happy but also funny at the same time. However, this time, Qing Shui had toyed with it for a much longer time than before.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Have you had enough!” Canghai Mingyue said in a slightly angry manner. The expression on her face conveyed reluctance.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Not yet, it’s too good-looking. I have never seen such a pair of beautiful legs before.” Qing Shui said with a smile. He pressed his thumb on a soft part of her foot.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ah, it’s aching!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled. He didn’t say anything because he saw her face turning red the very moment she finished yelling.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though Qing Shui’s godly hands were not capable of massage, his skill in easing the tension in muscle and bone, and warming and pressing the acupoints, had an even stronger effect than massaging.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li knew about it. It felt so good to the point that it would make the bones soft.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Later on, Qing Shui put down his fingers on the Zhaohai and Ran Gu acupoints. He gently pressed on them and continuously channeled the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique into them while glancing at Canghai Mingyue as she pursed her lips and endured the pain with supreme effort.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui mockingly put down his thumb on the Yong Quan Acupoint and slowly revolved and put pressure on it. He even went so far as to grab on her half of her leg with his other hand. The warmth constantly nourished her leg.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Are you feeling comfortable?” Qing Shui smiled softly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In response to that, Canghai Mingyue quickly pulled back her leg and scolded in embarrassment: “ You scoundrel.”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Canghai Mingyue finished speaking, she looked at Qing Shui with a shy look. As always, her beautiful eyes that had always looked arrogant and disdainful still had an infinite amount of gentleness in them even at this moment. However, there was an additional unknown, complicated feeling.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I want to hug you!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui would never forget Canghai Mingyue’s words of letting him hug her. He didn’t know what happened to himself, but the impetus of that feeling was unusually strong in this moment.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Before Canghai Mingyue, who was wearing a sexy pajamas, managed to say anything, Qing Shui had already tightly embraced her.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui only realized that the black pajamas was as thin as a cicada’s wing after he hugged Canghai Mingyue. Now, Qing Shui was able to clearly feel the bulging part of her chest that he previously did not take notice of, nor paid attention to, when he was using his hands.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s heart began beating really, really fast. At the same time, he also felt Canghai Mingyue’s heartbeat. Their two hearts were as if they were slowly sinking into one another. Slowly, rather than saying the heartbeats became identical, it was more like they had fused with each other.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It’s the second time Qing Shui encountered this kind of situation. This feeling was really strange. It felt really clear, but at the same time, he didn’t feel the urge to have sex as strong as before.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, the essence within Canghai Mingyue’s body began to surge violently. Qing Shui was previously spaced out and had yet to come back to his senses. But now, he could see Canghai Mingyue slightly knitting her brows.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She was actually going to break through under this kind of circumstances!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui moved both of his hands that were on Canghai Mingyue’s back to the spine section on both sides of the Lingtai acupoint. Simultaneously, he also released his nature energy let it go into Canghai Mingyue’s vessels. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Actually, Qing Shui was originally planning to use his nature energy to assist Canghai Mingyue at the time when she broke through, but he didn’t expect the hug just now to progress towards an advancement.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that those kind of mysterious feelings were good signs. Originally, Qing Shui felt that even if he had helped her, it still wasn’t guaranteed that she would be sure of breaking through. But now, Qing Shui was sure that she would be capable of breaking through.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui observed her face as she closed her eyes. Her face being so near to him made Qing Shui have pervertic thoughts. The sensation of being near to that beautiful body of hers was that obvious, the only unfortunate thing was that it wasn’t the time for it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the moment when Qing Shui channelled the nature energy into Canghai Mingyue’s veins through her Tao Dao acupoint and Ling Tai acupoint, Canghai Mingyue’s body jerked. But very quickly, she calmed back down.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It were these particular feelings that gave Qing Shui quite a lot of thoughts. This was because she already believed in herself to this extent.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">One could only break through the obstacles themselves. It's not something that other people could interfere with. To every warrior, their Xiantian Qi was unique. They wouldn't fuse with other warrior’s Xiantian qi, therefore, even if one have wanted to help, it would be for naught. However, there were a few medicinal pills and Heavenly and Earthly Treasures that were capable of increasing the success rate of a breakthrough. Unfortunately, these things were too precious and rare.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Xiantian Qi of a warrior would instinctively repel the Xiantian Qi that went inside the body. If an expert forcefully channeled in Xiantian Qi into their vessel, the consequence was that their vessels would break apart. Otherwise, breaking through wouldn't have been as difficult if you could receive help from external sources.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The weaklings’ Xiantian Qi on the other hand, was not capable of going into the vessels of an expert. It would immediately be repelled away.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Therefore, at the time when Qing Shui’s nature energy entered Canghai Mingyue’s veins, she was frightened by Qing Shui’s actions. She thought that it was Qing Shui’s Xiantian Qi. But after that, she didn't say anything more. This was because she believed in Qing Shui. If Qing Shui were to really harm her, she would just accept her fate.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The nature energy was the purest and righteous Qi in the world. Not only could it harmonize with everything, it even possessed an indomitable aura to eliminate all evils.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">On top of the breakthrough barrier, Qing Shui felt that the amount of nature energy at the moment was already able to increase her hope of succeeding by about ten percent. This ten percent was based on the original success rate for whoever was breaking through at the moment.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Take Canghai Mingyue as an example, her success rate of breaking through to the Martial King stage was fifty percent. In response to that, Qing Shui could use the nature energy he has now to add an additional 10% of success rate to the original 50%.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Don’t look down on this tiny success rate. At a crucial moment, it would be sufficient to be the last straw to break the camel’s back.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel the Xiantian Qi within Canghai Mingyue getting more and more violent as it revolved strongly inside her body. He sensed that his nature energy had made her Xiantian Qi become sharper.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui once thought that he could help the Qing Clan family members at the time when they were breaking through. Unfortunately, one can only rely on oneself for the phase of breaking through from Houtian to Xiantian. This was because they didn't have much Xiantian Qi, so even if Qing Shui had used up all his nature energy, it would still have no effect.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After the Xiantian Qi in Canghai Mingyue’s body achieved a saturation point, it started to revolve rapidly inside her. It revolved again and again until it achieved a terrifying level. It waited until it had accumulated the largest pushing force, and only then did it charge into the firm barrier.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After the collision, the Xiantian Qi got pushed back. After it revolved once, its aura recovered back to its peak and once again charged into the barrier.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui continuously mixed up his nature energy with Canghai Mingyue’s Xiantian qi. Every time it collided, it would collide at that point.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After once again revolving a few turns and raising the Xiantian Qi to the pinnacle, it once again charged towards the firm barrier.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Xiantian Qi returned after once again colliding with the barrier, but now there was a small and narrow hole on the barrier. Qing Shui naturally felt relieved in his heart as this was a hole that meant the breakthrough had succeeded.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It didn't matter how small the hole was. Because it was the one ant hole that would cause the collapse of a thousand li dyke!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pupu!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The small hole became bigger and bigger. The surroundings of the small hole had also began to shatter apart.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hong!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the moment when a noise different from before was made, Qing Shui knew that she has succeeded. He quickly drew back his nature energy. However, he didn't actually move, as he was still softly hugging her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the instant Canghai Mingyue broke through the barrier, a tremendous force went in from the Bai Hui acupoint and fused with the precious Xiantian Qi trying to break past the barrier.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Immediately, Canghai Mingyue felt the strength all over her body rising madly. She also felt an indescribable comfortable feeling all over her body. In fact, it might feel even more comfortable than when Qing Shui was putting pressure on her legs.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She opened up both of her eyes with a satisfied smile hanging on her face. However, when she realized that Qing Shui was still hugging her, her face immediately turned red, and her long eyebrows were even shaking!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Congratulations, Mingyue. Now, you are also a warrior that has advanced into the Martial King stage.” Qing Shui directly embraced Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ah! Don't be unreasonable!” Canghai Mingyue screamed and stated. Be that as it may, her whole body was currently in Qing Shui’s chest. She couldn't get herself to say that his manly scent were making her feel nervous.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I want a hug, and you have given me permission before…” Qing Shui hugged Canghai Mingyue’s soft body that was as bright as jade. He felt as though his soul was being purified. Or rather, he felt that his mind was a bit empty, just like the instant when he was having fun with a woman and released it…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Thank you, Qing Shui!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pa!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ah!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue screamed once and went into Qing Shui’s chest. She immediately bit Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui clenched his teeth. It didn’t really feel painful, nor was it itchy, but this had made him fail to understand how he himself was feeling. Previously, when Canghai Mingyue thanked him, Qing Shui right away slapped her round and beautiful butt in order to teach her a lesson.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The voice was clear and melodious, it also sounded a bit charming, but Qing Shui only had one feeling.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This sensation was really good. The sensation that felt soft all the way through the bone was so beautiful to the point that it could shock someone!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two only separated from each other when they heard the noise of footsteps. At this moment, Huoyun Liu-Li saw the two’s strange expressions. She looked at Qing Shui and then looked back at the shy Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You got her? So fast?” Huoyun Liu-Li felt aroused and asked Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui: “......”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li, don't you dare spout nonsense.” Canghai Mingyue told Huoyun Liu-li after she embarrassingly gazed at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright alright, I will stop saying nonsense. Sister, you are already his woman, you need to keep an eye on him.” At the moment, Huoyun Liu-Li and Canghai Mingyue were not much different than blood-related sisters.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue felt unusually warm deep in her heart. To her, Huoyun Liu-Li was even more important than Qing Shui. She thought about the decisions and opinions of her parents at that time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, they were no longer here, so she couldn't help but feel hurt.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sister, I'll stop saying it, don't be angry!” As soon as Huoyun Liu-Li saw Canghai Mingyue’s lonely expression, she immediately felt nervous. She thought that it was because of her statement.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could see Canghai Mingyue’s eyes. Added on to the fact that Qing Shui knew her well, she wouldn't be like this because of Liu-Li’s words. Therefore, he could already figure out roughly the gist of things.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Silly girl, it’s nothing to do with you. I was just thinking about another matter.” Canghai Mingyue smiled bitterly and told Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Stop thinking about it, be happy. As long as you are happy and have a blessed life, the people who care for you will be happy too.” Qing Shui smiled and said.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yeah! Today, Liu-li and I will be preparing the meal. Let’s all enjoy this meal together. Tomorrow, we will go back to Heavenly Palace! I am already missing Grandmaster.” Canghai Mingyue curbed all the unhappy feelings and said with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sister, you have broken through?” Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Canghai Mingyue in amazement. She didn’t actually realize that Canghai Mingyue had broken through, but she still remembered her saying that she would only go back after she advanced to the next stage.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue put on her long cloth, looking at Qing Shui as she smiled:” Liu-Li and I are going to prepare the meal now. After a while, come down and eat.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked on as the two girls left. At the moment, a feeling of warmth pervaded the deepest recesses of his heart. In his previous incarnation, this kind of treatment was something he couldn’t even dream of. Women of this grade would also only be in the World of the Nine Continents. In his previous incarnation, there weren’t many women who dared to appear in public without makeup.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, even these women with enough makeup on to form a second layer of skin would be noble and incomparable virtuous, or rather realistic, in that world. Especially a few of the girls that wanted to be whores but yet still demand respect. During daytime, they were shy and pure girls in front of you, &nbsp;so much so to the point that they wouldn’t even let you hold their hands. At night, however, they would be the kind of whores that rode on men and shaked on them wildly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In his previous incarnations, even if he had met two women like this, Qing Shui would never stand a chance, so much so that even if the woman had liked Qing Shui and wanted to be with him, Qing Shui would still know that it would never work out.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There weren’t any wolves around those beautiful women. He couldn’t even imagine what kind of person would have been around the two good-looking women, and they would naturally have their ways to force him to leave.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was precisely the problem with strength!&nbsp;</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 429 - Canghai Mingyue Breakthrough, Martial King level Martial Warrior</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui rushed back to Earthly Paradise, it was already &nbsp;afternoon. He helped Canghai Mingyue reinforce her meridians once more. This time there was only a 10% increase in strength and tenacity.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After the three reinforcements, Canghai Mingyue’s meridians had improved by 60% in both aspects. &nbsp;Even though it did not mean that she would directly gain a breakthrough or suddenly gain a large boost in strength, reinforcing her meridians was akin to how increasing the volume of a vase would naturally allow it to hold more water.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time around, as he held the pair of jade-white legs, which were always so mind-blowing beautiful to him, he was moved spiritually. He was easily entranced as he felt that soft, gentle, satin-like skin.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue was also unsure about her feelings when she saw Qing Shui like this. While she felt delighted, the feeling was more ambiguous to her. She had been hugged by him, kissed by him, and now, both of her legs have even been touched by him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s silhouette had unconsciously taken root in Canghai Mingyue’s heart. The Canghai couple might have been the precedent for her to despise all men in the past. She deeply loved and admired her parents. To a certain extent, the admiration and encouragement from her parents would also have an effect on her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It has always been said that when a girl chooses her husband, she would often subconsciously compare them to her father. This was because in a girl’s heart, her father would always be their hero.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had the approval of the Canghai couple. In fact, they even went so far to match them together. It might also be because of this that Canghai Mingyue did not immediately neglect him like before.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">And also, at that time, Canghai Mingyue thought that Qing Shui was the man that Liu-Li chose. After all, back then, she was still Liu-Li’s master. Perhaps, it was also because of this that, later on, she started to slowly realize how special Qing Shui was compared to other people.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Once a woman who has never been in a relationship before fell in love, she would be very persistent. From the beginning to the end, Canghai Mingyue did not say anything. But in her heart, she had already decided for herself.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Otherwise, she wouldn’t allow Qing Shui to hug her and even let him touch most of her body parts. Just like now, when he had strengthened himself already the third time, Qing Shui was still reluctant to part with her legs.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He gently touched and toyed with the white legs that were like the sculpture of god. Actually, every time he finished strengthening a vein, he feigned the procedure being unfinished to toy with them a bit longer."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue understood it clearly in her heart. She felt happy but also funny at the same time. However, this time, Qing Shui had toyed with it for a much longer time than before.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Have you had enough!” Canghai Mingyue said in a slightly angry manner. The expression on her face conveyed reluctance.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Not yet, it’s too good-looking. I have never seen such a pair of beautiful legs before.” Qing Shui said with a smile. He pressed his thumb on a soft part of her foot.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ah, it’s aching!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled. He didn’t say anything because he saw her face turning red the very moment she finished yelling.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though Qing Shui’s godly hands were not capable of massage, his skill in easing the tension in muscle and bone, and warming and pressing the acupoints, had an even stronger effect than massaging.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li knew about it. It felt so good to the point that it would make the bones soft.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Later on, Qing Shui put down his fingers on the Zhaohai and Ran Gu acupoints. He gently pressed on them and continuously channeled the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique into them while glancing at Canghai Mingyue as she pursed her lips and endured the pain with supreme effort.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui mockingly put down his thumb on the Yong Quan Acupoint and slowly revolved and put pressure on it. He even went so far as to grab on her half of her leg with his other hand. The warmth constantly nourished her leg.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Are you feeling comfortable?” Qing Shui smiled softly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In response to that, Canghai Mingyue quickly pulled back her leg and scolded in embarrassment: “ You scoundrel.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After Canghai Mingyue finished speaking, she looked at Qing Shui with a shy look. As always, her beautiful eyes that had always looked arrogant and disdainful still had an infinite amount of gentleness in them even at this moment. However, there was an additional unknown, complicated feeling.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I want to hug you!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui would never forget Canghai Mingyue’s words of letting him hug her. He didn’t know what happened to himself, but the impetus of that feeling was unusually strong in this moment.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Before Canghai Mingyue, who was wearing a sexy pajamas, managed to say anything, Qing Shui had already tightly embraced her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui only realized that the black pajamas was as thin as a cicada’s wing after he hugged Canghai Mingyue. Now, Qing Shui was able to clearly feel the bulging part of her chest that he previously did not take notice of, nor paid attention to, when he was using his hands.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s heart began beating really, really fast. At the same time, he also felt Canghai Mingyue’s heartbeat. Their two hearts were as if they were slowly sinking into one another. Slowly, rather than saying the heartbeats became identical, it was more like they had fused with each other.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It’s the second time Qing Shui encountered this kind of situation. This feeling was really strange. It felt really clear, but at the same time, he didn’t feel the urge to have sex as strong as before.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, the essence within Canghai Mingyue’s body began to surge violently. Qing Shui was previously spaced out and had yet to come back to his senses. But now, he could see Canghai Mingyue slightly knitting her brows.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She was actually going to break through under this kind of circumstances!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui moved both of his hands that were on Canghai Mingyue’s back to the spine section on both sides of the Lingtai acupoint. Simultaneously, he also released his nature energy let it go into Canghai Mingyue’s vessels. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Actually, Qing Shui was originally planning to use his nature energy to assist Canghai Mingyue at the time when she broke through, but he didn’t expect the hug just now to progress towards an advancement.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that those kind of mysterious feelings were good signs. Originally, Qing Shui felt that even if he had helped her, it still wasn’t guaranteed that she would be sure of breaking through. But now, Qing Shui was sure that she would be capable of breaking through.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui observed her face as she closed her eyes. Her face being so near to him made Qing Shui have pervertic thoughts. The sensation of being near to that beautiful body of hers was that obvious, the only unfortunate thing was that it wasn’t the time for it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the moment when Qing Shui channelled the nature energy into Canghai Mingyue’s veins through her Tao Dao acupoint and Ling Tai acupoint, Canghai Mingyue’s body jerked. But very quickly, she calmed back down.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It were these particular feelings that gave Qing Shui quite a lot of thoughts. This was because she already believed in herself to this extent.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">One could only break through the obstacles themselves. It's not something that other people could interfere with. To every warrior, their Xiantian Qi was unique. They wouldn't fuse with other warrior’s Xiantian qi, therefore, even if one have wanted to help, it would be for naught. However, there were a few medicinal pills and Heavenly and Earthly Treasures that were capable of increasing the success rate of a breakthrough. Unfortunately, these things were too precious and rare.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Xiantian Qi of a warrior would instinctively repel the Xiantian Qi that went inside the body. If an expert forcefully channeled in Xiantian Qi into their vessel, the consequence was that their vessels would break apart. Otherwise, breaking through wouldn't have been as difficult if you could receive help from external sources.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The weaklings’ Xiantian Qi on the other hand, was not capable of going into the vessels of an expert. It would immediately be repelled away.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Therefore, at the time when Qing Shui’s nature energy entered Canghai Mingyue’s veins, she was frightened by Qing Shui’s actions. She thought that it was Qing Shui’s Xiantian Qi. But after that, she didn't say anything more. This was because she believed in Qing Shui. If Qing Shui were to really harm her, she would just accept her fate.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The nature energy was the purest and righteous Qi in the world. Not only could it harmonize with everything, it even possessed an indomitable aura to eliminate all evils.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">On top of the breakthrough barrier, Qing Shui felt that the amount of nature energy at the moment was already able to increase her hope of succeeding by about ten percent. This ten percent was based on the original success rate for whoever was breaking through at the moment.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Take Canghai Mingyue as an example, her success rate of breaking through to the Martial King stage was fifty percent. In response to that, Qing Shui could use the nature energy he has now to add an additional 10% of success rate to the original 50%.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Don’t look down on this tiny success rate. At a crucial moment, it would be sufficient to be the last straw to break the camel’s back.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel the Xiantian Qi within Canghai Mingyue getting more and more violent as it revolved strongly inside her body. He sensed that his nature energy had made her Xiantian Qi become sharper.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui once thought that he could help the Qing Clan family members at the time when they were breaking through. Unfortunately, one can only rely on oneself for the phase of breaking through from Houtian to Xiantian. This was because they didn't have much Xiantian Qi, so even if Qing Shui had used up all his nature energy, it would still have no effect.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After the Xiantian Qi in Canghai Mingyue’s body achieved a saturation point, it started to revolve rapidly inside her. It revolved again and again until it achieved a terrifying level. It waited until it had accumulated the largest pushing force, and only then did it charge into the firm barrier.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After the collision, the Xiantian Qi got pushed back. After it revolved once, its aura recovered back to its peak and once again charged into the barrier.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui continuously mixed up his nature energy with Canghai Mingyue’s Xiantian qi. Every time it collided, it would collide at that point.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After once again revolving a few turns and raising the Xiantian Qi to the pinnacle, it once again charged towards the firm barrier.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Xiantian Qi returned after once again colliding with the barrier, but now there was a small and narrow hole on the barrier. Qing Shui naturally felt relieved in his heart as this was a hole that meant the breakthrough had succeeded.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It didn't matter how small the hole was. Because it was the one ant hole that would cause the collapse of a thousand li dyke!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pupu!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The small hole became bigger and bigger. The surroundings of the small hole had also began to shatter apart.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hong!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the moment when a noise different from before was made, Qing Shui knew that she has succeeded. He quickly drew back his nature energy. However, he didn't actually move, as he was still softly hugging her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the instant Canghai Mingyue broke through the barrier, a tremendous force went in from the Bai Hui acupoint and fused with the precious Xiantian Qi trying to break past the barrier.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Immediately, Canghai Mingyue felt the strength all over her body rising madly. She also felt an indescribable comfortable feeling all over her body. In fact, it might feel even more comfortable than when Qing Shui was putting pressure on her legs.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She opened up both of her eyes with a satisfied smile hanging on her face. However, when she realized that Qing Shui was still hugging her, her face immediately turned red, and her long eyebrows were even shaking!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Congratulations, Mingyue. Now, you are also a warrior that has advanced into the Martial King stage.” Qing Shui directly embraced Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ah! Don't be unreasonable!” Canghai Mingyue screamed and stated. Be that as it may, her whole body was currently in Qing Shui’s chest. She couldn't get herself to say that his manly scent were making her feel nervous.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I want a hug, and you have given me permission before…” Qing Shui hugged Canghai Mingyue’s soft body that was as bright as jade. He felt as though his soul was being purified. Or rather, he felt that his mind was a bit empty, just like the instant when he was having fun with a woman and released it…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Thank you, Qing Shui!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pa!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ah!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue screamed once and went into Qing Shui’s chest. She immediately bit Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui clenched his teeth. It didn’t really feel painful, nor was it itchy, but this had made him fail to understand how he himself was feeling. Previously, when Canghai Mingyue thanked him, Qing Shui right away slapped her round and beautiful butt in order to teach her a lesson.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The voice was clear and melodious, it also sounded a bit charming, but Qing Shui only had one feeling.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This sensation was really good. The sensation that felt soft all the way through the bone was so beautiful to the point that it could shock someone!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The two only separated from each other when they heard the noise of footsteps. At this moment, Huoyun Liu-Li saw the two’s strange expressions. She looked at Qing Shui and then looked back at the shy Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You got her? So fast?” Huoyun Liu-Li felt aroused and asked Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui: “......”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li, don't you dare spout nonsense.” Canghai Mingyue told Huoyun Liu-li after she embarrassingly gazed at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright alright, I will stop saying nonsense. Sister, you are already his woman, you need to keep an eye on him.” At the moment, Huoyun Liu-Li and Canghai Mingyue were not much different than blood-related sisters.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue felt unusually warm deep in her heart. To her, Huoyun Liu-Li was even more important than Qing Shui. She thought about the decisions and opinions of her parents at that time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, they were no longer here, so she couldn't help but feel hurt.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sister, I'll stop saying it, don't be angry!” As soon as Huoyun Liu-Li saw Canghai Mingyue’s lonely expression, she immediately felt nervous. She thought that it was because of her statement.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could see Canghai Mingyue’s eyes. Added on to the fact that Qing Shui knew her well, she wouldn't be like this because of Liu-Li’s words. Therefore, he could already figure out roughly the gist of things.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Silly girl, it’s nothing to do with you. I was just thinking about another matter.” Canghai Mingyue smiled bitterly and told Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Stop thinking about it, be happy. As long as you are happy and have a blessed life, the people who care for you will be happy too.” Qing Shui smiled and said.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yeah! Today, Liu-li and I will be preparing the meal. Let’s all enjoy this meal together. Tomorrow, we will go back to Heavenly Palace! I am already missing Grandmaster.” Canghai Mingyue curbed all the unhappy feelings and said with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sister, you have broken through?” Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Canghai Mingyue in amazement. She didn’t actually realize that Canghai Mingyue had broken through, but she still remembered her saying that she would only go back after she advanced to the next stage.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue put on her long cloth, looking at Qing Shui as she smiled:” Liu-Li and I are going to prepare the meal now. After a while, come down and eat.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked on as the two girls left. At the moment, a feeling of warmth pervaded the deepest recesses of his heart. In his previous incarnation, this kind of treatment was something he couldn’t even dream of. Women of this grade would also only be in the World of the Nine Continents. In his previous incarnation, there weren’t many women who dared to appear in public without makeup.&nbsp;</p>

 <p dir="ltr">There weren’t any wolves around those beautiful women. He couldn’t even imagine what kind of person would have been around the two good-looking women, and they would naturally have their ways to force him to leave.</p>
