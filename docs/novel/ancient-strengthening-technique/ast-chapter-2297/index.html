 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, Old Three! Use a bit more strength! Did you not eat or what?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shut up, Old Five! I’m already old now, so what?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I really have sinned too much when I was younger, so I’m paying for it now!” sighed one elder of the She Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two elderly members of the Chi Clan continuously jabbed at each other with their words. On the other hand, the two strong opposing elders of the She Clan had already endured many hits from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, The Third and Fifth Uncle were able to defeat their opponents so easily due to Qing Shui’s help. Otherwise, it would have been much harder for them to win. It was possible that they might even lose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fight had already reached the climax and didn’t continue for that long after it. Qing Shui’s Dragon-capturing hands, Gouging Strike, and Bright Buddha Seal were all used at critical points, which was at times when the Chi Clan’s experts could deliver a deadly blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The enemies’ experts were confused. The attacks that should have been easily dodged came smashing at them. They were then stunned as they discovered that their bodies refused to move. And afterward, the darkness engulfed them one by one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battle concluded quickly as their opponents left everything and retreated. Only three people from the Chi Clan were hurt, and it wasn’t even that serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cleaning the battlefield after the fight was something that made the members of the Chi Clan very happy because this filled them with a sense of accomplishment. It built their strength and their confidence that they would need to stand tall in this region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the fight, they also knew about the power that Qing Shui had trusted them with. But they weren’t sure about the situation as a whole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By killing tens of people that had come from the She Clan, they knew that they would shock them a bit. However, they shouldn’t let this situation be. Without pulling out the roots of the problem, the She Clan would just come back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides, Qing Shui had a guess: the next time the She Clan attacked, they would bring stronger members, stronger in the sense of better quality and quantity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui wasn’t afraid. Worrying about useless things wasn’t his style; moreover, the strength of the Chi Clan now was no longer ignorable. With the Formations that Qing Shui had imparted them, along with a form of sharpening their weapons before the fight, he hoped that they would be able to use them effectively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without realizing it, Qing Shui had been treated as a mysterious existence within the Chi Clan. He had a sort of mysterious strength. If a clan had such a strong member, it would be hard for them not to become strong. Along with the outstanding ladies beside him, they knew that he could keep forces like the Chi Clan under his control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Third Uncle Chi and Fifth Uncle Chi were a little beyond belief when they thought about it. By raising their own strength by two folds the original, they had reduced their opponents’ battle prowess by the same amount. These strengthening skills could lessen the disparity of strength between experts substantially. If they were originally on an equal level, then one of them would leave the other in the dust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As long there was a crowd with Qing Shui in the center, these people would be like an invincible wall. No army would be able to reach him even at the cost of all of their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, what made the Chi Clan really happy was the fact that Qing Shui was their friend. He was simply the gift from God. For all of the members of the Chi Clan, rejuvenating their Clan was their greatest wish. What had happened that year had left a hollow on their heart, and they were not about to let that go even if they died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although their defensive formation hadn’t contributed much during the battle, they still won in the end. After cleaning up the battlefield, they went on to party and celebrate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a while, the sky turned dark, and Shen Huang and Beihuang Fan went back to their assigned quarters with Qing Shui. The Chi Clan members thought that they would live in a little courtyard, but they only took a floor with three rooms inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had a small courtyard with a pavilion for their own use. The rooms here were pretty relaxed, and Qing Shui also had the status to take a courtyard all by himself. Qing Shui took the room in the middle for himself, and the two ladies took the two other rooms beside Qing Shui’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they ate, they ate together. However, this time, Qing Shui took out a little bottle of wine which made the two girls very happy. They had always had the simple and elegant appeal on them, however, the little red tinge on their face complemented their attractiveness doubtlessly, simply doubling their allure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui felt that this mealtime was even more of a feast for the eyes, and he continued to look at the two girls. The table had already been filled with the best food, but looking around, Qing Shui still thought that the allure of the two girls was even more irresistible, especially because he felt that they had reached a new milestone in their relationship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking of the small hands of Shen Huang, Qing Shui felt the heat go over him. All of a sudden, Shen Huang returned to the room after eating a little more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan also stood up as she saw this, but she was stopped by Qing Shui. “What? am I that scary? Stay and eat with me, otherwise, I’ll be lonely!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan relented and sat back down, she smiled. “No way, if you were scary, I wouldn’t dare follow you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little Fan Fan, I want to eat that duck wing there,” Qing Shui pointed at the full table. Hearing that, Beihuang Fan reached out with her chopsticks and took a piece of duck wing for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui bit with his mouth and continued chewing, sticking his tongue out a little. It was a very vulgar gesture, as well as licentious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan shivered a little. This bad boy over here had shown her some kind of ‘book’, saying that it was a Divine Technique. However, after opening it, the nude scene of boys and girls could be seen. There was this scene of a girl using her mouth to tease the ‘weapon’ of one of the guys, and the opposite was also in there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that time, of course, Beihuang Fan didn’t want to look, but Qing Shui kept on saying that it was a Divine Technique and he wasn’t lying to her, even urging her to read it. Now even she knew that it was a book of Dual Cultivation. She only felt a bit weirded out seeing how Qing Shui treated it like a treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aren’t you going to eat? Otherwise, I’m leaving!” said Beihuang Fan, not able to take it anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aren’t these all worthy of appreciation? Want me to feed you?” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No need! I’m full!” Beihuang Fan said, flustered. Watching the look in this bad boy’s eyes made her think of many dirty things. People really do turn into the ones they’re close to...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After finishing, Qing Shui shoved his mouth over to her direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan used a handkerchief to wipe his mouth without a word. She lost her bet and needed to wait for him the whole day...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui said, “Little Fan, go turn on the water. I need to take a shower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmm, Why don’t you come and clean my back?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go die…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Qing Shui had finished showering, he no longer saw Beihuang Fan. Walking to her room and pushing on it a little, he found that it was locked. Qing Shui smiled. Of course, a door like this would be no obstacle for him, but if he just barged in without her knowing that would be a little too much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please open the door, there’s something I want to talk to you about.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan lay on the other side of the door. “No way, I know you’re just trying to tease me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“By saying something like that, now I really want to go tease you.” Qing Shui’s heart was still warm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s late and I want to sleep, go to bed!” Beihuang Fan said lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to give you a massage. Think about how comfortable that is; the feeling as if you were high up in the clouds,” Qing Shui said this with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you going to give me just a massage?” asked Beihuang Fan with a sneer, she opened the door to her room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui saw that she was smiling, and his heart relaxed a little. “Do you want me to?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes...” Beihuang Fan said lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui really didn’t think that she would say this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Beihuang Fan continued to say. “But I need to restrain myself, I can’t always let you pleasure me. Qing Shui, it’s alright, just go to sleep. My day and night are yours, don’t rush it, or I’m afraid I won’t be able to control myself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui had nothing to say; this woman was too fine. In the end, he only nodded while he kept teasing her a bit. “Alright, you sleep earlier too. But whenever you want to feel better… you know where to knock.”</span></p>
