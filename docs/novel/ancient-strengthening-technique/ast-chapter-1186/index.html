 <p><strong>AST 1186 - I Admit Defeat, I Admit Defeat, We Admit Defeat As Well, I'll Fight This Match</strong></p>
 <p>"I admit defeat!"</p>
 <p>The voice wasn't loud but it rang out abruptly. No one would have thought that he would admit his defeat directly like this. Could it be that he was taken aback by the man who wore pitch-black battle armor?</p>
 <p>Admit defeat or die!</p>
 <p>Yan Yangsong didn't wish to make a pointless sacrifice. Since he already knew that he was going to lose anyway, why did he need to throw away his life? He hadn't lived long enough. The reason he chose this was because he valued his life over everything else.</p>
 <p>The reason Yu Clan was like this should be so that they could humiliate Yan Clan and deal a heavy blow to the other participants from Yan Clan who would be taking part. And in this way, Yu Clan would also be able to have another option in the candidate they chose to take part.</p>
 <p>Many people from Yan Clan fell silent. Yan Yangsong's countenance was grim, but he seemed to be pretending to remain calm. However, right now, everyone understood.</p>
 <p>Since Yan Clan forfeited this round, it was considered their loss. It was Yu Clan's turn to go up next!</p>
 <p>Very quickly, in a few breath's time, another person from Yu Clan stood there. This was a burly man who was like an iron tower. Compared to ordinary men, his height was one-third taller. He seemed to be one size bigger than Little Fatty as well.</p>
 <p>This person was dressed in heavy armor and holding a five-meter long huge axe. The axe looked very coordinated in his hand and when he stood there, he gave one the feeling that he would even be able to hack a mountain into two.</p>
 <p>"Who has the confidence to beat him?" Yan Yangchi asked softly. There weren't many of them left. There was only himself, Yan Yangliu, Yan Leng and Yan Jinyu. Yan Jinyu could possibly let Qing Shui take part on her behalf.</p>
 <p>A total of five rounds, with three losses and two victories. Yan Yangliu will definitely lose one round. Therefore, they could basically be assured of four losses. If they were to lose one more round, it would be their loss.</p>
 <p>Right now, many people had understood what was going on and were feeling worried for the Yan Clan. Or rather, it could be said that they were waiting to see if the people from Yan Clan could change the situation to be in their favor. Yu Clan had come with determination to win. Moreover, there was still one round for which they could get external help. Even if Yu Clan couldn't win one more round, they would still have one final chance.</p>
 <p>Yu Clan had the 3rd Prince to back them up!</p>
 <p>"Eldest Brother, you should go!" Just then, Qing Shui said to Yan Yangchi.</p>
 <p>"Let Eldest Brother head up last, I'll take this!" Yan Leng spoke up.</p>
 <p>"It should be hard for your attacks to break through this guy's Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation. Only Eldest Brother will be able to win against him," Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</p>
 <p>"Then how are we going to fight in the other rounds?" Yan Jinyu asked, worried.</p>
 <p>"A man like this should already be considered top notch in Yu Clan. We'll see how it goes after this round. If we can't even win this round, is there a point in carrying on?" Qing Shui was actually very conflicted as well. He was making a gamble, hoping that the next participant could be suppressed by Yan Leng's speed, wagering on the fact that this bulky man was Yu Clan's strongest young man.</p>
 <p>"Alright, I'll go!" Yan Yangchi's tightly knitted brows relaxed.</p>
 <p>"Eldest Brother, don't feel pressured. We'll see how it goes after beating him. This person's greatest strength should be "to lord over an area", therefore, you should try to not let him remain in a particular position for too long. It'll be best if you can get him to change his position every now and then. One more thing. You must kill him." The reason Qing Shui said this was because he could tell that the person on the arena was cultivating a martial technique that was similar to his State of Immovable as Mountains. However, the difference was that the longer he stood in a particular spot, the stronger he would become.</p>
 <p>"Alright!" Yan Yangchi nodded and flew toward the arena. He trusted Qing Shui a lot too and felt that this forging talent who had his abilities concealed was not someone simple.</p>
 <p>Yan Yangchi's weapon caused Qing Shui's eyes to light up. It was a pitch-black longspear. The speartip was extremely thin and was like a soulseeker which appeared in darkness.</p>
 <p>Deadly Darkness Spear</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled when he saw Yan Yangchi's weapon. At least, it shouldn't be too much of a problem for him to deal with that big bulky guy on the arena.</p>
 <p>"Yu Shan. Brother Yan please go easy on me!" the man said in a low and muffled voice.</p>
 <p>"Yan Yangchi. Please make your move!"</p>
 <p>At this stage of the competition, both clans were infuriated. No matter what, this time around, Yu Clan had gone too far and both clans were considered to be on opposing ends now.</p>
 <p>Yu Shan swung the huge grey axe he was holding and activated his Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation directly. As expected, it was the second form of the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation, a heavy armor that was like heavy rocks. It appeared to be very thick and made one wonder if he would fall from the sky.</p>
 <p>Yan Yangchi knew that the opponent wouldn't make the first move. He swung his Deadly Darkness Spear and his Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation appeared. It was a set of fiery red battle armor and appeared to have the force of explosive flames.</p>
 <p>Darkness Spirit!</p>
 <p>Yan Yangchi's speed was very fast as well. Most importantly, he had unleashed destructive powers as he charged forth, in a state of one with his spear, bringing along black colored spear Qi as he dashed toward Yu Shan.</p>
 <p>Unmoving Imprint!</p>
 <p>Yu Shan's huge axe swung out horizontally, encompassing him in a layer of formless power. The huge axe blocked Yan Yangchi's Deadly Darkness Spear.</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>The huge powers caused Yan Yangchi to retreat one step. However, his body was like a snake, slithering away. A layer of faint dark Qi appeared on the Deadly Darkness Spear, making it appear to be a little eerie.</p>
 <p>All-pervasive!</p>
 <p>Yan Yangchi's pitch-black longspear shook, releasing several tens of fine black spear Qi. Each stream of them were like a small-scaled Deadly Darkness Spear, thrusting out toward Yu Shan.</p>
 <p>Concurrently, Yan Yangchi stomped down fiercely and with a shake of his longspear, he went into a spin and dashed toward Yu Shan, being in a state of one with his spear.</p>
 <p>Axe Splits the Mountains!</p>
 <p>The powerful energy in Yu Shan spun quickly, fending off the surrounding spear shadows. At the same time, he swung and hacked toward Yan Yangchi with the huge axe he was carrying.</p>
 <p>Although this Axe Splits the Mountains seemed to be a clumsy attack, Qing Shui's eyes gleamed. This battle technique was a perfect match with Yu Shan's Unmoving Imprint.</p>
 <p>Being capable yet appearing clumsy!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could tell how profound this attack was. Yan Yangchi seemed to be very fast but yet his attack was nicely fended off by this axe!</p>
 <p>Ding...</p>
 <p>A loud piercing sound rang out and Yan Yangchi retreated once again. However, Yu Shan also retreated one step back as well.</p>
 <p>Unmoving Imprint!</p>
 <p>Yu Shan performed the same attack once again, his silhouette appeared to be thick and strong like a mountain but yet the huge axe in his hand hacked out from afar.</p>
 <p>Second-Wave Axe!</p>
 <p>The huge axe shadow hacked toward Yan Yangchi in a criss-cross pattern, like an axe that had came from another world, giving one the feeling that it was impossible to dodge. The two criss-crossed axe shadows brought about a movement in the world and it was as if the surrounding skies were all led to move along with them.</p>
 <p>Yan Yangchi closed his eyes slightly and then suddenly the Deadly Darkness Spear in his hand burst out a thick circle of black glow, as if it was a huge black pillar that was exuding a powerful engulfing power.</p>
 <p>Break!</p>
 <p>The huge black darkness dashed toward the two huge axes that were coming toward it!</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The spot where the clash occurred turned into complete darkness and when everything quieted down, everyone could see that Yan Yangchi had already appeared before Yu Shan. It was only at this moment that they could truly be considered to be meeting head-on.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Yan Yangchi advanced with every step, the Deadly Darkness Spear in his hand was light as ghost. He wasn't fast but his movements were tricky, each attack trying to take Yu Shan's life.</p>
 <p>Yu Shan's huge silhouette occasionally retreated and on occasions when he was too slow, the fearful tip of the Deadly Darkness Spear would pierce the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation. Each time it did, a ripple would appear on the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that Yan Yangchi would be victorious and he also understood why the latter did not need his help to forge a weapon. This spear that he was using should have a powerful effect in breaking the opponent's Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation.</p>
 <p>Splitting Heaven Shattering Earth！</p>
 <p>Yu Shan's huge axe managed to find a loophole and smashed out toward Yan Yangchi!</p>
 <p>Darkness Sovereign!</p>
 <p>Yan Yangchi's spear shadow was like a sharp shadow that was piercing toward Yu Shan, moving after the enemy does but arriving before the enemy does!</p>
 <p>The targeted position was the throat!</p>
 <p>Yu Shan was astonished, but he realized that he had no way to dodge. Even if he wanted to draw back his huge axe to defend, it was too late. A vicious gleam flashed in his eyes as the huge axe hacked toward Yan Yangchi with an even more brutal attack than before.</p>
 <p>Pfft pfft...</p>
 <p>Darkness Mirage!</p>
 <p>Yan Yangchi's spear pierced through Yu Shan's Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation and penetrated his throat. However, Yu Shan's huge axe concurrently hacked through Yan Yangchi's Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation and through Yan Yangchi.</p>
 <p>However, when Yu Shan's body fell, a new silhouette appeared not far away.</p>
 <p>Yan Yangchi!</p>
 <p>Right now, his countenance was pale. He had clearly suffered from serious internal injuries. Earlier, he had deployed a great skill which he had seldom used. The killing attack of the Deadly Darkness Spear.</p>
 <p>It was a pity that when he used this attack, he would suffer from some injuries as well.</p>
 <p>After his victory was announced, Yan Yangchi came down.</p>
 <p>The fight continued. This time around, it was Yan Clan's turn to choose their participant first.</p>
 <p>Yan Yangliu looked toward Yan Yangliu and before he could say anything, Yan Yangliu said loudly, "I give up!"</p>
 <p>Giving up, meant to admit defeat. At a time like this, it was in no way more glorious than saying "I admit defeat." Yan Dinglang continued to stand there, unfaltering.</p>
 <p>Yan Dingtian's expression was grim, but he didn't say a single word.</p>
 <p>In seven rounds, they won three and lost four. The next round was the most crucial one of them all. If they were to lose the next round, there would be no need for them to continue. Therefore, everyone was full of anticipation.</p>
 <p>Yan Clan admitted their defeat for one round and the next round was Yu Clan's turn to choose their participant.</p>
 <p>"This round, we admit our defeat as well!"</p>
 <p>This voice caused everyone to be astounded.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. He had earlier told Yan Yangchi that he must kill that man. From the very start, Qing Shui had told them that they must at least deal their opponents with serious injuries but it would be even better if they could kill them.</p>
 <p>The reason for him doing these was for Yu Clan to know that if Yan Clan were to admit their defeat, they get to keep their lives; but when Yu Clan's elites were to lose their lives one by one, it was something which concerned the clan's future.</p>
 <p>Although this was what Qing Shui had thought, he hadn't held much hope for this. However, when that voice rang out, to Qing Shui, it sounded as melodious as if it came from the heavens.</p>
 <p>Many people were stunned and thought that it might be because Yan Clan had gotten addicted to admitting their defeat and Yu Clan wanted to have a share of the feeling too. However, only people who knew were aware that this was because Yu Clan had absolute confidence that they would win the final round.</p>
 <p>However, right now, Qing Shui was even more confident in himself. He wasn't afraid of anyone who was under 100 years old. Moreover, he had just attained a breakthrough and he felt that he would have no problem winning. He was even afraid that his opponent would be instantly killed and there wouldn't be any fun.</p>
 <p>What would the cultivation level of the last member be like? Third Grade State Master?</p>
 <p>Before the last round, they had a one hour break. For this round, Yan Clan would send their participant up first!</p>
 <p>"Who'll be the one heading up this time around? Old Seventh?" Yan Yangchi asked softly.</p>
 <p>Old Seventh was referring to Yan Leng, who ranked Seventh amongst the brothers.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the Fifth and Seventh Princesses came over. They were in a huge tent and outsiders wouldn't be able to see them.</p>
 <p>"Are you alright?" The Fifth Princess looked at Yan Yangchi and asked, worried.</p>
 <p>"I'm fine. Why did the two of you come?" Yan Yangchi smiled and asked. He felt very happy to see the Fifth Princess here now. No matter what the situation was, he still felt happy.</p>
 <p>"For the last round, Yan Leng will lose." The Fifth Princess let out a sigh and said.</p>
 <p>"I'll fight this battle!"</p>
