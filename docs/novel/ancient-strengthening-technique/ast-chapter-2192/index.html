Beihuang Fan did not eat, and she sat alone in the corner thinking about something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui, Beihuang Yu, the Hill Moving Battle God, and the Diamond Battle God sat together and talked. They were reminiscing on the past when they were young and had a happy conversation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I'm curious, was there really nothing in the Yu Emperor Temple?” Beihuang Yu said while eating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There was nothing. How could there be something? The Demon Gate and the rest were there. Why would everyone leave so easily if there was something?” The Hill Moving Battle God shook his head as he replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I reckon there was something, perhaps somebody took it previously,” Beihuang Yu said casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is hard to say since it only opens once every five hundred years. For example, if we take something away this time, people would gain nothing when they come five hundred years later,” said the Hill Moving Battle God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That makes sense. In that case, we need to be fast. Every time people come in, they will only linger around here as nobody dares to go further, or else they have to stay here for five hundred years if they can't make it out…” Beihuang Yu sounded surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone knows about this, but you've seen it yourself. Even a terrifying being like the Diamond White Tiger King has appeared previously. Even if we can make it further quickly, we have to own the abilities to brace against the danger,” The Hill Moving Battle God said and shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Yu sighed helplessly and said, “It seems like I can only take what's left.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui planned to try his luck since he had the Nine Continents Steps. Besides, he could always leave the Demon Gate behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Fan did not join but sat quietly in the corner. Nobody thought she was lonely sitting there; she seemed graceful and elegant with an unapproachable sense of beauty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he caught Qing Shui looking at Beihuang Fan, Beihuang Yu smiled, “You're a lucky kid, my aunt fell for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, “Do you want to try calling me Uncle?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Yu was speechless; he was upset about this. Previously, they had met twice and confirmed their brotherhood, but this progress was out of his expectation. His ‘brother’ was betrothed to his own aunt. Although some rules were not to be broken, it was so wrong to even address him differently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait until you marry my aunt. By then, I will change the way I call you,” Beihuang Yu sounded lethargic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why? You don't like your aunt marrying someone?” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nonsense! As long as my aunt likes it, I will accept and treat you nicely even if you were a bastard. I trust my aunt. Moreover, she rarely likes someone; I wonder how happy my grandfather would be…” Beihuang Yu smirked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt the wonder of this world. It was surprising that this would happen to a goddess like Beihuang Fan…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui once again looked at Beihuang Fan’s beautiful figure. She was extremely pretty, graceful, and subtle. Men would not be impulsive to go wild for her, but she was admirable and adorable, making people want to hug her and take care of her. It was the kind of gentle pampering which people wanted to give her, as if she would get hurt with a slightly stronger pat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had an otherworldly aura. Qing Shui knew that many people could not approach her because of that. They didn’t dare to pollute her purity and pursue her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had some contacts with this woman without any intentions before this. Also, he felt surreal now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, there was also another person staring at Beihuang Fan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Demon Gate Junior Sect Master!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was definitely a genius among geniuses. He stared at her with affection; he took Beihuang Fan as his woman all this while, and she had to be his own. Despite the opposition, he believed that she still belonged to him. In many stories, the opposing couple would still be together eventually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So he believed he would too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, he realized how wrong he had been. Someone had appeared, A Battle God from the Divine Palace which was the closest to the Taiyi Immortal Palace. And they seemed to be very close now. He heard that Beihuang Fan’s father wished that she would marry Qing Shui. As for Beihuang Fan, she seemed to be close to Qing Shui, and she was even willing to die for him last time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A woman willing to die for the sake of a man without any blood relation. Many lifetime couples could not even do that! Thus, his heart was completely shattered this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew he had no hope, but he was hurt while looking at this beautiful lady. He wanted to hug her, give her shelter, and live with her. He could forfeit everything for her, including the status of the Demon Gate Junior Sect Master. He could also leave the Demon Gate to live with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Demon Gate Junior Sect Master thought he was too narrow-minded. He was not as foppish as other rich sons; he had only one woman now. He was indeed very restrictive in love affairs. Except for the training period, he would indulge in worldly pleasures after many days of training. His woman held a very respectable status in the Demon Gate. She was the Demon Gate Junior Sect Master’s woman, and everyone knew she was the only one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This woman was brilliant and understanding. She never asked about the Demon Gate Junior Sect Master’s business and never tried to probe what she was not supposed to. She would not be proud just because she was the only woman of the Demon Gate Junior Sect Master. She was friendly and quiet. She knew he liked a quiet woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Demon Gate Junior Sect Master looked at Beihuang Fan and Qing Shui. He envied this guy; he wanted to be with his love but he could not. As the Demon Gate Junior Sect Master, he could have everything, but his heart was in pieces now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stood up and walked to Qing Shui uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the Demon Gate Junior Sect Master as if he had discovered something. Looking at this cool and handsome face, he smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This man is not compatible with Beihuang Fan at all. Look at his personality, they could never complement each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Fan saw the Demon Gate Junior Sect Master coming, but she did not raise her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why are you here?” Qing Shui did not get up; he continued grilling his meat. He looked at the Demon Gate Junior Sect Master and asked with his head lowered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why does she like you instead of me?” The Demon Gate Junior Sect Master sounded hoarse as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui perplexed, he answered shyly, “Perhaps… perhaps, I'm better looking.”</span></p>
