 <p><strong>AST 721 - Blood Sucking Night Bat King, Horrifying Cold Attributed Blood Poison</strong></p>
 <p>Very soon, half a month had already passed. Almost one-third of their journey had peacefully gone by. The aura that the Fire Bird gave off after it broke through scared away many demonic beasts. Unless it was an extremely large group of demonic beasts, Qing Shui would just pass through them.</p>
 <p>With his current strength, Qing Shui had a slight desire to meet and fight a strong demonic beast. This long journey was incomparably tedious and lonely. Even though he had an absolute beauty by his side who was his wife in name, all he could do was look and nothing more.</p>
 <p>“It is late, let’s descend and have something to eat. We will continue our journey again tomorrow.” The past half a month had followed this sort of routine.</p>
 <p>After Di Chen had gave her consent, Qing Shui ordered the Fire Bird to descend. They first pitched a tent not too far away then released the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to let it get some fresh air.</p>
 <p>The surrounding area was boundless and you could see the hazy shadow of a mountain not so far away. The area was mostly covered in withered grass and some green shrubbery were scattered around sparsely.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t see the boundary, he only saw some demonic beasts and flying beasts in the air as they cried clearly. When the two of them stood there, they could feel a strange sense of loneliness.</p>
 <p>Without any family or friends, a person would be like a man who had lived alone in the great grasslands. Just the thought of this would cause an indescribable loneliness that could penetrate the soul.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Di Chen as he thought of what had happened to her in the past few years. She basically had a family but could not come back home. The Heavenly Palace Old Ancestor had been concerned about her, however, he was no longer around.</p>
 <p>He thought about Yiye Jiange and Canghai Mingyue who had both lost their parents, and Wenren Wu-shuang who had lost her elder sister. Canghai Mingyue was now different, she already changed after they had children. She would no longer feel that kind of loneliness, at most she yearned for her dead parents.</p>
 <p>It could be considered that Yiye Jiange now had a family ever since she met Luan Luan. However, the person that had caused Qing Shui the most worry was Wenren Wu-shuang. He did not know if she was able to completely recover her memory.</p>
 <p>Everyone had their own past. It was not surprising for them to have these kind of issues, even he had his own problems.</p>
 <p>Their meetings was the most fortunate events in his life. Qing Shui would repay any kindness to him with even more kindness, he was such a person regardless in both his past life or this life. That was why Qing Shui felt that it was all worth it when he had willingly put in so much effort and confronted so many dangers for them.</p>
 <p>He took out a large piece of beast skin and placed it on the ground like a carpet. A pot of a fragrant meat soup simmered above the bonfire beside them.</p>
 <p>The sky got dark as the sun sank beneath the mountains in the west. The cry of a beast could be occasionally heard from far away as Qing Shui and Di Chen had their dinner.</p>
 <p>This kind of open-air environment was not bad, they took an hour to finish their dinner. The bonfire had become more eye catching as their surroundings started to darkened.</p>
 <p>Ming!</p>
 <p>Ji!</p>
 <p>A faint cry could be heard from the distance. Qing Shui, who had only casually glanced in that direction, carried Di Chen and retreated. Di Chen actually saw it as well, she just didn’t have the chance to react before Qing Shui had carried her.</p>
 <p>There were many red dots in the sky and they slowly increased in size as they came closer. With the aid of their cultivation, they could clearly see the dots when they were about the size of a head.</p>
 <p>Blood Sucking Night Bat!</p>
 <p>The red dots that were as large as a head were actually their eyes. Their body’s were jet black and had a size of five meters. They had great numbers that would always travel in groups. They were considered as the kings of the night.</p>
 <p>He watched as the sky became filled with Blood Sucking Night Bats. His scalp went numb because these things had the same nature as the Blood-Thirsty Bald Eagle. However, these bats were even more terrifying.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that this happened because of the food he had made. Even if they wanted to escape now, it would be hard when they had attracted such a crowd of Blood Sucking Night Bat.</p>
 <p>The Blood Sucking Night Bats numbered in at least the thousands, the numerous scarlet eyes could easily intimidate a person. They covered the entire sky with their large, five meters body and sheer number. These Blood Sucking Night Bats were at peak Martial King level, but their attacks contains poison that could harm upon contact. This poison would cause one’s blood to freeze and just like the Blood-Thirsty Bald Eagle, they loved blood and their poison would multiply in lethality if applied several times. These were the horror of such demonic beasts, thus no one dared to antagonize the Blood-Thirsty Bald Eagle and Blood Sucking Night Bat.</p>
 <p>They had nowhere to run to in this boundless plains. The Nine Continents Steps was already used up, they could only wait until the next day to use it again. Aside from killing the bats, they could only ride on the Fire Bird to dash through them. However, he realized the situation was more difficult than he had initially thought.</p>
 <p>This was because Qing Shui saw a Blood Sucking Night Bat that was completely scarlet in color, with a wingspan that was greater than 10 meters. With just a glance, he could tell that this was the Blood Sucking Night Bat King.</p>
 <p>Its abilities was about 10000 countries but Qing Shui was more worried about its poison. In fact, he was mostly worried about Di Chen and felt flustered in his heart.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui raised his abilities to its peak, his left hand held the Violet Gold Divine Shield while his right hand held the ‘Thunder God’. With the Thunder God, he felt more confident in their ability to escape.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui summoned the Fire Bird which circled above his head. He only summoned the Fire Bird as he had no intention of summoning out his others demonic beasts.He did not dare to let the Fire Bird wander far away but he couldn’t just wait there either.</p>
 <p>Rush out!</p>
 <p>He decided that it was better to rush out. He would not be worried if he was by himself but Di Chen was here. He could not let anything happen to her, thus he took out two Frosted Iron Ball.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, What should we do?” Di Chen appeared very calm as she looked at Qing Shu.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, it will be fine!” If the Blood Sucking Night Bat King only had the abilities of 10000 countries, Qing Shui could deal with it in a short period of time. However, he was worried about the Blood Sucking Night Bat King’s poison.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui recalled the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui……”</p>
 <p>“Alright, don’t say anything, I will get us through this.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took a few Medicinal Pills, the Agility-Enhancing Fruit and then fastened the Tiger Card on himself. This was Qing Shui’s first use of a Crystal Demonic Beast Card that he had obtained from refined demons.</p>
 <p>In an instant, he felt very good as his four limbs were filled with a significant amount of explosive strength.</p>
 <p>The effects of these Crystal Demonic Beast Card were this good?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt like he had discovered a treasure but he discarded these thoughts as he fed the Fire Bird a Gale Pellet and prepared to rush out. He felt that there would be no problems as long as he could successfully break out of this encirclement.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Dance of the Nine Heavens!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used his spiritual sense to lock onto his main concern, which was the leader, the Blood Sucking Night Bat King. He then activated his Fiery Golden Eyes and Emperor's Qi.</p>
 <p>At the same time, he threw out the two Frosted Iron Ball with the use of his Twin Dragon Explosion!</p>
 <p>He was worried about the numbers of the opponent, however, he had faith in the terrifying capabilities of his hidden weapons. When he made a move, the Blood Sucking Night Bat King couldn’t help but cry out.</p>
 <p>At the same time, all the Blood Sucking Night Bats in the sky frantically rushed to attack Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Hell's Inferno!</p>
 <p>The Fire Bird spat out an intense flame, which turned the first wave of Blood Sucking Night Bats into ash. Di Chen’s Nine Heaven Immortal Silk also struck out continuously. With every strike, it would claim the life of a Blood Sucking Night Bat.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out another Frosted Iron Ball and used his spiritual sense to lock onto the Blood Sucking Night Bat King as he ferociously shot it out.</p>
 <p>Meteor Smash!</p>
 <p>Ji Ji!</p>
 <p>The Blood Sucking Night Bat King cried out urgently and a few Blood Sucking Night Bats quickly arrived in front of it. Qing Shui’s Meteor Smash had only killed a normal Blood Sucking Night Bat…...</p>
 <p>It could actually do this…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui indifferently smashed one Blood Sucking Night Bat that had rushed over to him. He then ordered the Fire Bird to fly towards the west. Suddenly, the Blood Sucking Night Bat King shot out a blob of red liquid the size of a fist. It was originally aimed at the Fire Bird but since it changed its position, the attack ended up flying towards Di Chen.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s heart raced, his body moved quickly to shield Di Chen with the Violet Gold Divine Shield!</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>It felt like some mud had hit a wall but just when Qing Shui was about to heave a sigh of relief, he suddenly felt that something was wrong. That mysterious red liquid was actually hurled from the unprotected side of his shield.</p>
 <p>It was too late to block and he couldn’t avoid because Di Chen was behind him!</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>With a faint sound, the red liquid entered Qing Shui’s body. At this moment, the Fire Bird used the Phoenix Dance of the Nine Heavens and Di Chen also aided it to carve out a path for escape.</p>
 <p>The speed of the Fire Bird was increased with the effects of Phoenix Dance of the Nine Heavens and Gale Pellet. They managed to break free from the thousands of Blood Sucking Night Bat.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was now very cautious because he could feel his blood start to turn cold. He could resist it with the assistance of his techniques but his blood still continued to turn colder.</p>
 <p>Even though Qing Shui did not have a Pure Yang Constitution, his constitution was not inferior compared to a person who had one. Even so, he still could not withstand this cold!</p>
 <p>Nature Energy!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui circulated the Nature Energy to its peak then infused it into his blood and it started to slowly counteract the cold attributed poison. He now knew how formidable the Blood Sucking Night Bat King was.</p>
 <p>When the poison slowly disappeared, he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. However at this moment, the poison that he thought he had already subdued came back even more ferociously. It even caused a layer of ice to form on the surface of Qing Shui’s body.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gently closed his eyes as the Fire Bird continued to fly!</p>
 <p>Di Chen was heartbroken when she felt the cold atmosphere and saw Qing Shui covered in ice as he stood there.</p>
 <p>She did not cry out because she could see that there was still a warmth emitted from Qing Shui’s head. She knew that he was circulating his energy and did not dare to disturb him. Instead, she just anxiously stood beside Qing Shui and looked at him.</p>
 <p>The Qi circulation of the Ancient Strengthening Technique got progressively slower, and only the Nature Energy and State of Immovable as Mountains counteracted the effects of the cold poison by a little.</p>
 <p>The Yin-Yang Image continued to slowly spin, it also helped to negate the cold poison and repaired the damages to his body.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had been covered in ice for a long time. When Di Chen saw the energy circulation in his body seem to stop, she recklessly decided to hug him.</p>
 <p>The bone-chilling cold did not bother her, she just tightly hugged Qing Shui’s frozen body. Very soon, the bone chilling coldness seeped into her body and she felt that she was about to pass out.</p>
 <p>At that moment, she was shocked when she suddenly felt as if she entered another dimension.</p>
 <p>The dream among the sea of flowers!</p>
