 <p><strong>AST 1407- Battle, Unable To Withstand A Single Blow, Qing Sha's Fury</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui's movements were very fast as he stopped the blood and attended to the wounds. He took out a bed from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and let the lady rest on it.</p>
 <p>Only then did Qing Shui look at the people from the Waterwolf Clan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sensed their abilities. They were all at Martial Emperor level, but none of them were at Peak Martial Emperor. Even the most powerful of them had yet to reach the level of the weakest Peak Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>However, there were some of them who had a strength surpassing 100,000 sun. This was already greatly beyond Qing Shui's expectations. Although he had still thought of this possibility, he was still surprised. There might still be even more powerful cultivators hidden in the Western Oxhe Continent.</p>
 <p>"Lad, do you think that just by riding on a demonic beast that looks similar to a phoenix, it makes it a real phoenix and that you're invincible?" The old man said slowly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wanted to laugh, but he still smiled. "Many years ago, the Sea Dragon Dynasty had acted in bad faith, massacring all of their friends that were like brothers to them, all for the sake of a single battle technique manual. This act makes them worse than a beast. Even if you have the Sea Dragon Dynasty now, it wouldn't wipe out your sins. You must bear the consequences of the sins that you've committed."</p>
 <p>"The winner takes it all. Who can bear witness to the one-sided words you've said about the things that had happened previously? Although our Sea Dragon Dynasty has only been established recently, we've produced great results and enjoy great prosperity. The citizens enjoy a good life. A good dynasty is one that can provide the people with a safe life. Don't you agree? If it was some other dynasty, I assure you that they can't do as well as our Sea Dragon Dynasty." The old man said very seriously.</p>
 <p>This old man was a crafty old fox. The one who gained the support of the people gained the world. With the people's support, the trust in the royal family would be even more powerful, and they would prosper, leaving a very long legacy.</p>
 <p>"No matter how great you make it out to be, you won't be able to clear off your sins. If a poor man can live a good life by killing a rich man and take over everything that he owns, should we encourage people to do something like this? If there aren't any proper regulations, wouldn't the Sea Dragon Dynasty be in a state of chaos?" Qing Shui smiled and looked at the old man.</p>
 <p>"Regulations are controlled by those in power. As long as you have sufficient power, you'll be able to set the rules."</p>
 <p>"I don't have enough power, but I can let your regulations disappear, let your Sea Dragon Dynasty disappear." Qing Shui stood up slowly.</p>
 <p>"Hahaha, the young people these days are too arrogant and don’t how big the world is. Alright, I'll first start with you." With a flash, the old man charged towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Bloodthirsty Wolves' Claw Seal!</p>
 <p>The old man's two hands suddenly become like a scarlet-red wolves' claws that were several square meters big. They had a strong stench of blood and there were blood blisters on it that continued to seethe. Their appearance was terrifying and disgusting.</p>
 <p>"Father, let me do it!"</p>
 <p>Although this old man was very powerful, Qing Sha's current strength was terrifying as well. Furthermore, her pernicious aura were all unleashed and she needed to kill. Therefore, Qing Shui didn't make any move. "Be careful."</p>
 <p>Qing Sha's palm brought along a dark-grey pernicious aura as she dashed out toward the old man, aiming at his Bloodthirsty Wolves' Claw Seal.</p>
 <p>Bang bang!</p>
 <p>The old man wasn't the strongest here, but his strength had reached &nbsp;4 million sun. Qing Sha was also at this level, but when her pernicious aura was awakened, her damaging prowess would increase by at least two-fold.</p>
 <p>No one had expected for there to be a result like this.</p>
 <p>The Waterwolf Clan's elder who was extremely powerful had been blasted to death by a single move from Qing Sha...</p>
 <p>Although everyone was taken by surprise, Qing Sha didn't stop there. With a flash, she dashed out toward the crowd. Qing Shui didn't dare to let down his guard. He called out the Hell's Phoenix to be on guard next to this lady while he quickly followed after Qing Sha.</p>
 <p>By the time the people on the opposite side had reacted, two of them had already been killed. Now that things had come down to this, they could no longer afford to think too much. All of them began to surround Qing Sha.</p>
 <p>Hundred Birds Worshiping The Phoenix! Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Laws!</p>
 <p>The Hell's Phoenix unleashed its might toward the surroundings. Phoenix Might!</p>
 <p>Qing Sha called out the Golden Ni Lion.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stayed close but he didn’t take any action unless it was necessary. He only tried to provide Qing Sha with greater convenience. Of course, if there were people who thought of using despicable means, Qing Shui would directly end their lives.</p>
 <p>Right now, with Qing Sha's killing prowess, she was like a tiger heading into a flock of sheeps. It was because the slightly powerful ones, who could at least stop Qing Sha if they were to join hands, had been suppressed by Qing Shui. They died aggrieved.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not care too much. If Qing Sha couldn't massacre these people, she wouldn't be able to remove the burden in her heart. Qing Shui wouldn't comment on whether what these people had done many years ago was right or wrong, but there was nothing wrong with what Qing Sha had done today.</p>
 <p>Everyone needs to be responsible for the things that they had done, no matter what they were, no matter if they were right or wrong.</p>
 <p>With Qing Shui secretly helping, almost half of the hundred over people were quickly killed. Qing Sha wouldn't hold back, nor did she wished to hold back. What filled up her mind were the scenes of the horrible deaths her family had been put through.</p>
 <p>She wanted to pay the Waterwolf Clan back for all these, together with interest. She didn't care if other people from the Waterwolf Clan were innocent. All of these people had been in the Waterwolf Clan and enjoyed the benefits that the clan brought them. The Waterwolf Clan only had all of these after they had killed the Watermoon Clan. Therefore, everything that they had now all had the blood of the Watermoon Clan on them.</p>
 <p>Qing Sha's eyes were in a black-red color, which exuded a strange glow. Qing Shui tapped on her Lingtai acupoint as needed, only so that she wouldn't lose her sanity.</p>
 <p>Qing Sha was covered in blood and her dark-red clothes made her appear like a Shura from hell. Everything that had just happened caused the surroundings to be extremely quiet. Everyone couldn't believe what had just happened.</p>
 <p>When everything quietened down, the place was already filled with deep trenches.</p>
 <p>Some of them were so deep that you couldn't see the bottom of the trenches, and the ground was stained with a dark red color. The pools of blood formed a little, dark-red stream.</p>
 <p>All of them died. The few cultivators with a strength of 100,000 sun were suppressed by Qing Shui. Otherwise, Qing Sha couldn't have killed them so quickly. If Qing Shui hadn't interfered, it would even be hard to say if Qing Sha could emerge victoriously.</p>
 <p>Qing Sha stood there in a daze. Her tears washed off the blood stains on her face and she lifted her head to look at the sky. "Father, Mother, Elder Brother... I've come to take revenge for you. I've found Elder Sister. I'll let those people pay with their blood. They'll be meeting you very soon. I'll make them admit their wrongdoings to where you guys are now..."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's felt a little emotional as well. He could understand Qing Sha's feelings. Back then, Yiye Jiange went through the same emotions and Qing Shui had gone through it as well.</p>
 <p>"The Watermoon Clan has two good daughters."</p>
 <p>"If one gives birth to a daughter, one should give birth to daughters like the Watermoon Clan's."</p>
 <p>"Waterwolf Clan got what they deserved!!"</p>
 <p>"They can only blame themselves for not completely removing the Watermoon Clan in the past. Who would have expected that two weak ladies would have the achievements they got today."</p>
 <p>"The things with the Waterwolf Clan aren't over yet. The Waterwolf Clan still have experts backing them up."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Very long later. Qing Sha turned around to look at Qing Shui. "Father, let's head to the Waterwolf Clan!"</p>
 <p>"Alright!" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Sha knew that Qing Shui was helping her earlier, but he had allowed her to settle everything by herself.</p>
 <p>Earlier, Qing Shui had already helped the lady with a brief treatment and some medicinal pills. She had recovered a lot and even took some porridge. Qing Shui had no lack of these in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>"Father, how is Sister? Qing Sha asked, worried.</p>
 <p>The latter looked in surprise at this man who had fed her porridge earlier. He looked very young, but her younger sister called him Father...</p>
 <p>"There's no need to worry. I assure you that I'll return you an elder sister in excellent condition."</p>
 <p>The lady didn't think too much of it. There were two horrifying scars on her face which could make any ordinary man disdain her. They might even get scared to death if they were to see her at night.</p>
 <p>However, this man didn't mind her looks at all. He didn't try to put up an act to show that he wasn't pretending. After so many years, her judgment of people's characters was considered quite good.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, I trust Father."</p>
 <p>The three of them took the Hell's Phoenix and flew toward the Waterwolf Clan.</p>
 <p>The people who came earlier were the core power of the Waterwolf Clan. They initially came to prove the Sea Dragon Dynasty's power but they didn’t expect things would turn out this way.</p>
 <p>In a small city where the royal family, the Waterwolf Clan, was located, the place was in a chaos. The event that had happened at the Heavenly Wolf Platform had spread all the way here.</p>
 <p>The people from the Waterwolf Clan were in a state of panic. After all, around a hundred of their powerful experts had died. No matter what, they wouldn't have a good ending. After all, when they rose up to their position in the past, they hadn't deployed the most treacherous means.</p>
 <p>If the Waterwolf Clan didn't have absolute power, there would have been many people who would deal with the Waterwolf Clan.</p>
 <p>Therefore, they were now in a state of panic. Many of them planned to pack up and leave this place and head for another unfamiliar place. This might be their only chance of survival.</p>
 <p>"Don't panic. We still have a few Old Ancestors around. Our Waterwolf Clan has legacies, we won't need to take long to recover. Right now, we're just waiting for the Old Ancestors to take action."</p>
 <p>A middle-aged man in the Waterwolf Clan shouted loudly. He was the eldest son of the Waterwolf Clan and was also the Crown Prince of the Sea Dragon Dynasty. He could tell that many people had the intention to flee.</p>
 <p>Shuilang Xuan's words had a great impact and people started to feel that it made sense. If they were to leave at this juncture and the Waterwolf Clan were to tide over this crisis, then it would be impossible for them to come back. The Waterwolf Clan was a great support and under its shade, they could enjoy numerous benefits.</p>
 <p>Staying was dangerous but there were people who liked to take risks, to gamble and were opportunistic. Therefore, a large part of the people stayed behind.</p>
 <p>When the Fire Bird reached the sky above them, the Waterwolf Clan was in a state of chaos but they were still very united. There were people shouting and cursing out...</p>
 <p>Hell's Inferno!</p>
 <p>The Hell's Phoenix sent a rain of flames over the Waterwolf Clan. When it landed, those people felt regretful but it was too late. The powerful Hell's Inferno wasn't something which they could stand up against and they were instantly turned to ash.</p>
 <p>The Hell's Phoenix continued to send the Hell's Inferno down ceaselessly. Buildings and people alike were all surrounded by the burning, pitch-black flames.</p>
 <p>Bang bang...</p>
 <p>Several tremendous sounds rang out and a few pavilion buildings exploded in the distant. Three old men came, as they walked in the sky. However, when they saw the Hell's Phoenix, they stood in the air, astonished.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the three old men. It was all over for the Waterwolf Clan and Qing Shui wasn't surprised that the entire process was so fast. After all, for someone of his level, killing a Grade Four power would be as easy as stepping down and killing an ant. However, these three old men who had just appeared all had a strength of about 150,000 sun.</p>
 <p>A strength of 150,000 sun could be considered to be weak for Qing Shui. However, in the Western Oxhe Continent, it would be considered to be a heaven-defying existence. The Heaven Secrets Academy and Divine Might Dynasty were all Grade Four dynasties and forces. However, they were still a far cry from the Sea Dragon Dynasty. Was this because of that battle technique manual?</p>
