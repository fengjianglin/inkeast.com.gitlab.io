Many people knew that the head of the Imperial Cuisine Hall was a Divine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone who could cause a Peak False God to suffer serious injuries with just one punch could only be a Divine but all these were guesses by outsiders. Nevertheless, Qing Shui’s strength was without a doubt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Lingfeng also got married and people say that after a man gets married, he would become more steady. While there was not much of a change in his personality, there was definitely some. Normally, he might be a little casual but it has been much less frequent than before as if he matured a lot in a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ziche Sha became someone’s wife too, making Xue Nuo appear even more like a young lass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Possessing the Golden Benevolent Buddha allowed Qing Shui to help everyone go through Constitution Nurturing again even though it wasn’t possible before. With the Golden Benevolent Buddha this time, the effects after the Constitution Nurturing were not bad either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time around, tens of days passed by. Qing Shui rendered a lot of help to the Ziche Clan and Lan Clan with some medicinal pills and martial skills. He helped Ziche Sha the most.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan and Qin Qing’s strength could not be refined much more. Thus, once their foundation became more stable and the matters here were resolved, Qing Shui would head to the Sea King Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan and Qin Qing remained at Imperial Cuisine Hall as the two women were now extremely strong if they combined their powers. The strength of Peak False Gods was very murky and unreliable. You could be considered one whether you have 10 or 100 Dao worth of strength. In fact, Qing Shui had 160 Dao of strength and he didn’t get Divinity Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whether one was a Divine depended on whether they had Divinity Spirit. Possessing Divinity Spirit required 100 Dao at the very least so 100 Dao could also be considered the minimum threshold for a Divine, and it could also be considered the strongest Peak False God. Qing Shui was a little unique in the case that he possessed 160 Dao, or even 320 Dao, and still remained a Peak False God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, the exceptions were not limited to just Qing Shui but most people would certainly be subjected to this rule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui left, having the two women around Imperial Cuisine Hall made him at ease as the number of people who could threaten the two of them were few and far between.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both women did not ask Qing Shui what the matter was and he let them cultivate further. He would return within a month and during that time they could cultivate and go on with their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan was considered to have reaped the most out of their recent trip. She originally wanted to only further understand the Divine realm and conveniently also the possibility of inquiring about the Five Tiger Immortal Sect. However, she didn’t manage to gather any news about the Five Tiger Immortal Sect but instead, gained further understanding of Immortal Sects and perhaps, she would be able to step into Divine realm not too long later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After leaving the Imperial Cuisine Hall, Qing Shui immediately used his Five Elements Divine Flag and appeared within the Divine Cave in a flash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Yiye Jiange and Muyun Qingge were present and seeing Qing Shui made them overjoyed. After all, more than half a year had passed since their last goodbyes. Yiye Jiange then seriously said to Qing Shui: “In the days that have passed, my heart was not able to find its equilibrium but now that you’re here, I’m much more at ease.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was shaken as recently he was unconscious for nearly two months and could it be that she was referring to this period of time? It seemed like linking people’s hearts and souls might actually be a thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m glad that you’re this concerned about me, but I’m so strong so how could anything happen to me?” Qing Shui laughed. Yiye Jiange felt that Qing Shui’s words were a little unnatural but she did not say anything. It was just that Qing Shui’s expression made her over-think.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You two go ahead and continue talking, I’ll go to the Sea King Palace for a bit.” Muyun Qingge smiled and greeted Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you in that much of a hurry?” Qing Shui asked suspiciously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I already wanted to go earlier, but you happened to return.” Muyun Qingge said with a smile and left the Divine Cave with a wave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw that Muyun Qingge had left, he immediately hugged Yiye Jiange and said: “I missed you so much!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange looked at this man and the happiness showed on her face. She also thought about Qing Shui and reached her hands over his neck and said: “I have been thinking about you too!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was moved and immediately kissed that rosy lips of hers and with one fluid motion carried her in his arms and headed straight for her room. There was a stone chamber here and when Qing Shui came the previous time he knew that this her room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While it was peaceful and quiet here, Qing Shui still wanted to go to Yiye Jiange’s room, just in case Muyun Qingge suddenly returned which would make him real gloomy. And so, he shut the stone chamber tightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange kissed Qing Shui in return as her beautiful eyes were half-closed and that delicate and charming face flushed red. Both of Qing Shui’s hands immediately reached within her garments and grabbed those full and perky globes of hers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An uncontrollable light moan emanated from her which stimulated Qing Shui until he was unable to control. Rapidly casting off her clothes, the room soon rang with their throes of pleasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui tirelessly rode, with half a year of not coming into intimate contact culminating into this very moment. He was like an insatiable wolf while Yiye Jiange’s legs - smooth as jade - were wrapped around Qing Shui’s waist like ivy; her beautiful snow-white torso twitched unceasingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her beautiful face, flushed a fiery red, could make one’s mind leave the body. At this moment, she tightly gripped onto Qing Shui and did not let him anyhow move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the exemplary beauty who lay exhausted in this embrace, as her mind and body received enormous pleasure and satisfaction. What more could one ask for? A fairy tale? Envying the mandarin ducks but not the immortals? This was exactly what Qing Shui was feeling just that and he sighed with affection and emotion. Love could bring about such feelings - the acme of love could make both parties seek to become one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui loved Yiye Jiange a lot and loving a person means loving all of her. Love was not about doing something for her but it was about not leaving. Love through your words and also your actions. If you can’t show through your actions, how could it be love?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought a little about his previous life and felt that it was pretty reasonable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He liked beautiful women but upon thinking of those women saying that they hoped men would not like them only for their looks, then why did they spend so much time every day on make-up and dressing up? Wasn’t it because they wanted others to like and appreciate their beauty?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, appreciating beauty wasn’t wrong. A woman’s beauty was her capital. There’s no need for the talk that men shouldn’t like them only for their looks. In love, the first impression was critical and with time, as one reaches middle age, the pursuit would be of a different level. Looks would not be that important since then it would be an accumulation of time and the profound feelings will be much more apparent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feelings require time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you thinking of? That preoccupied?” Yiye Jiange opened her eyes and the blush on her face remained so distinct and attractive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that Qing Shui seemed to be itching for action, she hurriedly said: “Accompany me and talk to me, I can’t stand it anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that elegant and seductive voice, as well as the words she said, that sort of contentment did not need to be said. Qing Shui had one hand on her chest as he lightly stroked and fondled, experiencing the overwhelming sensation of that creamy smooth skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Jiange, do you think that I only like your body?” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What does this have to do with anything?” Yiye Jiange laughed and looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She knew clearly what Qing Shui had done for her all these years. If he was someone who only liked a woman for her looks then he didn’t need to nor would he spare such a huge expense. Moreover, after all these years, she knew clearly what sort of man he was. Although he had a little too much love to go around, how many men will defend one woman?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no link?” Qing Shui curiously asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s all my fault. Why did I have to split hairs with you?” Yiye Jiange gently smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought for a while and realized whatever he liked, he will always like her. If liking a woman didn’t entail liking her body or her person, then what do you like about her?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It suddenly dawned upon Qing Shui .</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am very contented!” Qing Shui grinned at Yiye Jiange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange blushed red and whispered: “Me too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m very contented to be able to have a wife like you. How about you?” Qing Shui chortled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re a bad man.” Yiye Jiange’s face blushed an even shade of red and buried her pretty face in Qing Shui’s arms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fairy-like woman who didn’t eat cooked food of this world had a timid yet lovable look which caused Qing Shui to explode with vigor. This time, it would take half a day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, what is your strength now? I feel like your strength is now barely discernible.” Yiye Jiange casually asked. Now both of them were dressed properly but Qing Shui still carried her across his arms, snuggling up with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Divine, I was lucky a few days ago and broke through.” Qing Shui said lightheartedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That was so fast. When we first met you were not even Xiantian and now you’re already a Divine. Time passed really quickly.” Yiye Jiange mused and sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s right. That time you were my master. Now, you’re my wife.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I hate you. You’re not allowed to say that.” Yiye Jiange reached out and rapped Qing Shui’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, I’ve always had admired you but I was ashamed at how weak I was which was why I was respectful towards you. Perhaps, just short of worshipping you. The gods have treated me really well. I never thought that this day would come so soon and that I could make love with you.” Qing Shui poured his heart out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did you not think of this day?” Previously, Yiye Jiange actually did not think that this day would come and she didn’t even know why she decided to help Qing Shui at that time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were many similar situations in this world. Yiye Jiange couldn’t possibly lend a helping hand to everyone.Moreover, she wasn’t very strong at that time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t dare to think about it. You are the benefactor of my family and I regarded you as a goddess with nary a lustful thought. Back then, if I felt that way I would really be worse than a beast and moreover, I always felt I wasn’t compatible. Even now, I still think so.” Qing Shui looked at Yiye Jiange and said with a smile that was infinitely clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Am I really that incredible?” Yiye Jiange also laughed. She was extremely happy that she was such a figure in his heart and could feel the sincerity of those heartfelt words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, you are my heart. Without you, I’m just like a lifeless person.” Qing Shui pecked her impeccably delicate and jade-like face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You only know how to flatter and coax me with sweet nothings.” Yiye Jiange merrily smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am fickle in love but I’ve never once retracted my love and all of you are equally important to me. For all of you, I can sacrifice everything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I understand, I never blamed you. So many good women like you which means that I don’t have a problem with my foresight. You don’t have to feel apologetic and if we were to really fuss over this, I would have never stepped in again.” Yiye Jiange rubbed Qing Shui’s head and happily said.</span></p>
