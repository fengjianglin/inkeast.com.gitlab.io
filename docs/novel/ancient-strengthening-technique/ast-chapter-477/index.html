 <p><strong>Chapter 477 The powerful Feng Shamo! A Battle of Attrition!.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 477 - The powerful Feng Shamo! A Battle of Attrition!</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Bloody Butcher coughed out blood and got blown backward by the shockwave because of his speed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His speed was too slow, added to the fact that he was the closest one to the shockwave, he wouldn’t have been able to dodge it even if he had wanted to.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui wasn’t worried about the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. He knew that it could hold its own against this kind of strength and that it was capable of receiving heavy damages. Besides, the point where the force converged was on the Tigon Beast Champion. That was the center point of the force where the blast was the strongest.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui heard the loud and miserable roar, he already knew that the Tigon Beast Champion, which possessed a defensive strength of only three countries, could be considered to have basically been incapacitated under an impact force as strong as the strength of ten countries.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Peng!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Bloody Butcher dropped down on a distant spot. After struggling for a while, he stayed down on the ground and didn’t stand back up. Even though the stomping force from the Gigantic Elephant wasn’t aimed at him, he was less than ten meters away from the spot where the force was most concentrated. If he had been two meters closer to it, he might have died on the spot.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After all, his defensive strength was too much weaker compared to the strength of ten countries.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In fact, the Mighty Elephant Stomp was also the only technique which could fully demonstrate its power. The real strength of the Mighty Elephant Stomp lies in its destructive power. For two techniques which were equivalent to ten countries in term of strength, if one has had higher destructive power than the other, it could have significantly changed the outcome.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Slowly, the smoke in the air began to spread out. When the crowd was able to see the stage again, they were all frozen in shock by the outcome of the battle.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The only saw a ten meters long and wide huge hole on the spot where the Tigon Beast Champion had stood previously. Moreover, it was also several ten meters deep. Even though this place was certainly filled with the toughest of the toughest stones.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Gigantic Elephant stood at the edge of the enormous hole whereas the Tiger Beast Champion was inside it. It didn’t have any sign of movements, nor could any energy fluctuation be felt from it. People could already tell that it was dead with a glance. Furthermore, its abdomen was also in a complete mess.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The Tigon Beast Champion died?” A mysterious person on top of a Flying Beast in the air shouted out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ang!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Gigantic Elephant stood at the edge of the enormous hole as it held up its head and let out a long roar. There weren’t many inconsistencies in its voice. It also lacked any kind of heaven shaking aura, nor did it contain any joy from winning. It was just a gentle and long howl.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This made Qing Shui feel really surprised. He knew that Demonic Beasts which reached this kind of stage would begin to have a bit of intelligence of their own. Hence, he suspected that it might be feeling sympathetic towards the dead tiger.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Today, I have indeed widened my horizons. This is by far the only battle I have seen which consisted of two most formidable strengths.”A man who was carrying a longsword trembled as he said agitatedly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Me too, this trip was worth taking. I feel like I have found something that I want really badly.” A young adult quietly retreated after he finished speaking. He left without any hesitations.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This young man called Qing Shui is really interesting. Despite his age, he already possesses such courage. The girls that he liked must be really happy.” A plump woman stared at Qing Shui with a silly look.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You nymphomaniac!” Said a young adult bitterly and hatefully.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“**** you and your nonsense. Your mom is the nymphomaniac! Your whole family is a nymphomaniac!” The woman screamed at the young adult.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Young adult: “......”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sister, look! That elephant is so powerful! It would have been perfect if Feng Shamo also got blasted to death by it.” Huoyun Liu-Li said happily on the back of the Fire Bird. She wanted to jump off its back.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As Canghai Mingyue looked at Huoyun Liu-Li, a faint smile appeared on her face.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sister! Look at how beautiful that ice crane is!” Said Huoyun Liu-Li as she looked at the enormous azure colored ice crane not too far above.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, Qing Shui’s Red Luan doesn’t look as beautiful as the palace lord’s Blue Luan. It’s also slightly inferior in terms of strength. If the palace lord had been here, her blue luan might have been able to barely contend against this ice crane.” Canghai Mingyue felt a lot more relaxed now. This might have been because the Tigon Beast Champion died and the Bloody Butcher lost his ability to battle, that’s why she has the mood to talk about some other stuff.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui set his sight on Feng Shamo who was not so far away from him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had a spur in confidence because of the death of the Tigon Beast Champion and the condition of the Bloody Butcher which was yet to be known. Furthermore, the State of The Seven Star Armours wasn’t even halfway through its time limit.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I have really underestimated you.” At this moment, there weren’t any emotions on Feng Shamo’s face. The wrinkles on his dried up face became really deep and eye-catching.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The price of underestimating your opponent can be really huge sometimes.” Said Qing Shui while he looked calmly at Feng Shamo.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Haha, when you are at my age, there isn’t anything much that would be considered huge. Life is just like a cup of tea, mine, however, is already cold.” Feng Shamo showed a lonely smile as he raised up the long sword in his hand.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ang!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Gigantic Elephant stood in front of Qing Shui and trumpeted at Feng Shamo.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A hero past his prime!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui looked at Feng Shamo, he felt that Feng Shamo gave out this kind of aura exceptionally strongly. But occasionally, once something was done, it would no longer be under one’s control. The only thing they could do would be to try their best to continue on.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, let’s make a deal with each other, what do you think?” Feng Shamo suddenly lifted up his head and asked Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“A deal? What kind of deal can we make with each other?” Qing Shui asked while knitting his brows.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It’s nothing bad for you, you can consider it.” Feng Shamo smiled gently.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Tell me about it.” Qing Shui knitted his brows and said after thinking for a while.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If you emerged victorious in our fight, give Feng Clan a way out. I can give you the things that you want.” Feng Shamo smiled as he spoke to Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What if I didn’t win?” Qing Shui smiled and looked back at Feng Shamo.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Then the only option left for you would be death!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Then what if, I killed you instead?” Qing Shui still maintained his smile as he asked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;“That isn’t important. As long as you promise me this, I can give it to you now. Unless you give Feng Clan a way out, I will immediately make all the things that you want vanish.” Said Feng Shamo emphasized.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If I had allowed Feng Clan to survive today, wouldn’t I just be giving them a chance for them to come back at me on their own in the future?” Qing Shui knitted his brows as he looked at Feng Shamo.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The Feng Clan would not provoke you anymore. With the speed at which you are progressing, I don’t think Feng Clan will be able to catch up to you even if they urged on a horse by patting its bottom. Don’t tell me that you are still scared of a Feng Clan which is constantly weakening.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Despite whether Feng Shamo’s words were out of hardships or he was just trying to anger him, Qing Shui had never planned to eliminate Feng Clan completely. Qing Shui felt that it was something really difficult for him to do alone.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Both the Taichi nature and the nature energy which Qing Shui cultivated made him feel that eliminating Feng Clan wasn’t the way to attain peace. In fact, Qing Shui himself also despised this way of solving problems.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui never planned to eliminate Feng Clan in the first place. He was confident that he could make himself and the people around him grow stronger and stronger. Hence, he thought that there was no point in him destroying Feng Clan.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">By making deals with him, he would even be able to earn some compensations from it. Feng Shamo’s collection would definitely be even more precious than the collection of Feng Clan itself.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;“Alright, if I win, you die. But I will let Feng Clan survive.” Qing Shui promised him. But he didn’t promise that he wouldn’t kill anyone from Feng Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I hope that you wouldn’t randomly kill innocent people in Feng Clan. At present, you are already a character who stands above everyone else in the pyramid in Green Cloud Continent. The word of a warrior are worth nine sacred tripods. I will believe what you promised. And so, these are my collections. As for other stuff in Feng Clan, they are not the things that you would interested in.” The old man immediately threw an interspatial silk sachet to Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Interspatial silk sachet?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui immediately took it. Yet he didn’t open it up.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“In our battle today, we will see if you have the capability to keep all the things to yourself. If you die, I will still be able to take it back.” At this moment, Feng Shamo was giving out a powerful fighting intent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui immediately threw the interspatial silk sachet into the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. It has to be a joke! Since it was already in his hand, how would Feng Shamo still expect him to give it back?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If your collection failed to satisfy me, I wouldn’t mind going for one more round of elimination.” Qing Shui’s gentle tone sounded gentle yet had enough power to convince people.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Rest assured, after I die, if the things that I gave you still don’t satisfy you, you can do as you want. There is no longer anyone in Feng Clan who can stop you.” Feng Shamo pointed out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This old man is sly!” Qing Shui threw away the distracting thoughts. The way he said it has caused Qing Shui to almost be unable to do so. From the way he said it, he was clearly indicating that Qing Shui was bullying and slaughtering the weak. But luckily, Qing Shui never planned to eliminate them in the first place.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that he could no longer waste time because half of the time limit for the Seven Star Armored Vest had been used up.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Gentle Wind Light Cloud!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Feng Shamo shouted out gently. The silver colored silk clothes on his body began to give out a faint silver-colored light, making him look illusory.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As soon as Feng Shamo moved, Qing Shui’s heart sunk.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He raised up threads after threads of afterimages as he swiftly moved towards Qing Shui!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Such a terrifying speed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui quickly took out his Heaven Shaking Hammer to block the attacks.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Beng!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Speed is your strength!” At this moment, Qing Shui managed to have a deeper understanding towards this phrase.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was staggered and got blown backward. Feng Shamo on the other hand, continued to charge towards Qing Shui like a shadow that was following its body.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ang!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Gigantic Elephant also charged towards Feng Shamo. Unfortunately, at the moment, the speed of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was too much slower compared to Feng Shamo’s. Even though it had formidable strength and defense, it was useless under this kind of circumstance.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Speed was too important!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Once again, Feng Shamo’s silver-white colored long sword sliced down from the side with a sword aura two meters long.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was already the third time Qing Shui dodged it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Thousand Hammer Technique!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Undeniably, at present, the large hammer was equivalent to a large shield and was particularly useful. It’s just that when Qing Shui used the Thousand Hammer Technique, he was basically like an ordinary blacksmith. The only difference was that the dull and simple aura exuded from it made people eyes pop out.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui held the hammer in his left hand and the sword in his right hand. It was equivalent to him having a ‘shield’ on his left hand and a sword in his right hand. It looked a bit weird, yet really hot-blooded! Across the continent, no one would bother about how many weapons you held as long as you could fully make use them. Generally, everyone would have two weapons. The majority would use either two swords, two hoops or two hammers. There were more. However, there was almost no one like Qing Shui who would hold both a hammer and a sword at once.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“My god, don’t tell me that this young man is born into a blacksmith family?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You silly, no matter how you think about it, it’s impossible!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Have you ever seen such a handsome and wild blacksmith?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Well, I have never seen anyone who could demonstrate the action of forging ironware to such an extent.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shield Attack!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took the opportunity. He combined the technique Shield Attack with the power of the huge black Heaven Shaking Hammer and clashed it against Feng Shamo’s long sword.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Art of Pursuing!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Beng!!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Simultaneously, Qing Shui tossed the Binding Talismans in his left hand all around Feng Shamo.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui abruptly stomped Feng Shamo who was still in mid-air with the Mighty Elephant Stomp. He also made the Diamond Gigantic Elephant seal up the place where Feng Shamo landed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui has never thought of hurting him with the Mighty Elephant Stomp. Qing Shui was just trying to fight for the opportunity for the Binding Talismans to work. After all, Feng Shamo’s speed was simply too fast.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was aware that this was a kind of Speed Boosting Technique which Feng Shamo cultivated. It was just that he didn’t know how long it would last. If not, it could be quite a problem when they fought. If Qing Shui was to make even the slightest mistake, it would lead him to regret for life.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though Qing Shui has a defensive stat as much which was worth three countries under the effect of the Seven Star Armored Vest, Qing Shui still didn’t dare to take the risk. After all, Feng Shamo’s strength exceeded his own defense. What’s more, he had a unique method of using his strength. So once he got injured in the weak point of his body, it would still be impossible for him to survive.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Peng!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A lot of Binding Talismans were torn apart around Feng Shamo. Only one Binding Talisman successfully took effect. It’s already worth it, besides, Qing Shui’s Art of Pursuing has also hit the target.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hong!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Beng!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s Mighty Elephant Stomp from before once again caused a mess all over the place.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Spiritual Sense unfold!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stopped giving Feng Shamo any chances to use the strange technique which could remove the effect of the Art of Pursuing. He fiercely attacked him with another Shield Attack.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Under the formidable Shield Attack, even Feng Shamo would have to avoid it or else he would be blown away by the impact.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nature energy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui raised his nature energy all the way to its peak. At present, it’s not the time for him to hide any of his secret moves anymore.</p>

  <p dir="ltr">Immovable Mountains!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tiger’s Mount!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Art of Core Qi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the time when Qing Shui was forcing Feng Shamo, he was also constantly operating each of his states which could still be raised further. For now, it’s a battle of endurance.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was confident in his Ancient Strengthening Technique and the strength of his body. Now, they were battling to exhaust one another. He was competing with Feng Shamo to see who would get exhausted faster.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Feng Shamo whose speed got reduced twice by Qing Shui’s Binding Talisman and Art of Pursuing had almost the same speed as Qing Shui. Once again, Qing Shui got to witness the huge effect brought about by the Binding Talismans and his Art of Pursuing.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tiger Tailwhip Kick!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Beng!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Sword of Fourth Waves!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shield Attack!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After every hit, Qing Shui would charge straight at him again. He wouldn’t make any unnecessary moves as he collided with Feng Shamo.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui relied on his Seven Stars Armored Vest, the powerful veins, bones, and organs which he cultivated, as well as the super powerful self-recovery of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though for the time being, his strength was slightly inferior compared to Feng Shamo’s, Qing Shui felt that his resistive force was much more powerful than his.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For now, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant would also be of help. Since power and speed weren’t the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s specialty, the most useful thing it could do was to force Feng Shamo to tackle Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Or else, it would be really difficult for Qing Shui to even recklessly put his life at stake like this.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It might have been that Feng Shamo was also extremely confident with himself. Adding on to the fact that the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was glaring at him like a tiger watching its prey the whole time, the only thing he could do was tackling Qing Shui. By doing so, he would be able to avoid the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It’s just that he began to feel that the matter wasn’t as simple as he had thought.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bloodstain burst out of the corner of Feng Shamo’s mouth. The same thing went for Qing Shui. His was even worse compared to Feng Shamo’s. But slowly, Feng Shamo started to realize that his strength was significantly dropping. The young man in front of him on the other hand, looked as if he had never experienced how being tired felt. Each strike and slices of his were like hurricanes and storms.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Peng!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Both Qing Shui and Feng Shamo coughed out blood again at almost the same time. Qing Shui could clearly feel his damaged blood veins and organs slowly recovering at a speed visible to the naked eyes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Yin-Yang image in his consciousness was also speeding up its rotation. It gave out bits of golden light which immersed his veins, bones, and organs. Even though this caused Qing Shui’s body to feel really painful, it was able to prevent him from delaying the use of his strength.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It could allow him to draw out the potential of his body in advance without having to bear any kind of serious consequences. This was also one of the powerful sides of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It has been fifteen whole minutes since the time he got hit by Qing Shui’s Binding Talismans and Art of Pursuing technique. Within that fifteen minutes, the weapons had collided with each other for several thousand times. The enormous shockwave caused the surroundings to turn into ruins.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Gigantic Elephant constantly attempted to coordinate with Qing Shui. Feng Shamo was forced to confront Qing Shui. If he kept on retreating, he would give an opportunity for the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and Qing Shui to attack him from both the back and the front which would result in his death.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, Feng Shamo once again confronted Qing Shui and got pushed back.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However at this moment, he used one of his hands to rapidly connect dots in mid-air. He looked like he was forming a seal. The miserable and sorrowful aura exuded from the seal caused the expression of the people around him to change dramatically. His entire hand rapidly turned bloody-red, making it looked incomparably weird.</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 477 - The powerful Feng Shamo! A Battle of Attrition!</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Bloody Butcher coughed out blood and got blown backward by the shockwave because of his speed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His speed was too slow, added to the fact that he was the closest one to the shockwave, he wouldn’t have been able to dodge it even if he had wanted to.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui wasn’t worried about the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. He knew that it could hold its own against this kind of strength and that it was capable of receiving heavy damages. Besides, the point where the force converged was on the Tigon Beast Champion. That was the center point of the force where the blast was the strongest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui heard the loud and miserable roar, he already knew that the Tigon Beast Champion, which possessed a defensive strength of only three countries, could be considered to have basically been incapacitated under an impact force as strong as the strength of ten countries.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Peng!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Bloody Butcher dropped down on a distant spot. After struggling for a while, he stayed down on the ground and didn’t stand back up. Even though the stomping force from the Gigantic Elephant wasn’t aimed at him, he was less than ten meters away from the spot where the force was most concentrated. If he had been two meters closer to it, he might have died on the spot.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After all, his defensive strength was too much weaker compared to the strength of ten countries.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In fact, the Mighty Elephant Stomp was also the only technique which could fully demonstrate its power. The real strength of the Mighty Elephant Stomp lies in its destructive power. For two techniques which were equivalent to ten countries in term of strength, if one has had higher destructive power than the other, it could have significantly changed the outcome.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Slowly, the smoke in the air began to spread out. When the crowd was able to see the stage again, they were all frozen in shock by the outcome of the battle.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The only saw a ten meters long and wide huge hole on the spot where the Tigon Beast Champion had stood previously. Moreover, it was also several ten meters deep. Even though this place was certainly filled with the toughest of the toughest stones.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Gigantic Elephant stood at the edge of the enormous hole whereas the Tiger Beast Champion was inside it. It didn’t have any sign of movements, nor could any energy fluctuation be felt from it. People could already tell that it was dead with a glance. Furthermore, its abdomen was also in a complete mess.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The Tigon Beast Champion died?” A mysterious person on top of a Flying Beast in the air shouted out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ang!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Gigantic Elephant stood at the edge of the enormous hole as it held up its head and let out a long roar. There weren’t many inconsistencies in its voice. It also lacked any kind of heaven shaking aura, nor did it contain any joy from winning. It was just a gentle and long howl.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This made Qing Shui feel really surprised. He knew that Demonic Beasts which reached this kind of stage would begin to have a bit of intelligence of their own. Hence, he suspected that it might be feeling sympathetic towards the dead tiger.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Today, I have indeed widened my horizons. This is by far the only battle I have seen which consisted of two most formidable strengths.”A man who was carrying a longsword trembled as he said agitatedly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Me too, this trip was worth taking. I feel like I have found something that I want really badly.” A young adult quietly retreated after he finished speaking. He left without any hesitations.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This young man called Qing Shui is really interesting. Despite his age, he already possesses such courage. The girls that he liked must be really happy.” A plump woman stared at Qing Shui with a silly look.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You nymphomaniac!” Said a young adult bitterly and hatefully.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“**** you and your nonsense. Your mom is the nymphomaniac! Your whole family is a nymphomaniac!” The woman screamed at the young adult.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Young adult: “......”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sister, look! That elephant is so powerful! It would have been perfect if Feng Shamo also got blasted to death by it.” Huoyun Liu-Li said happily on the back of the Fire Bird. She wanted to jump off its back.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As Canghai Mingyue looked at Huoyun Liu-Li, a faint smile appeared on her face.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sister! Look at how beautiful that ice crane is!” Said Huoyun Liu-Li as she looked at the enormous azure colored ice crane not too far above.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, Qing Shui’s Red Luan doesn’t look as beautiful as the palace lord’s Blue Luan. It’s also slightly inferior in terms of strength. If the palace lord had been here, her blue luan might have been able to barely contend against this ice crane.” Canghai Mingyue felt a lot more relaxed now. This might have been because the Tigon Beast Champion died and the Bloody Butcher lost his ability to battle, that’s why she has the mood to talk about some other stuff.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui set his sight on Feng Shamo who was not so far away from him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had a spur in confidence because of the death of the Tigon Beast Champion and the condition of the Bloody Butcher which was yet to be known. Furthermore, the State of The Seven Star Armours wasn’t even halfway through its time limit.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I have really underestimated you.” At this moment, there weren’t any emotions on Feng Shamo’s face. The wrinkles on his dried up face became really deep and eye-catching.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The price of underestimating your opponent can be really huge sometimes.” Said Qing Shui while he looked calmly at Feng Shamo.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Haha, when you are at my age, there isn’t anything much that would be considered huge. Life is just like a cup of tea, mine, however, is already cold.” Feng Shamo showed a lonely smile as he raised up the long sword in his hand.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ang!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Gigantic Elephant stood in front of Qing Shui and trumpeted at Feng Shamo.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A hero past his prime!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui looked at Feng Shamo, he felt that Feng Shamo gave out this kind of aura exceptionally strongly. But occasionally, once something was done, it would no longer be under one’s control. The only thing they could do would be to try their best to continue on.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, let’s make a deal with each other, what do you think?” Feng Shamo suddenly lifted up his head and asked Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“A deal? What kind of deal can we make with each other?” Qing Shui asked while knitting his brows.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It’s nothing bad for you, you can consider it.” Feng Shamo smiled gently.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Tell me about it.” Qing Shui knitted his brows and said after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If you emerged victorious in our fight, give Feng Clan a way out. I can give you the things that you want.” Feng Shamo smiled as he spoke to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What if I didn’t win?” Qing Shui smiled and looked back at Feng Shamo.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Then the only option left for you would be death!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Then what if, I killed you instead?” Qing Shui still maintained his smile as he asked.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;“That isn’t important. As long as you promise me this, I can give it to you now. Unless you give Feng Clan a way out, I will immediately make all the things that you want vanish.” Said Feng Shamo emphasized.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If I had allowed Feng Clan to survive today, wouldn’t I just be giving them a chance for them to come back at me on their own in the future?” Qing Shui knitted his brows as he looked at Feng Shamo.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The Feng Clan would not provoke you anymore. With the speed at which you are progressing, I don’t think Feng Clan will be able to catch up to you even if they urged on a horse by patting its bottom. Don’t tell me that you are still scared of a Feng Clan which is constantly weakening.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Despite whether Feng Shamo’s words were out of hardships or he was just trying to anger him, Qing Shui had never planned to eliminate Feng Clan completely. Qing Shui felt that it was something really difficult for him to do alone.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Both the Taichi nature and the nature energy which Qing Shui cultivated made him feel that eliminating Feng Clan wasn’t the way to attain peace. In fact, Qing Shui himself also despised this way of solving problems.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui never planned to eliminate Feng Clan in the first place. He was confident that he could make himself and the people around him grow stronger and stronger. Hence, he thought that there was no point in him destroying Feng Clan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">By making deals with him, he would even be able to earn some compensations from it. Feng Shamo’s collection would definitely be even more precious than the collection of Feng Clan itself.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;“Alright, if I win, you die. But I will let Feng Clan survive.” Qing Shui promised him. But he didn’t promise that he wouldn’t kill anyone from Feng Clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I hope that you wouldn’t randomly kill innocent people in Feng Clan. At present, you are already a character who stands above everyone else in the pyramid in Green Cloud Continent. The word of a warrior are worth nine sacred tripods. I will believe what you promised. And so, these are my collections. As for other stuff in Feng Clan, they are not the things that you would interested in.” The old man immediately threw an interspatial silk sachet to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Interspatial silk sachet?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui immediately took it. Yet he didn’t open it up.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“In our battle today, we will see if you have the capability to keep all the things to yourself. If you die, I will still be able to take it back.” At this moment, Feng Shamo was giving out a powerful fighting intent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui immediately threw the interspatial silk sachet into the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. It has to be a joke! Since it was already in his hand, how would Feng Shamo still expect him to give it back?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If your collection failed to satisfy me, I wouldn’t mind going for one more round of elimination.” Qing Shui’s gentle tone sounded gentle yet had enough power to convince people.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Rest assured, after I die, if the things that I gave you still don’t satisfy you, you can do as you want. There is no longer anyone in Feng Clan who can stop you.” Feng Shamo pointed out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This old man is sly!” Qing Shui threw away the distracting thoughts. The way he said it has caused Qing Shui to almost be unable to do so. From the way he said it, he was clearly indicating that Qing Shui was bullying and slaughtering the weak. But luckily, Qing Shui never planned to eliminate them in the first place.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that he could no longer waste time because half of the time limit for the Seven Star Armored Vest had been used up.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Gentle Wind Light Cloud!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Feng Shamo shouted out gently. The silver colored silk clothes on his body began to give out a faint silver-colored light, making him look illusory.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As soon as Feng Shamo moved, Qing Shui’s heart sunk.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He raised up threads after threads of afterimages as he swiftly moved towards Qing Shui!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Such a terrifying speed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui quickly took out his Heaven Shaking Hammer to block the attacks.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Beng!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Speed is your strength!” At this moment, Qing Shui managed to have a deeper understanding towards this phrase.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was staggered and got blown backward. Feng Shamo on the other hand, continued to charge towards Qing Shui like a shadow that was following its body.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ang!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Gigantic Elephant also charged towards Feng Shamo. Unfortunately, at the moment, the speed of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was too much slower compared to Feng Shamo’s. Even though it had formidable strength and defense, it was useless under this kind of circumstance.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Speed was too important!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Once again, Feng Shamo’s silver-white colored long sword sliced down from the side with a sword aura two meters long.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was already the third time Qing Shui dodged it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Thousand Hammer Technique!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Undeniably, at present, the large hammer was equivalent to a large shield and was particularly useful. It’s just that when Qing Shui used the Thousand Hammer Technique, he was basically like an ordinary blacksmith. The only difference was that the dull and simple aura exuded from it made people eyes pop out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui held the hammer in his left hand and the sword in his right hand. It was equivalent to him having a ‘shield’ on his left hand and a sword in his right hand. It looked a bit weird, yet really hot-blooded! Across the continent, no one would bother about how many weapons you held as long as you could fully make use them. Generally, everyone would have two weapons. The majority would use either two swords, two hoops or two hammers. There were more. However, there was almost no one like Qing Shui who would hold both a hammer and a sword at once.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“My god, don’t tell me that this young man is born into a blacksmith family?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You silly, no matter how you think about it, it’s impossible!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Have you ever seen such a handsome and wild blacksmith?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Well, I have never seen anyone who could demonstrate the action of forging ironware to such an extent.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shield Attack!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took the opportunity. He combined the technique Shield Attack with the power of the huge black Heaven Shaking Hammer and clashed it against Feng Shamo’s long sword.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Art of Pursuing!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Beng!!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Simultaneously, Qing Shui tossed the Binding Talismans in his left hand all around Feng Shamo.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui abruptly stomped Feng Shamo who was still in mid-air with the Mighty Elephant Stomp. He also made the Diamond Gigantic Elephant seal up the place where Feng Shamo landed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui has never thought of hurting him with the Mighty Elephant Stomp. Qing Shui was just trying to fight for the opportunity for the Binding Talismans to work. After all, Feng Shamo’s speed was simply too fast.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was aware that this was a kind of Speed Boosting Technique which Feng Shamo cultivated. It was just that he didn’t know how long it would last. If not, it could be quite a problem when they fought. If Qing Shui was to make even the slightest mistake, it would lead him to regret for life.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though Qing Shui has a defensive stat as much which was worth three countries under the effect of the Seven Star Armored Vest, Qing Shui still didn’t dare to take the risk. After all, Feng Shamo’s strength exceeded his own defense. What’s more, he had a unique method of using his strength. So once he got injured in the weak point of his body, it would still be impossible for him to survive.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Peng!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A lot of Binding Talismans were torn apart around Feng Shamo. Only one Binding Talisman successfully took effect. It’s already worth it, besides, Qing Shui’s Art of Pursuing has also hit the target.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hong!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Beng!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s Mighty Elephant Stomp from before once again caused a mess all over the place.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Spiritual Sense unfold!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stopped giving Feng Shamo any chances to use the strange technique which could remove the effect of the Art of Pursuing. He fiercely attacked him with another Shield Attack.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Under the formidable Shield Attack, even Feng Shamo would have to avoid it or else he would be blown away by the impact.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nature energy!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui raised his nature energy all the way to its peak. At present, it’s not the time for him to hide any of his secret moves anymore.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Immovable Mountains!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tiger’s Mount!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Art of Core Qi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the time when Qing Shui was forcing Feng Shamo, he was also constantly operating each of his states which could still be raised further. For now, it’s a battle of endurance.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was confident in his Ancient Strengthening Technique and the strength of his body. Now, they were battling to exhaust one another. He was competing with Feng Shamo to see who would get exhausted faster.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Feng Shamo whose speed got reduced twice by Qing Shui’s Binding Talisman and Art of Pursuing had almost the same speed as Qing Shui. Once again, Qing Shui got to witness the huge effect brought about by the Binding Talismans and his Art of Pursuing.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tiger Tailwhip Kick!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Beng!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Sword of Fourth Waves!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shield Attack!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After every hit, Qing Shui would charge straight at him again. He wouldn’t make any unnecessary moves as he collided with Feng Shamo.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui relied on his Seven Stars Armored Vest, the powerful veins, bones, and organs which he cultivated, as well as the super powerful self-recovery of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though for the time being, his strength was slightly inferior compared to Feng Shamo’s, Qing Shui felt that his resistive force was much more powerful than his.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">For now, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant would also be of help. Since power and speed weren’t the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s specialty, the most useful thing it could do was to force Feng Shamo to tackle Qing Shui.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">The Yin-Yang image in his consciousness was also speeding up its rotation. It gave out bits of golden light which immersed his veins, bones, and organs. Even though this caused Qing Shui’s body to feel really painful, it was able to prevent him from delaying the use of his strength.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It could allow him to draw out the potential of his body in advance without having to bear any kind of serious consequences. This was also one of the powerful sides of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
