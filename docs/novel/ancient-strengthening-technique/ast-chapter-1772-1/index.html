 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t know if he should feel happy after hearing what Muyun Qingge said. This thing has happened too suddenly. What’s worse was that he was a person with the traditional mindset. If the Vampiric Empress didn't have his child in her stomach, he would have been able to act like nothing ever happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, until now, it’s still considered as nothing has happened. The empress has only asked for a drop of his Blood Essence in return for the Vampiric Divine Gold. The only problem was that her daughter would definitely have his blood flowing in her veins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though he didn’t share any relations with this woman. No matter how beautiful or how pretty she might look, at the end of the day, she was still a Vampiric Empress. He has never once intended to have such a woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Certainly, it even remained a question whether the woman looked up to him. For now, only one thing was confirmed. When the girl was born in the future, she would definitely have his blood flowing inside her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was speechless… He has gotten very paranoid about the way the Vampiric Empress gave birth. Prior to this, he has never thought that such method, would actually have anything to do with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sheng Jun was also very shocked to find out that Qing Shui wanted to leave. Before this, he has promised her to stay for a few days, but now, not even half a day has passed and he was already in a rush to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did anything happen? Do you need help?” Sheng Jun now treated Muyun Qingge and Qing Shui like her own friends, hence, she was very concerned about this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not really, I just feel like going back. We will come back again when we are free.” Qing Shui smiled and said. It’s quite obvious that his smile didn’t look very happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sheng Jun didn’t know what happened, despite that, she still nodded, “Alright then, I won’t try to hold you for any longer. Be careful on your journey. Remember to come back whenever you are free.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded. At this moment, Muyun Qingge talked to Sheng Jun as if she has remembered something, “In the future, if you ever need to engage in any sorts of a battle against the Vampiric Empress, you can mention Qing Shui’s name. Though the Vampiric Empress doesn’t really know Qing Shui’s name, arguably, she still received a drop of Blood Essence from him. You can just say that you are his friend.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge nodded and immediately disappeared from the Sacred Mountain along with Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sheng Jun looked towards the direction where Qing Shui disappeared to with a strange look. A Vampiric Empress? He has never heard of one being around his area. Hence... It must mean that she received a drop of Qing Shui’s Blood Essence and turned into one…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sheng Jun didn’t know about anything. She understood what Muyun Qingge meant and has also managed to understand the reason behind his departure and as to why he was upset. She then shook her head, “Is this what one considers an ill-fated relationship?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t blame Muyun Qingge for mentioning this matter. In fact, Qing Shui felt even more relieved after she mentioned it. He didn’t wish for anything to happen between Sheng Jun and the Vampiric Empress. Actually, deep down, he also wished to say it, but it’s just as fine if it came out of Muyun Qingge’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This also made him feel less hesitant. Muyun Qingge was a very kind woman. Qing Shui couldn’t help but turn around to look at the woman beside him who was like a fairy. She wore a dignified outfit which felt like it wasn’t made of this world. She also gave people the impression that she was a very honest person. Her aura shared some resemblance with Yiye Jiange’s except compared to Jiange's, her aura revealed that it showed a bit less disdain towards human affairs. She was also similar to Mingyue Gelou, her dignified look was accompanied by another kind of charm. Compared to Hai Dongqing’s elegance, she gave people an additional feeling of realness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t have to care so much about it. Could it be that someone like you would also discriminate against other tribes?”Muyun Qingge asked gently. She was also a Drakaina Tribeswoman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, to me, everything is equal. I don’t look down on anyone.” Qing Shui was stunned for a moment. He then carried on and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well then, what are you still confused about?” Muyun Qingge asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know that deep down, you find the Vampiress Demoness to be evil. But can you say for sure that there aren’t any evil dwelling within humans? In the demonic tribes, there are even demon kings with kind hearts. You can’t just assume their whole tribe at one go. As you can see, the Vampiric Empress indeed has quite a good heart.” Muyun Qingge said quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui trembled. He remembered the Demon Lord Tantai Lingyan and also the unusual sight of this world, for example, Luo Qingcheng being a mermaid. The woman who was currently beside himself was also a Drakina Tribeswoman. As it turned out, his sight was still quite limited to what he could see, he hasn’t managed to express love as he thought he could.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little brat, don’t worry about me. If you don’t look for a husband soon, for all you know, I might take advantage of you. Now that I think about it, why don’t you just convenient me a little?” Qing Shui smiled and said after letting go of what was on his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge angrily glared at Qing Shui after listening to his shameless words, “Hmph! As I thought, all men are evil.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along their way back, other than constantly rushing through their journey with the Nine Continents Step, Qing Shui and Muyun Qingge would spend most of their time cultivating. Certainly, in the case of Qing Shui, he was very free. Since he didn’t even manage to finish up his time within the realm, there was absolutely no need for him to cultivate in the outside world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge, on the other hand, worked very hard. Eventhough talent might be very important, it still came up short compared to hard work. Only by having strong conviction and determination could a person unleash their talent well. Merely talent, without any hard work or conviction, would only cause a person’s talent to go to waste and in turn, reverted them back into a normal human being.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Experts were loners. This quote wasn’t just trying to say that experts felt lonely when they were on top of the world and had no one worthy of competing against them. Even throughout their entire life, they lived them alone. This was because they would spend the majority of their time cultivating. They wouldn’t have any time to be involved in any human affairs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment, Muyun Qingge was constantly dancing gracefully with her Sun Shooting Bow. Ever since the Sun Shooting Bow automatically recognized her as its owner, her body has been going through changes. There seemed to be a Bow Shadow made up of Origin Qi dwelling inside her Dantian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bow figure had provided her with great benefits. Her strength was increasing at a fast rate. Most importantly, the strength of the arrow which she shot with her Sun Shooting Bow, was gradually becoming more and more powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As of now, Qing Shui has helped her developed quite a number of arrows. There were even some that were considered precious. These arrows, after being shot, could still be used after being found. Quite the difference with arrows of mediocre quality, they would be disposable once used.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were also some arrows with unusually enormous strength. However, they could be used only once. The strength of these arrows was undisputedly powerful. They were strong enough to be known as Destructive Divine Killing Arrow. They were just as strong as the arrow which Qing Shui had shot back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Qing Shui’s current ability, he wasn’t yet able to forge any Destructive Divine Killing Arrows. Despite that, he was still able to create arrows which surpassed Legendary Grades. If he was in luck, sometimes, the arrows might even be legendary arrows at False God Grade.
