 <p><strong>AST 1344 - Helping Someone Else To Push Through To False God Cultivation Realm? Third Grade Of Nine Continents Mountain</strong></p>
 <p>Yuan Su forced a smile as she watched that man, who had always been going along the flow yet had a heart as firm as a rock. No matter how much the world had changed, he would still be calm and serene. The one who could never be calm was none other than her own self.</p>
 <p>In just a span of a few days, Soulsearch’s and Yuan Su’s power had undergone a huge change. Qing Shui was more concerned for the Qing Clan as he was trying to figure out how he could push their strength to the State Master level. By the time they were able to achieve that level, they would be able to rely on the Yang Pills to advance further.</p>
 <p>The limitation towards one’s body that was once given by the Crippling Divine Pills was considered a type of shortcoming. Even though the pills could increase one’s power considerably, the aftereffect of consuming such pill was too great, which could inhibit the growth of the body’s strong life force.</p>
 <p>After that, there was the Xiantian Golden Pellet, which was actually a higher-leveled Crippling Divine Pill but far greater than it ever was. For ordinary citizens, Xiantian Golden Pellet was a true divine medicine.</p>
 <p>Most wealthy merchants would never be short of money, yet they would regret having such a short life. In the World of the Nine Continents, the strength of martial cultivators would always exceed the rights of his past life. A powerful martial cultivator would resemble a government official in his past wherever they go, which was why powerful people would never run out of money.</p>
 <p>Having money was good but not their short lifespans. In most cases, money would be required to avert calamity. It seemed that money would be spent just to settle things most of the time. Because of this, the majority of the descendants of those wealthy merchants were obliged to learn martial arts. No matter the amount of money they could spend, they must find the best medicinal pills to assist their children in their cultivation progress. Once their children were able to become powerful cultivators, it would be convenient for these merchants as father to engage in business deals.</p>
 <p>Even so, those who were shown to be capable may end up being careless as a result of negligence. The stronger the person would become, the more they would feel dissatisfied in themselves and strive for greater power. Eventually, they would use any means necessary to achieve what they wanted, which would always end up in an unfavorable situation.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s miraculous acupuncture and the ability of rebirth could somewhat compensate these few points. He could renew vitality and spark a stronger life force, breaking the shackles of traditional ways. It was because of that that the members of Qing Clan could no longer be affected by the Crippling Divine Pill and the Xiantian Golden Pellet. They could, however, go through cultivation to boost their power.</p>
 <p>But to build them to become State Masters could prove to be difficult. Fortunately, they still had a lot of time, so they were able to spend their money lavishly.</p>
 <p>…….</p>
 <p>And so, a week passed. The matters with the Young Master of Shui Clan did not stir up a big problem. No one mentioned whether the youngest Young Master of the Shui Clan was alive or dead. In any case, they never bumped into each other ever again.</p>
 <p>No one else from the Shui Clan appeared either and no one ever came to the Imperial Cuisine Hall to cause anymore ruckus. Due to that, Qing Shui had quite a lot of leisure time in his hands.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, who was taking a rest today, caught a glimpse of Old Man Puyang and the little girl coming into the Imperial Cuisine Hall. Things were different now. Even though it was done verbally, he and the Puyang Clan were considered as relatives. Because of that, Qing Shui happily welcomed them to the fifth floor.</p>
 <p>Although Old Man Puyang couldn’t come every day and could only manage to come at least twice every three days, the little girl was privileged enough to take some food home even after she had finished her meal. Other than Puyang Zhengming, no one else would dare to do so.</p>
 <p>Once she got to know Qing Shui better, she began to grow closer to him, addressing him affectionately as her uncle. She had grown closer to Li Ji too. When she met Yuan Su for the first time, she wasn’t scared. Perhaps this was due to Yuan Su’s demeanor - a type of demeanor that could easily calm those around her.</p>
 <p>“Old man, how have you been for the past few days?” Qing Shui asked as he poured a cup of tea for Old Man Puyang.</p>
 <p>“Good. I’m just an idler. Whenever I’m free, I bring this little girl out for a stroll,” Old Man Puyang said casually.</p>
 <p>“Old man, you should be a Peak Martial Emperor, right? I was wondering if you have made preparations to break through to False God realm.” Qing Shui said as he took a sip of his tea.</p>
 <p>“False God?” Old Man Puyang smiled and shook his head.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui only remained silent and watched him. He was well aware that Old Man Puyang was still capable of articulating his words clearly.</p>
 <p>“The False God realm is too difficult to achieve. I have already reached the Peak Martial Emperor level for a hundred years. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to reach another breakthrough, so I gave up during the last few years of my life. I just want to live out the rest of my life in simplicity and raise Zhengming. My children can take care of themselves when they grow up and the future of the Puyang Clan still depends on them. At this stage, I don’t have to worry anymore,” Old Man Puyang said calmly.</p>
 <p>Puyang Clan was a family with many descendants, especially from a period of great prosperity. They had descendants, so the tendency to grow and expand was still strong.</p>
 <p>“Don’t you want to strive for it?” Qing Shui smilingly asked.</p>
 <p>“I want to. I have been striving for it for hundreds of years but it’s unfortunate that there’s no hope of it. For the last dozen years, hope has become more bleak.” Old Man Puyang shook his head and smiled.</p>
 <p>“If I extend your lifespan by a few more hundred years, do you think there’s hope in that?” Qing Shui suggested after pondering for a while. The strength of the Puyang Clan could bring benefits for Qing Shui. Moreover, this old man’s breakthrough to False God realm might not take a long time because he could provide assistance to him in that regard.</p>
 <p>Old Man Puyang looked at Qing Shui with a surprised expression on his face, as if he had misheard those words. He continued to stare at Qing Shui in disbelief.</p>
 <p>“Old man, you’ve been stuck in a bottleneck for so many years. Your state of mind seems to be tempered well enough. Perhaps this is one of the imperative requirements in breaking through to the False God realm. I will help you, even in this short amount of time, there’s half a hope in breaking through to False God realm. If you can’t achieve the breakthrough in this short amount of time, you can break through to False God realm in the next hundred years,” Qing Shui said in a determined tone.</p>
 <p>Now, it was Old Man Puyang’s turn to lose his composure. He didn’t seem to care about the False God realm before. Yet it wasn’t that he didn’t care but because the chance of actually achieving the False God realm was almost certainly impossible in the past. He decided to let go of things that he couldn’t control. At this point in his life, he had to accept the unpleasant fact that some things were not meant to be.</p>
 <p>However, it was different now. If he could achieve that one thing he had been dreaming about through hard work, it would be difficult to contain his excitement inside his heart.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, are those words true?” Old Man Puyang was excited because there was still one thing in his heart that required Qing Shui’s help in achieving.</p>
 <p>“Of course, do you not believe in the things I’ve said?”</p>
 <p>“I believe, of course I believe. I just feel that it’s a bit inconceivable,” Old Man Puyang cackled.</p>
 <p>“Come, let’s go up.”</p>
 <p>The little girl was busy playing with Yuan Su, so Qing Shui and Old Man Puyang flew up in the air without any concern. Qing Shui assisted the old man in nurturing his constitution while developing his potential before he proceeded to let the old man consume the advanced strengthening pellets of Ren and Du Meridians.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn’t sure how much of the old man’s power he could boost or how much potential power he could develop. The old man’s body had already reached a bottleneck, which by normal circumstances would mean that further upgrade was impossible. The Peak Martial Emperor of 500,000 sun was already the highest point one could reach, so any power would be capped at that limit. Of course, most people would stop at 300,000 sun of power. Only a handful of prodigies could actually reach 400,000 sun of power. It would be considered extremely rare for one to be able to reach 500,000 sun of power during the Peak Martial Emperor level.</p>
 <p>The disparity between breaking through to False God realm with the power of 300,000 sun and breaking through with the power of 400,000 sun was too great. This would be considered as a type of growth or the physical strength of one’s body. For example, it would be considered a difference of one fold between Qing Shui’s physical strength of 30 sun and the physical strength of 50 sun, which would make their differences much larger that it seemed. That being said, the power of 350,000 sun or 310,000 sun for a Peak Martial Emperor would always be much stronger than the power of 300,000 sun. Even the difference of 10,000 sun was considered crucial.</p>
 <p>The lifespan of Old Man Puyang had already been elevated by Qing Shui. The ailments and impurities inside his body had been mostly cleared and it wouldn’t be a problem to increase his lifespan by another 800 years. Furthermore, Qing Shui hadn’t even used his full power to do so. He didn’t put all his effort in it, not because he didn’t want to help the old man but because he was afraid that it would be too outrageous. Besides, if the old man managed to break through to False God, his lifespan would be extended again.</p>
 <p>Other than lifespan, the old man’s power had also been increased from the original 350,000 sun to 450,000 sun. In addition to that, a strong energy had also been harnessed inside his body.</p>
 <p>The Life and Death Needles that had been merged with the energy from the Shield Attack were aiding the old man in pushing through that huge barrier continuously.</p>
 <p>The advanced strengthening pellets of Ren and Du Meridians had already enhanced the old man’s Ren and Du meridians respectively, allowing his body to become sturdier. Once he managed to break through to False God, his body would not be destroyed by the sudden gain of power.</p>
 <p>The Life and Death Needles bombarded with a stream of pure energy, which abruptly caused the Nine Continents Mountain to circulate once more inside his Dantian. A stronger energy of the Shield Attack began to merge with the Shield Attack that had been previously fused with the Life and Death Needles and flowed into the old man’s body.</p>
 <p>The barrier between a Peak Martial Emperor and the False God realm was akin to a large mountain range - unshakable and immovable. A large amount of energy of the Shield Attack continued to assault the barrier but was rebounded by the greater energy from the barrier itself, causing the streams of energy to bounce back to Qing Shui and his Nine Continents Mountain.</p>
 <p>The circulating speed of the Nine Continents Mountain had increased!</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>This sound didn’t came from the old man’s body but from Qing Shui’s body. Qing Shui was pleasantly surprised, yet he didn’t have the time to examine what had happened exactly. He could only sense the energy of the Shield Attack emitted by the Nine Continents Mountain had grown much stronger.</p>
 <p>Time passed by slowly. Qing Shui finally stopped when he was completely out of energy. The unyielding barrier did not even budge even in the slightest. However, this was normal. If there was a slight budge, then Old Man Puyang’s breakthrough could happen in the near future.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui ceased his actions and said, “Old man, this will require some time. It’s better than what I had expected. I can guarantee you that it is possible for you to break through to the False God realm.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was elated. He could now use this method to help his family and friends in forcing a breakthrough, then stabilize and nurture their constitution after that. With the use of medicinal pills and whatnot, there would be no problem in achieving that. This was somewhat similar to Strength Infusion. However, Strength Infusion could only happen once. This method, on the other hand, could be used continuously, albeit after a certain cooldown period. During this period, their power would be stabilized in order to maintain on the higher realm.</p>
 <p>“I can feel it, Qing Shui. The impassable barrier seems so close now. Moreover, I have reached 450,000 sun of power. I actually feel that there’s hope in breaking through to the False God realm now.” Old Man Puyang was emotional as he gazed at Qing Shui with a different perspective.</p>
 <p>Previously, he thought Qing Shui was a terrible existence that only warranted fright. But now, it seemed that ‘terrifying’ would be a better word to describe this man.</p>
 <p>He also felt that he had made the right choice this time. Not only did he have a good relationship with Qing Shui, like two best friends of different ages, most importantly, Qing Shui would worry for his family. This was all worth it in his opinion and based on his experiences in life, he could see what kind of person Qing Shui was. There was nothing to worry about for Zhengming in the future anymore.</p>
 <p>It was already late when he returned to the Imperial Cuisine Hall. Old Man Puyang took the little girl with him and left.</p>
 <p>It was at this moment that Qing Shui began to inspect the Nine Continents Mountain in his Dantian.</p>
 <p>The technique that hadn’t reached the next level had finally achieved an upgrade. Previously, his power and attack speed were tripled. After the upgrade, his power and the attack speed were now quadrupled.</p>
