 <p><strong>Chapter 473 Misty Hall Palace Mistress, Qing Shui attacking with irresistible force.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 473 - Misty Hall Palace Mistress, Qing Shui attacking with irresistible force</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why do you still put up a virtuous facade?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui was stunned, he wanted to say he wished to eradicate the roots when removing the weeds, but he could not say it as it made no difference. It does not matter what the motive was, eradicating the roots was something only the vicious and cruel would do because it involves killing the innocent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If he said this, then in would be the same as what the girl called Feng Yu said, which meant admitting that he was the same type of person as Feng Yunyang.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was not actually a person who killed indiscriminately, or else he would not have suffered from a lifetime of regret. Because he did not eradicate the roots, it caused the death of Wenren Wugou, leading to the change in temperament of Wenren Wu-shuang.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But now, Qing Shui was tongue-tied as a result of what that girl said, he knew that the source was himself, it could be that he subconsciously rejected the method of eradicating the roots.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Preposterous, who let you guys out, go back!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, four old men came out, two of them appeared to be far younger than the other two.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not know what was going on, he originally thought the three girls were the second line of defense, however, &nbsp;that was not the case.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The girl called Feng Yu did not make another sound but gave Qing Shui a meaningful look, and quickly brought the two girls beside her away.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Chui could not calm his heart down, not because the girl earlier was pretty, but because of what she said, had shaken the beliefs he had about the Feng Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She caused him to doubt his plans of eradicating the roots. Qing Shui did not know if this was a good thing or bad. Although he can save a lot of future troubles by eradicating the roots, this method was too heaven-defying resulting in grave consequences if he took things too extreme.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Young Man, I have to say you are very excellent and strong, but why is it that you are so brainless?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The second elder on the left - one of the older ones - looked at Qing Shui with a hint of curiosity but also with disdain and pity.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was human nature! When seeing a talented youth, even an enemy would be appreciated.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If you leave the Feng Clan now, I will let you go!” Qing Shui softly said. He sighed quietly, knowing that he had been affected by Feng Yu’s words.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hahahaha, what a joke, you don’t know the depths of the heavens!” The old man laughed at Qing Shui’s words, either in humor or anger.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even the other three men had faint traces of smiles on their faces, it was as though they found the situation in front of them funny, just like watching a clown perform. They did not heed Qing Shui’s words at all.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slightly frowned, he had already given them their chance, even if he did not eradicate their roots, he had to kill some today, he had to establish a name for himself.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Be it fierce, mighty or evil, it does not matter, strength speaks the loudest in the World of the Nine Continents.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Boy, if you kowtow and apologize to the Feng Clan, we can leave you with a complete corpse!” the other older man said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“We can take care of the people outside for you, especially that elder Mo,” one of the younger men said, with emphasis on the words ‘take care of.’</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Elder Mo is here as well? Elder Mo had not appeared when Qing Shui arrived. Qing Shui did not expect him to come, helping his own people. He had a very good memory, he would repay kindness with even more kindness.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You guys chose this for yourself!”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Once Qing Shui said that he dashed towards the older men, heading towards them in an instant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Sword of Fourth Wave!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Art of Pursuing!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui avoided the long sword of one of the elders, he then immediately clashed against the elder's longsword at the speed of lightning.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Kaka!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The elder who said the vicious words earlier was attacked by Qing Shui and although he did not die, he was crippled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In a single exchange, he caused a Peak Martial King with the strength of two countries to be crippled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shock!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The remaining elders were shocked, but they did not have time to show their astonishment!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was already Qing Shui showing mercy, however, this was perhaps worst than just killing him. A cultivator would place his cultivation above his life.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Time is but a fleeting moment!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Piercing Sword!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui used the strength of the Big Dipper Sword to pierce towards the old man who was attacking him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Only at this moment, the remaining two younger elders finally awoke from their daze and rushed towards Qing Shui. It was a pity that their speed and reflexes were vastly inferior to Qing Shui’s.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They died due to the vast difference of suppression in cultivation!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Once a certain level of strength was achieved, numbers would not make up the difference, this is why peak level cultivators can dominate the World of the Nine Continents.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ting!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Since it had reached this situation, Qing Shui used enough power to vastly overpower his opponents.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bear Leaning Against the Trees!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui dodged the old man’s long sword, which flew at him. He used one of the killer moves of the Bear Form and rushed at that old man’s chest.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bang!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The old man was blasted back, his bones, together with his organs, were and able to withstand the force and were all broken or ruptured.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The scene of killing starts!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly moved towards the inner parts of the Feng Clan. along the way he had already killed more than 30 old men, until he was met with three cultivators with the strength of three countries.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They were supreme elders of the Heavenly Palace.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When he killed those three supreme elders, he did not know what to feel. In the past, these people were untouchable to him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But now, they were slaughtered like vegetables on a chopping board and Qing Shui knew that there would be more later!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Feng Clan was ruined throughout, there were more than 10 broken pavilions and there was a cloud of dust in the air.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“There are a lot of sounds, but we can’t see anything!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, look at those with flying beast, their mouths look big, why isn’t there a compassionate person who would tell us what is going on,” someone grumbled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">[TL notes: Culture context: If a person had a big mouth, it means that he is talkative and cannot keep secrets]</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Wow, another pavilion collapsed, I really want to see the battles inside!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Elder sister, Qing Shui killed another three!” Huoyun Liu-li, who stood on the back of the Fire Bird, said to Canghai Mingyue while concentrating.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“En, but the further he goes, the more worrying it gets. That Feng Shamo has not come out yet, who knows if Qing Shui would still have strength by the time he comes out.” Canghai Mingyue said worriedly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya, You An and a few others stood on a large flying beast. The flying beast was completely gray, had a lion's head and an eagle’s wings. This was a Griffin, when it stretched out its wings, it reached 15 meters, carrying a few people was no problems for it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Elder Mo and two other elders from the Heavenly Palace were carefully scrutinizing the Feng Clan for any movements.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Elder Cang, you got very lucky, your Grandson-in-law is ridiculously strong.” You An said happily to Cang Wuya.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hai… he still has an unknown number of women around him!” Cang Wuya helplessly sighed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“En, Indeed, such an outstanding youth, such a pity that I do not have a granddaugther, or else I would push her towards him.” You An laughed loudly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hai… I’m still very worried!” Cang Wuya quietly said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Cang, Qing Shui is not the type to die early, he has a full forehead, he should be very prosperous!” Xu Ziming laughed embarrassedly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">[TL notes: To the chinese, the looks of a person can indicate their future and luck. E.g. a plump person is prosperous or a woman with wide hips will give birth to males.]</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everyone knew that these were words of comfort, but under such circumstances, even if one knew, they would be happy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The crisp sound of birds came from Heavenly Palace’s stone house mountain.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Misty Hall Palace Mistress was dressed in white as usual, her veil covering her!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A Blue Luan descended and the Heavenly Palace’s Old Ancestor slowly turned around.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old Ancestor!” the Misty Hall Palace Mistress greeted and bowed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The young lass is here!” the Heavenly Palace’s Old Ancestor laughed, looking benevolent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I noticed that you have been standing here for quite a while, are you worried about him?” Di Chen looked towards where the Old Ancestor was looking.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes, I originally intended to hand the Heavenly Palace over to you, but you did not want it. Now, my lifespan is coming to an end, I met this little demon who is not inferior to you, how can I not worry.” The Old Ancestor laughed, not seeming strict at all, just like an ordinary pair of grandfather-granddaughter.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old Ancestor is teasing me again, aren’t you calling me a demon as well? Anyway I’m not suitable, even the Misty Hall is barely managed by me, I’m sure you don’t want to see the Heavenly Palace ruined in my hands.” The Misty Hall Palace Mistress rarely spoke like that with an elder.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Haha, ruined in your hands, you are joking. As long as you are around, who in the Greencloud Continent can destroy my Heavenly Palace, I am only afraid that you will leave,” the Old Ancestor turned his head to look at the Misty Hall Palace Mistress.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’m not going anywhere!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Haha, the last two times you rushed off to save that kid, are you……” the Old Ancestor looked kindly at the Misty Hall Palace Mistress, trying to glean some information from her eyes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What are you saying, I just feel that this person is talented and do not wish for him to die early.” The Misty Hall Palace Mistress avoided the Old Ancestor’s gaze because she felt that her words were not persuasive.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Old Ancestor had lived for 500 years, what has he not experienced? Although the Misty Hall Palace Mistress was strong when it comes to the matters of the heart, she and the Old Ancestor were worlds apart.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Haha, I did not say anything, You being here with me today, aren’t you afraid something will happen to him?” the Old Ancestor suddenly relaxed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Nothing will happen to him!” the Misty Hall Palace Mistress laughed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had seen her smile, in front of the Old Ancestor she would reveal this smile as well, one like a child’s.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Girl, how long are you planning to stay in the Greencloud Continent? Don’t you miss home?” The Old Ancestor asked quietly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I don’t know, maybe for a long time, or maybe soon. I do miss home, I just don’t know how to face them.” The Misty Hall Palace Mistress thought about that man, that meticulous man who was like a brother to her and was excellent. He was probably the most excellent man she had seen, but she did not want to marry him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Girl, don’t think too much, everything will be alright. They definitely love you, they probably will not force you into it.” the Old Ancestor consoled her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“They did not force me, but I don’t want the see that look of lost hope and disappointment.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Escaping is not an solution, these things have to be settled.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That's why I’m waiting for a certain person, hoping that he would go with me.” Misty Hall Palace Mistress looked at the Old Ancestor and smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Old Ancestor was shocked, and the smiled in relief: “His ancestors must have offered a lot of Joss sticks!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">[TL notes: Offering Joss stick is like a form of bribing the heavens for a better fortune]</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old Ancestor is speaking nonsense again, what are you think of?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Feng Clan!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old man Feng, this young man does not seem ordinary. He actually managed to clear more than 10 lines of defence, it is getting interesting.” A red faced old man sitting across Feng Shamo said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The old man looked like a buddha, at the same time, like a butcher. They said that there was only a thin line of difference between a buddha and a butcher. The old man’s body looked burly with traces of fat, a bald head, and the beast tooth necklace around his neck, emitted a killing intent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Feng Shamo did not reply to the red faced old man, but spoke to another old man: “Mingze, didn’t you want to go? Go and face this young man now!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">From the very start, Feng Shamo’s expression did not change.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This man called Mingze was not as excited as he was at first, his head was full of silver hair. His eyes had a flash of determination. He stood up and took his leave from the red faced old man and Feng Shamo.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Feng Mingze wore a suit of battle armor, in his hand he held a great sword, as slowly made his way out of the courtyard.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the old man blocking his path, full of silver hair, with a large sword, eyes as sharp as sword.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yet another supreme elder!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You still want to obstruct my path?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s body was already spotted with blood, but they were not his!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The ones he killed were mostly old, some with some status, Qing Shui felt that he was already numb!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I must kill you today!” Feng Mingze looked at Qing Shui, clenching his teeth.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">People say recklessness would cause someone to look younger and Qing Shui felt that the saying was right. In his past life, Qing Shui felt that you can’t tell the age of a person just by looks, would a 40-old year old man be considered young?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the World of the Nine Continents, the lifespan of humans was longer, even ordinary people can live to 200. Once one broke through to Xiantian, they can live to 500 or even longer. Through the usage of precious medicines or special techniques, one could delay aging. Thus, the measurement of youth would depend on the spirit.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just like this old man, Qing Shui did not feel that he was old, even though his hair was all silver, he was hot blooded and his eyes were filled with a fiery passion.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You are the eighth person to say this to me today, the last seven have already died.” Qing Shui slowly said with a smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Cut the Crap, DIE!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Feng Mingze was very straightforward, his hands griped his sword, and a thick white Sword Qi extended from the blade by 90cm, even his body had a layer of fainter white mist around him.</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 473 - Misty Hall Palace Mistress, Qing Shui attacking with irresistible force</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why do you still put up a virtuous facade?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui was stunned, he wanted to say he wished to eradicate the roots when removing the weeds, but he could not say it as it made no difference. It does not matter what the motive was, eradicating the roots was something only the vicious and cruel would do because it involves killing the innocent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If he said this, then in would be the same as what the girl called Feng Yu said, which meant admitting that he was the same type of person as Feng Yunyang.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was not actually a person who killed indiscriminately, or else he would not have suffered from a lifetime of regret. Because he did not eradicate the roots, it caused the death of Wenren Wugou, leading to the change in temperament of Wenren Wu-shuang.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But now, Qing Shui was tongue-tied as a result of what that girl said, he knew that the source was himself, it could be that he subconsciously rejected the method of eradicating the roots.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Preposterous, who let you guys out, go back!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, four old men came out, two of them appeared to be far younger than the other two.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not know what was going on, he originally thought the three girls were the second line of defense, however, &nbsp;that was not the case.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The girl called Feng Yu did not make another sound but gave Qing Shui a meaningful look, and quickly brought the two girls beside her away.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Chui could not calm his heart down, not because the girl earlier was pretty, but because of what she said, had shaken the beliefs he had about the Feng Clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She caused him to doubt his plans of eradicating the roots. Qing Shui did not know if this was a good thing or bad. Although he can save a lot of future troubles by eradicating the roots, this method was too heaven-defying resulting in grave consequences if he took things too extreme.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Young Man, I have to say you are very excellent and strong, but why is it that you are so brainless?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The second elder on the left - one of the older ones - looked at Qing Shui with a hint of curiosity but also with disdain and pity.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was human nature! When seeing a talented youth, even an enemy would be appreciated.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If you leave the Feng Clan now, I will let you go!” Qing Shui softly said. He sighed quietly, knowing that he had been affected by Feng Yu’s words.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hahahaha, what a joke, you don’t know the depths of the heavens!” The old man laughed at Qing Shui’s words, either in humor or anger.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even the other three men had faint traces of smiles on their faces, it was as though they found the situation in front of them funny, just like watching a clown perform. They did not heed Qing Shui’s words at all.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slightly frowned, he had already given them their chance, even if he did not eradicate their roots, he had to kill some today, he had to establish a name for himself.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Be it fierce, mighty or evil, it does not matter, strength speaks the loudest in the World of the Nine Continents.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Boy, if you kowtow and apologize to the Feng Clan, we can leave you with a complete corpse!” the other older man said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“We can take care of the people outside for you, especially that elder Mo,” one of the younger men said, with emphasis on the words ‘take care of.’</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Elder Mo is here as well? Elder Mo had not appeared when Qing Shui arrived. Qing Shui did not expect him to come, helping his own people. He had a very good memory, he would repay kindness with even more kindness.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You guys chose this for yourself!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Once Qing Shui said that he dashed towards the older men, heading towards them in an instant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Sword of Fourth Wave!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Art of Pursuing!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui avoided the long sword of one of the elders, he then immediately clashed against the elder's longsword at the speed of lightning.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Kaka!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The elder who said the vicious words earlier was attacked by Qing Shui and although he did not die, he was crippled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In a single exchange, he caused a Peak Martial King with the strength of two countries to be crippled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shock!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The remaining elders were shocked, but they did not have time to show their astonishment!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was already Qing Shui showing mercy, however, this was perhaps worst than just killing him. A cultivator would place his cultivation above his life.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Time is but a fleeting moment!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Piercing Sword!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui used the strength of the Big Dipper Sword to pierce towards the old man who was attacking him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Only at this moment, the remaining two younger elders finally awoke from their daze and rushed towards Qing Shui. It was a pity that their speed and reflexes were vastly inferior to Qing Shui’s.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They died due to the vast difference of suppression in cultivation!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Once a certain level of strength was achieved, numbers would not make up the difference, this is why peak level cultivators can dominate the World of the Nine Continents.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ting!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Since it had reached this situation, Qing Shui used enough power to vastly overpower his opponents.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Bear Leaning Against the Trees!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui dodged the old man’s long sword, which flew at him. He used one of the killer moves of the Bear Form and rushed at that old man’s chest.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Bang!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The old man was blasted back, his bones, together with his organs, were and able to withstand the force and were all broken or ruptured.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The scene of killing starts!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly moved towards the inner parts of the Feng Clan. along the way he had already killed more than 30 old men, until he was met with three cultivators with the strength of three countries.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They were supreme elders of the Heavenly Palace.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When he killed those three supreme elders, he did not know what to feel. In the past, these people were untouchable to him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But now, they were slaughtered like vegetables on a chopping board and Qing Shui knew that there would be more later!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Feng Clan was ruined throughout, there were more than 10 broken pavilions and there was a cloud of dust in the air.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“There are a lot of sounds, but we can’t see anything!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, look at those with flying beast, their mouths look big, why isn’t there a compassionate person who would tell us what is going on,” someone grumbled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">[TL notes: Culture context: If a person had a big mouth, it means that he is talkative and cannot keep secrets]</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Wow, another pavilion collapsed, I really want to see the battles inside!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Elder sister, Qing Shui killed another three!” Huoyun Liu-li, who stood on the back of the Fire Bird, said to Canghai Mingyue while concentrating.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“En, but the further he goes, the more worrying it gets. That Feng Shamo has not come out yet, who knows if Qing Shui would still have strength by the time he comes out.” Canghai Mingyue said worriedly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya, You An and a few others stood on a large flying beast. The flying beast was completely gray, had a lion's head and an eagle’s wings. This was a Griffin, when it stretched out its wings, it reached 15 meters, carrying a few people was no problems for it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Elder Mo and two other elders from the Heavenly Palace were carefully scrutinizing the Feng Clan for any movements.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Elder Cang, you got very lucky, your Grandson-in-law is ridiculously strong.” You An said happily to Cang Wuya.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hai… he still has an unknown number of women around him!” Cang Wuya helplessly sighed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“En, Indeed, such an outstanding youth, such a pity that I do not have a granddaugther, or else I would push her towards him.” You An laughed loudly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hai… I’m still very worried!” Cang Wuya quietly said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Cang, Qing Shui is not the type to die early, he has a full forehead, he should be very prosperous!” Xu Ziming laughed embarrassedly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">[TL notes: To the chinese, the looks of a person can indicate their future and luck. E.g. a plump person is prosperous or a woman with wide hips will give birth to males.]</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everyone knew that these were words of comfort, but under such circumstances, even if one knew, they would be happy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The crisp sound of birds came from Heavenly Palace’s stone house mountain.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Misty Hall Palace Mistress was dressed in white as usual, her veil covering her!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A Blue Luan descended and the Heavenly Palace’s Old Ancestor slowly turned around.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old Ancestor!” the Misty Hall Palace Mistress greeted and bowed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The young lass is here!” the Heavenly Palace’s Old Ancestor laughed, looking benevolent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I noticed that you have been standing here for quite a while, are you worried about him?” Di Chen looked towards where the Old Ancestor was looking.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes, I originally intended to hand the Heavenly Palace over to you, but you did not want it. Now, my lifespan is coming to an end, I met this little demon who is not inferior to you, how can I not worry.” The Old Ancestor laughed, not seeming strict at all, just like an ordinary pair of grandfather-granddaughter.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old Ancestor is teasing me again, aren’t you calling me a demon as well? Anyway I’m not suitable, even the Misty Hall is barely managed by me, I’m sure you don’t want to see the Heavenly Palace ruined in my hands.” The Misty Hall Palace Mistress rarely spoke like that with an elder.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Haha, ruined in your hands, you are joking. As long as you are around, who in the Greencloud Continent can destroy my Heavenly Palace, I am only afraid that you will leave,” the Old Ancestor turned his head to look at the Misty Hall Palace Mistress.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’m not going anywhere!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Haha, the last two times you rushed off to save that kid, are you……” the Old Ancestor looked kindly at the Misty Hall Palace Mistress, trying to glean some information from her eyes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What are you saying, I just feel that this person is talented and do not wish for him to die early.” The Misty Hall Palace Mistress avoided the Old Ancestor’s gaze because she felt that her words were not persuasive.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Old Ancestor had lived for 500 years, what has he not experienced? Although the Misty Hall Palace Mistress was strong when it comes to the matters of the heart, she and the Old Ancestor were worlds apart.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Haha, I did not say anything, You being here with me today, aren’t you afraid something will happen to him?” the Old Ancestor suddenly relaxed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Nothing will happen to him!” the Misty Hall Palace Mistress laughed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had seen her smile, in front of the Old Ancestor she would reveal this smile as well, one like a child’s.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Girl, how long are you planning to stay in the Greencloud Continent? Don’t you miss home?” The Old Ancestor asked quietly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I don’t know, maybe for a long time, or maybe soon. I do miss home, I just don’t know how to face them.” The Misty Hall Palace Mistress thought about that man, that meticulous man who was like a brother to her and was excellent. He was probably the most excellent man she had seen, but she did not want to marry him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Girl, don’t think too much, everything will be alright. They definitely love you, they probably will not force you into it.” the Old Ancestor consoled her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“They did not force me, but I don’t want the see that look of lost hope and disappointment.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Escaping is not an solution, these things have to be settled.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“That's why I’m waiting for a certain person, hoping that he would go with me.” Misty Hall Palace Mistress looked at the Old Ancestor and smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Old Ancestor was shocked, and the smiled in relief: “His ancestors must have offered a lot of Joss sticks!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">[TL notes: Offering Joss stick is like a form of bribing the heavens for a better fortune]</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old Ancestor is speaking nonsense again, what are you think of?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Feng Clan!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old man Feng, this young man does not seem ordinary. He actually managed to clear more than 10 lines of defence, it is getting interesting.” A red faced old man sitting across Feng Shamo said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The old man looked like a buddha, at the same time, like a butcher. They said that there was only a thin line of difference between a buddha and a butcher. The old man’s body looked burly with traces of fat, a bald head, and the beast tooth necklace around his neck, emitted a killing intent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Feng Shamo did not reply to the red faced old man, but spoke to another old man: “Mingze, didn’t you want to go? Go and face this young man now!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">From the very start, Feng Shamo’s expression did not change.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This man called Mingze was not as excited as he was at first, his head was full of silver hair. His eyes had a flash of determination. He stood up and took his leave from the red faced old man and Feng Shamo.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Feng Mingze wore a suit of battle armor, in his hand he held a great sword, as slowly made his way out of the courtyard.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the old man blocking his path, full of silver hair, with a large sword, eyes as sharp as sword.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yet another supreme elder!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You still want to obstruct my path?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s body was already spotted with blood, but they were not his!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The ones he killed were mostly old, some with some status, Qing Shui felt that he was already numb!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I must kill you today!” Feng Mingze looked at Qing Shui, clenching his teeth.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">People say recklessness would cause someone to look younger and Qing Shui felt that the saying was right. In his past life, Qing Shui felt that you can’t tell the age of a person just by looks, would a 40-old year old man be considered young?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the World of the Nine Continents, the lifespan of humans was longer, even ordinary people can live to 200. Once one broke through to Xiantian, they can live to 500 or even longer. Through the usage of precious medicines or special techniques, one could delay aging. Thus, the measurement of youth would depend on the spirit.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just like this old man, Qing Shui did not feel that he was old, even though his hair was all silver, he was hot blooded and his eyes were filled with a fiery passion.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You are the eighth person to say this to me today, the last seven have already died.” Qing Shui slowly said with a smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Cut the Crap, DIE!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Feng Mingze was very straightforward, his hands griped his sword, and a thick white Sword Qi extended from the blade by 90cm, even his body had a layer of fainter white mist around him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Good Strength!”</p>
