 <p><strong>AST 1332 - Misunderstandings, Another Type of Breakthrough, Returning to the Imperial Cuisine Hall</strong></p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu laughed happily when she heard what Qing Shui said. “I didn’t have confidence in the past, but now I do. Thank you!”</p>
 <p>“Martial Aunt, you don’t have to thank me. You could say that this was destined. After all, you are the one who developed the changes to the Tiger Form. I am also happy that you grew strong,” Qing Shui replied cheerfully.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. You benefited quite a lot from me, too. Should I be your woman? Anyways, I’m not going to marry anyone and you’re not going to touch me.” Yehuang Guwu smiled teasingly. She liked toying with Qing Shui. This younger man gave her a sense of security. If she couldn’t marry anyone, it did not matter to her if they were just married in name. However, if she could be a real woman, who would she marry?</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu was troubled when she thought about this, but she quickly dismissed that thought. If she could become a real woman, she should be happy and not worried.</p>
 <p>“Sure!” Qing Shui replied. Somehow, he couldn’t bring himself to reject the woman. He didn’t want her to feel unhappy about the problem with her body, as it would affect her cultivation.</p>
 <p>“Will you stay here for a few days?” Yehuang Guwu asked with a smile.</p>
 <p>“I’m leaving tomorrow, but I will help you improve today!” Qing Shui took out his Life and Death Needles!</p>
 <p>The Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellet and the Du Meridian Strengthening Pellet were suitable for people of all levels. Their effects on people with low cultivation levels and high cultivation levels were the same. They would leave a latent strengthening effect in people with lower levels of cultivation. As the person grew stronger, it would help them improve their natural talents. After all, the pellets were powerful medicines concocted with Sky Penetrating Grass, which could clear the Ren Meridian and Tiantu acupoints.</p>
 <p>Right now, his Life and Death Needles could improve absorption significantly, nurture constitution and cleanse the marrow to promote the growth capacity of the body.</p>
 <p>By later in the night, Yehuang Guwu’s strength had increased to over 40,000 sun. Though this was within Qing Shui’s expectations, he was still slightly surprised.</p>
 <p>Most of the people in the Qing clan had also managed to more than double their strength, but their cultivation was considerably lower. On the other hand, Qing Shui felt accomplished after helping someone as powerful as Yehuang Guwu raise her strength by one fold.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu was awestruck. The most powerful person in Western Oxhe Continent wasn’t even that strong. For someone in the Dancing Phoenix Continent to reach this level, that person must have had some sort of treasure or miracle medicine.</p>
 <p>Then again, Qing Shui was both a physician and an alchemist, which was why his medical expertise could reach such incredible proficiency. She could tell that the biggest benefit from this treatment was not her increase in strength. Instead, she could feel that the treatment had increased her potential growth and solidified her foundations. This was akin to laying the foundations of a pagoda so that it would be more stable, allowing it to be built taller. Thus, It could be said that Qing Shui’s Constitution Nurturing Acupuncture was among one of his best techniques.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I am going to take a bath. Come with me!” Yehuang Guwu grinned, pulling Qing Shui with her before he finished his sentence.</p>
 <p>It was the same bathtub, but with two people, there wasn’t much water and the water was already at their chest level. Both of them were naked, but the petals on the surface of the water blocked Qing Shui’s view. The sort of vague partial view of her body made the whole situation even more erotic.</p>
 <p>The top half of her breast was above the water as a few petals moved across and blocked the view of the pink nipples. Qing Shui didn’t know if it was on purpose or just a coincidence. Qing Shui’s legs were just beside Yehuang Guwu’s jade-like legs. Every now and then, she would use her toes to tickle the bottom of his feet. Meanwhile, Qing Shui’s front appendage was like a lance in the clear water.</p>
 <p>“Is it hard to hold back?” Yehuang Guwu blushed and sat on Qing Shui in a mermaid-like posture. Qing Shui inhaled sharply and he could feel his penis growing hard. At the same time, the woman made a muffled sound as she sat on him. Next, they both froze.</p>
 <p>The woman made a sound as she frowned and her body trembled. At that point, an inch of Qing Shui’s lance had already entered a tight, warm space.</p>
 <p>From behind...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s penis hardened as he thought of this. With water as a lubricant, he entered another half an inch. He couldn’t help but let out a comfortable sigh. Yehuang Guwu’s body trembled again. She was a cultivator, so her body was very flexible, but she couldn’t resist letting out a soft moan as she hooked her arms onto Qing Shui’s neck. She let her body sink deeper as a flush of red appeared on her face.</p>
 <p>“Are we together now, with this most intimate act?” Yehuang Guwu never expected that this would happen. She initially only wanted to toy with him or give him a handjob. She didn’t know how it had progressed to such a state. By the time she realized, it had already happened. But since she was prepared from before, she would accept whatever happened. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have shared a bath with him.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t as if she was ignorant about the matter. It was common knowledge, recorded in books. Many women would use sex to please their men, using their mouth, hands, voice and breasts. This was the joy of sex. However, she had never thought about such things in the past, even with her body. She didn’t expect it would happen so suddenly.</p>
 <p>“You’re my woman, but we will feel closer like this.” Qing Shui hugged the woman and felt a sort of pity for her. This person he called Martial Aunt, who appeared so headstrong and confident, was actually a pitiable woman. She might be making use of him, or was that too strong a term? Qing Shui wanted to tell her that he could make her a woman, but he did not speak. He felt that it wasn’t the right time. She tried her best and made Qing Shui ejaculate in her body. Even though it was anal sex, she felt that it was the only way to feel his love.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t particularly control himself, but they did it for at least an hour. Actually, only Huoyun Liu-li dared to provide Qing Shui with such sexual play, but even that was also rare.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Yehuang Guwu lay intertwined in a bed. After that affair, he felt that Yehuang Guwu was a lot calmer, having the look of a submissive woman. It was as if she had always been a normal woman.</p>
 <p>“When will Xuan’er and Ruyan exit their seclusion?” Qing Shui asked quietly. He did not actually want to know when they would come out, but he wanted to know if the two girls knew about his relationship with Yehuang Guwu. He guessed that they already knew a little, but they might not know how intimate they were.</p>
 <p>“Are you worried about the relationship between us?” Yehuang Guwu questioned Qing Shui, looking at him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head, “That’s not it. If I was worried, I wouldn’t even ask you.”</p>
 <p>“They seemed to be my disciples, but that is only in name. They call me Sister Wu, privately. But I am really just imparting my skills, like how you taught me. Do you want me to call you Master?” Yehuang Guwu smiled.</p>
 <p>“Xuan’er seems to rely on you a lot. You both seem close.”</p>
 <p>“It isn’t just “seem”. We are actually close. She encouraged me to open myself to you because she noticed that I like you. Well, her encouragement worked.” Yehuang Guwu chuckled.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Martial Aunt, you should find that your powers are increasing rapidly and your wish will definitely come true.” Qing Shui bid Yehuang Guwu farewell. He did not say that he would help her take revenge,as he knew that the woman was obstinate. With her Tiger Form, it was only a matter of time.</p>
 <p>“I am sure of that. Please be careful. Don’t worry about the Western Oxhe Continent. I will help you take care of the others.” Yehuang Guwu knew what Qing Shui was worried about.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui waved and then he disappeared from the Southern Sea!</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui was in the Dancing Phoenix Continent once again, he felt calm. He used his Nine Continents Steps Effect and went to the Imperial Cuisine Hall. He was shocked when he reached the place. There were numerous expensive Beast carriages outside the gates, but that wasn’t what astounded him. He was surprised to find that there were many non-cultivators.</p>
 <p>Some of them were locals, but they do not own large mansions and buildings like the rich. They only owned rooms in large manors and shared the same courtyard, just like the communal dwellings in his previous life.</p>
 <p>The Imperial Cuisine Hall was treating patients for free today but there were really too many people. Soulsearch was busy diagnosing and prescribing medicines for patients. He did not notice Qing Shui until he was right beside him.</p>
 <p>“Younger brother, you are back.” Soulsearch was pleasantly surprised. He was a little stressed during this period without Qing Shui, so he was visibly relieved when he saw him.</p>
 <p>“Yes, brother. Let’s settle the patients first.”</p>
 <p>With Qing Shui’s help, the patients received their treatments more quickly. Armed with his Gold Needles, Qing Shui treated his patients within a few minutes. Some of them only needed some simple acupuncture.</p>
 <p>“He is the divine physician of the Imperial Cuisine Hall. Even Physician Soulsearch was treated by him.”</p>
 <p>“He is so young!”</p>
 <p>“This must be your first time here. Divine Physician Qing is a righteous man. He said that he would provide treatment to both the rich and poor, but definitely not people who are as unworthy as beasts.”</p>
 <p>“How can I pay for the medical fees if I have no money?”</p>
 <p>“Do you know what charity care is? Besides, he said that different people will have to pay different medical costs. He doesn’t allow any room for negotiation about this. Even if a rich person has the same symptoms as a poor person, the poor person will not need to pay to be given medicine. The rich man might have to spend half his fortune to be treated.</p>
 <p>“This is what I call a true physician. He is indeed a righteous physician with great resolution.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The crowd only dispersed after nightfall. Qing Shui, Soulsearch and Liji headed to the fifth floor. The Imperial Cuisine Hall was more populous than ever. There were many more people from various aristocrat clans. After all, with the Puyang Clan around, the place was just full of life.</p>
 <p>“Brother, did anything happen while I was not around?” Qing Shui asked.</p>
 <p>“No. Someone wanted to join Imperial Cuisine Hall, but he insisted on meeting with you first.” Soulsearch replied lightheartedly.</p>
 <p>“This person’s medical skills must be quite good.” Qing Shui laughed. It was fairly obvious to him, as he could see that Soulsearch looked pleased.</p>
