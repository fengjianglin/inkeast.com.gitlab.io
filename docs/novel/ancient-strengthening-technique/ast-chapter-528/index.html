 <p><strong>Chapter 528 Development, the unique Plum Blossom. Refining the Xiantian Golden Pellet.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 528 - Development, the unique Plum Blossom. Refining the Xiantian Golden Pellet</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">In addition to that, Qing Shui also enhanced her body physique and after she took in two Tiger Vitality Pill, her power was boosted even further. As of now, she has already achieved a strength equivalent to that of a Second Grade Martial General.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For now, Qing Shui would at least still be capable of helping someone raise their strength up to the pinnacle of Houtian Realm. The only thing was that he would need a bit of time in order to do so. Hence, Qing Shui planned to stay over in Qing Clan for a while to help make the entire clan stronger.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everyone can take up to ten Tiger Vitality Pill every year. Just by doing so, their strength would have improved greatly. For warriors at the Houtian Realm, the Tiger Vitality Pill was already considered to be the best medicinal pill for them. The better medicinal pills would be those that increase the strength by a certain amount of percentage. But this would not only be wasted if given to Houtian Warriors, the effect of these medicines compared to that of the Tiger Vitality Pill would also be really insignificant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hence, sometimes, the quality of medicinal pills didn’t really define its usefulness.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At present, Qing Shui has divided up his time into three sections every day. They’re during dawn, in the morning and in the afternoon respectively. During dawn, he would spend one hour to train Qing Clan. In the morning and afternoon on the other hand, he would spend two hours respectively for the trainings.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He would also mix in his medicinal pill, acupuncture and some of his techniques to help them raise their power up to the pinnacle of Houtian Realm as soon as possible. After that, he would go on to think of a way to help them break through to the Xiantian Realm.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The other thing he will have to do will be to refine Xiantian Golden Pellet. He couldn’t afford to drag on any longer regarding his mother’s issue. This was the time when each and every part of his mother’s body functions were at their pinnacle. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui has thought about using other methods to help undo the consequences &nbsp;caused to his mother’s body from taking in the Crippling Divine Pill. However, all of them resulted in failures. Eventually, Qing Shui made up his mind to refine the Xiantian Golden Pellet.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It’s all for the ability of Xiantian Realm to resist cold and the additional five hundred years of life.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui has already prepared all of the required Demonic Beast’s Core which ranged from one thousand years up to four thousand years. He has also obtained the Peach of Immortality. The only thing he still need would be the 2000 Years Snow Melted Woods.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Snow Melted Wood, as the name implied, it only grew in places where it snows all year long. It was a kind of tree that absorb water which melted from snows. It’s entire body was snow white in colour, sparkling and translucent. It had the function of purifying the meridians in our body.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt really anxious. This was because such a place wasn’t easy to find. Even though there were quite a few places that snowed all year long, it was still quite far away from him. More importantly, Qing Shui’s hands were tied at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The function of the Snow Melted Wood was precisely to cleanse one’s meridians. By mixing it along with the Peach of Immortality which could expand one’s lifespan and fusing some of the Thousand Years Medicinal Herb as well as the most crucial Demonic Beast’s Core, the conditions needed to raise one’s strength up to Xiantian Realm would have been achieved.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Meridians Cleansing!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Didn’t the Plum Blossoms in his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal also had function like this? He wanted to try refining the Plum Blossom to see if it could replace the Snow Melted Wood. The Snow Melted Wood that was listed in the prescription should be for the purpose of only Meridian Cleansing. This was because other than that, it really didn’t have much use.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The function of the Plum Blossom was a bit inferior compared to it. Qing Shui wanted to try refining it with his own Alchemy to make it more pure. Then after that, add in a few other supportive herbs.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As Qing Shui thought about these, he already felt a bit excited. The moment it first came into his mind, he already decided to try it, but then he would still have to wait until nighttime to do so.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After practicing Taichi Fist, Qing Shui began to guide all three generations of Qing Clan every time he saw Qing Bei pouting at Luan Luan, he would feel like laughing. All along, Qing Shui has always gave her the most attention. All of a sudden, Luan Luan joined in, she must have found it hard to get used to it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What’s wrong Little Bei? Look at your mouth, that pouting expression, you might even be able to hang a bottle on it.” Qing Shui asked Qing Bei in a funny way.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Shui is so biased! Do you not like Little Bei anymore.” Qing Bei asked in agony. On top of that, her eyes even turned red.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui also didn’t realize that he has been particularly close to Luan Luan for the past two days. Originally, Qing Bei was the youngest child in the family. Added on that she was the only girl in Qing Clan, everyone, particularly his mother would spoil her a lot. She treated her like her own blood-related daughter. Of course, Qing Shui was aware that losing Qing Qing also played a factor in this.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Since Qing Qing returned, naturally, his mother’s love for Qing Bei would be diverted away. The same would also happen to the love his mother had for himself. And now, even Luan Luan joined in. Hence, it’s quite normal that Qing Bei felt depressed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Little brat, no matter what happens, I am and will always be your brother. Why would I dislike Little Bei? Tell me about it, what does Brother Shui not share with you whenever there are something good?” Qing Shui smiled and rubbed Qing Bei’s head.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Is it true? Will Brother Shui always look after Little Bei?” Qing Bei looked at Qing Shui. The way she asked resembled that of a weeping beauty.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Since when has Brother Shui ever lied to you?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was speechless. He never thought that he would play such a prominent role in some people’s heart, nor has he expected that such unintentional actions would lead to a situation like this. If Qing Bei had seen the way he treated his women, would she have felt sad too?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui removed all of these from his thought. He thought to himself that he would just leave it be for the time being since there was no sign of things like this happening anytime soon.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everything that happened with Luan Luan has truly caused an impact on all three generations of Qing Clan. Prior to this, they have only heard about her being a genius. Now, they have truly witnessed it. Furthermore, she didn’t even need any medicinal pills.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After the morning practice finished, Luan Luan’s actions further stunned them even more. The little brat only screamed to the sky twice and “Bai Bai” has already came to her. She climbed onto it skillfully.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Daddy, I am going to play for a while.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That’s a Demonic Beast grade Flying Beast……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“She was so young and yet she already possessed such a terrifying talent, furthermore, she is still a Beast Tamer.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, how did you educate your daughter? Please give me some tips!” Qing You chuckled and told Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This can’t be taught, I only told her the basics. In fact, I don’t even see her much. This is something given to her since she was born. But then, she is really hardworking too. Other than talent, hard work is also something that cannot be neglected. The only difference is that if one has good talent, they will be able to improve faster. For one who is talentless, they will have to use time and hard work to replace it. For example, me, I might be slightly talentless compared to even Little Bei! But then I could still manage to get stronger than all of you.” Qing Shui looked at them with a smile. He hid the things about his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he &nbsp;wouldn’t tell other people about it. But what Qing Shui said was all true. It’s something that everyone witnessed. It’s just that he had a good master as well.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But when they looked at Qing Shui, they felt really blessed that Qing Shui could be their “Master”. For a first, they wouldn’t run short of medicinal pills, so if they were to cultivate even harder…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The three generations of Qing Clan once again recovered slowly from the shock from Luan Luan. They looked at Qing Shui with fiery expressions. Faith was a really important thing to everyone. It was a seed, a kind of motivation.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Other than making them less arrogant, Qing Shui also wanted to give them hope.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Looking at their expressions, Qing Shui could already tell that his goal has been achieved.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the time when they were eating, Luan Luan came back after she enjoyed her time outside. The quick-witted child was particularly loved by Qing Yi and the other clan members. Not only was she Qing Shui’s daughter, she was even a beautiful and delicate genius. The things that she would accomplish in the future was also something that people really looked forward to just like with Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">During daytime, other than training Qing You, Qing Shui would accompany Luan Luan and Yuchang to go out and play. Occasionally, Qing Bei and Liu-Li would also join them. But the total number of times in which they followed were very little.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two quick-witted girls really got along well. When it comes to cultivating, little Yu Chang could only be considered to be decent. She wasn’t at the same terrifying level as Luan Luan. The two children would often sit on Luan Luan’s “Bai Bai” to fly everywhere. Qing Shui also wasn’t worried of there being any problems. “Bai Bai” was more sensitive compared to normal beasts. Even if they were to fall off, it would still catch them. Besides, Qing Shui has also asked the Fire bird to follow them. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At night, Qing Shui went back to the place he lived in and immediately entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He was running short of time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui cultivated madly. He thought that if he could break through to the Sixth Heavenly Layer sooner than expected, he would be able to advance into the so called “Martial Saint” grade.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui didn’t care about the Martial Saint grade. The only thing he thought about was the Sixth Heavenly Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. The condition to break through to the Martial Saint grade has already made Qing Shui felt really upset. Where would one possibly be able to find the Fruit With Unique Attributes in the world?&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">One more thing was that Qing Shui has absolutely never thought of relying on the unusual fruits to assist him in breaking through to the Martial Saint Grade. Qing Shui has always believed in his own Sixth Heavenly Layer. Hence for Martial Saint, Qing Shui wasn’t really interested in it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Back Connecting Fist!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ever since Qing Shui successfully established contact with three of the acupoints, he stopped making any new breakthrough. Even though he kept on having the feeling that it was at the brink of breaking through, it still never happened. Now, he was even being caught by Mingyue Gelou, Qing Bei and Luan Luan.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Force Thrusting Back Connection!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Might of a Fierce Tiger!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">One after another Qing Shui threw out his punches consecutively. The clattering noises, along with the continuous ripples caused in the air, caused Qing Shui’s “Back-connecting Fist” to reach a state which resembled that of a surging fire. It felt as if it would be able to cause explosions at any time.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stopped. From his previous punches, he could already tell that three days was the longest time he would need to break through. .&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After that, Qing Shui picked up a Plum Blossom which he collected not long ago. Then, he picked out the Peach of Immortality, the core as well as the medicinal herbs according to the prescription.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">These were all the medicinal herbs needed for the Xiantian Golden Pellet. The last ingredient he needed was the Two Thousand Years Snow Melted Wood. Qing Shui fixed his sight on the piles of Plum Blossom.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two thousand years Snow Melted Wood. Qing Shui straight away took out the Hundred Years Plum Blossom. The amount of which he took out was ten times more than what was needed for the Snow Melted Woods. After that, he took out the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron and began refining them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He mixed them together to raise them to a higher level just like how he refined medicines to change the quality of it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the first time Qing Shui did it with this kind of method. In the end, the theory may be true, but the result did not reach his expectations. Just like the thousand years medicinal herb, by theory, it was made by mixing a thousand “One Year Medicinal Herbs”. But with this kind of method, let’s not talk about a thousand of it, even if there had been a hundred thousand of it, it would still not achieve the strength equivalent to a Thousand Year Medicinal Herb.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After refining so many Plum Blossoms, Qing Shui felt that it barely met his expectations. He used up the entire ‘rack’ of Plum Blossoms.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After completing the ingredients needed, Qing Shui felt a bit agitated. Which one of the ingredients for the Xiantian Golden Pellet wasn’t the most valuable things in the World of the Nine Continents? Even the least valuable ones were the Thousand Years Medicinal Herb and the Thousand Years Demonic Beast’s Core.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">On top of that, there were still the valuable ones. The Five Thousand Years LingZhi, Peach of Immortality and Four Thousand Years Demonic Beast’s Core.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He couldn’t hold his excitement in refining the Xiantian Golden Pellet, the most unusual medicinal pellet across the World of the Nine Continents. Even though it could only help a person raise their strength up to the Xiantian Realm, it still costed a fortune.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The incomparably expensive medicinal herbs, along with its extremely low succession rate, this caused a lot of Alchemists to leave it in fantasy.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui calmed down his mind. Then, he started revolving his Ancient Strengthening Technique to raise his body’s condition to its peak. After that, he released all of his supportive techniques at once, particularly those which could help strengthen auras.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Until now, Qing Shui was still feeling a bit nervous. After all, if the whole process was to fail, he would lose an enormous amount of assets. But the consequences was still bearable for him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It must succeed! This was what Qing Shui hoped for. He prayed. After that, he refined the medicinal herbs and ingredients meticulously. He did each steps with utmost care to ensure that not even the slightest mistake was made.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Everyone can take up to ten Tiger Vitality Pill every year. Just by doing so, their strength would have improved greatly. For warriors at the Houtian Realm, the Tiger Vitality Pill was already considered to be the best medicinal pill for them. The better medicinal pills would be those that increase the strength by a certain amount of percentage. But this would not only be wasted if given to Houtian Warriors, the effect of these medicines compared to that of the Tiger Vitality Pill would also be really insignificant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hence, sometimes, the quality of medicinal pills didn’t really define its usefulness.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At present, Qing Shui has divided up his time into three sections every day. They’re during dawn, in the morning and in the afternoon respectively. During dawn, he would spend one hour to train Qing Clan. In the morning and afternoon on the other hand, he would spend two hours respectively for the trainings.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He would also mix in his medicinal pill, acupuncture and some of his techniques to help them raise their power up to the pinnacle of Houtian Realm as soon as possible. After that, he would go on to think of a way to help them break through to the Xiantian Realm.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The other thing he will have to do will be to refine Xiantian Golden Pellet. He couldn’t afford to drag on any longer regarding his mother’s issue. This was the time when each and every part of his mother’s body functions were at their pinnacle. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui has thought about using other methods to help undo the consequences &nbsp;caused to his mother’s body from taking in the Crippling Divine Pill. However, all of them resulted in failures. Eventually, Qing Shui made up his mind to refine the Xiantian Golden Pellet.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It’s all for the ability of Xiantian Realm to resist cold and the additional five hundred years of life.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui has already prepared all of the required Demonic Beast’s Core which ranged from one thousand years up to four thousand years. He has also obtained the Peach of Immortality. The only thing he still need would be the 2000 Years Snow Melted Woods.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Snow Melted Wood, as the name implied, it only grew in places where it snows all year long. It was a kind of tree that absorb water which melted from snows. It’s entire body was snow white in colour, sparkling and translucent. It had the function of purifying the meridians in our body.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt really anxious. This was because such a place wasn’t easy to find. Even though there were quite a few places that snowed all year long, it was still quite far away from him. More importantly, Qing Shui’s hands were tied at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The function of the Snow Melted Wood was precisely to cleanse one’s meridians. By mixing it along with the Peach of Immortality which could expand one’s lifespan and fusing some of the Thousand Years Medicinal Herb as well as the most crucial Demonic Beast’s Core, the conditions needed to raise one’s strength up to Xiantian Realm would have been achieved.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Meridians Cleansing!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Didn’t the Plum Blossoms in his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal also had function like this? He wanted to try refining the Plum Blossom to see if it could replace the Snow Melted Wood. The Snow Melted Wood that was listed in the prescription should be for the purpose of only Meridian Cleansing. This was because other than that, it really didn’t have much use.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The function of the Plum Blossom was a bit inferior compared to it. Qing Shui wanted to try refining it with his own Alchemy to make it more pure. Then after that, add in a few other supportive herbs.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As Qing Shui thought about these, he already felt a bit excited. The moment it first came into his mind, he already decided to try it, but then he would still have to wait until nighttime to do so.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After practicing Taichi Fist, Qing Shui began to guide all three generations of Qing Clan every time he saw Qing Bei pouting at Luan Luan, he would feel like laughing. All along, Qing Shui has always gave her the most attention. All of a sudden, Luan Luan joined in, she must have found it hard to get used to it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What’s wrong Little Bei? Look at your mouth, that pouting expression, you might even be able to hang a bottle on it.” Qing Shui asked Qing Bei in a funny way.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Shui is so biased! Do you not like Little Bei anymore.” Qing Bei asked in agony. On top of that, her eyes even turned red.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui also didn’t realize that he has been particularly close to Luan Luan for the past two days. Originally, Qing Bei was the youngest child in the family. Added on that she was the only girl in Qing Clan, everyone, particularly his mother would spoil her a lot. She treated her like her own blood-related daughter. Of course, Qing Shui was aware that losing Qing Qing also played a factor in this.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Since Qing Qing returned, naturally, his mother’s love for Qing Bei would be diverted away. The same would also happen to the love his mother had for himself. And now, even Luan Luan joined in. Hence, it’s quite normal that Qing Bei felt depressed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Little brat, no matter what happens, I am and will always be your brother. Why would I dislike Little Bei? Tell me about it, what does Brother Shui not share with you whenever there are something good?” Qing Shui smiled and rubbed Qing Bei’s head.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Is it true? Will Brother Shui always look after Little Bei?” Qing Bei looked at Qing Shui. The way she asked resembled that of a weeping beauty.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Since when has Brother Shui ever lied to you?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was speechless. He never thought that he would play such a prominent role in some people’s heart, nor has he expected that such unintentional actions would lead to a situation like this. If Qing Bei had seen the way he treated his women, would she have felt sad too?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui removed all of these from his thought. He thought to himself that he would just leave it be for the time being since there was no sign of things like this happening anytime soon.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everything that happened with Luan Luan has truly caused an impact on all three generations of Qing Clan. Prior to this, they have only heard about her being a genius. Now, they have truly witnessed it. Furthermore, she didn’t even need any medicinal pills.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After the morning practice finished, Luan Luan’s actions further stunned them even more. The little brat only screamed to the sky twice and “Bai Bai” has already came to her. She climbed onto it skillfully.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Daddy, I am going to play for a while.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“That’s a Demonic Beast grade Flying Beast……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“She was so young and yet she already possessed such a terrifying talent, furthermore, she is still a Beast Tamer.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, how did you educate your daughter? Please give me some tips!” Qing You chuckled and told Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This can’t be taught, I only told her the basics. In fact, I don’t even see her much. This is something given to her since she was born. But then, she is really hardworking too. Other than talent, hard work is also something that cannot be neglected. The only difference is that if one has good talent, they will be able to improve faster. For one who is talentless, they will have to use time and hard work to replace it. For example, me, I might be slightly talentless compared to even Little Bei! But then I could still manage to get stronger than all of you.” Qing Shui looked at them with a smile. He hid the things about his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he &nbsp;wouldn’t tell other people about it. But what Qing Shui said was all true. It’s something that everyone witnessed. It’s just that he had a good master as well.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But when they looked at Qing Shui, they felt really blessed that Qing Shui could be their “Master”. For a first, they wouldn’t run short of medicinal pills, so if they were to cultivate even harder…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The three generations of Qing Clan once again recovered slowly from the shock from Luan Luan. They looked at Qing Shui with fiery expressions. Faith was a really important thing to everyone. It was a seed, a kind of motivation.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Other than making them less arrogant, Qing Shui also wanted to give them hope.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Looking at their expressions, Qing Shui could already tell that his goal has been achieved.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the time when they were eating, Luan Luan came back after she enjoyed her time outside. The quick-witted child was particularly loved by Qing Yi and the other clan members. Not only was she Qing Shui’s daughter, she was even a beautiful and delicate genius. The things that she would accomplish in the future was also something that people really looked forward to just like with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">During daytime, other than training Qing You, Qing Shui would accompany Luan Luan and Yuchang to go out and play. Occasionally, Qing Bei and Liu-Li would also join them. But the total number of times in which they followed were very little.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The two quick-witted girls really got along well. When it comes to cultivating, little Yu Chang could only be considered to be decent. She wasn’t at the same terrifying level as Luan Luan. The two children would often sit on Luan Luan’s “Bai Bai” to fly everywhere. Qing Shui also wasn’t worried of there being any problems. “Bai Bai” was more sensitive compared to normal beasts. Even if they were to fall off, it would still catch them. Besides, Qing Shui has also asked the Fire bird to follow them. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At night, Qing Shui went back to the place he lived in and immediately entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He was running short of time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui cultivated madly. He thought that if he could break through to the Sixth Heavenly Layer sooner than expected, he would be able to advance into the so called “Martial Saint” grade.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui didn’t care about the Martial Saint grade. The only thing he thought about was the Sixth Heavenly Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. The condition to break through to the Martial Saint grade has already made Qing Shui felt really upset. Where would one possibly be able to find the Fruit With Unique Attributes in the world?&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">One more thing was that Qing Shui has absolutely never thought of relying on the unusual fruits to assist him in breaking through to the Martial Saint Grade. Qing Shui has always believed in his own Sixth Heavenly Layer. Hence for Martial Saint, Qing Shui wasn’t really interested in it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Back Connecting Fist!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ever since Qing Shui successfully established contact with three of the acupoints, he stopped making any new breakthrough. Even though he kept on having the feeling that it was at the brink of breaking through, it still never happened. Now, he was even being caught by Mingyue Gelou, Qing Bei and Luan Luan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Force Thrusting Back Connection!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Might of a Fierce Tiger!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">One after another Qing Shui threw out his punches consecutively. The clattering noises, along with the continuous ripples caused in the air, caused Qing Shui’s “Back-connecting Fist” to reach a state which resembled that of a surging fire. It felt as if it would be able to cause explosions at any time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stopped. From his previous punches, he could already tell that three days was the longest time he would need to break through. .&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After that, Qing Shui picked up a Plum Blossom which he collected not long ago. Then, he picked out the Peach of Immortality, the core as well as the medicinal herbs according to the prescription.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">These were all the medicinal herbs needed for the Xiantian Golden Pellet. The last ingredient he needed was the Two Thousand Years Snow Melted Wood. Qing Shui fixed his sight on the piles of Plum Blossom.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The two thousand years Snow Melted Wood. Qing Shui straight away took out the Hundred Years Plum Blossom. The amount of which he took out was ten times more than what was needed for the Snow Melted Woods. After that, he took out the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron and began refining them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He mixed them together to raise them to a higher level just like how he refined medicines to change the quality of it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was the first time Qing Shui did it with this kind of method. In the end, the theory may be true, but the result did not reach his expectations. Just like the thousand years medicinal herb, by theory, it was made by mixing a thousand “One Year Medicinal Herbs”. But with this kind of method, let’s not talk about a thousand of it, even if there had been a hundred thousand of it, it would still not achieve the strength equivalent to a Thousand Year Medicinal Herb.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After refining so many Plum Blossoms, Qing Shui felt that it barely met his expectations. He used up the entire ‘rack’ of Plum Blossoms.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After completing the ingredients needed, Qing Shui felt a bit agitated. Which one of the ingredients for the Xiantian Golden Pellet wasn’t the most valuable things in the World of the Nine Continents? Even the least valuable ones were the Thousand Years Medicinal Herb and the Thousand Years Demonic Beast’s Core.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">On top of that, there were still the valuable ones. The Five Thousand Years LingZhi, Peach of Immortality and Four Thousand Years Demonic Beast’s Core.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He couldn’t hold his excitement in refining the Xiantian Golden Pellet, the most unusual medicinal pellet across the World of the Nine Continents. Even though it could only help a person raise their strength up to the Xiantian Realm, it still costed a fortune.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The incomparably expensive medicinal herbs, along with its extremely low succession rate, this caused a lot of Alchemists to leave it in fantasy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui calmed down his mind. Then, he started revolving his Ancient Strengthening Technique to raise his body’s condition to its peak. After that, he released all of his supportive techniques at once, particularly those which could help strengthen auras.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Until now, Qing Shui was still feeling a bit nervous. After all, if the whole process was to fail, he would lose an enormous amount of assets. But the consequences was still bearable for him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It must succeed! This was what Qing Shui hoped for. He prayed. After that, he refined the medicinal herbs and ingredients meticulously. He did each steps with utmost care to ensure that not even the slightest mistake was made.</p>
