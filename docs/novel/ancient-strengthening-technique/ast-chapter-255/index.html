 <p><strong>Chapter 255 I’m Not Leaving Even If I were to Die, Can You Hug Me?.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 255 I’m Not Leaving Even If I were to Die, Can You Hug Me?</strong></p>
  <p>It was an enjoyment for Qing Shui when he saw Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li wearing the boots that he had forged himself. That heartwarming feeling was a very long lasting one.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at the Golden-Ringed Battle Armor that was completed. The surface of this armor was snake skin with Golden-Ringed prints, while the interior was made of Tempered Metallic Essence. Qing Shui decided to call it Golden-Ringed Battle Armor.</p>
  <p>Looking at the sky, Qing Shui did not expect that one set of battle armor would take him almost a whole afternoon to complete, but he was satisfied.</p>
  <p>Now, everything seemed very calm, but Qing Shui knew that it was the calm before the storm. When the day arrive, it would definitely be a case of strong howling wind and torrential rain. He was not even sure if he would be able to get through that day safely.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui put the Golden-Ringed Battle Armor safely away, since it was something which could increase his chances of safety. Now that he had his battle armor and boots ready, for the rest of the time, other than training, Qing Shui also planned to complete the set with a helmet, belt, bangle and necklace. Qing Shui would not forgo any chance of increasing his powers, even if it was by a little bit.</p>
  <p>The sky started to turn dim and Qing Shui planned to leave the blacksmith store and head back to the Canghai residence. After all, he had mentioned to Canghai and the others that he would be moving back.</p>
  <p>However, at that moment, Qing Shui felt an indescribable heart-throbbing feeling rising.</p>
  <p>It was a hair-raising feeling and Qing Shui immediately went into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, observing the situation outside from within.</p>
  <p>Less than a breath time after Qing Shui had entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, a figure appeared not far from Qing Shui. Qing Shui saw clearly that it was a middle-aged elegant looking man, wearing a purple moon robe to accentuate his dignified aura. His eyes were bright and they had a tinge of feeling of one who had been through alot in life; his upright nose with that arrogant looking lips made one feel that this man was very strange and especially masculine, having a dominating aura amidst his elegance.</p>
  <p>“I had obviously sensed that it’s here, why is there nothing here?” The middle-aged elegant and handsome looking man mumbled to himself.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at this man who could possibly rival Canghai, though he would still lose out to Canghai by a bit. While he did not know who this man was, Qing Shui had the feeling that he was someone from the Immortal Sword Sect.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui knew that the man was looking for him. Thank goodness his spiritual sense was strong enough. Qing Shui was even more certain now that the man was from the Immortal Sword Sect and he was obviously not just a notch stronger than those Elders.</p>
  <p>It was a pity that he was not able to launch an attack on the outside from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. If not, it would be possible for him to scare off this strong middle-aged man.</p>
  <p>The middle-aged man closed that pair of big bright eyes, silently feeling the movements in the surroundings. On the other hand, Qing Shui tried to restrain himself in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, controlling his urge to launch a sneak attack on this middle-aged man.</p>
  <p>Even if he did not succeed, he should still be able to retreat safely into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. However, Qing Shui still felt that something was off, though he was not sure what it was. Therefore, he restrained the urge to launch the sneak attack.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui restrained himself so as to not to alert the enemy in advance and try to stall for some time. If he was able to enter the 90th cycle of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, Qing Shui would dash out without any hesitation as he felt that once he entered the 90th cycle, he would definitely be able to get away with damage inflicted on his opponent if he were to launch a sneak attack.</p>
  <p>“I wonder if Old Ancestor made his way at Canghai’s residence?” The man said softly as he pondered.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s gaze suddenly turned red, both his fist clenched tightly as a thin trail of blood appeared slowly from his palms. He tried very hard to control himself, putting on the Golden-Ringed Battle Armor and Coldsteel Boots, calling the fire bird to his side, preparing himself to dash out at the best possible moment.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui had the urge to dash out immediately, but he knew that he needed to grasp the opportunity to at least deal a heavy blow on this middle-aged man. However, at that moment, he heard the middle-aged man let out a sigh!</p>
  <p>“Seems like he really isn’t here.” After saying that, he dashed out through the backdoor in a flash.</p>
  <p>“Darn, trying to fool me… ” Qing Shui hurled out abuses. He had also suspected that this man was trying to fool him, but under such a situation, it would be better to believe it than not to.</p>
  <p>Only after staying for a short moment did Qing Shui then leave the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and dashed towards the Canghai residence. Regardless if what the middle-aged man had said was to lure him out, his mind would not be at peace until he saw that the Canghai family were safe for himself.</p>
  <p>When Qing Shui arrived at Canghai’s residence, he noticed that there were no anomalies. It was already dark, so he quietly walked in, and he finally felt as ease when he heard the familiar voices chattering.</p>
  <p>When Qing Shui walked into the hall, he noticed that they were only short of his presence and he smiled, embarrassed.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, what happened to your hand?” Huoyun Liu-Li suddenly noticed that there were blood trails on Qing Shui’s hands and she anxiously ran over to grab his hands, not feeling any bit of despise.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, what happened?” Canghai also noticed that something was off and he walked to Qing Shui’s side and asked softly.</p>
  <p>“What would make you scratch your two hands like this?” Canghai asked, puzzled.</p>
  <p>“It’s because I heard that the Immortal Sword Sect’s Old Ancestor has made his way here.” Qing Shui smiled bitterly as he said. Thereafter, he smiled at Huoyun Liu-Li to express that he was fine as he gradually pulled back his hands.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue and her mother also walked over quickly, looking at him in concern. It was impossible for them to say that they were not touched. After all, Qing Shui had rushed back in a panic, unafraid of death, when he heard that something had happened to the Canghai family.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, come here to clean your wound and apply medicine!” Canghai Mingyue’s mother smiled and said.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled at her and went to wash the blood off his hands. Ever since he started cultivating the Ancient Strengthening Technique, Qing Shui’s recovery was amazing. A light layer of scarring had already formed on the wounds, so there was no need to apply medicine.</p>
  <p>“Let’s have dinner first. We’ll talk afterwards.” Canghai smiled and said when he saw that Canghai Mingyue wanted to say something.</p>
  <p>It was very quiet during the meal, and it was as if no one had much appetite. It was especially so for Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li as they had both ate a little. Qing Shui was also worried about what was going to happen.</p>
  <p>“Daddy, quickly speak out. If not, your daughter won’t be able to sleep.” After they had their meal, Canghai Mingyue sat down next to Canghai and said!</p>
  <p>“It shouldn’t be any longer than half a month. For this half a month, we’ll need to be more alert and wait for the opportunity to come up. When it does, you must listen to my arrangements.” Canghai smiled and said.</p>
  <p>“Senior plans to delay them to let us escape?” Qing Shui lifted his head as he looking at Canghai with burning eyes. His eyes were filled with fighting spirit and will, his gaze was as bright as the stars.</p>
  <p>“I’m not leaving, I’m not leaving even if I were to die!” Canghai Mingyue said stubbornly.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose. He knew that this would happen and at that moment, he also had no plans to make his escape.</p>
  <p>“Sigh, that old blind chap has already reached the 7th grade of the Martial King rank while I’m only at the pinnacle of the 6th grade of Martial King. It would probably take him only around a hundred moves to kill me.” Canghai sighed and said.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui quickly analyzed Canghai’s words. Canghai could hold off for a hundred moves. If only he could provide him with an additional 10% speed, 10% defence, ignoring the strength, and if there were any of his techniques which could be useful for battle. </p>
  <p>What gave Qing Shui hope was that the old blind chap was a 7th grade Martial King, and a 7th grade Martial King was not undefeatable!</p>
  <p>“Senior, do we not even have a slight chance of winning?” Qing Shui asked, refusing to give up hope. He did not believe in miracles, but he believed that anything can be achieved through effort.</p>
  <p>“It’s not that there’s none, but it’s a pity that it’s too hard to achieve it now.” Canghai let out a sigh and said.</p>
  <p>“Senior, since it has come down to this, you should just say it. If there was a chance, wouldn’t it mean that everyone’s lives would be secure?” Qing Shui refused to give up on any chances at all.</p>
  <p>“Thirty years ago, I blinded one of the old blind chap’s eyes. If his other eye is also blind, it should be no problem for us to secure our lives.”</p>
  <p>Canghai’s words gave Qing Shui hope. Once he found a direction, he would work hard towards it. Qing Shui looked at Canghai earnestly.</p>
  <p>“Which of his eye is the good one?”</p>
  <p>“His left eye!” Canghai was also feeling weird. He felt that Qing Shui was very mysterious, and he might really be able to do something beyond their expectations. Canghai Mingyue also looked at Qing Shui, feeling complicated yet happy.</p>
  <p>Half a month. Qing Shui felt that he would need to make good use of time to prepare for it. Thankfully, he had already started some of the preparation. After dinner, Qing Shui headed towards the building at the back together with Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, dad said that there’s no assurance for everyone’s lives. When the time comes, when the opportunity arise, take Liu-Li and leave. Be good to her, alright?” When they were heading back, Canghai Mingyue said, feeling melancholy. </p>
  <p>“Try saying it again and I will whack your butt.” Qing Shui looked calmly at Canghai Mingyue as he said. No one able to tell if he was angry or joking.</p>
  <p>“You rascal, this is for your own good. I can’t escape alone, leaving my parents in the lurch, but it’s not the same for the two of you.” Canghai Mingyue said angrily.</p>
  <p>“I’m not leaving, I’m not leaving even if I were to die.” Huoyun Liu-Li smiled and said, but anyone could tell that she was very determined.</p>
  <p>“Liu-Li, why are you acting like this too?” Canghai Mingyue’s eyes turned slightly red as she looked at Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
  <p>“Everything that I have was given to me by Master. If I were to leave, even I would not be able to forgive myself.” Huoyun Liu-Li once again addressed Canghai Mingyue as her Master at this point.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue turned her head and looked at Qing Shui again, her smiling eyes had a frail beauty to it. Qing Shui looked to her and smiled, “Don’t worry. Maybe things are not as we imagine it to be. Human’s effort is always the deciding factor, and humans are masters of their own fate.”</p>
  <p>“Thank you, Qing Shui!” Canghai Mingyue said seriously.</p>
  <p>“You’re standing on ceremony again. We are a family, why are you regarding me as an outsider? No matter what happens, I will stand on your side. And there’s still Liu-Li, we’ll all be together.” Qing Shui grinned and said.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue did not feel that feel angry at Qing Shui’s words. It was already very hard to come by for Qing Shui to do this for them. He did not have any evil designs, he did not express that he wanted to chase her, nor did he overly take advantage of her when he could. It might be because of all these reasons that she was not averse towards him.</p>
  <p>Thinking of the few jokes he had made towards her, while the meaning of the words were very ambiguous and flirtatious, that heartwarming and heart-throbbing feeling did not come with any fury.</p>
  <p>Think about this, Canghai Mingyue felt that it was very heartwarming deep inside. It might be because they were at their wit’s end that she realized that there were many things which she had yet to attempt, such as love. It was impossible for a normal lady to not long for love between men and women.</p>
  <p>However, she had not expected for such a thing to suddenly happen. Seeing that she might only be left with a few days to live instead of having a long life before her like she had originally thought, she had not wanted to get herself involved in a romantic relationship too early. She was afraid that being tied down in a romantic relationship would be an obstacle to her cultivation.</p>
  <p>She did not want to leave behind any regrets. She wanted to be able to feel it at least, no matter how short, even if it was an act… </p>
  <p>“Qing Shui… ”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was about to leave when he heard Canghai Mingyue calling out to him in a low voice! Puzzled, he turned to look towards Canghai Mingyue, who was feeling unease.</p>
  <p>“Can you hug me? Just like how you would do to your wife!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was stunned. He would never had thought that Canghai Mingyue would act like this. He felt that he had heard it wrongly. But he saw that Huoyun Liu-Li was also looking at Canghai Mingyue in surprise.</p>
  <p>“Don’t think too much of it. I’m just afraid that I wouldn’t be able to live for long! I want to leave myself some memories.” Canghai Mingyue was embarrassed, but she bravely lifted her head to look at Qing Shui. A flicker of brightness lit up her dark and deep gaze, her goddess-like looks exuded an unparalleled beauty.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt slightly stumped when he heard her saying those words with such ambiguous feelings. While her expression was that of embarrassment and her goddess-like face was extremely beautiful, Qing Shui knew that she was afraid that she would not be able to survive through this ordeal. She did not want her lovelife to be a complete blank and wanted a warm and unforgettable hug.</p>

 <p>Qing Shui looked at this man who could possibly rival Canghai, though he would still lose out to Canghai by a bit. While he did not know who this man was, Qing Shui had the feeling that he was someone from the Immortal Sword Sect.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that the man was looking for him. Thank goodness his spiritual sense was strong enough. Qing Shui was even more certain now that the man was from the Immortal Sword Sect and he was obviously not just a notch stronger than those Elders.</p>
 <p>It was a pity that he was not able to launch an attack on the outside from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. If not, it would be possible for him to scare off this strong middle-aged man.</p>
 <p>The middle-aged man closed that pair of big bright eyes, silently feeling the movements in the surroundings. On the other hand, Qing Shui tried to restrain himself in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, controlling his urge to launch a sneak attack on this middle-aged man.</p>
 <p>Even if he did not succeed, he should still be able to retreat safely into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. However, Qing Shui still felt that something was off, though he was not sure what it was. Therefore, he restrained the urge to launch the sneak attack.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui restrained himself so as to not to alert the enemy in advance and try to stall for some time. If he was able to enter the 90th cycle of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, Qing Shui would dash out without any hesitation as he felt that once he entered the 90th cycle, he would definitely be able to get away with damage inflicted on his opponent if he were to launch a sneak attack.</p>
 <p>“I wonder if Old Ancestor made his way at Canghai’s residence?” The man said softly as he pondered.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s gaze suddenly turned red, both his fist clenched tightly as a thin trail of blood appeared slowly from his palms. He tried very hard to control himself, putting on the Golden-Ringed Battle Armor and Coldsteel Boots, calling the fire bird to his side, preparing himself to dash out at the best possible moment.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had the urge to dash out immediately, but he knew that he needed to grasp the opportunity to at least deal a heavy blow on this middle-aged man. However, at that moment, he heard the middle-aged man let out a sigh!</p>
 <p>“Seems like he really isn’t here.” After saying that, he dashed out through the backdoor in a flash.</p>
 <p>“Darn, trying to fool me… ” Qing Shui hurled out abuses. He had also suspected that this man was trying to fool him, but under such a situation, it would be better to believe it than not to.</p>
 <p>Only after staying for a short moment did Qing Shui then leave the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and dashed towards the Canghai residence. Regardless if what the middle-aged man had said was to lure him out, his mind would not be at peace until he saw that the Canghai family were safe for himself.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui arrived at Canghai’s residence, he noticed that there were no anomalies. It was already dark, so he quietly walked in, and he finally felt as ease when he heard the familiar voices chattering.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui walked into the hall, he noticed that they were only short of his presence and he smiled, embarrassed.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, what happened to your hand?” Huoyun Liu-Li suddenly noticed that there were blood trails on Qing Shui’s hands and she anxiously ran over to grab his hands, not feeling any bit of despise.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, what happened?” Canghai also noticed that something was off and he walked to Qing Shui’s side and asked softly.</p>
 <p>“What would make you scratch your two hands like this?” Canghai asked, puzzled.</p>
 <p>“It’s because I heard that the Immortal Sword Sect’s Old Ancestor has made his way here.” Qing Shui smiled bitterly as he said. Thereafter, he smiled at Huoyun Liu-Li to express that he was fine as he gradually pulled back his hands.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue and her mother also walked over quickly, looking at him in concern. It was impossible for them to say that they were not touched. After all, Qing Shui had rushed back in a panic, unafraid of death, when he heard that something had happened to the Canghai family.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, come here to clean your wound and apply medicine!” Canghai Mingyue’s mother smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled at her and went to wash the blood off his hands. Ever since he started cultivating the Ancient Strengthening Technique, Qing Shui’s recovery was amazing. A light layer of scarring had already formed on the wounds, so there was no need to apply medicine.</p>
 <p>“Let’s have dinner first. We’ll talk afterwards.” Canghai smiled and said when he saw that Canghai Mingyue wanted to say something.</p>
 <p>It was very quiet during the meal, and it was as if no one had much appetite. It was especially so for Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li as they had both ate a little. Qing Shui was also worried about what was going to happen.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, quickly speak out. If not, your daughter won’t be able to sleep.” After they had their meal, Canghai Mingyue sat down next to Canghai and said!</p>
 <p>“It shouldn’t be any longer than half a month. For this half a month, we’ll need to be more alert and wait for the opportunity to come up. When it does, you must listen to my arrangements.” Canghai smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“Senior plans to delay them to let us escape?” Qing Shui lifted his head as he looking at Canghai with burning eyes. His eyes were filled with fighting spirit and will, his gaze was as bright as the stars.</p>
 <p>“I’m not leaving, I’m not leaving even if I were to die!” Canghai Mingyue said stubbornly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose. He knew that this would happen and at that moment, he also had no plans to make his escape.</p>
 <p>“Sigh, that old blind chap has already reached the 7th grade of the Martial King rank while I’m only at the pinnacle of the 6th grade of Martial King. It would probably take him only around a hundred moves to kill me.” Canghai sighed and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly analyzed Canghai’s words. Canghai could hold off for a hundred moves. If only he could provide him with an additional 10% speed, 10% defence, ignoring the strength, and if there were any of his techniques which could be useful for battle. </p>
 <p>What gave Qing Shui hope was that the old blind chap was a 7th grade Martial King, and a 7th grade Martial King was not undefeatable!</p>
 <p>“Senior, do we not even have a slight chance of winning?” Qing Shui asked, refusing to give up hope. He did not believe in miracles, but he believed that anything can be achieved through effort.</p>
 <p>“It’s not that there’s none, but it’s a pity that it’s too hard to achieve it now.” Canghai let out a sigh and said.</p>
 <p>“Senior, since it has come down to this, you should just say it. If there was a chance, wouldn’t it mean that everyone’s lives would be secure?” Qing Shui refused to give up on any chances at all.</p>
 <p>“Thirty years ago, I blinded one of the old blind chap’s eyes. If his other eye is also blind, it should be no problem for us to secure our lives.”</p>
 <p>Canghai’s words gave Qing Shui hope. Once he found a direction, he would work hard towards it. Qing Shui looked at Canghai earnestly.</p>
 <p>“Which of his eye is the good one?”</p>
 <p>“His left eye!” Canghai was also feeling weird. He felt that Qing Shui was very mysterious, and he might really be able to do something beyond their expectations. Canghai Mingyue also looked at Qing Shui, feeling complicated yet happy.</p>
 <p>Half a month. Qing Shui felt that he would need to make good use of time to prepare for it. Thankfully, he had already started some of the preparation. After dinner, Qing Shui headed towards the building at the back together with Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, dad said that there’s no assurance for everyone’s lives. When the time comes, when the opportunity arise, take Liu-Li and leave. Be good to her, alright?” When they were heading back, Canghai Mingyue said, feeling melancholy. </p>
 <p>“Try saying it again and I will whack your butt.” Qing Shui looked calmly at Canghai Mingyue as he said. No one able to tell if he was angry or joking.</p>
 <p>“You rascal, this is for your own good. I can’t escape alone, leaving my parents in the lurch, but it’s not the same for the two of you.” Canghai Mingyue said angrily.</p>
 <p>“I’m not leaving, I’m not leaving even if I were to die.” Huoyun Liu-Li smiled and said, but anyone could tell that she was very determined.</p>
 <p>“Liu-Li, why are you acting like this too?” Canghai Mingyue’s eyes turned slightly red as she looked at Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
 <p>“Everything that I have was given to me by Master. If I were to leave, even I would not be able to forgive myself.” Huoyun Liu-Li once again addressed Canghai Mingyue as her Master at this point.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue turned her head and looked at Qing Shui again, her smiling eyes had a frail beauty to it. Qing Shui looked to her and smiled, “Don’t worry. Maybe things are not as we imagine it to be. Human’s effort is always the deciding factor, and humans are masters of their own fate.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Qing Shui!” Canghai Mingyue said seriously.</p>
 <p>“You’re standing on ceremony again. We are a family, why are you regarding me as an outsider? No matter what happens, I will stand on your side. And there’s still Liu-Li, we’ll all be together.” Qing Shui grinned and said.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue did not feel that feel angry at Qing Shui’s words. It was already very hard to come by for Qing Shui to do this for them. He did not have any evil designs, he did not express that he wanted to chase her, nor did he overly take advantage of her when he could. It might be because of all these reasons that she was not averse towards him.</p>
 <p>Thinking of the few jokes he had made towards her, while the meaning of the words were very ambiguous and flirtatious, that heartwarming and heart-throbbing feeling did not come with any fury.</p>
 <p>Think about this, Canghai Mingyue felt that it was very heartwarming deep inside. It might be because they were at their wit’s end that she realized that there were many things which she had yet to attempt, such as love. It was impossible for a normal lady to not long for love between men and women.</p>
 <p>However, she had not expected for such a thing to suddenly happen. Seeing that she might only be left with a few days to live instead of having a long life before her like she had originally thought, she had not wanted to get herself involved in a romantic relationship too early. She was afraid that being tied down in a romantic relationship would be an obstacle to her cultivation.</p>
 <p>She did not want to leave behind any regrets. She wanted to be able to feel it at least, no matter how short, even if it was an act… </p>
 <p>“Qing Shui… ”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was about to leave when he heard Canghai Mingyue calling out to him in a low voice! Puzzled, he turned to look towards Canghai Mingyue, who was feeling unease.</p>
 <p>“Can you hug me? Just like how you would do to your wife!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. He would never had thought that Canghai Mingyue would act like this. He felt that he had heard it wrongly. But he saw that Huoyun Liu-Li was also looking at Canghai Mingyue in surprise.</p>
 <p>“Don’t think too much of it. I’m just afraid that I wouldn’t be able to live for long! I want to leave myself some memories.” Canghai Mingyue was embarrassed, but she bravely lifted her head to look at Qing Shui. A flicker of brightness lit up her dark and deep gaze, her goddess-like looks exuded an unparalleled beauty.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt slightly stumped when he heard her saying those words with such ambiguous feelings. While her expression was that of embarrassment and her goddess-like face was extremely beautiful, Qing Shui knew that she was afraid that she would not be able to survive through this ordeal. She did not want her lovelife to be a complete blank and wanted a warm and unforgettable hug.</p>
