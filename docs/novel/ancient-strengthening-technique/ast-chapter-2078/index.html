 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui remembered the Darknight Demon King Tu Lang from before. The word ‘Tu Lang’ should be a name. Similarly, in the term ‘Giant Demon King Biao Yong’, ‘Biao Yong’ was also a name. These showed that more than one demon lord existed. In fact, there could be even more Darknights and Giant Demon Kings in the outside world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Too absorbed on observing the portraits, He didn’t notice that Shen Huang had been standing quietly beside him all the time. Qing Shui shook his head to get his mind off this thing for the time being. Looking around the room, he noticed the inner hall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go and take a look at the inner hall. This is only an ancestral hall of the demon lords. And it shows that at one point, there used to be multiple demon lords gathering here. As for whether or not they left behind any treasures, the chances of it happening would be quite small.” Qing Shui didn’t have high hopes on this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, since we are already here, it won’t hurt taking a look at it. If we are lucky, maybe we will find one or two treasures,” Shen Huang said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang felt that her trip this time had been worthwhile. Even though she was aware that Qing Shui was a formidable Formation Master; she never expected his power to exceed her expectations by so much. The fact that he managed to destroy a formation from ancient times still shocked her until now. This was how terrifying a powerful Formation Master could be!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In ancient times, no one would have dared to provoke formidable Formation Masters as they had been capable of destroying an entire sect in one night. The price for eliminating an ancient city had been very high. A large number of materials would have been needed for the Formation. For a city to be destroyed, all of them would have had to be at Divine Grade. Even if it were only a sect, the more powerful the enemies who were trapped inside the Formations, the more energy the Formations would need to consume. If the materials weren’t good enough, and the Formation failed to kill the people trapped in it, it would collapse. By then, the only thing which awaited the Formation Master would be death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, even a powerful Formation Master would need the protections of a formidable force. Meanwhile. Formation Masters were also very popular. Given that they were strong enough, they would be in high demand by a lot of people. However, cases where the Formation Masters had betrayed and destroyed an entire clan, had also happened in the World of the Nine Continents before. Hence, while Formation Masters were loved by many; the people also couldn’t help but fear them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nowadays, there were very few Formation Masters across the world, not to mention the ridiculously powerful ones. And in most of the cases, Divine Grade materials were even rarer than formidable Formation Masters themselves. That was why a lot of people couldn’t help but let out a sigh of relief as the Formation Masters wouldn’t be that feared anymore without the formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang knew that Qing Shui wouldn’t do anything bad to her. Plus, it was naturally a good thing to have a strong Formidable Master as a friend, let alone they weren’t just ordinary friends. Thinking up to this point, Shen Huang got a bit embarrassed and blushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All this time, Qing Shui had had his eyes fixed on Shen Huang. He couldn’t figure out what the goddess in front of him was thinking. She had been so distracted a while ago, but now, her face even started to turn red. This caused him to be really confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she lifted her head only to see Qing Shui’s confused look, she felt a bit shy. But at this moment, Qing Shui asked, “Are you thinking about how you can have your way with me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?” Shen Huang was confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You harassed me in your thoughts,” Qing Shui said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can you be even more absurd than that?” Shen Huang was speechless hearing Qing Shui’s accusation, but she wasn’t angry. She felt that she was a bit too helpless to be angry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, I would really love to,” Qing Shui quickly led her into the inner hall the moment he finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Qing Shui’s nervous look, Shen Huang unconsciously grinned. She felt that this has been the happiest moment of her life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The inner hall was a lot narrower than outside. Other than a few poles, nothing much could be found in it. There was no formation, but there was a stone platform. It was unknown whether it served the purpose as a bed or a place for the demon kings to practice their techniques. Its surface was smooth like jade. Even though it was made of decent materials and was quite good for cultivating, it wasn’t enough to catch Qing Shui’s attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph? That part seems to be sticking out. Could it lead to some sort of secret path?” Suddenly, Shen Huang noticed a mark about the size of a fist on a not so obvious spot. It was slightly bulging compared to the other tiles. Unless one looked at it carefully, they wouldn’t be able to tell the difference. Even if they did, it wouldn't be enough to cause them to ponder over it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang approached the bulging plate as she spoke and pressed on it with both of her arms. The plate immediately sunk down. Seeing that, Qing Shui said hurriedly, “Rotate it clockwise by 540 degrees. Good. And now, do it anti-clockwise by two rounds and a half. After that, turn it back clockwise again for three rounds and a half.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Shen Huang didn’t understand why Qing Shui would ask her to do that, she still followed his instructions and rotated it. After that, a roaring noise was heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire inner hall was vibrating. Shen Huang looked at Qing Shui with a confused expression and said, “Don’t tell me it’s going to collapse!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is hard to say.” Qing Shui was keeping his eyes on the stone bits that were constantly dropping down from the top.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luckily, it didn’t take too long for the tremor to stop, and a stone door could be seen slowly emerging on a wall not so far away. When they had been looking at that wall previously, nothing could be found from it, not even a small gap in between. The door was quite narrow; it could only allow two people to go into it side-by-side. It was about ten feet tall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As I thought, there is really a secret path. It seems I may be able to get myself a few treasured possessions.” Shen Huang smiled and winked a few times at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was shocked by her. He then rubbed his nose and said, “Eldest Mistress, if you dare to seduce me again, believe it or not, I will…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui clicked on his own tongue. Even though he did not say it out, he knew that Shen Huang would naturally know what he was thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can you please die already? Who would want to seduce you? Please stop being so disgusting from now on.” Shen Huang shot a glare at Qing Shui. Regardless of whether she was angry or flirting with him, she would still look stunningly beautiful. Qing Shui could never be satisfied by looking at her, but at least being beside her, he could get to feast his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not disgusting, not disgusting at all. It smells good and feels very soft.” Qing Shui said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While he was saying that, Qing Shui’s mind was blank. Even though Shen Huang didn’t manage to read Qing Shui’s mind, she was more or less able to figure out what he wanted to say. After so many days of being together with him, she had begun to get a grasp on the vulgar thoughts this man could come up with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nonsense,” Shen Huang said and stomped on the ground, taking the lead to head towards the stone door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the cute face of hers and could tell that she was happy. This was her first time being so adorable. He didn’t know if this would also be the last time he ever saw it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as they entered the secret room, they were welcomed by a cold aura. It was an unusual kind of cold, causing both Qing Shui and Shen Huang to look at each other. An aura that could even make people at their level feel cold; from here, it could be seen just how cold it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two followed along the stone stairs and made their way down for about ten meters. By the time they reached the bottom, there was a path leading them ahead and what lies ahead of them was the hidden room. The room was precisely where the cold aura originated from. Everything became clear to Qing Shui as soon as he entered it. There was a snow-white bed in here, its surface emitting the freezing aura.</span></p>

The cold Qi around here couldn’t be compared to the ones emitting from the Frigid Jade Stone Bed at all. The cold Qis around the bed was very thick and concentrated. But because the secret room was quite small, that was why it would feel cold being around here.</span></p>

The pill was about the size of a human’s head. It was crystal blue in color and looked shiny. Qing Shui looked at it with his Heavenly Vision Technique and was shocked when he found out what it was.</span></p>

Once a being with a phoenix’s bloodline consumed the Nirvana Holy Pill, its entire body would go through a complete Nirvana Rebirth. It would soon gain access to the abilities of the Ice Crystal Phoenix and be blessed with some of its power. The Nirvana Holy Pill could only raise the power of the beast to the limit of five billion Dao. If the strength of the being which consumed the Nirvana Holy Pill exceeded the said value, it would only be able to comprehend some of the innate talents and battle techniques of the Ice Crystal Phoenix.</span></p>
