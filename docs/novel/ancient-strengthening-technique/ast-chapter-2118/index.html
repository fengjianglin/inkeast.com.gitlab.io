 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt his presence redundant at once. He had no idea why the feeling came in. He admitted that he liked Nuolan, it was easy to like a beautiful woman, but it was not up to an extreme extent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was definitely unwilling to let this young man own Nuolan. Firstly, his instinct told him so. Secondly, he did not know Beihuang Yu well enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Nuolan liked Beihuang Yu too, that was a mutual affection and he had no excuses to stop them. Even, for now, he had no rights to stop them. He was not Nuolan’s man and as Beihuang Yu said previously, he had the freedom to like Nuolan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Surely, Nuolan had her freedom to reject him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Listening to Beihuang Yu, there was a gentle look in Nuolan’s eyes. Staring into Beihuang Yu ’s clingy and sincere eyes, she was confused. Over the years, the two men by her side now were the closest to her. Besides, most people would think that Beihuang Yu was better than Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Apart from being the young master of Taiyi Immortal Palace, he was a talented genius of the Northern Emperor Domain. He was young and good looking. The key point was that he had no other women and he only liked her alone. In this case, he was certainly better than Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the struggle in Nuolan’s eyes, there was a strange beam in Beihuang Yu’s eyes. He said softly, “Nuolan, I don’t want to watch you suffer. I only wish that you will give me a chance. I will never force you to make a choice, my heart for you will remain forever. Even if you are not my wife this time and even when we both have our own families, you are always the one I love the most. No matter what happens in the future, I will be with you. I will keep the most important place for you here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was speechless. This guy looked honest and not the foppish son of the rich, but he was so good at saying flirty words. His strongest feature was the confidence in his expression, gesture, and tone. Qing Shui could see no flaws in him. The essence of lover’s talk was the sincerity and originality, it would be disgusting if one was being pretentious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuolan nodded, “I have not considered about this yet so let’s leave it to the future. You really don’t have to do this, I might not marry anyone for my entire life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll accompany you. I said it before, I won’t stay single for you, but I will think about these after you get married,” replied Beihuang Yu gently. The determination of his tone was stunning enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt like watching the TV main characters’ conversation from his past life. It seemed like they would get together eventually. It was written in the script and he felt this way right now…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nuolan, this is?” Beihuang Yu only looked at Qing Shui now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He is Qing Shui from the Divine Palace. We collaborated and opened the Imperial Cuisine Hall here,” Nuolan introduced Qing Shui to Beihuang Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hello, I was thinking the whole time that Mr. Qing has a great strength. Now that I know you are from the Divine Palace, it’s no wonder. I’m Beihuang Yu, glad to know you,” Beihuang Yu sounded graceful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had a feeling that this man was here to snatch his woman away in an obvious and polite way. Yet, he had no choice, the woman never admitted to be his…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hello, I’m Qing Shui. Glad to know you too. Mr. Yu also has a formidable strength.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui observed the situation as he spoke. This man had several women regardless of his marital status. He had a Yang and tough constitution, though his Origin Essence leaked out, it was nothing and harmless to him. In short, this man had different women every night. One woman could not satisfy him; thus, he had several women despite being single. However, it was normal for a person like him to have many women.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could sense that this Beihuang Yu had a strong interest in Nuolan. He did not say it wrong, he said he would wait for Nuolan but never promised to stay away from women because of her. Hence, Qing Shui would not make a big fuss over it. Some things were already obvious and well-known, even Nuolan knew about it. It would be anti-climatic to say it out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hoho, let’s practice together if you are free. I haven’t fought for ages and I can’t help to have an urge to battle when I see Mr. Qing,” said Beihuang Yu with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui scolded secretly. This was freaking obvious, he wanted to beat Qing Shui. Initially, this man looked honest. But perhaps, he was just being warlike as a training fanatic would enjoy battling with others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sure, I want to have a battle with someone too,” Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s do it today instead of another day. I wonder if Mr. Qing is free now. My hands get itchy as I say this, how about a battle for three hundred rounds?” Beihuang Yu smiled. He looked serious without any hidden motives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Again, Qing Shui realized this guy had a harmless expression. He was originally very strong and together with this manner, he emitted a unique charm. Thought he sounded rather pushy now, it did not feel like he had any bad intentions. Everyone knew he was warlike anyway.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was not someone who would back off. Even though he might not be a match for Beihuang Yu now, nobody knew the winner in the real battle. Qing Shui was lacking in his attacking power, but he could reduce the opponent’s strength to a non-threatening level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was in theory, but Qing Shui had no idea how it would be exactly. However, as Qing Shui was a Battle God of Divine Palace, Beihuang Yu would not kill him considering the relationship between the Taiyi Immortal Palace and Divine Palace. Moreover, Nuolan was around too. Still, there was a possibility that he would hurt him “accidentally”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you doing, battle as soon as you know each other, a fight? No fights allowed,” Nuolan saw Qing Shui hesitated. In fact, she decided to stop them from the beginning. She knew that Qing Shui could not fight against Beihuang Yu at this level. Beihuang Yu was the strongest one among the younger generation in the Northern Emperor Domain. He was also one of the top powerhouses even if everyone of all ages was included. He was the top ten in the Taiyi Immortal Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Taiyi Immortal Palace was stronger than Divine Palace. If Beihuang Yu was in the Divine Palace, only the Lord could win over him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, together with Qing Shui, at least five persons could defeat Beihuang Yu if they fought in pairs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since Nuolan said so, we won’t fight then,” said Beihuang Yu so simply and casually, but everybody, who heard it, would tell that Qing Shui was hiding behind a woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, it’s fine to have a battle sometimes. I can probably find out about my weakness. Elder Sis Nuolan, it’s alright. You know I’m tough, I will be fine,” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Yu’s heart skipped a beat as he watched Qing Shui without any movement. That statement made Beihuang Yu feel that Nuolan was close to this kid. Though he had endless women before and knew that Nuolan was still pure, he still felt uncomfortable listening to Qing Shui’s statement.</span></p>
