 <p><strong>AST 843 - Tang Manor Medicinal Hall, Tang Manor?</strong></p>
 <p>The road stretched very far out, with buildings on both sides of the huge street. The beast carriages passing by on the road created “da da” sounds and there were also all sorts of people passing by. There were people who were alone and also people who were in groups. There was a family of three, a couple who was whispering sweet nothings to each other, a party of adventurers...</p>
 <p>When he looked at this scene while standing there alone, Qing Shui could not help but think of his family and Yun Duan whom he had just left two months ago.</p>
 <p>"Uncle, please head to the biggest trader in medicinal herbs in the area."</p>
 <p>"Alright!"</p>
 <p>The coachman replied and proceeded forward at quick pace with Qing Shui on board. He turned into an extremely wide street. Through the windows in the carriage, Qing Shui could see the buildings on both sides of the streets.</p>
 <p>"Sir, we've arrived!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui paid the money and said, "Uncle, please wait here for a while. Take this money. I may still need to head elsewhere in a while. If you don't see me coming out after an hour, you can leave."</p>
 <p>The other party readily agreed.</p>
 <p>Tang Manor Medicinal Hall!</p>
 <p>Tang Manor?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui suddenly thought of the few factions which were the most powerful in the Central Continent: Buddha Sect, Demon Gate, Tang Manor, Dragon Emperor Mountain, Sky City, Moon City...</p>
 <p>While these factions could not all be of the same level, there were the top few in the Central Continent. This was especially so for the Buddha Sect, which was the symbol of Central Continent itself. This was a great clan with strong foundations and backings. It was said that even the branches of the Buddha Sect were all extremely powerful existences.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li's parents were at Demon Gate. Qing Shui also knew of how powerful it was and thus he was still not able to bring her to the Demon Gate for now. Today, he came across this Tang Manor Medicinal Hall.</p>
 <p>That Tang Manor was probably the only one in Central Continent who would dare to use the words 'Tang Manor'!</p>
 <p>Having been viewed on similar standings with Demon Gate, Tang Manor shouldn't be that weak themselves. After a short moment in a daze, Qing Shui headed in. The medicinal hall had its own shop but it dealt largely with wholesaling of medicinal herbs.</p>
 <p>However, medicinal halls of such a level usually engaged doing vast quantities of business in large market. The medicinal herbs here were of greater quality and were basically those of 500 Years or higher. There were those which were 1,000 Years, 2,000 Years and even quite a few which were 3,000 Years.This was the difference between a normal medicinal hall and those which belonged to major factions.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui walked into the shop. It was a big shop with a length and width exceeding two hundred meters. It was like a department store from his previous life but it just appeared simpler.</p>
 <p>There was a platform covered in golden colored cloth, with huge rows of luxurious and neat looking shelves behind it. On the shelves, there were boxes of various sizes and there were no less than ten cultivators who were on guard in the hall.</p>
 <p>However, in one look, Qing Shui saw an old man sitting in the corner, reading a book. It was a plainly dress old man but Qing Shui knew that the level of this old man was definitely stronger than him.</p>
 <p>Just as Qing Shui saw the old man, the latter lifted his head to look at Qing Shui, as if he had a lot of things on his mind. After his old eyes came into contact with Qing Shui, he seemed to be astonished but quickly regained his composure.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sensed that this old man should be the actual person who was guarding the place. The other guards were probably just there to maintain a front.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, a middle-aged man welcomed him and said politely to Qing Shui, "Sir, is there anything I can help you with?"</p>
 <p>"I need a medicinal herb. Do you have a complete collection of medicinal herbs here?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>"Haha, I'm not bragging but if you can't find the medicinal herb in Tang Manor Medicinal herb, you won't be able to find it elsewhere either." The man said with great confidence.</p>
 <p>He was truly not bragging. Qing Shui smiled and nodded, "Do you have the Sky Penetrating Grass? It's best if it's one that is at least 5,000 Years."</p>
 <p>The man was still trying to recall if they had any Sky Penetrating Grass but when he heard the request was one that was 5,000 Years, he was stunned. He could remember clearly all the medicinal herbs in Tang Manor Medicinal Hall which were 5,000 Years or above but Sky Penetrating Grass wasn’t one of them.</p>
 <p>After thinking for a short while, the man looked at Qing Shui and said seriously, "We don't have the medicinal herb that you're looking for here. I consider myself to know quite a lot about medicinal herbs but I've never heard of the Sky Penetrating Grass which you have mentioned."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was mentally prepared and had also expected this answer. However, he still felt disappointed. However, thinking of how the Sky Penetrating Grass might not be called by the same name in the world of the nine continents, Qing Shui quickly took out paper and brush.</p>
 <p>In the alchemy recipe, there was not only a description of the Sky Penetrating Grass but also a picture of it. It was a pity that Qing Shui was the only one who could see it. Now, his painting skills had already reached an extremely high level.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui quickly drew out the picture of the Sky Penetrating Grass, the people in the surroundings were extremely astonished. To think that this young man had this ability. The medicinal herb in the painting appeared to be old and strong and its sharp feature were clearly portrayed on the paper. However, it also gave the feeling of bleakness and loneliness.</p>
 <p>"Lad, you have great painting skills!"</p>
 <p>Just then, the old man who had been holding onto a book all this time walked over. When he saw Qing Shui's painting, he could not help but gave his compliments. When he saw this young man's masterpiece, he could not help but walk over. He knew that he had underestimated this young lad.</p>
 <p>"Sir, you flatter me! I don't deserve this," Qing Shui smiled and greeted him. He knew that this old man was much stronger than him.</p>
 <p>"You deserve it. I've seen quite a number of artists and am also one who likes paintings. There's no need for you to be so humble. You're looking for the Sky Penetrating Grass?" The old man looked at Qing Shui and smiled saying.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was not overly humble since it would make people feel that he was being fake. He nodded and said, "That's right. I wonder if you know where they can be found?"</p>
 <p>Just as the old man was about to say something, a young man quickly ran in. Upon seeing the old man, he said, "Grandfather, elder brother has competed in martial arts with someone else and has been hit in a vital spot. He's now on the verge of his death."</p>
 <p>"Lad, I'll need to excuse myself for a moment." After saying that, the old man was about to leave with the young man.</p>
 <p>"Let me go with you. It just so happens that I have some medical skills." Qing Shui followed behind.</p>
 <p>"Then I'll thank you." The old man took the young man by the hand and moved on at great speed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's speed was still acceptable and thus he followed behind closely. As they went along the street at great speed, they came across a luxurious manor not long later.</p>
 <p>When he saw the majestic looking words written on the sign, he was also astonished. It was because the words "Tang Manor" was no less impressive than the words he had seen in Central Continent previously.</p>
 <p>The old man and young man stopped at the door and Qing Shui also stopped next to them. The reason he had followed them was because he felt that the old man might have Sky Penetrating Grass or at least, he should know about it.</p>
 <p>The other good thing about it was that Tang Manor and Demon Gate belonged to the same circle. It might proved to be useful in the future. Therefore, since he had this chance today, he should strengthen the ties.</p>
 <p>"Lad, let's go in!"</p>
 <p>The old man said to Qing Shui and quickly entered.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui answered. At this moment, he still didn't neglect him. This made Qing Shui full of admiration for the old man's calm and his social skills. It was becuase Qing Shui could tell that he was anxious but yet he could still afford to deal with this person who was not related to him at all.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had not the time to take a close look at the luxurious manor. Doing so at such a time was showing disrespect to the master of the house.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui continued to think as he walked, wondering what status this old man with a hint of celestial aura had in Tang Manor. Since he was usually at the Tang Manor Medicinal herb shop, he must know quite a bit about medicinal herbs. At least, he should be quite a good alchemist.</p>
 <p>Otherwise, the young man would not be in such a hurry to look for him.</p>
 <p>Passing by a few corridors, turning into a courtyard, they came across quite a number of people. When they saw the old man, all of them addressed him as Fifth Master. When they entered the courtyard, they saw many people entering and leaving the place.</p>
 <p>"Make way, grandfather is here," the young man said as he rushed forward.</p>
 <p>Hearing the young man's words, everyone immediately made way. Qing Shui followed the old man into the room. The room was filled with a faint stench of blood and medicinal herbs. In the center of the hall, there was a young man breathing weakly while lying down on a bed.</p>
 <p>There were many people around him, of all ages. There were even some old men who were carrying medicinal boxes!</p>
 <p>The young man seemed to be in his thirties or forties but his face was so pale that there was no hint of blood in it. His eyes were closed tightly, his clothes covered with traces of blood. The old man quickly went over.</p>
 <p>"Fifth Master!"</p>
 <p>"Fifth Master!"</p>
 <p>"Grandfather!"</p>
 <p>"Father!"</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>"Father, you must save Chong`er!" a middle-aged beautiful married woman cried and said when she saw the old man.</p>
 <p>A middle-aged man next to her quickly pulled her away, "Stop making trouble. Would father not save Chong`er?"</p>
 <p>The old man sat down, frowning as he looked at the young man on the bed. He checked his pulse and touched the young man's neck before saying, "Who did this?"</p>
 <p>When the old man said this, a strong surge of aura burst out. It was only now that Qing Shui knew how terrifying the old man was.</p>
 <p>"Someone from Dragon Emperor Mountain!" The young man from before sighed and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't say anything, despite being very astonished to be coming across the name of another powerful faction. It was really lively in the Central Continent.</p>
 <p>On hearing the name Dragon Emperor Mountain, the old man's aura calmed down. "Chong`er's organs have been seriously damaged and have moved. Even his vitality has been cut off. Even if you find the best alchemist in Central Continent here, without a miraculous medicine which can bring one back to life, there's no way to save him."</p>
 <p>The people from Tang Manor had already heard the same reply from not less than 20 alchemists. Now, hearing the same reply again from the old man, everyone fell silent. The beautiful married lady from earlier broke into tears once again.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also looked at the person who was on his deathbed. It was just like what the old man had said. Not only were serious injuries dealt to his organs,he had no more hint of vitality in him and there were even many parts in his meridian channels which were broken off.</p>
 <p>The old man saw that Qing Shui was looking seriously at the bed. His brows twitched and he asked, "Lad, you have a way to save him?"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was also thinking about it. For an existence like the Tang Manor, with such a huge medicinal hall, by rights, they should also have something which could bring one back to life. However, after giving it more thought, since the old man was not the head of the family, with so many descendents in the clan, even if some of them were to die, they wouldn't have a chance to take it. After all, even for an existence like the Tang Manor, they wouldn't have much of such stuff.</p>
 <p>"I might not be able to cure him."</p>
 <p>Hearing Qing Shui's words, everyone was stunned. Earlier on, no one could be bothered to ask who this young man was but to think that this young man was saying that he might not be able to save the patient despite the old men who had been conducting alchemy and providing treatment for hundreds of years said that there was no cure. This meant that the chances were still high for him to be saved.</p>
 <p>After being stunned for a short moment, the old man stood up and said, "I'd like to ask for your help. No matter whether you can save him or not, I'll reward you tremendously."</p>
