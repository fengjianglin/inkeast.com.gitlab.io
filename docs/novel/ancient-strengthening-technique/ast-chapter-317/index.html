  <p><strong>317 Refining Beauty Pellets, Swallow the Energy Fruit</strong></p>
  <p><span style>Preserving one’s youth for 30 years, and increasing the overall power by 20%!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Except for the blood of Mutated Beasts of Heaven and Earth, Qing Shui has already gathered the rest of the ingredients. However, he substituted blood of Mutated Beast of Heaven and Earth with the Blood of the 1000 Year Clam. He also added the powder of the Golden Pearl of 1000 Year Calm to the set of ingredients. The effect of the pellet should not be reduced just because he did not have the blood of the Mutated Beast of Heaven and Earth.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was confident in his medicine refining skills!</span></p>
  <p><span style>After he had prepared his ingredients, Qing Shui got a little excited. This was the second 1</span><span style>st</span><span style> level King Grade medicinal pill after the Great Revitalizing Pellet, but this was also his first time refining a King Grade Medicinal Pill of 2</span><span style>nd</span><span style> level.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Before that though, Qing Shui practiced most of the Ancient Strengthening Technique to better condition himself. Then he took out the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron and proceed to put in the rinsed medicinal herbs into the cauldron in the proper level.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The amount, arrangement, sequence, level, coordination... Qing Shui had already prepared it all discreetly before he started up his Primordial Flames.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Perhaps because his spirit energy had grown greatly, Qing Shui's Primordial Flames was clearly much stronger than before. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui closed his eyes. The scenery of the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron appeared in his spiritual sense and began manipulating the heat from Primordial Flames followed by the smelting, sublimation, and fusion of the medicinal herbs, alongside a constant qualitative change in the medicinal herbs.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui invested all his body and mind into it, as he progressed in perfect order. He felt that his accumulated knowledge of refining medicinal pills, from refining to alchemy, has enabled him to create the prescriptions easier.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Just like this Beauty Pellet, although it was Qing Shui's first time refining it, he felt like he had refined them a couple of times. Maybe this was due to the experience from when he refined other medicines... &nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Golden Flint Iron Cauldron let out a "wheezing" sound. A moment later, a subtle herbal smell dispersed in the air. At this time, Qing Shui's Primordial Flames grew extra "thick".</span></p>
  <p><span style>In the blink of an eye, the flame became small, rising only an inch. This continued for about a quarter of an hour until the flame started to grow bigger slowly. The sound emitted by the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron also began to grow louder.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Time slowly passed by as if it was lost unconsciously. Qing Shui's Primordial Flames did not change much however part of the fire’s intensity was still changing continuously.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The purpose of refining medicines was to fuse and sublime different types of medical ingredients to obtain a higher grade medical herb. After that, the herbs undergo fusion and sublimation until the resulting effects reached a certain higher degree. When it reached the limit, the biggest change would occur, "Forming Pellet"!</span></p>
  <p><span style>When Qing Shui heard the sound of "Forming Pellet", a faint smile appeared on his face. The clear and soft sound of "Forming Pellet" reminded Qing Shui of a pleasant moan that a woman made when she was in the midst of making love. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui's Primordial Flames did not seem to change at all, but the Yang Fire spilled out from the Primordial Flames (also known as Flames of Yin-Yang) and he left the Yin Fire to warm up the Beauty Pellet.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Half an hour had passed. The flame slowly receded. The Yin Fire's property was Cold. This type of fire was not hot, but icy cold. It could freeze everything in its way if it reached the extreme point. At the same time, Yin Fire had the ability to turn everything into ashes.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As Qing Shui pulled back from his refining, the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron had turned icy cold. He did not rush to open the cauldron, but started to slowly practice his Ancient Strengthening Technique.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This time, the refining of the Beauty Pellet has used up the time of one whole day and night. Qing Shui was able to accept the time used to refine the Beauty Pellet as it was considered the best of the 2</span><span style>nd</span><span style> level King Grade pill.</span></p>
  <p><span style>If Qing Shui knew that other famous alchemist has used up one month to refine 2</span><span style>nd</span><span style> level King Grade medicinal pills, and the success rate was only 5%, no one could know what Qing Shui would think of it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As it was mind-exhausting, Qing Shui would not be able to persist if he did not surpass the fifth level of the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal and gain a huge boost to his spirit energy. </span></p>
  <p><span style>"It's just too dangerous!"</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui slowly got up, as he had almost recovered fully after a large cycle of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. This time an half an hour had passed by.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"If I ate two Energy Fruit, perhaps I could recover even more. Refining medicine is really mind-consuming. It's no wonder those who can refine ungodly medicinal pills have ungodly power."</span></p>
  <p><span style>Meanwhile, Qing Shui slowly walk towards the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron. He lifted the cauldron, which had returned to its normal temperature, and opened the lid with his heart ready as he anticipated the surprises.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At that moment, a flow of sweet fragrance filled his whole body. This type of smell was a sweet subtle fragrance, not the kind that had a strong pungent scent.</span></p>
  <p><span style>There was a cooling effect from the sweet fragrance, like the refreshment from mint flavor. Qing Shui felt refreshed, and he could not resist the temptation to look inside the cauldron.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Deep inside the golden cauldron, there were three medicinal pills. These pills were the size of a pearl, with a mystical deep blue color coating. The pills were glowing with a hint of blue light. The glow was pretty and psychedelic.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Three pills, and they are really concentrated with essence. With that much precious medicinal herbs, all that refinement, smelting, and sublimation, the result is just these three small items."</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui could only sigh at the wonders of refining medicine after each success. It was remarkable he was able to fuse the compatibility between the different types of herbs and develop the fusion to the ultimate level and turn them into a concentrated and higher level item.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Low-leveled alchemists could only fuse and sublime the ingredients in a simple process. Sometimes they could only fuse, but not completely sublime the herbs, thus they were unable to bring out the full effect of the medical herbs, not even by one success stage. High-leveled alchemists, expert alchemists, Xiantian alchemists... they could fuse parts, of big parts, or all of the herbs to develop a combination with the effect of ten or twelve success stages.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Each person can only consume one Beauty Pellet, which can effectively preserve one’s youthfulness for 30 years and increase the overall power by 20%. After Qing Shui took a glimpse at the Beauty Pellet, he stored it in a small porcelain jar with three seals. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui didn't think that the Beauty Pellet could heal wounds, but he believed in Cang Wuya's words, so Qing Shui never doubt the effect of the pellet. The only thing he didn't know was the right time to consume this medicinal pill. After all, they way to increase the power was based on your numbers.</span></p>
  <p><span style>To consume the same type of pill, one must base the amount of power they gain on their first time of consuming that pill, much like the small revitalizing pill, where one can increase their power by one stage by consuming two of the pills. If one consumes the first pill in the Xiantian Fifth Grade and the second one in the Xiantian Sixth Grade, then the one success stage of power gained in the second time would be based on the one success stage of power gained in the Xiantian Fifth Grade. Even if one reaches the Martial King level, it would still be based on the one success grade of power gained in the Xiantian Fifth Grade.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The amount of ingredients left could be used to refine one more time. After Qing Shui rested for one day in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he fired up the cauldron. He succeeded once again this time, and acquired three more Beauty Pellets. Qing Shui was very pleased with the refinements success rate, it was just that these ingredients were difficult to find. Once the ingredients were gathered though, his success rate was almost always 100%.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui spent the rest of his time on his practice. The upgrade of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal allowed him to acquire more time to spend on other things. During his rest after the practice, he went around to have a look at the new areas.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The current Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was about 135 acres, which was still a big piece of land. The Chinese Parasol tree which originally was as tall as the old top looked more composed to the scenery.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The lake in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had become wider after it had been upgraded from the fourth level of the realm, which was double its size. The lake stretched wide in every corner, and made the distance between the plantation and rocks alongside the lake seem further apart and even farther away from each other.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing shui looked at the nine lotus in the middle of the lake. It was very big and beautiful. The fragrance from the lotus allowed one to feel serene and purify one's heart and soul.</span></p>
  <p><span style>There was no movement from the fishes whatsoever. The Two Golden Horn Firetail Fish were still wild and tyrannical. Qing Shui was very interested in watching the two of them swimming around the lake triumphantly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui also knew that these two biological species feared one organism living in the lake, the Golden Medicinal Turtle. The 5000 year old Golden Medicinal Turtle looked like a very solid and tough diamond.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui still remember clearly the moment the two Golden Horn Firetail Fish met the Golden Medicinal Turtle. The fish used their sharp golden horn and rushed towards the Golden Medicinal Turtle. </span></p>
  <p><span style>He was able to witness that miraculously fast speed and the momentarily explosive force. Qing Shui was stunned by their power. But in the end, the Golden Medicinal Turtle was still a mere turtle that lay on the ground and basked in the sun. A little turtle that lived for 5000 years was still a typical turtle.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The healthy vigorous turtle turned, and then furiously rushed towards the Golden Horn Firetail Fish!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui watched the scenario unfold in the lake without blinking his eyes. He wasn't worried, because he noticed that hardness of the "golden horn" on the Golden Horn Firetail Fish and the hardness of the "golden turtle shell" of the Golden Medicinal Turtle were basically the same.</span></p>
  <p><span style>"Clink!" A clear sound radiated. Qing Shui felt that it was interesting and impressive to see how fast the speed of the turtle was, and how flexible it was compared to before. Although he knew the turtle was not ordinary, the turtle he saw back then was just the tip of an iceberg.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After the clash, Qing Shui could see that the one Golden Horn Firetail Fish rolled back after it had been rammed. Moreover, it looked like it was confused and had a blank gaze. The Golden Medicinal Turtle extended its head out as if it was going to be unforgiving, and headed straight towards the Golden Horn Firetail Fish and went for the bite.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was now a bit worried. This was a pair of Golden Horn Firetail Fish, they can't be allowed to be eaten by the Golden Medicinal Turtle. Just when Qing Shui was thinking of lending a hand to save the fishes, he noticed that the other Golden Horn Firetail Fish rushed towards the first fish and faced its side while tightening its body.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This action stopped the Golden Medicinal Turtle from trying to bite the first Golden Horn Firetail Fish! After all, the turtle's brain, abdomen, and four limbs... those were its weakest points.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui smiled. These three little beings were too smart. They knew how to cooperate with each other, and they were able to balance between their gains and losses and grasp their potential danger.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Those two little fishes never tried to provoke the 1000 Year Clam either. Qing Shui didn't know why, but perhaps it was too big for them. The other fishes, prawns, crabs, and green turtle were no less inferior than the black fishes and black turtle.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The bud of the Flower of Life had already blossomed. Qing Shui knew that the upgrade of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had changed the growth of these plantations. Qing Shui was happy as he thought about the wide field of 1000 year medicinal ingredients. The distance between the fields was growing smaller.</span></p>
  <p><span style>What made Qing Shui speechless though was the pink flower on the roots of the nameless tree. The blossoming flower, which was as big as the rim of a bowl, did not change. Qing Shui began to suspect whether it was another kind of Flower of Life...</span></p>
  <p><span style>The four other fruits were beginning to ripen. Qing Shui was especially interested in the Golden Sun Tai Shui, and a 5000 year old Golden Flesh LingZhi. He felt that the pills he refined every time would always be better than what he had expected. Maybe it had something to do with why he was unable to separate with the Flesh LingZhi. &nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span style>There were still eight more Energy Fruits. Qing Shui decided to eat the first two fruits. The first bite felt very cool, sweet and crispy. It was as if the fruit left a lingering fragrance in his mouth as he bit down.</span></p>

After that, the herbs undergo fusion and sublimation until the resulting effects reached a certain higher degree. When it reached the limit, the biggest change would occur, "Forming Pellet"!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Qing Shui heard the sound of "Forming Pellet", a faint smile appeared on his face. The clear and soft sound of "Forming Pellet" reminded Qing Shui of a pleasant moan that a woman made when she was in the midst of making love. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui's Primordial Flames did not seem to change at all, but the Yang Fire spilled out from the Primordial Flames (also known as Flames of Yin-Yang) and he left the Yin Fire to warm up the Beauty Pellet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Half an hour had passed. The flame slowly receded. The Yin Fire's property was Cold. This type of fire was not hot, but icy cold. It could freeze everything in its way if it reached the extreme point. At the same time, Yin Fire had the ability to turn everything into ashes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Qing Shui pulled back from his refining, the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron had turned icy cold. He did not rush to open the cauldron, but started to slowly practice his Ancient Strengthening Technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, the refining of the Beauty Pellet has used up the time of one whole day and night. Qing Shui was able to accept the time used to refine the Beauty Pellet as it was considered the best of the 2</span><span style>nd</span><span style> level King Grade pill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Qing Shui knew that other famous alchemist has used up one month to refine 2</span><span style>nd</span><span style> level King Grade medicinal pills, and the success rate was only 5%, no one could know what Qing Shui would think of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As it was mind-exhausting, Qing Shui would not be able to persist if he did not surpass the fifth level of the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal and gain a huge boost to his spirit energy. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's just too dangerous!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui slowly got up, as he had almost recovered fully after a large cycle of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. This time an half an hour had passed by.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If I ate two Energy Fruit, perhaps I could recover even more. Refining medicine is really mind-consuming. It's no wonder those who can refine ungodly medicinal pills have ungodly power."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Qing Shui slowly walk towards the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron. He lifted the cauldron, which had returned to its normal temperature, and opened the lid with his heart ready as he anticipated the surprises.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a flow of sweet fragrance filled his whole body. This type of smell was a sweet subtle fragrance, not the kind that had a strong pungent scent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a cooling effect from the sweet fragrance, like the refreshment from mint flavor. Qing Shui felt refreshed, and he could not resist the temptation to look inside the cauldron.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deep inside the golden cauldron, there were three medicinal pills. These pills were the size of a pearl, with a mystical deep blue color coating. The pills were glowing with a hint of blue light. The glow was pretty and psychedelic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Three pills, and they are really concentrated with essence. With that much precious medicinal herbs, all that refinement, smelting, and sublimation, the result is just these three small items."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui could only sigh at the wonders of refining medicine after each success. It was remarkable he was able to fuse the compatibility between the different types of herbs and develop the fusion to the ultimate level and turn them into a concentrated and higher level item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Low-leveled alchemists could only fuse and sublime the ingredients in a simple process. Sometimes they could only fuse, but not completely sublime the herbs, thus they were unable to bring out the full effect of the medical herbs, not even by one success stage. High-leveled alchemists, expert alchemists, Xiantian alchemists... they could fuse parts, of big parts, or all of the herbs to develop a combination with the effect of ten or twelve success stages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Each person can only consume one Beauty Pellet, which can effectively preserve one’s youthfulness for 30 years and increase the overall power by 20%. After Qing Shui took a glimpse at the Beauty Pellet, he stored it in a small porcelain jar with three seals. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui didn't think that the Beauty Pellet could heal wounds, but he believed in Cang Wuya's words, so Qing Shui never doubt the effect of the pellet. The only thing he didn't know was the right time to consume this medicinal pill. After all, they way to increase the power was based on your numbers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To consume the same type of pill, one must base the amount of power they gain on their first time of consuming that pill, much like the small revitalizing pill, where one can increase their power by one stage by consuming two of the pills. If one consumes the first pill in the Xiantian Fifth Grade and the second one in the Xiantian Sixth Grade, then the one success stage of power gained in the second time would be based on the one success stage of power gained in the Xiantian Fifth Grade. Even if one reaches the Martial King level, it would still be based on the one success grade of power gained in the Xiantian Fifth Grade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The amount of ingredients left could be used to refine one more time. After Qing Shui rested for one day in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he fired up the cauldron. He succeeded once again this time, and acquired three more Beauty Pellets. Qing Shui was very pleased with the refinements success rate, it was just that these ingredients were difficult to find. Once the ingredients were gathered though, his success rate was almost always 100%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui spent the rest of his time on his practice. The upgrade of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal allowed him to acquire more time to spend on other things. During his rest after the practice, he went around to have a look at the new areas.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The current Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was about 135 acres, which was still a big piece of land. The Chinese Parasol tree which originally was as tall as the old top looked more composed to the scenery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lake in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had become wider after it had been upgraded from the fourth level of the realm, which was double its size. The lake stretched wide in every corner, and made the distance between the plantation and rocks alongside the lake seem further apart and even farther away from each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing shui looked at the nine lotus in the middle of the lake. It was very big and beautiful. The fragrance from the lotus allowed one to feel serene and purify one's heart and soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no movement from the fishes whatsoever. The Two Golden Horn Firetail Fish were still wild and tyrannical. Qing Shui was very interested in watching the two of them swimming around the lake triumphantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui also knew that these two biological species feared one organism living in the lake, the Golden Medicinal Turtle. The 5000 year old Golden Medicinal Turtle looked like a very solid and tough diamond.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui still remember clearly the moment the two Golden Horn Firetail Fish met the Golden Medicinal Turtle. The fish used their sharp golden horn and rushed towards the Golden Medicinal Turtle. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He was able to witness that miraculously fast speed and the momentarily explosive force. Qing Shui was stunned by their power. But in the end, the Golden Medicinal Turtle was still a mere turtle that lay on the ground and basked in the sun. A little turtle that lived for 5000 years was still a typical turtle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The healthy vigorous turtle turned, and then furiously rushed towards the Golden Horn Firetail Fish!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui watched the scenario unfold in the lake without blinking his eyes. He wasn't worried, because he noticed that hardness of the "golden horn" on the Golden Horn Firetail Fish and the hardness of the "golden turtle shell" of the Golden Medicinal Turtle were basically the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Clink!" A clear sound radiated. Qing Shui felt that it was interesting and impressive to see how fast the speed of the turtle was, and how flexible it was compared to before. Although he knew the turtle was not ordinary, the turtle he saw back then was just the tip of an iceberg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the clash, Qing Shui could see that the one Golden Horn Firetail Fish rolled back after it had been rammed. Moreover, it looked like it was confused and had a blank gaze. The Golden Medicinal Turtle extended its head out as if it was going to be unforgiving, and headed straight towards the Golden Horn Firetail Fish and went for the bite.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui was now a bit worried. This was a pair of Golden Horn Firetail Fish, they can't be allowed to be eaten by the Golden Medicinal Turtle. Just when Qing Shui was thinking of lending a hand to save the fishes, he noticed that the other Golden Horn Firetail Fish rushed towards the first fish and faced its side while tightening its body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This action stopped the Golden Medicinal Turtle from trying to bite the first Golden Horn Firetail Fish! After all, the turtle's brain, abdomen, and four limbs... those were its weakest points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui smiled. These three little beings were too smart. They knew how to cooperate with each other, and they were able to balance between their gains and losses and grasp their potential danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those two little fishes never tried to provoke the 1000 Year Clam either. Qing Shui didn't know why, but perhaps it was too big for them. The other fishes, prawns, crabs, and green turtle were no less inferior than the black fishes and black turtle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bud of the Flower of Life had already blossomed. Qing Shui knew that the upgrade of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had changed the growth of these plantations. Qing Shui was happy as he thought about the wide field of 1000 year medicinal ingredients. The distance between the fields was growing smaller.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What made Qing Shui speechless though was the pink flower on the roots of the nameless tree. The blossoming flower, which was as big as the rim of a bowl, did not change. Qing Shui began to suspect whether it was another kind of Flower of Life...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The four other fruits were beginning to ripen. Qing Shui was especially interested in the Golden Sun Tai Shui, and a 5000 year old Golden Flesh LingZhi. He felt that the pills he refined every time would always be better than what he had expected. Maybe it had something to do with why he was unable to separate with the Flesh LingZhi. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were still eight more Energy Fruits. Qing Shui decided to eat the first two fruits. The first bite felt very cool, sweet and crispy. It was as if the fruit left a lingering fragrance in his mouth as he bit down.</span></p>
