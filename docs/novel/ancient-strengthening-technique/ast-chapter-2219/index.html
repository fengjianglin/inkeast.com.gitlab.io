 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of them ended up dead and another injured. Qing Shui had killed someone from the Nine Continents Food Residence. The man kneeling on the ground shivered, but Qing Shui didn't kill him. He didn't like to get rid of others to their roots nor did he like to be too ruthless. It was like what he said earlier. They were given a choice between their lives or their pride.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they were to choose to hang on to their pride, they would lose their lives. If they were to choose their lives, they would be forfeiting their pride. If they were to forfeit their pride, it would also be the end for them. They would find it very hard to progress their cultivation any further and thus there was no need for him to be too ruthless and wipe them out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was at this moment that Qing Shui looked toward the Bei Clan. The few people in charge were now ghastly pale. Even the person from the Nine Continents Food Residence had knelt down. Who else could they rely on? Even those from the Nine Continents Food Residence could only choose between keeping their lives or their pride. How could the two of them choose? Did they still have a right to choose?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I said before that everyone has to be responsible for their own actions. Each of you shall break one of your arms. If you can't bear to do it, I can do it on your behalf." Qing Shui said outrightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The faces of the people from the Bei Clan turned pale, but they did as they were told. Some of them who couldn't bear to do it had others assist them. Between their lives and an arm, their lives were more important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Remember, the next time I see any of you, I'll kill you directly. Those who do bad deeds will eventually have to pay for their actions. You have brought it onto yourselves."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at that man who had knelt down. The man gritted his teeth and broke one of his arms. Qing Shui no longer looked at him but said to Beihuang Fan, "Let's go."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Qing Shui and Beihuang Fan left, Beihuang Fan remained silent the entire time. Currently, they were both on a flying beast, flying toward the Imperial Cuisine Hall after Qing Shui had performed the Nine Continents Steps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Go on, speak your mind!" Qing Shui looked at Beihuang Fan, knowing that she had something to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I never expected that you were so powerful. But I'm still worried that the people from the Nine Continents Food Residence would find out. Although those three people would be punished by the Nine Continents Food Residence, the Nine Continents Food Residence has lost face because of them. Do you think that they'll seek vengeance from you?" Beihuang Fan asked, feeling a little worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We'll take things as they come. Don't worry about this before anything happens. It'll just add on to your troubles." Qing Shui laughed and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"A person who doesn't plan for the future will definitely face troubles very soon. It's better to plan ahead of time!" Beihuang Fan was still worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We better pray that the people from the Nine Continents Food Residence won't come. If they were to come, there's nothing we can do either. We'll just have to fight. But if we can’t defeat them... if we can't defeat them, what should we do?" Qing Shui looked at Beihuang Fan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Fan felt the urge to beat him up, "I'm asking you to think about it..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Aren't I discussing this with you? You're my helpful wife," Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Bleh, you and your wishful thinking! Be more serious!" Beihuang Fan's face became a little flushed. This guy would never forget to take advantage of her. To think that he was still in the mood to joke at a time like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm being very serious. You must marry me. Otherwise, I'll make whoever dares to marry you impotent or be plagued with premature ejaculation. I'll make you a living widow," Qing Shui blabbered on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beihuang Fan looked speechlessly at Qing Shui, "Are you done?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, we'll stop for today. We’ll continue tomorrow." Qing Shui nodded seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They returned to the Imperial Cuisine Hall and a few days later, Yiye Jiange came. Muyun Qingge came along with her as well. However, when Qing Shui saw Qing Xiu appearing as if he was on the verge of death while in Yiye Jiange's arms, he trembled. Yiye Jiange appeared very frail and the first thing she said when he saw Qing Shui was, "Xiu`er..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui quickly took Qing Xiu and was shocked greatly the moment he did. It was because two of Qing Xiu's bones were gone. These two pieces of bone were very important. One of them was located at the spine, and the other at the ribs. This made Qing Xiu's vitality increasingly weaker.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's eyes turned red. Qing Xiu was still so young. Who would do something so horrible?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui used the Life and Death Needles to stimulate Qing Xiu's potential. With his bones removed, ordinary regenerating medicine were useless unless they could allow one to regrow their flesh and bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had yet to refine the Reborn Pellet and the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus was used to safeguard one's life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, there was only one solution at the moment was to get back the lost bones. With Qing Shui's ability, he would be able to heal Qing Xiu to his original state. Therefore, after Qing Xiu was out of danger, Qing Shui spoke, "What happened?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge replied, "This was done by the Golden Yakshas. They said that since you killed a member of their Ye Clan, they'll lay their hands on yours. This is just the beginning."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui unknowingly clenched his fist. He didn't seek out the Golden Yakshas and yet they made the first move. The child from the Golden Yakshas was killed by Cong Yunlong. But no matter who was the one who had killed the child back then, since the Golden Yakshas dared to make a move on his child, they better be prepared to receive his fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Where are Xiu`er's two pieces of bone?" Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The Golden Yakshas has a very eerie physician. He said that these two pieces of Xiu`er's bones were very powerful and he inserted them into a member of the Ye Clan." Muyun Qingge said furiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Jiange, don't worry, Xiu`er will be fine. Come, let's return to the Sea King Palace first. They'll come again." Qing Shui held back his rage. It was useless no matter how furious he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We've already activated a formation in the Sea King Palace. There's no need to worry about its safety," Muyun Qingge looked at Qing Shui a little anxiously and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui settled things here and they left, with Beihuang Fan following along once again. Qing Shui didn't stop her either. Furthermore, quite a number of people from the Taiyi Immortal Palace and Divine Palace came along with him. When they heard that the Golden Yakshas had made a move on Qing Shui's child, they were all enraged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, Qing Shui had left behind the Nine-Headed Snake tribe in the North Sea. However, they were still a far cry from the Golden Yakshas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't let the people from the Divine Palace and the Taiyi Immortal Palace to join them, but with Beihuang Fan coming along, there was a representative from the Taiyi Immortal Palace. As for the Divine Palace, the Hill Moving Battle God, the Diamond Battle God, as well as Yin Tong, Lan Lingfeng and the others all wanted to come along.</span></p>

Qing Shui knew that there was no stopping them and thus he didn't attempt to do so. The group rushed over to the Sea King Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Father!" When Qing Xiu woke up and saw Qing Shui, he was very happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and pat him on the head. Most people who saw Qing Xiu would think that he was a girl, being too delicate and pretty. He had silky long hair and was so handsome that most people would feel moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Does it hurt?" Qing Shui appeared as if he was smiling, but he was actually aching inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It doesn't. I'm a man, this bit of pain isn't much," Qing Xiu smiled happily and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Father will avenge you. I'll take apart the bones of the people who dared to lay their hands on you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, an elderly man from the Nine-Headed Mystic Snakes came. When he saw Qing Shui, he appeared to feel very guilty, "I'm sorry, we let you down."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was a little angry, but he knew that they weren't to blame. After all, the ladies were slightly stronger than the Nine-Headed Mystic Snakes and given that the ladies couldn't even do anything, they wouldn't be able to do anything either. Therefore, he waved his hand, "You guys aren't to be blamed for this. Even if all of you were mobilized, you wouldn't be able to fend them off."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long later, Cong Yunlong's group came as well. They had brought along two people, one being a strange man and another being a child who was about the same age as Qing Xiu. Cong Yunlong said to Qing Shui, "Brother, my nephew's bones had been removed by this man. They’re now in this child."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The child's gaze was very cold. Although he was being held hostage right now, he didn't appear to be scared. It's as if this matter had nothing to do with him at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the man and noticed that both his legs suffered comminuted fractures. However, his arms and hands were intact. His face was also swollen, just like that of a pig's head.</span></p>
