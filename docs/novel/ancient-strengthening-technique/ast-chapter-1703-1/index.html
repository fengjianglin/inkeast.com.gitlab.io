Of course, she could be feeling scared as well. Moreover a lady who took great care of her own chastity wouldn't be able to take action immediately, even if she were to encounter a man that she liked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The humans in the world is made up of men and women. In life, the matter between men and women was indispensable to life. However, it didn't all revolve around it. This matter was a indispensable condiment of life. Of course, humans used this same method to engage in reproduction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui also knew why Qing Hanye had said that he was detestable in the past. Back then, while it was said that he couldn't be bothered with her, others could tell that he was avoiding her. To a lady with unrivalled beauty, moreover one who had taken the initiative, it was a huge blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Are you angry with me for what I had done in the past?" Qing Shui and Qing Hanye sat next to each other on the sofa, looking a lot calmer now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they hadn’t done anything too physical between each other, kissing and embracing can help to ease their feelings. They don't always just serve as to add fuel to the flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"If you were one of those frivolous men, there's no way that I'd have taken a liking to you." Qing Hanye smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You trust me so much? I might be a hypocrite, playing hard to get in order to get you one day." Qing Shui chuckled as he looked at this beautiful lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"If that's how it is, I'll accept it. How long were you going to keep it going? Are you sure that you'll be able to find me? You don't even know how to lie. Otherwise, you wouldn't have not tried to find me despite having been here for so many years." Qing Hanye sounded especially happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Ye'er!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui previously had also called her Ye`er when the old man was around, just like how the old man had done. However, it made them feel especially close when he addressed her in this way when there was just the two of them. Qing Hanye felt very warm inside. Other than her Master, there was now one more person that she cared for.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mmm!" Qing Hanye lifted her head and smiled charmingly as she looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You demoness. With a woman like you, my lifespan would be shortened by at least ten years." Qing Shui reached out his hand to pinch her upright nose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Are you regretting it?" Qing Hanye smiled. Such a "compliment" from a man was still very effective on women..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How could that be possible? I would gladly accept dying in the hands of a beautiful lady. I'd even be willing to have a hundred years taken from my lifespan, let alone ten years."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're not allowed to say such ominous things. I want you to be well." Qing Hanye rested her head on Qing Shui's shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't stay for very long. He still needed to return to Yiye Jiange. Moreover, he wanted to enjoy the blissful family life. Therefore, Qing Shui returned before it was dark.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was never too late to enjoy a good meal, and good things must be slowly appreciated. Qing Shui was not that anxious as there would still be plenty of chances in the future. Moreover, during this trip, he had gotten the Extreme Yang Righteous Pill.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also a surprising gain, an especially great one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought of fate. Usually things that are unexplainable can be described as fate. In fatalism, the encounters between people is all destined and there will always be the possibility of connections being formed between people, or between people and things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time Qing Shui returned to the Sunset Palace, it was already night time. Qing Shui had a new secret way of returning unnoticed. After the ninth layer of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was unlocked, the changes to the spirit energy caused Qing Shui to make an astonishing discovery. He could now use the Nine Continents Steps in the water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon entering Yiye Jiange's room, he noticed that she was alone. Yiye Jiange was now just like an ordinary person, and thus there was no need for the Sunset Palace Mistress or Muyun Qingge to be by her side all the time. However, both of them were also staying in this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Yiye Jiange saw that Qing Shui had returned, she broke into a happy smile. Although she hadn’t said it, but she was still a little worried when Qing Shui was headed to the Dragonwolf Palace. She was now at ease on seeing that Qing Shui had returned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're back!" Yiye Jiange carried their child and walked up to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The little kid had only just awakened right before Qing Shui got back. The child was still very young and would basically be sleeping throughout the day. In Qing Shui's previous life, children who were this young would rarely be carried due to their weak stature. However, the situation was different in this world, the outstanding genes here gave the child a very strong body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui hugged Yiye Jiange with the child between them. However, Yiye Jiange inhaled and said, "You have Qing Hanye's scent on you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's face turned red, "We didn't do anything."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only right after saying this that Qing Shui had realized that he had let the cat out of the bag. With that, It would be even harder for Yiye Jiange to believe him now. However, upon a second thought, he felt that there was a need for him to tell the others about the relationship between himself and Qing Hanye after all. Right now, was he lifting up a rock and getting ready to smash his own foot?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui's expression and could not hold back her smile, "What did you want to do?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled awkwardly. "Jiange, I've always felt that I'm a b*stard, failing to appreciate the happiness that I have. What would you do if you were in my position? Sometimes, I really feel at a loss and hate myself a lot."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange rested her forehead against Qing Shui's and said, "Qing Shui, you've given me a lot. Look at Xiu`er. This is our child. He has connected the two of us together."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui couldn't really understand what Yiye Jiange was trying to imply. He lowered his head and looked at the little kid’s pure eyes that were like crystals. The child looked a lot like Yiye Jiange and was beautiful, just like a girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, you don't have to act like this. We all understand. Moreover, I still decided to become husband and wife with you despite knowing that you have other women. I don't regret this. Even if I was to be given another chance, I would still make the same choice. We won't restrict you in anyway because we know that you're very important to all of us."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at Yiye Jiange in a daze. Qing Shui's beliefs from his previous life had been deeply rooted in him and it was hard for him to change them in such a short time. In his previous life, there were very few women who could say and do something like this. At the very least, there was no way for Qing Shui to have come in to contact with such women with his status in his previous life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm afraid that you guys would feel aggrieved." After so many years, Qing Shui's attitude in this area had improved a lot. However, he would still have such thoughts occasionally. It was the thoughts that had been left behind from his previous life and it might be something that may never disappear throughout his entire lifetime.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I know right now that I feel I'm the most blissful person in the world. You shouldn't say such things anymore in the future." Yiye Jiange rubbed Qing Shui's head, giving him a heartwarming feeling.</span></p>
