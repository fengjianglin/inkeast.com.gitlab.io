 <p><strong>AST 1281 - Barbarians, Expert Level Beast Blood Tribe, The Power of Faith?</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt weird when he saw this woman. He felt that she would definitely know about the situation in the other Three Continents and that she was a frequent visitor to those continents. This feeling was quite strange, yet quite distinct.</p>
 <p>The woman was shocked as well when she heard Qing Shui’s words. His words were quite unexpected because this little man wanted to go to the other Three Continents. However, she was more surprised than she was shocked.</p>
 <p>“I didn’t think you would improve this quick. What would you like to know? I will tell you provided that it’s within my knowledge,” said the woman as she flashed a smile at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“I want to know if you are able to defeat the Desolate Sect.” This thought appeared suddenly in Qing Shui’s mind, so he asked his question straightaway.</p>
 <p>The woman was clearly stunned by his inquiry but maintained a smile on her face as she looked at Qing Shui and said, “You already know about Desolate Sect’s intentions. But I think that pair of so-called ‘geniuses’ from the Desolate Sect cannot be compared to you.”</p>
 <p>The woman did not reply Qing Shui’s inquiry directly. That wasn’t strange at all as no one would typically reply to this sort of question with a direct answer.</p>
 <p>“I’d like to form an alliance with Putuo Mountain. What do you think about that?” Qing Shui decided to ask for the woman’s opinion.</p>
 <p>“Alliance, that’s good. Will you be the chief of the alliance or someone else?” The woman seemed happy at the thought of an alliance.</p>
 <p>“I wanted to be the chief initially but suddenly I noticed that there are others who are far more suitable than I am,” said Qing Shui as he turned his gaze to her. He was telling the truth and to be honest, he never had any sort of interest in being the leader. However, he could never find someone whom he could trust wholeheartedly based on first impressions. That was, until he was able to meet her.</p>
 <p>“You little kid, are you talking about me?!” the woman giggled.</p>
 <p>“Don’t call me ‘little kid’. I’m very big, you know,” Qing Shui replied with a serious expression.</p>
 <p>He didn’t realize that his words were quite ambiguous but when he saw the gleaming eyes of the woman, he felt electrocuted, as if a spark had traveled through his body in an instant.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, you’re quite big!” the woman replied with a serious expression as well.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was once again shocked by the woman’s behavior. He was, however, quite happy to hear those words. He felt quite accomplished, especially when a grown man like him received such praise.</p>
 <p>The woman’s words and expression caused Yu Ruyan to flush deep red. She was embarrassed to the point that she needed to lower her head so no one could see her face. Yu Ruyan knew quite well what those sizes meant as she had had the experience of being climaxed to ecstasy each time they did it….</p>
 <p>The woman looked at Qing Shui flirtatiously before turning her gaze to Yu Ruyan. Qing Shui followed the woman’s gaze and realized that she was looking at Yu Ruyan. At that moment, he blushed unconsciously. In the end, he could never turn away from this female rogue with goddess-like elegance….</p>
 <p>“I think you’re more suitable than me.”</p>
 <p>“Why do you think I’m more suitable than you?” The woman asked calmly as she sipped her tea while smiling at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“You have the ability to convince people, even though the words you speak are quite shocking,” said Qing Shui while curling a smile on his lips.</p>
 <p>“My master has never talked to anyone like that before. She’s just teasing you.” At that moment, Tantai Xuan spoke up and explained to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could feel that the woman was teasing, yet he still felt that this woman had the power to impact others.</p>
 <p>“I can form an alliance but I’m not interested in leading those people. I will agree to the alliance on one condition and that is for you to lead. Also, you cannot give orders to me,” said the woman as she blinked her beautiful eyes profusely.</p>
 <p>“Eh, you must supervise the alliance from behind the scenes!” Qing Shui pouted in return.</p>
 <p>There were many who had followed the state of affairs behind the scenes in the World of the Nine Continents. His words were quite easy to understand nonetheless.</p>
 <p>The woman was stunned when she heard Qing Shui’s words, yet she smiled at him and said, “This little kid has guts. He even wants take advantage of a woman like me. Do you want me to become your concubine?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shivered. This was the first time he felt that a beautiful woman like her could be as relentless as a tiger, especially one that could devour an entire man without even spitting out the bones. He quickly laughed it off and said, “How can I make you do that? This is asking too much of you. I think we should forget about it.”</p>
 <p>“You’ve thought too much. I would rather spend my whole life with a woman than with a man.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could feel his hair standing on end. He laughed it off without saying another word. Zhu Qing used to like women but that was over. It was still fine as she wasn’t quite involved in the relationship, which was why she was able to get over it. He wasn’t sure whether this woman was joking or not. But that didn’t matter anymore because he felt the urge to get out of there as soon as possible.</p>
 <p>“Then let me start again, senior. I was wondering about the situation of the other Three Continents. I’m quite curious about it. Can you divulge a bit more to me?” asked Qing Shui. The woman did allow him to ask some questions just now.</p>
 <p>“I knew you would ask about that. Actually, the other Three Continents have nothing special, only that they are bigger and wider than this area. They do have the ruins of the ancient battlefields and mysterious artifacts are said to be hidden in there, according to the legends. There are False God cultivators, as well as ancient demonic beasts - the pure ones. Also, there’s a real gigantic dragon. The Three Continents could be considered as the most extravagant continents among the Nine Continents. Of course, the number of normal people exceeds the number of cultivators. However, there exist powerful cultivators which no other continents have ever seen.” The woman seemed to describe the other Three Continents with great passion. As she continued to describe the situation of the other Three Continents, there was a slight loneliness and helplessness in her expression.</p>
 <p>Various thoughts wandered into Qing Shui’s mind. The lady in ancient chinese clothing riding on a green dragon whom he had telepathic communication with was from the other Three Continents, when he had asked of her origin. The Demon Lord Palace was also situated in the other Three Continents. The old turtle he met before was also an ancient demonic beast - the pure kind, of course.</p>
 <p>The ruins of ancient battlefields were rumored to contain divine pills, divine weapons and armor, as well as the blessed eggs of the ancient demonic beasts. The eggs were sealed when they were still in their adolescent stage….</p>
 <p>That would be a place of both opportunity and danger!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was looking forward to the Three Continents as he listened to the woman’s description. He would need to improve his powers before he decided to go there, of course.</p>
 <p>“Senior, do you know what kind of power the False God Realm holds?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t know. There are many levels in the False God Realm too. The disparity between each level is as wide as the natural chasm.” The woman shook her head in reply.</p>
 <p>“Then are there many False God cultivators in the other Three Continents?” Qing Shui continued to ask.</p>
 <p>“I’m not sure either. No one can imagine how expansive the other Three Continents are. Perhaps you will know it in the future. Just like the ground beneath your feet and the lonely grave of a dead person. There are limits to how much one can walk down a path and interact with what they can see with their eyes. Can you understand what I’m saying?” said the woman soft-spokenly.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, I can understand a bit. It’s different each time to achieve each level. No matter how good we are, there are always those who are better than ourselves. Even gods are not all invincible. We are just a drop in the ocean. It’s not easy for us to come together and become waves. Is this what you mean?” Qing Shui pondered for a while before he answered the woman.</p>
 <p>“More or less. But not exactly. Even though there are exceptional people out there, you can be that person. Even if you can’t shake the heavens when your power grows stronger, it is still possible for you to stir up a monstrous wave in the ocean,” the woman replied as she looked at Qing Shui with a smirk.</p>
 <p>“That is true. Senior, besides the Desolate Sect, are there other sects in that area?” Qing Shui had heard about other sects in that place but he also knew that those people were all dauntless and barbaric and they have strong natural-born talents. It was rumored that they had the blood of wild beasts flowing in their veins. According to the legend, the people from the Beast Blood Tribe in the Five Continents were a type of people. In this place, however, the people from the Beast Blood Tribe were stronger and more powerful.</p>
 <p>“There is. In comparison to them, they were said to be an area of scarce population. In contrast to that fact, they were also quite powerful. The further south you go, the stronger those people are but there is a limit to that power. It is said that one must pass through the vast Southern Sea in order to reach the other Three Continents.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had more or less acquired some simple knowledge about the Western Oxhe Continent. He could be said to have known more than he should have. However, the places he had been before were only a few, so naturally the forces he had met would be less than that. As his power grew, he would bypass a lot of low-leveled forces. He could be considered a man who had walked the higher places in life.</p>
 <p>Barbarians!</p>
 <p>The people in the Desolate Mountain Regions were also called barbarians. However, from what he could gather from the woman’s words, they were also the people of the Beast Blood Tribe but only more powerful than most Beast Blood Tribes. These people were considered slightly smarter than those in the Five Continents.</p>
 <p>“Oh right, the Desolate Sect has good relationships with those people,” the woman added.</p>
 <p>“How so?” Qing Shui asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“The pair of geniuses from the Desolate Sect have bloodlines of the Beast Blood Tribe. Their bloodlines are pure too,” the woman said as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“The bloodline of the Beast Blood Tribe? So they are mixed-blood!” muttered Qing Shui. He knew that even those from higher status still had similar features of an ordinary person.</p>
 <p>“Mixed-blood? Mm, you can say that!” The woman was surprised by his term but smiled nonetheless.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui was a bit embarrassed by his reply. The mixed bloods in the Beast Blood Tribes could cross-breed, especially in the World of the Nine Continents. The Beast Blood Tribe were barbarians - humans that hadn’t evolved. They were considered higher leveled beasts, yet unlike those of the Immortal Demons.</p>
 <p>“Most people will look down on barbarians and the Beast Blood Tribes, which is why they are considered enemies with one another.”</p>
 <p>“And now, the Desolate Sect and the Beast Blood Tribe may have worked together or perhaps they had already formed an alliance. Moreover, those geniuses may be able to create a miracle in the future because they possessed the appearance of those in the Beast Blood Tribe but the brains of an astute human. Even those of the Beast Blood Tribe would worship them. They already possess a sort of power of faith in their bodies, which can also be the reason why they will only become smarter. Their talents will grow stronger as well.” The woman explained slowly.</p>
 <p>“The power of faith?” Qing Shui was stunned.</p>
 <p>This type of profounding thing does exist. According to the legends, only those with astute minds would be able to possess such power. Qing Shui looked at the woman dumbfoundedly.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. The power of faith is actually hard to come by. Unless someone feels indebted to you and treats you like a deity, this is the only way you will be able to develop a shred of power of faith,” the woman explained.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt relieved. However, he still wasn’t able to understand it fully. Since he was able to come to this place, anything could be possible. Furthermore, the power of faith was too difficult to acquire, according to the woman.</p>
 <p>“The power of faith is nothing miraculous. This is not saying that you can become an invincible cultivator once you have the power of faith. Those with this power will be able to defeat their targets and achieve their objectives, allowing their power to expand exponentially and sometimes allowing them to lose interest in any battles. This power is quite a deterrent,” the woman continued.</p>
 <p>“As for a head of a sect or a king of a dynasty, will they be able to acquire the power of faith?” Qing Shui asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“Not exactly. A dynasty can provide their people with a good living, so naturally there will be power of faith. If it were the opposite, not only will there be absence of power of faith, the dynasty will receive the power of curses. By then, misfortunes will fall upon them.”</p>
 <p>“The power of curses?” Qing Shui felt a throb on his head.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be surprised. The power of faith and the power of curses aren’t that fantastic. This is more or less a type of miraculous constitution within a body. When one person is cursed by a massive horde of people, they will definitely be remembered. Naturally, they will gain hostilities from some people, which is why they are said to be burdened with misfortunes. On the other hand, there are many people with faith, which in turn will become some sort of aura. You will feel pressured when fighting against a person famed for their faith. Do you have a better understanding if I explain it like this?” The woman smiled as she explained.</p>
 <p>“I see. It’s nothing miraculous if you explain it like this. This I already know. If the power of curses cannot become the power of faith, then it is also known as the reward of the good and the evil.” Qing Shui chuckled while feeling at ease.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Also, all False God cultivators have strong power of faith.” The woman thought for a while before she replied Qing Shui.</p>
