 <p><strong>Chapter 208 Black Gem, The Class of a Beautiful Woman is like Alcohol.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 208 – Black Gem, The Class of a Beautiful Woman is like Alcohol</strong></p>
  <p>“Let’s go have a drink! I have a collection of some good alcohol!” The man said happily and ignored the woman’s rebuking gaze. </p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at the especially comforting and sweet harmony between this celestial couple. The beautiful and mature woman exuded a trace of tenderness and charm, giving her a feminine aura. She was extremely enchanting; she was the epitome of all mature women. The naturally sumptuous feeling that she emitted was something that youthful girls couldn’t compare to. </p>
  <p>Looking at Canghai’s manners and actions, Qing Shui guessed that he must have loved alcohol. In addition, he loved drinking good alcohol as much as he loved collecting them. From the situation, Canghai Mingyue’s mother didn’t seem to approve of Canghai’s drinking habits. The only thing that Qing Shui couldn’t understand was how normal it was for people to be against drinking in his past life. However, drinking in the land of the nine continents wasn’t harmful to one’s body. Moreover, alcohol was considered to be a kind of nourishment for the body. Besides, it was difficult, and maybe even impossible for regular alcohol to cause any damage to formidable men like them. </p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt that Canghai’s wife didn’t really nag him. This mild and gentle man seemed like the kind to respect woman. So far, Qing Shui didn’t see any obvious flaws in this man called Canghai Canghai. He was the most perfect man Qing Shui had seen so far. </p>
  <p>As they walked towards the comfortable building, Qing Shui looked at the child-like Canghai Mingyue walking in front of the celestial couple. Her adorable and loveable manner made Qing Shui suspect that there was something wrong with his eyes. His gaze always followed that splendid figure moving about a meter ahead of him. As he walked, he made small talk. Canghai Mingyue’s parents also didn’t forget Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-li. They occasionally turned their heads to check up on and even converse with them. </p>
  <p>Qing Shui wasn’t good at making small talk with others, but the Canghai couple were people who had a lot of experience. They were amiable and easy-going, making the others feel warm. Qing Shui lamented at how gorgeous their daughter was on the outside. She was truly their child from her looks because Qing Shui felt that another person couldn’t bear such an extremely beautiful daughter. </p>
  <p>Quickly, they entered the room. It was a drawing room with warm, comfortable, tender, and plain decorations! </p>
  <p>“Everyone can sit anywhere. Just treat this as your own house. We are very hospitable!” The man smiled and said amiably after he entered the room. </p>
  <p>“Take out that bottle of ‘Half Celestial’ from my study. It is rare that the little girl would bring friends over. I’m happy, very happy!” The man said ecstatically.</p>
  <p>For an unknown reason, the woman rolled her eyes at the man charmingly. That man really made everyone else envious. Qing Shui was even jealous of this man for a short moment. With a wife and a daughter like this, what more could he ask for?</p>
  <p>The woman smiled at Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-li, and then left. She probably went to get the so-called “Half Celestial!”</p>
  <p>“Daddy, who talks about their daughter like this? You make it sound like I don’t have any friends.” The little girl hugged the man’s arm and said delicately. </p>
  <p>Ever since he met the Canghai couple, Qing Shui had been lamenting about how this woman, Canghai Mingyue, was so shockingly attractive. Qing Shui felt his frail heart become stronger and stronger, but he still felt that her killing power was greater than her celestial outer appearance. </p>
  <p>It is said that women are beautiful because they are lovely. However, Qing Shui felt that once a beautiful woman started acting cute, she was even more powerful. Her beauty and charm could not be estimated. </p>
  <p>“I think there must be many people who envy and admire you!” Qing Shui said as he smiled and looked at this god-like man. </p>
  <p>“Humph, how?” Although the man sounded like he was asking a serious question, there was also an air of casualness to it. That mild and gentle tone with that magnetic voice made Qing Shui feel very pleasant while listening to him talk. He was definitely a real charmer; from what Qing Shui could see, this kind of man would be a perfect match with any woman.</p>
  <p>“Your daughter only has this lovely attitude when she is in front of you. If I didn’t see it with my own eyes, I would not believe that aloof and disdainful woman can be so loveable. There are an infinite number of men who would be jealous that you can enjoy such bliss.” Qing Shui chuckled and said towards the man and looked at Canghai Mingyue mischievously. </p>
  <p>After Qing Shui’s words, Canghai Mingyue’s face obviously flushed pink. That pair of deep eyes had a different kind of loveliness. Those “lovely” eyes glanced at Qing Shui suspiciously. The playfulness that only belonged to little women unexpectedly appeared on this celestial woman.</p>
  <p>“Haha, my daughter can really be lovely. Your words make it sound as if my daughter is formidable in public.” The man seemed to enjoy having a conversation about his daughter with Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“She is not really formidable. She is just too aloof; there are not a lot of men who can reach her. At least I have not discovered anyone who can. Of course, you won’t have a chance.” Qing Shui chuckled. Whether his words were complimenting or insulting Canghai Mingyue, even Qing Shui was not sure.</p>
  <p>“Haha, you really spoke to my heart. This girl’s standards are too high. I am really scared that she won’t be married.” The man smiled and said gently.</p>
  <p>“Daddy, why are you still talking?”</p>
  <p>The man looked at Canghai Mingyue dotingly and then looked at Qing Shui. He smiled and said. “Actually, when every daughter finds a man who she loves, the father would feel happy yet disappointed. Letting someone else take the little girl whom you have raised for thirty years would definitely not feel good.”</p>
  <p>“Daddy, who says things like that about their daughter?” Canghai MIngyue hugged one of her father’s arms and slighted pouted with her sexy red lips. She then glanced at Qing Shui angrily.</p>
  <p>However, Qing Shui just smiled and stared at Canghai Mingyue’s pair of deep, happy, angry, and a little bitter eyes. He found that at least for now, she was a lovely woman.</p>
  <p>Looking at the silent Huoyun Liu-li next to him, the man said happily, “Liu-li, your name is beautiful, but you are even more beautiful. After a little while, I will give you a welcome present. After all, you are my daughter’s disciple in name. I didn’t think that she would accept disciples with her level of skill. From now on, you should call me Elder Uncle at home. Your Elder Aunt and I will treat you as a daughter like Mingyue. She has been lonely ever since she was little, but she seems to be very happy with you. In the future, just make this your home like Mingyue.”</p>
  <p>“Hehe, Liu-li, call him godfather. As long as you call him your godfather, there won’t be many people who will bully you. I will let my daddy give you many gifts. To tell the truth, our master-disciple relationship didn’t exist for a long time now. It is just a name, so now is a good time to end it officially.” Canghai Mingyue said smilingly. </p>
  <p>From the look of Huoyun Liu-li’s lips, she hesitated for a long time before finally saying “godfather” happily. She wanted to bow, but she was quickly stopped with the explanation that girls didn’t need to do this. </p>
  <p>Qing Shui rubbed his head. A woman’s heart is always strange and unimaginable. However, the Canghai Mingyue at her house completely toppled the proud, aloof, disdainful, unapproachable, and emotionless goddess image in Qing Shui’s eyes. </p>
  <p>“Respected Elder, do I receive a gift? Look, you adopted a goddaughter. I should probably get a little of the good fortune from such a good event.”</p>
  <p>Just when Qing Shui finished speaking, the woman walked back gracefully with a jar of alcohol. She looked at Qing Shui and said with a smile, “We planned to give you our most precious thing, but we would have to see if you are qualified to receive that heart. We will support you.”</p>
  <p>The woman’s words stunned everyone besides the man. Qing Shui smiled forcefully. Wasn’t their most precious thing Canghai Mingyue? Could it mean that they would support me in my pursuit for their daughter?</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-li were both quick and intelligent, so they quickly caught on to the meaning of her words. Canghai Mingyue opened her mouth but didn’t say anything. She only ruthlessly glanced at Qing Shui timidly. However, the woman’s words stirred up Huoyun Liu-li’s heart. </p>
  <p>In Huoyun Liu-li’s heart, Canghai Mingyue was the best and most beautiful woman. She was perfect, and her kindness towards Liu-li could not be repaid. Huoyun Liu-li was willing to do anything for her, but she hadn’t had a chance to show her gratitude. She felt inferior to her master, the perfect woman, in every aspect. </p>
  <p>Now that she saw the two, whom she should call godfather and godmother, trying their best to play matchmaker for Master and Qing Shui, she felt that maybe Qing Shui could be a match for her in the future. Previously, she had felt more and more distant with Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>What could she do for her master? She still had a dream, but now she could only forget it and give it up. She needed to give up this man whom she needed to let go even before she started having any kind of relationship with him. </p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue saw Huoyun Liu-li’s daydreamy expression and already guessed some of her thoughts. She walked over, sat down next to her, and pinched Huoyun Liu-li’s cheeks. The scene even made Qing Shui envious. He wanted to try it himself; the feeling must have been great.</p>
  <p>“You silly girl, I really am fond of you. I am uninterested in that animal; I have no interest in him at all. Your treasure is only a treasure to you. Do you understand now, little girl?”</p>
  <p>“Cough cough!” Qing Shui almost fell off his chair in one breath.</p>
  <p>The Canghai couple also smiled awkwardly. Running into these kinds of things was especially awkward. In addition, being in front of those who were younger than them also made them feel even more embarrassed. </p>
  <p>“Come, this is my treasured ‘Half Celestial.’ I had been reluctant to drink it before, but I am happy today because I accepted a goddaughter. Let’s all taste this.”</p>
  <p>The man now saw that his new goddaughter liked this kid. This time, he really screwed up. It seemed as if he treated his goddaughter differently. </p>
  <p>“Little girl, this is a gift for you from your godmother. I will give you a bigger gift later.” The woman took off her necklace. There was a large black gem hanging on it which exuded a faint magical halo.</p>
  <p>“Black gem.” Qing Shui looked at this gem which was obviously much higher in grade than the moonstone on his neck. The luster that it exuded and its glossy surface was obviously different.</p>
  <p>Could this be the difference between grades?</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue grabbed Huoyun Liu-li, who kept refusing the gift, and forced her to put it on. “Why won’t you accept your godmother’s gift? This is a third-grade black gem pendant. It could probably double your speed.”</p>
  <p>Hearing Canghai Mingyue’s words, Qing Shui was sure that the world of the nine continents had these magical gem. The halo that it exuded could enhance a person’s statistics. Qing Shui felt its effects when he wore the moonstone. </p>
  <p>Third-grade black gem could double speed. Things that had multipliers on a person’s base statistics were always good stuff. It seemed that these gems all had rare substances, were difficult to produce like this black gem pendant, or even required some magical process. </p>
  <p>After Huoyun Liu-li wore this black gem pendant, that charming and lovely face had an additional feeling of mysteriousness, which added to her attractiveness.</p>
  <p>“No wonder the women in the restricted movies in my previous life wore necklaces, belts, bracelets, rings, earrings, and etc. Even if they were not wearing anything, those accessories could be seen.”</p>
  <p>A woman’s beauty relied on class. Class was like alcohol: the longer you ferment it, the more flavorful it is. Flower vase women were like blooming flowers. They were beautiful yet ephemeral!</p>

There are an infinite number of men who would be jealous that you can enjoy such bliss.” Qing Shui chuckled and said towards the man and looked at Canghai Mingyue mischievously. </p>
 <p>After Qing Shui’s words, Canghai Mingyue’s face obviously flushed pink. That pair of deep eyes had a different kind of loveliness. Those “lovely” eyes glanced at Qing Shui suspiciously. The playfulness that only belonged to little women unexpectedly appeared on this celestial woman.</p>
 <p>“Haha, my daughter can really be lovely. Your words make it sound as if my daughter is formidable in public.” The man seemed to enjoy having a conversation about his daughter with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“She is not really formidable. She is just too aloof; there are not a lot of men who can reach her. At least I have not discovered anyone who can. Of course, you won’t have a chance.” Qing Shui chuckled. Whether his words were complimenting or insulting Canghai Mingyue, even Qing Shui was not sure.</p>
 <p>“Haha, you really spoke to my heart. This girl’s standards are too high. I am really scared that she won’t be married.” The man smiled and said gently.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, why are you still talking?”</p>
 <p>The man looked at Canghai Mingyue dotingly and then looked at Qing Shui. He smiled and said. “Actually, when every daughter finds a man who she loves, the father would feel happy yet disappointed. Letting someone else take the little girl whom you have raised for thirty years would definitely not feel good.”</p>
 <p>“Daddy, who says things like that about their daughter?” Canghai MIngyue hugged one of her father’s arms and slighted pouted with her sexy red lips. She then glanced at Qing Shui angrily.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui just smiled and stared at Canghai Mingyue’s pair of deep, happy, angry, and a little bitter eyes. He found that at least for now, she was a lovely woman.</p>
 <p>Looking at the silent Huoyun Liu-li next to him, the man said happily, “Liu-li, your name is beautiful, but you are even more beautiful. After a little while, I will give you a welcome present. After all, you are my daughter’s disciple in name. I didn’t think that she would accept disciples with her level of skill. From now on, you should call me Elder Uncle at home. Your Elder Aunt and I will treat you as a daughter like Mingyue. She has been lonely ever since she was little, but she seems to be very happy with you. In the future, just make this your home like Mingyue.”</p>
 <p>“Hehe, Liu-li, call him godfather. As long as you call him your godfather, there won’t be many people who will bully you. I will let my daddy give you many gifts. To tell the truth, our master-disciple relationship didn’t exist for a long time now. It is just a name, so now is a good time to end it officially.” Canghai Mingyue said smilingly. </p>
 <p>From the look of Huoyun Liu-li’s lips, she hesitated for a long time before finally saying “godfather” happily. She wanted to bow, but she was quickly stopped with the explanation that girls didn’t need to do this. </p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his head. A woman’s heart is always strange and unimaginable. However, the Canghai Mingyue at her house completely toppled the proud, aloof, disdainful, unapproachable, and emotionless goddess image in Qing Shui’s eyes. </p>
 <p>“Respected Elder, do I receive a gift? Look, you adopted a goddaughter. I should probably get a little of the good fortune from such a good event.”</p>
 <p>Just when Qing Shui finished speaking, the woman walked back gracefully with a jar of alcohol. She looked at Qing Shui and said with a smile, “We planned to give you our most precious thing, but we would have to see if you are qualified to receive that heart. We will support you.”</p>
 <p>The woman’s words stunned everyone besides the man. Qing Shui smiled forcefully. Wasn’t their most precious thing Canghai Mingyue? Could it mean that they would support me in my pursuit for their daughter?</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-li were both quick and intelligent, so they quickly caught on to the meaning of her words. Canghai Mingyue opened her mouth but didn’t say anything. She only ruthlessly glanced at Qing Shui timidly. However, the woman’s words stirred up Huoyun Liu-li’s heart. </p>
 <p>In Huoyun Liu-li’s heart, Canghai Mingyue was the best and most beautiful woman. She was perfect, and her kindness towards Liu-li could not be repaid. Huoyun Liu-li was willing to do anything for her, but she hadn’t had a chance to show her gratitude. She felt inferior to her master, the perfect woman, in every aspect. </p>
 <p>Now that she saw the two, whom she should call godfather and godmother, trying their best to play matchmaker for Master and Qing Shui, she felt that maybe Qing Shui could be a match for her in the future. Previously, she had felt more and more distant with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>What could she do for her master? She still had a dream, but now she could only forget it and give it up. She needed to give up this man whom she needed to let go even before she started having any kind of relationship with him. </p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue saw Huoyun Liu-li’s daydreamy expression and already guessed some of her thoughts. She walked over, sat down next to her, and pinched Huoyun Liu-li’s cheeks. The scene even made Qing Shui envious. He wanted to try it himself; the feeling must have been great.</p>
 <p>“You silly girl, I really am fond of you. I am uninterested in that animal; I have no interest in him at all. Your treasure is only a treasure to you. Do you understand now, little girl?”</p>
 <p>“Cough cough!” Qing Shui almost fell off his chair in one breath.</p>
 <p>The Canghai couple also smiled awkwardly. Running into these kinds of things was especially awkward. In addition, being in front of those who were younger than them also made them feel even more embarrassed. </p>
 <p>“Come, this is my treasured ‘Half Celestial.’ I had been reluctant to drink it before, but I am happy today because I accepted a goddaughter. Let’s all taste this.”</p>
 <p>The man now saw that his new goddaughter liked this kid. This time, he really screwed up. It seemed as if he treated his goddaughter differently. </p>
 <p>“Little girl, this is a gift for you from your godmother. I will give you a bigger gift later.” The woman took off her necklace. There was a large black gem hanging on it which exuded a faint magical halo.</p>
 <p>“Black gem.” Qing Shui looked at this gem which was obviously much higher in grade than the moonstone on his neck. The luster that it exuded and its glossy surface was obviously different.</p>
 <p>Could this be the difference between grades?</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue grabbed Huoyun Liu-li, who kept refusing the gift, and forced her to put it on. “Why won’t you accept your godmother’s gift? This is a third-grade black gem pendant. It could probably double your speed.”</p>
 <p>Hearing Canghai Mingyue’s words, Qing Shui was sure that the world of the nine continents had these magical gem. The halo that it exuded could enhance a person’s statistics. Qing Shui felt its effects when he wore the moonstone. </p>
 <p>Third-grade black gem could double speed. Things that had multipliers on a person’s base statistics were always good stuff. It seemed that these gems all had rare substances, were difficult to produce like this black gem pendant, or even required some magical process. </p>
 <p>After Huoyun Liu-li wore this black gem pendant, that charming and lovely face had an additional feeling of mysteriousness, which added to her attractiveness.</p>
 <p>“No wonder the women in the restricted movies in my previous life wore necklaces, belts, bracelets, rings, earrings, and etc. Even if they were not wearing anything, those accessories could be seen.”</p>
 <p>A woman’s beauty relied on class. Class was like alcohol: the longer you ferment it, the more flavorful it is. Flower vase women were like blooming flowers. They were beautiful yet ephemeral!</p>
