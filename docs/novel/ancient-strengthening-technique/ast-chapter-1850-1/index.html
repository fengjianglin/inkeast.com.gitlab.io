 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All twelve of the Portraits of Beauty were now in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Also, he just found out the Art Maestro was still alive. How strong was he currently? Was he in any way related to the Qing Clan? How long could he live? What’s the limit of a human?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Also, the secrets behind all twelve of the Portraits of Beauty….. Could they represent the twelve Heavenly Meridians? What abilities would he gain once he connected all twelve of the Heavenly Meridians? Initially, he thought that the twelfth Portraits of Beauty would be very difficult to find, which was also perfectly normal. He would never have thought that he would manage to find all of them within this thirty years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When it’s about time, Qing Shui immediately appeared within the realm and hung the portrait of the Vampiric Empress above the Magnificent Mountains and Rivers screen. All twelve of the Portraits of Beauty were hung side by side in an orderly manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A light which words couldn’t describe seemingly emerged from those portraits and began to swallow everything in the surrounding. Qing Shui was also covered in it. It felt like a dream, as an unimaginable kind of strength emerged within his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It felt like the Nine Yang Force, but at the same time, also like the Nine Yang Force of Dragon Soul. This strength was very unusual. It felt like a dry land just encountered rainwaters. Qing Shui’s body was absorbing it at a crazy pace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was ultimately a comfortable feeling. It felt very peaceful and at the same time also very harmonious. All in all, The energy was slowly nurturing Qing Shui’s body. His bones, meridians, bloodlines, and even organs were all absorbing the energy at a mad pace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though the strength might seem very little, it was continuously flowing into his body. It felt very comfortable and also looked very good. As to whether it was useful or not, this would depend on other factors, for example, time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, with Qing Shui in this current state, there was no doubt that he would get huge benefits from it. However, it would still take time. If the time given was short, then the benefits he could gain would be limited. But given enough time, he could potentially get a lot stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Qing Shui was standing there, a layer of faint light could be seen circulating around him. It wasn’t golden light, instead, it was rainbow-colored. It looked like a ring of light and also dense like a fog at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time Qing Shui came to his senses, three days had passed. He could already figure out his current state without feeling it. Three days was a long time, at least from Qing Shui’s perspective. After all, it was the first time he encountered such a phenomenon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He tried to sense his strength only to find that it hadn’t increased that significantly. It increased from the original 400.000 Dao Force to the current 500.000 Dao Force. His raw strength managed to achieve 1.5 million Sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Judging by the phenomenon which he just went through, the amount of strength which he attained could not be considered as a significant increase. However, Qing Shui managed to find out about another huge benefit. His strength has become even more concrete than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was like applying the same force to an iron staff and an embroidery needle respectively. Its penetrating force and damaging prowess were two completely different concepts. The gap in strength was too large.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was just an assumption, not a way of comparing damaging prowess and force. It’s comparing their sharpness. By applying the same force to an iron staff instead of an embroidery needle, the strength could be significantly stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This kind of strength was similar to a critical hit. But it wasn’t something which an ordinary critical hit could compare to. It was an increase of destructive power. For the same ten Jin Force, Qing Shui could unleash it at a hundred Jin and caused considerable damage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s strength has risen up by 100.000 Dao Force, but his actual destructive power increased multiple times. This kind of force didn’t just help to strengthen his offensive prowess. It also significantly improved the toughness of his body. He could now resist against devastating attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To think that Qing Shui could receive such heaven-defying benefits by merely looking at all twelve of the Portraits of Beauty……. This could be one of the secrets from the Portraits of Beauty… He only needed to find out about what exactly this energy was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui kept having the feeling that he should give it a name…. Since this energy originated from the Portraits of Beauty, should it be named as the Goddess Force? This sounded a bit weird…..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought about it for half a day, yet he was still unable to come up with any good names. Hence, he settled with the Goddess Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui practiced his Taichi Fist while he was in the realm. Now, the feeling of Taichi Fist once again went through another change. Prior to this, it used to be formless and had no concept in it. But now, a bit of concept seemed to have been added into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Qing Shui suddenly remembered the realms that were explained back then. Whether the mountain was a mountain, a mountain wasn’t a mountain, a mountain would still be a mountain. These three respective realms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, he has already understood many things. Strength and realms were two existences which could never be separated from each other. Only when a person achieved a certain amount of strength, could they attain a new and higher leveled realm. Without strength, one could never accomplish anything in the realm they were at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui casually swayed his arms. In between his movements, his rhythms resembled that of fairies. His movement consisted of a combination of hardness and gentleness. And unlike any combination that was performed, his movement was at a much higher level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the next day, Qing Shui woke up quite early. When he entered the room outside, the Vampiric Empress was already awake. She was breastfeeding the baby. Qing Shui happened to see it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They are so huge and white!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled as he sat down in front of her. He was looking at the two snow white breasts without blinking. They looked graceful and elegant while also plumped and upright. A mild fragrance was also spreading out across the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Vampiric Empress also never expected for Qing Shui to turn up right away. No matter what relationship the two shared with each other, there was no need for them to avoid each other when she breastfed the baby. She just never expected Qing Shui to say it so straightforwardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are a bastard.” The Vampiric Empress said in a grumpy tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right now, I am a bit envious of her……” Qing Shui’s face was very thick. He wasn’t concerned about anything when he was saying it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Vampiric Empress knew exactly what Qing Shui meant. She blushed and kicked Qing Shui. Coincidentally, Qing Shui happened to be sitting right next to her leg. She was leaning against the couch while breastfeeding her baby.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t try to avoid it. He extended his arm and grabbed on her bright foot. It felt cool and smooth, like a silk fabric and a jade stone. He felt very comfortable grabbing it. The Vampiric Empress whose leg was grabbed by Qing Shui trembled, “Qing Shui, I won’t kick you anymore. Please let me go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled. This woman’s personality didn’t allow her to give in to anyone. To think that she would actually surrender to him now… But he could already figure out the reason for it. Her legs should be her sensitive spot. This could be the reason why she didn’t put on her shoes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me help you massage your legs!” Qing Shui smiled as he started to massage her legs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a while, Qing Shui could already hear soft moaning noises coming out of the Vampiric Empress mouth. It was very elegant and attractive. Eventually, the moaning noise could be heard very loudly.</span></p>
