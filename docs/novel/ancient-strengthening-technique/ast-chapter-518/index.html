 <p><strong>Chapter 518 Half the Lifespan of An Ordinary Person, No More Rivals Amongst Those at the Martial Saint Level and Below.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 518 - Half the Lifespan of An Ordinary Person, No More Rivals Amongst Those at the Martial Saint Level and Below</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hearing that tiger's roar, the few ladies were all stunned. Huoyun Liu-Li, Qingqing and Canghai Mingyue all looked towards Di Chen. She was the strongest amongst them all.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue looked toward Di Chen, "Elder sister Chen..."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Chen smiled and nodded!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue's eyes turned moist, "It's been two and a half years..."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"This is really great..." Qingqing could not hold back her joy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui roared out, he subconsciously looked at his internal body. Earlier, he was not done looking through everything before he was interrupted by the sudden breakthrough of his Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, Qing Shui saw his heart and felt into a daze. Other than his heart, all of his other internal organs had not only completely recovered, but they had even become stronger than before. However, only his heart did not undergo any change.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, one thing that Qing Shui could sense was that it no longer deteriorated.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui frowned again. This was the most important organ. If it could not be healed, the results would be inconceivable. Thankfully, the deterioration was stopped and he could now use his Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique again. His acupuncture and alchemy should be able to heal it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui used his Spiritual Sense and slowly sensed his body's condition!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took another look at that beaten heart which was tied down by some mysterious energy, causing it to not be destroyed completely. Qing Shui knew that it was not the powers of the ‘Stone of Life,’ since it was already shattered earlier.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stomped down!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His body had the strength of five countries and with his Mighty Elephant Stomp at the large success stage, he could unleash a stomp five times his strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A strength of 25 countries caused this small valley to be turned into a piece of flat land!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A tremendous sound rang out and mixed in with the shattered rocks and dust that flew everywhere.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui left. He knew that with his current condition, with his heart in this state, he had only the lifespan of an ordinary person.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He could probably only live to the age of 80 years old!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui was not worried. A lifespan of 80 years was plenty. Moreover, Qing Shui felt that he should be able to find a solution to this in such a long period of time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Thinking of this, he felt completely relaxed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In two and a half years, the pain he had gone through was one that was unheard of. Qing Shui headed straight for the Qing Village with his Cloudmist Steps, deep in thought.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Haha, my powers had increased by a lot, but to think that my speed had also increased by many folds..."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt elated. His life had been snatched back from the Heavens and he had changed his life by defying fate. Since he had succeeded this time around, it just meant that his life should not have been stopped here.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">One who survives a great disaster is destined to have good fortune!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Happiness is something one fights for himself. Now, Qing Shui's mental state underwent another change. It might be because his abilities had progressed greatly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Shui could be said to be said to be at the top amongst those in the Martial Saint level. In this group, there would be almost none who could defeat him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">No rivals amongst those at the Martial Saint level and below!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">What Qing Shui did not understand was that his Ancient Strengthening Technique had actually broken through to the 199th cycle directly. With a flash, Qing Shui recalled the Ancient Book of ‘Rebirth.’</p>
  <p dir="ltr">During this period of time, Qing Shui's inner potential had been stimulated, bringing him the strongest powers from deep down within his body. The ‘Qi of Life’ that exploded was the most mysterious thing in the human body. It was also the strongest vital energy stored in Qing Shui during this period of time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">During his recovery, qi of life had been immersed with the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique and brought him a series of breakthroughs. These were all the powerful effects of the Ancient Book of ‘Rebirth.’</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The human body was the strangest thing in the world. To be able to produce tremendous strength and be connected with all things in the world...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The pain he had gone through for the past two and half years was worth it. If he had not gone through this accident, Qing Shui estimated that he would still be able to reach the 199th cycle by now.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, he would not have been able to attain the powers he now had. The Ancient Book of ‘Rebirth’ stimulated the potential from the deepest part of the human body, and could increase Qing Shui's strength by another fold.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Two times!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">How terrifying was this concept? But who would be able to persist in training the Ancient Book of ‘Rebirth?’ And it must also be when one was at the lowest point of their life.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everything required too many coincidences. The pain, persistence, and determination... It was hard to be able to get even one of these three requirements. Let alone the fact that they must reach terrifying limits. Take determination, for example, Qing Shui could repeatedly practice his sword thrusts alone for millions of times.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">And he still had many things he could not let go off in this world...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The cultivation of the Ancient Book of ‘Rebirth’ was heaven-defying. To Qing Shui, it was even stronger than the Heavenly Pellet.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui felt that there must still be some other use to the Heavenly Pellet...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He could finally stand upright with confidence now. A cold gleam flashed across his eyes. “Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord... One day, I'll make you regret this... I'll definitely return that palm…’</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even the weakest grade one Martial Saint had a strength of at least 10 countries or more. There were also some who had 20 countries worth of strength when they just arrived at the Martial Saint level. Qing Shui was not sure how strong a grade one Martial Saint could be.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If Qing Shui were to rely on only his body now, without any external items, &nbsp;his strength could reach 13 countries.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui realized that he was too reliant on external items. The Golden-Ringed Battle Armor, Big Dipper Sword, Violet Gold Divine Shield, the Heavenly Talisman...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If he was holding only a Big Dipper Sword, his strength could reach 15.5 countries.The Big Dipper Sword's Seven Star Armored Vest could increase his defenses by two folds and reach 14 countries...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just with the Big Dipper Sword alone, he could make a path in his world in the Greencloud Continent...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was better to have those things than be without them. Each martial arts practitioner would more or less have such items. Weapons and armors were considered one of them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's speed was very fast. With a flash, he appeared 30 meters away. An afterimage flashed passed and Qing Shui used his strong Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique without a care.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When he entered Qing Village, Qing Shui saw some familiar faces at the entrance!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, Qing Shui, they said that you've healed. Let mother take a look..." Qing Yi held onto Qing Shui as tears fell down uncontrollably.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Back when Qing Shui was in stuck in his previous situation, she did not say much. She only kept on comforting Qing Shui that it was alright even if he had no cultivation. However, she would secretly cry to herself.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She did not wish to appear sad before Qing Shui for fear of giving him pressure.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now that Qing Shui has recovered, she finally had no more need to hold it in. Although she still felt a bit of grief, she was mostly overjoyed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Mother, your son is alright now. Why are you crying?" Qing Shui reached out his hand to wipe the tears off his mother's face.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qingqing smiled as she looked at Qing Shui from the side. However, crystal-like tears were brimming in her eyes, making one's heart ache...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was Qing Clan's pillar of support. If he were to fall, the whole Qing Clan would not have many developments. However, with just Xiantian cultivators, they would still be able to have a good life in the Hundred Miles City for over a hundred years, or even hundreds of years, provided that there were no accidents.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Alright, alright, today is a happy day. Since there are no outsiders here, everyone should be happy! Let's go back and have a celebration!" Qing Luo said to the others happily.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Old Master had spoken, so everyone broke out laughing, especially those from the Qing Clan's 3rd generation. Everyone was in smiles.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"It's great that Brother Qing has now recovered. You promised to get me a wife who's at least at the Xiantian level." Qing You grinned and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Xiantian? Aren't you afraid of being ridden and hit by her everyday?" Qing Shi could not help but teased.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His words caused Mingyue Gelou and Qingzhuang to blush. To be ridden and hit...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Thank goodness that no one had noticed them, and the two ladies also tilted their heads slightly downwards.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"It's not hard to find one. But that is if you do not have any expectations for her looks. It's important to look for a wife with great virtue..." Qing Shui said seriously to Qing You.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Stop, stop. Brother Qing Shui, I'd rather marry a beautiful Xiantian cultivator. Even if she were to rid on me and hit me every day..."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"You good for nothing rascal!" Qing Luo smacked Qing You's head.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The others all laughed and entered the Qing Clan together!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Clan was undoubtedly the top clan in Hundred Miles City, even the whole Qing Village had been brought to greater heights together. In the past, when people from the Hundred Miles City passed by Qing Village to hunt in the Qing Village, there would always be some conflicts. During these times, people from the Qing Village would always have to put up with it after seeing that they were from the Hundred Miles City.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Village's land was not small. Moreover, including the people from the town not far away, there were hundreds of thousands people in this generation. They were collectively known as the Qing Village.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now, when people from the Qing Village went to the Hundred Miles City, they could all proudly say that they were from Qing Village. When people from the Hundred Miles City passed by the Qing Village, they longer acted the same as before. They no longer sped by them, shouting and calling them to get out of the way when they saw anyone.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everything was because of Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was not only the pillar for Qing Village, but also the pillar of the Hundred Miles City. Therefore, even the people from the Hundred Miles City would need to give great respect to Qing Shui's hometown, Qing Village.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The family of 30 plus put tables together to sit down together.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The meal was very lively, and they kept firing Qing Shui with questions!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Brother Shui, let me have a ride on that golden elephant of yours!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Earlier, she was not in the mood for it, but now that Qing Shui was better, she was naturally in the mood now.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"That's easy. We'll go in a while!" Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the second new year.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, what are your plans now?" Seeing that everyone had finished their dinner, Qing Luo held onto a cup of tea and asked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I'll stay here for now, and get some things done." Qing Shui thought that he should raise the level of the people in Qing Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Especially the Xiantian Golden Pellet for his mother and grandfather. Qing Shui planned to refine them as soon as possible! He also wanted to take this opportunity to look out for some precious ingredients.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li was seated on one side next to Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">And on the other side was Qing Yi, followed by Qingqing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">On the other side with Huoyun Liu-Li was Canghai Mingyue, Qingzhuang, Mingyue Gelou, Little Yuchang, Qing Bei...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Chen had returned to her room. With her present, the others were not able to be at ease. Therefore, she would choose to avoid such situations. Moreover, it was not convenient for her since she was wearing a face veil.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The others did not think much about it either. Toward her, everyone was filled with gratitude...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li grabbed onto Qing Shui's hand quietly, her shrewd and beautiful eyes occasionally glanced towards Qing Shui, causing him to think about what she said the other time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I don’t care. This year, Qing Shui, you have to be mine…"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"She did not force herself on me..."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now that Qing Shui has recovered, he would naturally not let her go. Otherwise, it would be harming her. For a proud lady like her to say such words, it was because she was deeply in love with him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It required a lot of courage!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui grabbed onto her hand tightly...</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui frowned again. This was the most important organ. If it could not be healed, the results would be inconceivable. Thankfully, the deterioration was stopped and he could now use his Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique again. His acupuncture and alchemy should be able to heal it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui used his Spiritual Sense and slowly sensed his body's condition!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took another look at that beaten heart which was tied down by some mysterious energy, causing it to not be destroyed completely. Qing Shui knew that it was not the powers of the ‘Stone of Life,’ since it was already shattered earlier.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stomped down!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His body had the strength of five countries and with his Mighty Elephant Stomp at the large success stage, he could unleash a stomp five times his strength.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A strength of 25 countries caused this small valley to be turned into a piece of flat land!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A tremendous sound rang out and mixed in with the shattered rocks and dust that flew everywhere.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui left. He knew that with his current condition, with his heart in this state, he had only the lifespan of an ordinary person.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He could probably only live to the age of 80 years old!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui was not worried. A lifespan of 80 years was plenty. Moreover, Qing Shui felt that he should be able to find a solution to this in such a long period of time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Thinking of this, he felt completely relaxed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In two and a half years, the pain he had gone through was one that was unheard of. Qing Shui headed straight for the Qing Village with his Cloudmist Steps, deep in thought.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Haha, my powers had increased by a lot, but to think that my speed had also increased by many folds..."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt elated. His life had been snatched back from the Heavens and he had changed his life by defying fate. Since he had succeeded this time around, it just meant that his life should not have been stopped here.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">One who survives a great disaster is destined to have good fortune!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Happiness is something one fights for himself. Now, Qing Shui's mental state underwent another change. It might be because his abilities had progressed greatly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Shui could be said to be said to be at the top amongst those in the Martial Saint level. In this group, there would be almost none who could defeat him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">No rivals amongst those at the Martial Saint level and below!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">What Qing Shui did not understand was that his Ancient Strengthening Technique had actually broken through to the 199th cycle directly. With a flash, Qing Shui recalled the Ancient Book of ‘Rebirth.’</p>
 <p dir="ltr">During this period of time, Qing Shui's inner potential had been stimulated, bringing him the strongest powers from deep down within his body. The ‘Qi of Life’ that exploded was the most mysterious thing in the human body. It was also the strongest vital energy stored in Qing Shui during this period of time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">During his recovery, qi of life had been immersed with the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique and brought him a series of breakthroughs. These were all the powerful effects of the Ancient Book of ‘Rebirth.’</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The human body was the strangest thing in the world. To be able to produce tremendous strength and be connected with all things in the world...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The pain he had gone through for the past two and half years was worth it. If he had not gone through this accident, Qing Shui estimated that he would still be able to reach the 199th cycle by now.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, he would not have been able to attain the powers he now had. The Ancient Book of ‘Rebirth’ stimulated the potential from the deepest part of the human body, and could increase Qing Shui's strength by another fold.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Two times!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">How terrifying was this concept? But who would be able to persist in training the Ancient Book of ‘Rebirth?’ And it must also be when one was at the lowest point of their life.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everything required too many coincidences. The pain, persistence, and determination... It was hard to be able to get even one of these three requirements. Let alone the fact that they must reach terrifying limits. Take determination, for example, Qing Shui could repeatedly practice his sword thrusts alone for millions of times.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">And he still had many things he could not let go off in this world...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The cultivation of the Ancient Book of ‘Rebirth’ was heaven-defying. To Qing Shui, it was even stronger than the Heavenly Pellet.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui felt that there must still be some other use to the Heavenly Pellet...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He could finally stand upright with confidence now. A cold gleam flashed across his eyes. “Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord... One day, I'll make you regret this... I'll definitely return that palm…’</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even the weakest grade one Martial Saint had a strength of at least 10 countries or more. There were also some who had 20 countries worth of strength when they just arrived at the Martial Saint level. Qing Shui was not sure how strong a grade one Martial Saint could be.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If Qing Shui were to rely on only his body now, without any external items, &nbsp;his strength could reach 13 countries.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui realized that he was too reliant on external items. The Golden-Ringed Battle Armor, Big Dipper Sword, Violet Gold Divine Shield, the Heavenly Talisman...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If he was holding only a Big Dipper Sword, his strength could reach 15.5 countries.The Big Dipper Sword's Seven Star Armored Vest could increase his defenses by two folds and reach 14 countries...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just with the Big Dipper Sword alone, he could make a path in his world in the Greencloud Continent...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was better to have those things than be without them. Each martial arts practitioner would more or less have such items. Weapons and armors were considered one of them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's speed was very fast. With a flash, he appeared 30 meters away. An afterimage flashed passed and Qing Shui used his strong Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique without a care.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When he entered Qing Village, Qing Shui saw some familiar faces at the entrance!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, Qing Shui, they said that you've healed. Let mother take a look..." Qing Yi held onto Qing Shui as tears fell down uncontrollably.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Back when Qing Shui was in stuck in his previous situation, she did not say much. She only kept on comforting Qing Shui that it was alright even if he had no cultivation. However, she would secretly cry to herself.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She did not wish to appear sad before Qing Shui for fear of giving him pressure.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now that Qing Shui has recovered, she finally had no more need to hold it in. Although she still felt a bit of grief, she was mostly overjoyed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Mother, your son is alright now. Why are you crying?" Qing Shui reached out his hand to wipe the tears off his mother's face.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qingqing smiled as she looked at Qing Shui from the side. However, crystal-like tears were brimming in her eyes, making one's heart ache...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was Qing Clan's pillar of support. If he were to fall, the whole Qing Clan would not have many developments. However, with just Xiantian cultivators, they would still be able to have a good life in the Hundred Miles City for over a hundred years, or even hundreds of years, provided that there were no accidents.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Alright, alright, today is a happy day. Since there are no outsiders here, everyone should be happy! Let's go back and have a celebration!" Qing Luo said to the others happily.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Old Master had spoken, so everyone broke out laughing, especially those from the Qing Clan's 3rd generation. Everyone was in smiles.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"It's great that Brother Qing has now recovered. You promised to get me a wife who's at least at the Xiantian level." Qing You grinned and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Xiantian? Aren't you afraid of being ridden and hit by her everyday?" Qing Shi could not help but teased.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His words caused Mingyue Gelou and Qingzhuang to blush. To be ridden and hit...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Thank goodness that no one had noticed them, and the two ladies also tilted their heads slightly downwards.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"It's not hard to find one. But that is if you do not have any expectations for her looks. It's important to look for a wife with great virtue..." Qing Shui said seriously to Qing You.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Stop, stop. Brother Qing Shui, I'd rather marry a beautiful Xiantian cultivator. Even if she were to rid on me and hit me every day..."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"You good for nothing rascal!" Qing Luo smacked Qing You's head.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The others all laughed and entered the Qing Clan together!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Clan was undoubtedly the top clan in Hundred Miles City, even the whole Qing Village had been brought to greater heights together. In the past, when people from the Hundred Miles City passed by Qing Village to hunt in the Qing Village, there would always be some conflicts. During these times, people from the Qing Village would always have to put up with it after seeing that they were from the Hundred Miles City.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Village's land was not small. Moreover, including the people from the town not far away, there were hundreds of thousands people in this generation. They were collectively known as the Qing Village.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now, when people from the Qing Village went to the Hundred Miles City, they could all proudly say that they were from Qing Village. When people from the Hundred Miles City passed by the Qing Village, they longer acted the same as before. They no longer sped by them, shouting and calling them to get out of the way when they saw anyone.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everything was because of Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was not only the pillar for Qing Village, but also the pillar of the Hundred Miles City. Therefore, even the people from the Hundred Miles City would need to give great respect to Qing Shui's hometown, Qing Village.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The family of 30 plus put tables together to sit down together.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The meal was very lively, and they kept firing Qing Shui with questions!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Brother Shui, let me have a ride on that golden elephant of yours!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Earlier, she was not in the mood for it, but now that Qing Shui was better, she was naturally in the mood now.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"That's easy. We'll go in a while!" Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was the second new year.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, what are your plans now?" Seeing that everyone had finished their dinner, Qing Luo held onto a cup of tea and asked.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I'll stay here for now, and get some things done." Qing Shui thought that he should raise the level of the people in Qing Clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Especially the Xiantian Golden Pellet for his mother and grandfather. Qing Shui planned to refine them as soon as possible! He also wanted to take this opportunity to look out for some precious ingredients.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li was seated on one side next to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">And on the other side was Qing Yi, followed by Qingqing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">On the other side with Huoyun Liu-Li was Canghai Mingyue, Qingzhuang, Mingyue Gelou, Little Yuchang, Qing Bei...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Di Chen had returned to her room. With her present, the others were not able to be at ease. Therefore, she would choose to avoid such situations. Moreover, it was not convenient for her since she was wearing a face veil.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The others did not think much about it either. Toward her, everyone was filled with gratitude...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li grabbed onto Qing Shui's hand quietly, her shrewd and beautiful eyes occasionally glanced towards Qing Shui, causing him to think about what she said the other time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I don’t care. This year, Qing Shui, you have to be mine…"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"She did not force herself on me..."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now that Qing Shui has recovered, he would naturally not let her go. Otherwise, it would be harming her. For a proud lady like her to say such words, it was because she was deeply in love with him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It required a lot of courage!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui grabbed onto her hand tightly...</p>
