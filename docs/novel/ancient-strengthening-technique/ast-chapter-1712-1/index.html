 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Wu tried hard to bear with it, but eventually, still failed to do so as a trickle of blood flowed down the corner of his lips. However, he knew that Qing Shui had held back and also knew the difference between Qing Shui and himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked at Qing Shui for very long, not saying a single word as he wore a pale countenance. This time around, the blow dealt to him was far too great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He hadn't expected that Qing Shui would be this strong and that this young man could keep himself concealed so deeply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't say anything and just stared at him like that, smiling. He wasn't sure if Huang Wu would go back on his words, or if he would get the people around him to attack together. If that were to happen, then it'd be a tough battle. However, Qing Shui wasn't afraid. If push comes to shoves, he would kill all of them today, even at the risk of his own life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two old men on the opposite helped and checked Huang Wu's condition before giving him a medicinal pill. It was only then did they look toward Qing Shui, cold gleam flashing in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui faced them calmly. He could see the fury in the old men's eyes, but he remained unafraid. The other party seemed to be raring to go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, at that moment, Huang Wu spoke up: "Alright. Let us leave."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On hearing Huang Wu's words, the two men appeared to be in great disbelief. When had their leader ever been put down so much before? Most importantly, this was the first time that he had taken the initiative to give up after having been on the losing end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was he really giving up? Or was this only temporarily?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"May I ask for your name? I'll definitely come back to settle this debt with you in the future." Huang Wu looked at Qing Shui and said softly. By this time, he had already recovered to his earlier appearance, being neither happy nor sad. Such a mental state was really hard to come by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm called Qing Shui. We'll meet in the future and you're welcomed anytime. I'll be waiting." Qing Shui said nonchalantly while at the same time, secretly heaved a sigh of relief. He didn't wish to fall out with the Wavemoon Cavern right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Let's go!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Wu and the group left very quickly. However, Qing Shui had the feeling that Huang Wu wouldn't give up just like that. What he said before he left wasn't just for show. Qing Shui understood people with such character.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Hell Tigon had died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui started to clean up this huge beast. He first opened up its head to obtain that Desolate Beast Pellet, then moved onto the Core. Its eyes are also medicinal ingredients. Its blood, tendons, heart, and others...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui also placed a lot of the Hell Tigon's hide and bones into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After finishing all of these tasks, about half a day had passed. Qing Shui then washed up and changed into a set of clean clothes before he headed back with the other three ladies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very soon, they arrived back at the Sunset Sea King Palace. The moment they went in, they saw Yiye Jiange standing in the courtyard waiting for them. When she noticed that they had returned safely with faint smiles, the slight frown she had eased up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You guys are back. How was it?" Seeing that they had returned safely, Yiye Jiange knew that she didn't have to ask if they were fine. Therefore, she asked about their takeaways from this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Of course, there isn't any problem. That beast only looks tough. Although it was big in size, it wasn't that strong." Qing Shui said with great ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange knew that there must have been some problems when Qing Shui said this. However, she smiled and said, "Go on and tell me the truth. Seeing that you guys have returned safely, I know that even if it was dangerous, it's all over now."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sunset Palace Mistress then gave a brief outline of what had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about it, Yiye Jiange still felt a little scared. However, it was just as she had said. Now that she knew the outcome, she wasn't especially worried. At the very least, they managed to withstand it no matter how dangerous the situation had been. After all, the outcome was already known.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was also a reason why the Sunset Palace Mistress decided to say this. They had a close relationship as sisters and wouldn't hide things from Yiye Jiange like Qing Shui had done. Moreover, now that they were living together, it was a form of disrespect to be hiding stuff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unknowingly, another half a month passed by. The days were very peaceful. Qing Xiu had turned one month old and Qing Shui held a baby shower for him. He didn't invite many people, only a selected few.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't hold such matters in high regards. He had witnessed too much of the fickleness in human relationships in his previous life. Therefore, the best thing that should be done was to be himself, to get stronger, and to get his own family stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye came. After all, she was also the child's godmother. Qing Shui smiled and carried Qing Xiu, feeling that this kid was quite lucky. At the very least, there were a lot of people doting on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to when he had just been born, Qing Xiu, having reached one month old, was much bigger now. He wore pale colored clothes and his exquisite little face was very handsome. The child was very active and would at least be awake for six hours a day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he was still young, anyone could get to hold him. He wasn't adverse to strangers. After all, he was too young to understand anything. He only opened his pair of big, bright eyes that were like a pair of crystals, seemingly curious about anything and everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye carried Qing Xiu from Qing Shui's hands. Qing Xiu noticed that the way she carried the child was very natural, unlike how awkward Qing Shui had been. This might be a lady's instinctive capability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Do you like children this much?" Qing Shui smiled and looked at Qing Hanye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye threw Qing Shui an annoyed glance charmingly. She had seen the tease in Qing Shui's eyes and knew that he didn't have any good intentions. However, she immediately acted shy and embarrassed, asking Qing Shui coquettishly, "When are you going to give me a child as well?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that Qing Hanye was doing this on purpose. This lady was a demoness, and there were times when she was worse than Huoyun Liu-Li. Noticing that Yiye Jiange was heading over in their direction, he could only smile awkwardly. He knew that Qing Hanye had only said that because she saw Yiye Jiange coming over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at how helpless Qing Shui looked, Qing Hanye laughed softly. Her charming appearance caused Qing Shui's heart to itch. However, he could only bear with it now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, the others are here. You should go show yourself and greet the others!” Yiye Jiange smiled and said then walked up to Qing Hanye to take a look at the kid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright! I'll go and take a look." Qing Shui planned to take his leave as well. Qing Hanye was such a charming lady that there was no need for her to try to seduce people. She was already extremely seductive to begin with. If she were to put her mind toward seducing someone, the guy probably wouldn't even know how he had fallen into her trap.</span></p>
