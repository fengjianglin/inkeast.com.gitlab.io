 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Flying Sword, Divine Weapon, awakened. State: Third Grade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. As he suspected, his Flying Sword was a Divine Weapon. This was great! It had gone up all the way to the third grade. Qing Shui didn’t find it weird as things were usually upgraded easily at the beginning. Considering that the effect of his Divine Square Cauldron had been boosted by two times thanks to the Treasure Basin, Qing Shui felt that it was safe to assume that to ascend through the first three grades of a Divine Weapon, it would only require one Divine Square Cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After being cleansed by the Treasure Basin, his Divine Square Cauldron alone could stand up against three others ones that haven’t been soaked inside the Treasure Basin. In just a moment, his Flying Sword ascended up to the third grade thanks to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Driven by excitement, Qing Shui read through the explanations for the Flying Sword Divine Weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Reduce the injuries inflicted to allies by 10%. The effect lasted throughout the entire fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was very happy. The allies mentioned here should include his comrades, as well as his demonic beasts. It was just that he wasn’t sure about how the weapon could recognize whether or not a person was his comrade. Could it be they had to stand within a certain formation, or could it automatically recognize the partners by their auras? For example, usually, when two enemies faced off against each other, they would stand on opposing sides. This made it easy to recognize friends and foes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui found it a bit weird but since this was how it was explained, he felt that there shouldn’t be any problem with it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Increased the recovery speed of the user by 30% and raised the overall offensive and defensive prowess by 0.6 billion Dao Force. The extra wounding prowess caused to, and by the enemies, were also increased by the same amount. The user’s allies were able to reduce damages inflicted to them by 3%.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a third grade Divine Weapon, just these external factors already made it so powerful. Qing Shui was stunned for quite a while as he didn’t know how he should express the surprise he was currently feeling. Initially, he was already satisfied enough having the Flying Sword. Its speed, as well as its sharpness, had made up for the things which Qing Shui lacked. However, he had never expected for it to actually come with such fearsome additional abilities. All of these supports helped increase the owner’s physical power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A 0.6 billion Dao Force increase to the overall defense and offense. It didn’t take Qing Shui much time to figure out that for each grade it ascended to, the weapon would provide an additional 0.2 billion Dao Force worth of boost to the user’s offensive and defensive prowess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Other than that, the 0.6 billion increase to damaging prowess was almost the same as boosting the offensive prowess. However, as stated, the wounding prowess here was only an additional effect, thus, it couldn’t be counted directly as the user’s default strength. However, the external damaging prowess could be even more terrifying. The reason was that the attacks that made use of it were mostly capable of neglecting the opponent’s defense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Reduced the damage caused externally by 0.6 billion Dao Force. This was even better than having his defensive prowess increased by that amount. About the last thing which mentioned about reducing the overall damage caused to the allies by 3%, this should be the same as reducing the injuries which the allies suffered by 10% that was mentioned above. They were both aimed for a group of people. Adding them up, they would be able to lessen 13% of damages altogether.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui already had the Emperor’s Qi, Art of Pursuing, as well as Area Dominance. Now that he also attained the ability of the Divine Weapon, his strength once again was increased by a significant amount. Qing Shui’s defensive and offensive prowess could already be considered to be very terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s initial defensive prowess counting in the Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda was worth less than 15 billion Dao Force. But now, thanks to the additional stack provided by his Divine Weapon, it immediately achieved as much as 23 billion Dao Force. Furthermore, the Divine Weapon was able to help neglect up to 0.6 billion Dao Force worth of strength and reduce the damage caused to the user’s body by 30%.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Emperor’s Qi was capable of reducing the opponent’s strength by 20%. The Area Dominance also did the same thing, only that it also reduced speed in addition to strength. The ‘strength’ mentioned here only stood for offensive prowess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, even an opponent with fearsome strength wouldn’t pose a threat to Qing Shui thanks to his absurd defensive prowess and resistance against other attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui couldn’t wait to get a few more Divine Square Cauldron. Unfortunately, this thing was quite rare. However, Qing Shui had already come up with plans to collect it. He would draw out the Divine Square Cauldron itself and then add it into the list of things which he was willing to purchase for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Qing Shui remembered the ore which he was given with the other day when he saved an ordinary person. Back then, he only glanced through it and knew that it had to do with upgrading the grade of the Divine Weapon. Driven by excitement, he took out the ore quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that, Qing Shui wasn’t sure if he should feel happy or upset.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mystic Crystal Ore!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It could support the Divine Weapon Crystal. Used for ascending realms beyond the 13th grade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a very simple explanation. Qing Shui felt heated up. Though he had not yet able to use it for the time being, it was telling him that the Divine Weapons could ascend beyond the 13th grade. He wasn’t sure about the maximum level it could attain but he could confirm that there were more than 13 levels.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the joyful moment, Qing Shui started worrying about how he should track down more Divine Square Cauldron. So long as he had enough of them, he would be able to upgrade his Divine Weapons. By then, Qing Shui’s strength would also be increased significantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A mere third grade Divine Weapon had already helped Qing Shui raised his defensive prowess from 10.5 billion Dao Force up to 20.3 billion Dao Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Other than that, Qing Shui’s current Nine Continents Mountain had achieved an offensive prowess worth 10.5 billion Dao Force. By combining it with the formidable Shield Attacks, his Nine Continents Mountain would turn out to be a powerful killing machine. The advantage it had as a Supreme Treasure was already starting to show.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment, Qing Shui was feeling very relaxed. Even if he was currently in the True Nine Continents World, he felt that he was starting to feel more and more secure around here. What he was secured about wasn’t his own heart, but his fundamentals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Across the continent, whether or not a person was rich wasn’t judged by how much money they had, but how strong their fundamental was. With a strong foundation, money would come to them waves after waves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the same in his previous incarnation. Sometimes, it was not about how much money you had. There were a lot of people who lost everything in just one night. Instead, the most important thing about a person was how capable he was. So long as he was capable enough, money wouldn’t be a problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the time being, Qing Shui decided to take his mind away from the things regarding Five Tigers Immortal Sect. After all, since he had already a promise with Nuo Lan, he should have faith in her and let her be in charge of it. At the very least, she should be able to give him an accurate answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the next day, a good thing happened to Qing Shui. Someone had managed to bring him the Redcloud Grass. In exchange for that, they accumulated 100 points for themselves. The person had brought a total of 100 Redcloud Grass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These medicinal herbs were only found deep within the Redcloud Valley. That place was a bit more dangerous. The price which Qing Shui suggested wasn’t that high, but to him, he felt that it was already good enough. After all, 1 point wasn’t worth as simple as a hundred gold. Even if a person wanted to accumulate points, they wouldn’t necessarily sell it for 200 golds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t find it weird. “Food is the god of all people”. Gluttony and lust were the most important things in one’s life. Furthermore, a lot of people didn’t just eat to survive, but treated it as a way to enjoy themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Nuo Lan found it normal as she knew how alluring the food could be, she still couldn’t help but be surprised by it.</span></p>
