 <p><strong>AST 1221 - The Loser Will Break Off One Arm, Dare You Take the Challenge</strong></p>
 <p>No matter what, Tian Jiange's decision was a clever one. Those who headed up first tended to not be too strong. He gained three consecutive wins. At the beginning, more people would pay attention as well.</p>
 <p>He might have gotten the attention of people from Divine Might Dynasty's royalty. This time, the person who came forth was a lady who was quite beautiful, with a generous and mature beauty. Most people with good aptitude would tend to have a good bone structure, a proportionate body, and good skin. This was why there were no lack of beauties and handsome men amongst cultivators.</p>
 <p>"Please!" The lady smiled and said to Tian Jiange the moment she went up.</p>
 <p>"Please!" Tian Jiange cupped his fists together.</p>
 <p>The lady was very nimble, with a footwork that was as flexible as a sly little rabbit. The lady had a snow-white claw-like weapon which glowed with a fluorescent light, appearing to be very eye catching.</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>Their weapons collided and Tian Jiange's body trembled a little. His body appeared a little weird and he retreated a step a bit unnaturally. Qing Shui managed to notice something. He felt that the lady's attack must have an ability that was similar to a numbing effect.</p>
 <p>If it was Qing Shui, he could fend it off with his Nature Energy. There was an increasing number of people with unique abilities as they grew stronger. At this level, who would not have a killer move of their own? It wasn't surprising for this lady to own an ability like this. She might even have some other, even more terrifying abilities.</p>
 <p>Sky Sword of Emotions!</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange's longsword was also snow-white and now it was releasing a brilliant snow-white and sharp aura through his body. Very quickly, the numbness was gone and his movements were even smoother than before.</p>
 <p>Song of the Sky Sword!</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange's longsword created a clanking sound that was like a song. When hearing it, one's morale would be boosted and it also unleashed a powerful killing intent. If ordinary people were to hear it, fear would develop in their hearts and they wouldn't be at ease.</p>
 <p>However, when Tian Jiange heard this sound, the blood in his body would boil, as if a person's fresh blood was lit up. It was an ability that could stimulate a person's potential within a short period of time, making him stronger than before.</p>
 <p>Soul Attracting Claws!</p>
 <p>The lady didn't show any signs of faltering. With a swing of her left hand, another claw appeared in her hand. When the two claws clashed, a crisp and melodious sound like a wind chime rang out, overpowering Tian Jiange's clanks by a lot. The melodious sound she produced was one which could calm a person down and even induce sleepiness.</p>
 <p>Soul Charming!</p>
 <p>Just as Tian Jiange fell into a short trance, the lady made her move. She was fast as a fox and her claws attacked toward Tian Jiange's neck and chest, as if she was out for a kill. Moreover, her sharp claws were not ordinary weapons. It felt as if she would really able to kill Tian Jiange.</p>
 <p>Ding ding...</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange tried very hard to defend. A series of densely packed metallic sounds rang out and even his Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation sent out rippling waves. If not for his Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation, Tian Jiange would have died many times over.</p>
 <p>"Admit your defeat. If I wish to kill you, it wouldn't be hard to accomplish. Your Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation won't be able to fend off my attacks." After forcing Tian Jiange back, the lady smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange felt very depressed as well. He wasn't a match for this lady, but he didn't wish to admit defeat. It was actually very normal for one to admit defeat in a sparring exchange like this. It was good for one to understand the feelings of humiliation and use that as to propel one towards becoming even stronger.</p>
 <p>"I'm not admitting defeat. You can either knock me off the arena or kill me." After a long hesitation, Tian Jiange said.</p>
 <p>"Why?" The lady looked at him, her eyes gleaming.</p>
 <p>"I can't get it past myself." Tian Jiange smiled bitterly and said before gradually lifting up his sword.</p>
 <p>"Sigh, what's the point." The lady shook her head and her Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation appeared as well. It looked very light. If one didn't pay extra attention, it would be hard to tell that it was a Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation. It was something like a robe made of a fox's fur.</p>
 <p>Sky Fox Flash!</p>
 <p>Soul Charming Bone Corrosion!</p>
 <p>The lady suddenly dashed out toward Tian Jiange like an illusion. Her claws glimmered with colorful lights and she brought about a series of dreamy colors as she waved her claws above.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange looked at his opponent's terrifying yet beautiful attack and tried to fend it off. However, in the end, his Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation dissipated and her ice-cold claws stopped at his throat and chest respectively. The sharp claws flashed with an icy cold light, exuding a killing intent which was not to be doubted.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange had lost. He looked at the lady and said slowly, "I've lost. I've lost in the battle."</p>
 <p>With that, Tian Jiange turned and headed down.</p>
 <p>"I'm called Hu Yiya!" The lady said to Tian Jiange's back view.</p>
 <p>"I'm Tian Jiange."</p>
 <p>"This is my first time at Heaven Secrets Academy. I wonder if you can bring me around later?" The lady said with a poised tone.</p>
 <p>"Of course. You can come look for me later. I'll be over there." Tian Jiange pointed to Qing Shui's location and said.</p>
 <p>"Good for you Brother. To think that you can attract good fortune with women even under such a situation." Qing Shui looked toward Tian Jiange and remarked.</p>
 <p>"What good fortune with woman. If you're capable, then go and beat her down." Tian Jiange said helplessly.</p>
 <p>This was the lady's eighth round and the other people after Tian Jiange weren't as lucky. Those who didn't admit defeat would suffer some injuries. Due to this, many people could tell that she seemed to treat Tian Jiange a little bit better.</p>
 <p>The lady's consecutive wins brought about loud cheers from many members of Divine Might Dynasty's royalty. They were all cheering for her. When Qing Shui saw the next challenger, he was stunned for a moment.</p>
 <p>It was Young Master Fu!</p>
 <p>since the last time he had quickly left the Sacred Hall, they hadn't met since. When Qing Shui looked up toward the arena, Young Master Fu just happened to look in his direction as well.</p>
 <p>"The two of you have a grudge?" Tian Jiange looked at Qing Shui and asked.</p>
 <p>"We had a little problem." Qing Shui said, not paying it much heed.</p>
 <p>"He's a member of the Saint Child Band and is now Elder Tianyi's disciple. You're better off keeping your guards up against him. A hypocrite like him is worse than a villain." Tian Jiange gritted his teeth and said.</p>
 <p>This perked Qing Shui's curiosity. He could sense that there was definitely bad blood between Tian Jiange and Young Master Fu, and it seemed to be very mysterious. Qing Shui could see that Tian Jiange’s eyes were spewing fire as he looked towards Young Master Fu.</p>
 <p>And when Young Master Fu looked at Tian Jiange, there was a smirk in his gaze.</p>
 <p>"This bastard..."</p>
 <p>"Brother's new girlfriend might be in trouble." Qing Shui looked at the arena and said softly.</p>
 <p>"All these years, none of the ladies I've taken a liking to have had a good ending. Not even a lady who merely had some more contact with me." Tian Jiange sounded especially helpless.</p>
 <p>"Why is that?" Qing Shui looked at Tian Jiange.</p>
 <p>"He is related to Saint Child Band's Saint Child by blood. They are brothers. I'm the brother to Lord Sect's leader. There has always been friction between Lord Sect and Saint Child Band but it was merely competition. Sometimes, things can be truly unbelievable. His fiancee liked me and after this Fu Yanting found out about it, he announced that he will make sure that I'll never get married in this life. Any lady who is even a little bit closer to me shall not be met with a good ending." Tian Jiange smiled bitterly and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The battle on the arena had already started. Young Master Fu was Fu Yanting. He held two short daggers, which were in a way similar to Hu Yiya's claws. However, this time around, it was Fu Yanting pushing back Hu Yiya. Occasionally, Fu Yanting's short dagger would suddenly reach out from his sleeves and slashed against her Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation.</p>
 <p>Pfft!</p>
 <p>Fu Yanting's dagger slashed Hu Yiya’s shoulder. Not only did it injured her, but it also made her panic. After all, if her clothes were torn, she could possibly be exposed.</p>
 <p>Fu Yanting's two daggers were like an executioner's blades and he was just like a cat playing with its prey.</p>
 <p>"Senior Martial Sister, admit defeat! Stop fighting with that bastard!"</p>
 <p>"How can this person be like this? Torturing a lady like this. He's really bringing shame to Heaven Secrets Academy. This will definitely worsen the following battles between Heaven Secrets Academy and Divine Might Dynasty."</p>
 <p>"Speak softer, Young Master Fu is Saint Child's brother. Don't let him hear you. Otherwise, we'll be in big trouble."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also saw Tian Jiange's conflicted gaze. After all, many people had seen that the lady seemed to have taken a liking toward him earlier. Most importantly, Tian Jiange felt that it was because of him that she was in such a situation. If she hadn't met him nor spoke with him, then Fu Yanting would not have taken action.</p>
 <p>"Admit defeat!" Tian Jiange let out a sigh and said to the stubborn lady on the arena.</p>
 <p>"Admit defeat? If she had wanted to do that, why would she wait until now? Tian Jiange, are you feeling pained for her? Are you feeling upset? Hahaha."</p>
 <p>Fu Yanting continued to attack without rushing, occasionally leaving another wound on Hu Yiya.</p>
 <p>"Fu Yanting, if you have a problem with me, then direct it at me. What you're doing is creating problems between Heaven Secrets Academy and Divine Might Dynasty. Aren't you afraid that the Elders would put the blame on you?" Tian Jiange bellowed.</p>
 <p>"You only know how to holler down there. You can't even defeat a lady. What's there to blame? She's not admitting her defeat, so I'll continue to fight until she does. Is there something wrong with that?" Fu Yanting looked at Tian Jiange and spoke with disdain.</p>
 <p>"Go on. What must I do for you to stop?" Tian Jiange sighed and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui finally realized why Tian Jiange and that lady had hit it off well. The two of them were actually very similar, and they were similar to him as well. This was the feeling he got.</p>
 <p>"That person besides you seems to be your brother? The elder brother is trash. I wonder how the younger brother fares. Why don't you let him take the place of this lady to have a fight with me? What do you think?" Fu Yanting looked at Qing Shui, his gaze filled with challenge and viciousness.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange didn't say anything but clenched his fists tightly. It was a pity that he wasn't a match for Fu Yanting. Moreover, he no longer had the rights to step up onto the arena.</p>
 <p>There were no rules in such an exchange competition that those who were from the same side couldn't spar. It was just that even though there were no strict regulations, people from the same side wouldn’t usually challenge each other in such a situation. They had plenty of time usually. Why would they have to fight between themselves in front of outsiders?</p>
 <p>However, Fu Yanting's words caused many people in the surroundings to be taken aback.</p>
 <p>"A bunch of cowards, just like that trash." Fu Yanting threw a challenging look toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"It's fine to have a fight. However, it's a bit petty for there to be no prize. How about this, the loser will break off one arm. Do you dare to take the challenge?" Qing Shui appeared on the arena.</p>
