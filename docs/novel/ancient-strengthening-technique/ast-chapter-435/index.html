 <p><strong>Chapter 435 Massacre, Qing Hanye’s injustice, Her name is Huang Qing.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 435 - Massacre, Qing Hanye’s injustice, Her name is Huang Qing</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">All of the sudden, Elder Huo and Elder Xu sprang onto Qing Hanye with the intention to use her to coerce Qing Shui. This was the only way they could possibly survive.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But Qing Shui had already anticipated their movements!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You are dead!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui roared with anger as he circulated his “Core Qi Method” to the peak and reached the speed of light with his Cloudmist Step. Taking advantage of his enhanced speed, he quickly rushed in front of Qing Hanye.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Roar!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">An earth shattering Tiger’s Roar exploded in the air. The Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique gushed out from Qing Shui’s body through his back, with two arm-like forces of Qi extending towards the air akin to a pair of Storm Dragons.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The force of Qi demonstrated the most superb Taichi Single Whip he had ever performed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was the “One with Heaven” Taichi Single Whip!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As Elder Huo and Elder Xu observed the wavering of the arm-like force of Qi and felt Qing Shui’s immense, suffocating presence, they were suddenly filled with a sense of despair. The Elders gave up on running away instantaneously.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not equip himself with the Golden Ringed Battle Armor, Big Dipper Sword, and Godly Force Talisman. Instead, with just the Heavenly Thunder Slash, Frenzied Bull’s Strength, and Diamond Qi, Qing Shui was able to gather his strength to a total of 8.4 million units of energy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was able to unleash the essence of power to an unimaginable degree with “One with Heaven” Taichi Single Whip alone. Since his “Divine Arm Clearing” had already reached the Grand Perfection Stage, he would be able to unleash a large amount of power through both of his arms.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Bang bang!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Elders were met with an inevitable fate as they were struck with Qing Shui’s immense power. They had been defeated by the late Canghai couple before, and they were finally defeated by Qing Shui once more. The Elders died instantly, like a hot knife through a butter.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was clearly filled with violent rage since he didn’t take a long time to kill them. He felt great respect towards the late Canghai couple since they had treated him well. Qing Shui loved them a lot, especially Canghai. After hearing of their stories from Cang Wuya and witnessing his contributions to a better world, Qing Shui held a high opinion of him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Men would always gear towards their belief of righteousness. Qing Shui admired the fact that Canghai was able to plow through every obstacles because of his father. If it were him, he would do the same without hesitation, even if it meant his death.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The word “father” felt heavy. Even though Qing Shui had never been regarded as a real father, he was able to experience and taste how it felt like to be one!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, in Qing Shui’s opinion, the word “mother” felt even heavier than “father”. The love of a father symbolized a mountain, while the love of a mother symbolized water. Throughout his life, Qing Shui was brought up by his mother alone. He felt greater respect for all mothers in the world, especially Canghai Mingyue’s mother. She sacrificed her life so that Qing Shui and his mother could live.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue’s mother paid the price with her life for the sake of her daughter’s life!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, Qing Shui could hear multiple footsteps running towards them. A group of Immortal Sword Sect disciples wearing a set of white clothing surrounded the area. Qing Shui had always loved the color white, but he felt unpleasant looking at the color now because it reminded him of the Immortal Sword Sect.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The surrounding people discovered that two of the Elders had died. There was another one alive, but his legs were broken and his face was covered in blood. Elder Zhang wailed in pain, but all of them did nothing except look at each other in bewilderment.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui walked towards Elder Zhang and asked: “Where is the tomb?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I…. don’t… know...” Elder Zhang croaked painfully!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Oof!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui kicked him hard in the stomach!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mingyue, since they made you upset, shall we eradicate the entire Immortal Sword Sect?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The members of the Immortal Sword Sect were shocked by his words as their faces turned pale. Even Qing Hanye was staring at him with dismay in her eyes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Is this the same person I knew before? Is he still the man with the childlike heart?” Qing Hanye stood firmly without changing her expression. Her gaze, however, felt as if it could sever the fates of a thousand people in an instant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, do you have to do this? There are innocent people here….”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Silence!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui hissed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He didn’t know why he had a sudden outburst of anger. Perhaps it was because of the pain the Immortal Sword Sect had brought upon Canghai Mingyue, or perhaps it was because Huoyun Liu-Li almost lost her life in this place.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Perhaps Qing Shui was angry because he found out that the Grand Elder of the Immortal Sword Sect was actually Qing Hanye’s grandfather. Although she had once saved his life, Qing Shui could not help but feel annoyed when Qing Hanye tried to absolve the issue on behalf of Immortal Sword Sect.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She had an enchanting hourglass figure, a charming demeanor, shoulder-length silky hair, a pair of lovely eyes, and an upright nose. &nbsp;Although she didn’t have the prettiest dainty lips, it was still quite seductive.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Hanye looked at Qing Shui with a hurtful expression and tears in her eyes. She walked towards Qing Shui slowly while swaying her slender hourglass figure side to side.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, I know you are mad at me right now.” Qing Hanye said in a beautiful, mellow voice that could tug at any man’s heartstrings. Her expression seemed a bit flirtatious yet frightened. He felt crazy looking at how her soft lips moved.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui evaded her gaze. He felt awful looking at how frightened she had become. If it wasn’t for the Spirit Duo Cultivation with her previously, he wouldn’t have developed mixed feelings for Qing Hanye.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the same time, Qing Shui could not help but remember the words uttered by Qing Hanye’s grandfather before he left the Immortal Sword Sect.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hanye said you can come back for her anytime when you have finally realized that you have feelings for her. She will always wait for you no matter what.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stared at Qing Hanye as he reminisced his first impression of her as a “skinny bone” woman. He was able to see how kind she was after he had gotten to know her a little more. She was different from Huoyun Liu-Li in terms of mannerism. Qing Hanye was charming because of her bone structure whilst Huoyun Liu-Li was charming because of her facial expression.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Let’s go to the Immortal Sword Sect. Wasn’t your grandfather confined there? Even though we owe nothing to each other since then, let me make it up for him this time.” Qing Shui said gently to Qing Hanye.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li wanted to say something, but in the end, she didn’t say a word. However, her expression showed that she was clearly in low spirits!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, please don’t kill those innocent people and help rescue Hanye’s grandfather!” Canghai Mingue wiped her tears as Qing Shui lifted her up by supporting her arms.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tears rolled down from Qing Hanye’s face as she turned around and ran. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why did you do that?” Canghai Mingyue asked softly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Let’s go to the Immortal Sword Sect and finish our business with them first.” Qing Shui forced a smile at Canghai Mingyue. He didn’t understand why he lashed out at Qing Hanye in the first place. But he couldn’t bring himself to apologize to her since he didn’t think he was wrong at all.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Forget it, let’s not think about that for now!” Qing Shui shook his head and sorted out his thoughts.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After that, Qing Shui arrived at the Immortal Sword Sect!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Immortal Sword Sect had already received news of their members’ deaths at Qing Shui’s hands. It was devastating to receive dire news about the deaths of their three members, especially when they were Elders. They took it as a threat and heightened their security with more guards.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The three Elders didn’t even manage to land a blow on that kid, yet they died by his hands. What should we do now?” An elderly man with a head of white hairs paced around the Immortal Sword Sect hall as he spoke. His hairs drooped down until they reached his waist. Back then, this man was one of the four elderly men who would always stand behind the Grand Elder. He was known as Elder Xiong, the strongest martial warrior amongst the four elders. However, he has since taken over the rights of being the head of the sect.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Elder Xiong, if we can find that person, she might be able to help you.” A middle-aged man from below piped up, frowning as he tried to think of a solution.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Who?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That person from the Southern City Furniture Store!” The middle-aged man said &nbsp;mysteriously.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Wang Xing, do you mean the Sword Demon Huang Qing?” Elder Xiong’s eye brightened up.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes. No one else would be able to save us except Sword Demon Huang Qing from the Sword Tower.” Wang Xing said in a more serious tone.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Elder Xiong went silent. He knew that woman was a legendary Peak of Martial King warrior in the Greencloud Country who wielded a three feet long Greenedge Sword as her main weapon. She was also an official guard of the Sword Tower with status above an Elder, but she was never in Sword Tower doing her job. Instead, Huang Qing had been situated in the Southern City Furniture Store in the past recent years. No one even knew how old she was, but she was known to have a beautiful appearance. Even though her name was Huang Qing, others had given her the title of Demon Sword. Eventually, everyone started to call her Demon Sword Huang Qing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Moreover, no one knew why she joined Sword Tower since she had already risen to the level of the Peak of Martial King. Her origins were unknown to many, but some rumors pointed her origins back to the Central Continents, while some said she was from Eastern Victory Divine Continent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Wang Xing, would she come if we ask?” Elder Xiong frowned.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I am not sure. Immortal Sword Sect has always been affiliated with Sword Tower. Since she was an official guard of Sword Tower, she should be obliged to come and help us.” Wang Xing said after he thought about Elder Xiong’s question for a while.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Then go with Old Fu. Make haste and come back as soon as possible.” Elder Xiong stressed heavily on their swiftness to the situation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes, sir!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Wang Xing and a quiet elderly man left quickly after that!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…..</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, please spare them if they stop their resistance!” Canghai Mingyue pleaded to Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Don’t worry, Mingyue. There are hundreds and thousands of disciples who are unrelated to our business. I will listen to you, but I can’t promise I will have mercy on them once they start revolting. Remember, they didn’t have mercy on us when we came back then.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had already equipped the Golden-Ringed Battle Armor and the Big Dipper Sword. Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li had also equipped the Tricolor Battle Skirts and boots respectively.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It became more convenient for Canghai Mingyue to store items inside the Interspatial Silk Satchel that Qing Shui had given to her. She and Huoyun Liu-Li were made aware that Qing Shui was in possession of an interspatial item, but they never inquired him on it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stood on the left side of Canghai Mingyue while Huoyun Liu-Li held the Demonic Stonegold Rabbit King in her arms and stood on her right side. The three of them walked towards the Southern Ancient Pass slowly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They felt a unique feeling at this moment!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They were getting closer to the Immortal Sword Sect. They could even see a number of people wearing a white Immortal Sword Sect uniform moving about!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hundreds of people wielding a longsword emblazoned with the Immortal Sword Sect emblem suddenly appeared in front of their path. All of them seemed to be roughly in their 30s.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Some looked nervous, and some of them looked fearless. Some scanned the area, as if they were looking for a place to escape.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was obvious what they were here for. They weren’t meant to defeat him, only obstruct him as decoys and impair his arrival to the Immortal Sword Sect. They took out their sharp swords, which refracted the light from the sun on their shiny surface, and were ready to die for their cause.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui frown in disapproval. He could tell that his opponents were trying to stall for time by using their weakest pawns as scapegoats.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Do they have higher-skilled martial warriors as their backup? Or maybe they were able to call upon a skilled warrior?” Qing Shui was skeptical about the situation, or else the Immortal Sword Sect elders would not have sent their weakest warriors to defend themselves.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Either they wanted to sacrifice their men as a way to sate Qing Shui’s hunger for blood, or they intended to increase his bloodlust….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui went closer to the mass of sect disciples. He used his imposing force as a way to urge their escape to prevent any unnecessary bloodshed. These men could not stave off Qing Shui’s aura, as a few of them had already “slided down the slope” and disappeared from sight.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As soon as that happened, the others quickly followed and ran away! After all, it would be insane to willingly seek one’s doom when they were offered the option to live.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After they escaped, another batch of people appeared. These people were also in their 30s, but their strength felt unbalanced as a whole. They may be stronger than the previous group, but their maximum strength could only be placed at the Peak of Houtian.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui began to cast an imposing force once more so that they would retreat. They were no match for him, which was why Qing Shui felt that it was unnecessary to even start a fight with them. From the beginning, it was destined to be a rough journey for them to travel.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Then, after about a hundred meters!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A group of Elementary stage Xiantian martial warriors appeared!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stopped and waved one of his hands into the air!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He summoned the Diamond Demonic Boar from the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li were shocked at the sudden appearance of the beast. It was their first time seeing an actual Diamond Demonic Beast appearing in front of them. However, it was expected for them to be surprised since this was a rare sight to witness!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was able to let off the martial warriors below the level of Xiantian, but he could not do the same for the Xiantian martial warriors blocking his path. Although they had obtained special privileges to disregard some mediocre rules and regulations, all of their actions - whether good or bad, would have an influence against the society.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After he had taken three breaths waiting for movement, no one did anything! Qing Shui decided to make the first move and flung his hand in the air while commanding the Diamond Demonic Boar to kill the mass of people in front of him!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Demonic Boar went on a rampage against the Xiantian martial warriors akin to “a tiger amongst a flock of sheep”. The martial warriors tried to retaliate by stabbing their swords into its body. However, the boar let out a sharp painful cry while continuing its murderous spree.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ahh!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ahhhh!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The air was filled with endless piercing screams. Blood spilled over every inch of the ground, staining every path with corpses. It was at this time that Qing Shui experienced an uncertain change inside him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">What a bloody and messy murder!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The whole scene was a definition of a merciless massacre. He would have been one of them if he didn’t meet the saviors of his life.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt calmer after seeing the pool of blood on the ground!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He felt like going all the way now that he had made his decision to walk this bloody path. It would not be considered a shame to die by the blade of a sword. Their death would be tantamount to a mighty general who fought to the death in a battlefield. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After a while, everything went silent. Qing Shui knew he was getting closer to the Immortal Sword Sect as he caught a glimpse of the gate not far from where he was standing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were about a hundred people guarding the front of the gate. The youngest of them all was grizzled with streaks of white hair, and a few more were already covered in a full set of white hairs. Even though they looked old, they were clearly vigorous and energetic. However, they also felt quite anxious about the outcome of this fight when pitted against Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mingyue, Liu-Li!” As soon as he called out to them, Qing Shui immediately summoned Firebird from the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The ladies were not taken by surprise by the summoning because they had already anticipated Qing Shui being in possession of a Beast Tamer’s “Interspatial Beast King Medallion”!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Essentially, the Beast Tamer’s “Interspatial Beast King Medallion” had a similar function to that of a Interspatial Silk Sachet, but instead of random non-living items, it could only keep beasts that had been tamed by its owner.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The “Interspatial Beast King Medallion” was made from the energy harnessed by a Beast Tamer, which would be imbued into a “Jade Crystal Beast Bone” to create a whole new dimension identical to the dimension inside the Interspatial Silk Sachet.</p>

 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 435 - Massacre, Qing Hanye’s injustice, Her name is Huang Qing</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">All of the sudden, Elder Huo and Elder Xu sprang onto Qing Hanye with the intention to use her to coerce Qing Shui. This was the only way they could possibly survive.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But Qing Shui had already anticipated their movements!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You are dead!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui roared with anger as he circulated his “Core Qi Method” to the peak and reached the speed of light with his Cloudmist Step. Taking advantage of his enhanced speed, he quickly rushed in front of Qing Hanye.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Roar!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">An earth shattering Tiger’s Roar exploded in the air. The Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique gushed out from Qing Shui’s body through his back, with two arm-like forces of Qi extending towards the air akin to a pair of Storm Dragons.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The force of Qi demonstrated the most superb Taichi Single Whip he had ever performed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was the “One with Heaven” Taichi Single Whip!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As Elder Huo and Elder Xu observed the wavering of the arm-like force of Qi and felt Qing Shui’s immense, suffocating presence, they were suddenly filled with a sense of despair. The Elders gave up on running away instantaneously.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not equip himself with the Golden Ringed Battle Armor, Big Dipper Sword, and Godly Force Talisman. Instead, with just the Heavenly Thunder Slash, Frenzied Bull’s Strength, and Diamond Qi, Qing Shui was able to gather his strength to a total of 8.4 million units of energy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was able to unleash the essence of power to an unimaginable degree with “One with Heaven” Taichi Single Whip alone. Since his “Divine Arm Clearing” had already reached the Grand Perfection Stage, he would be able to unleash a large amount of power through both of his arms.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Bang bang!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Elders were met with an inevitable fate as they were struck with Qing Shui’s immense power. They had been defeated by the late Canghai couple before, and they were finally defeated by Qing Shui once more. The Elders died instantly, like a hot knife through a butter.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was clearly filled with violent rage since he didn’t take a long time to kill them. He felt great respect towards the late Canghai couple since they had treated him well. Qing Shui loved them a lot, especially Canghai. After hearing of their stories from Cang Wuya and witnessing his contributions to a better world, Qing Shui held a high opinion of him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Men would always gear towards their belief of righteousness. Qing Shui admired the fact that Canghai was able to plow through every obstacles because of his father. If it were him, he would do the same without hesitation, even if it meant his death.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The word “father” felt heavy. Even though Qing Shui had never been regarded as a real father, he was able to experience and taste how it felt like to be one!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, in Qing Shui’s opinion, the word “mother” felt even heavier than “father”. The love of a father symbolized a mountain, while the love of a mother symbolized water. Throughout his life, Qing Shui was brought up by his mother alone. He felt greater respect for all mothers in the world, especially Canghai Mingyue’s mother. She sacrificed her life so that Qing Shui and his mother could live.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue’s mother paid the price with her life for the sake of her daughter’s life!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, Qing Shui could hear multiple footsteps running towards them. A group of Immortal Sword Sect disciples wearing a set of white clothing surrounded the area. Qing Shui had always loved the color white, but he felt unpleasant looking at the color now because it reminded him of the Immortal Sword Sect.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The surrounding people discovered that two of the Elders had died. There was another one alive, but his legs were broken and his face was covered in blood. Elder Zhang wailed in pain, but all of them did nothing except look at each other in bewilderment.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui walked towards Elder Zhang and asked: “Where is the tomb?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I…. don’t… know...” Elder Zhang croaked painfully!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Oof!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui kicked him hard in the stomach!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mingyue, since they made you upset, shall we eradicate the entire Immortal Sword Sect?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The members of the Immortal Sword Sect were shocked by his words as their faces turned pale. Even Qing Hanye was staring at him with dismay in her eyes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Is this the same person I knew before? Is he still the man with the childlike heart?” Qing Hanye stood firmly without changing her expression. Her gaze, however, felt as if it could sever the fates of a thousand people in an instant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, do you have to do this? There are innocent people here….”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Silence!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui hissed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He didn’t know why he had a sudden outburst of anger. Perhaps it was because of the pain the Immortal Sword Sect had brought upon Canghai Mingyue, or perhaps it was because Huoyun Liu-Li almost lost her life in this place.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Perhaps Qing Shui was angry because he found out that the Grand Elder of the Immortal Sword Sect was actually Qing Hanye’s grandfather. Although she had once saved his life, Qing Shui could not help but feel annoyed when Qing Hanye tried to absolve the issue on behalf of Immortal Sword Sect.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She had an enchanting hourglass figure, a charming demeanor, shoulder-length silky hair, a pair of lovely eyes, and an upright nose. &nbsp;Although she didn’t have the prettiest dainty lips, it was still quite seductive.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Hanye looked at Qing Shui with a hurtful expression and tears in her eyes. She walked towards Qing Shui slowly while swaying her slender hourglass figure side to side.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, I know you are mad at me right now.” Qing Hanye said in a beautiful, mellow voice that could tug at any man’s heartstrings. Her expression seemed a bit flirtatious yet frightened. He felt crazy looking at how her soft lips moved.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui evaded her gaze. He felt awful looking at how frightened she had become. If it wasn’t for the Spirit Duo Cultivation with her previously, he wouldn’t have developed mixed feelings for Qing Hanye.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the same time, Qing Shui could not help but remember the words uttered by Qing Hanye’s grandfather before he left the Immortal Sword Sect.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hanye said you can come back for her anytime when you have finally realized that you have feelings for her. She will always wait for you no matter what.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stared at Qing Hanye as he reminisced his first impression of her as a “skinny bone” woman. He was able to see how kind she was after he had gotten to know her a little more. She was different from Huoyun Liu-Li in terms of mannerism. Qing Hanye was charming because of her bone structure whilst Huoyun Liu-Li was charming because of her facial expression.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Let’s go to the Immortal Sword Sect. Wasn’t your grandfather confined there? Even though we owe nothing to each other since then, let me make it up for him this time.” Qing Shui said gently to Qing Hanye.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li wanted to say something, but in the end, she didn’t say a word. However, her expression showed that she was clearly in low spirits!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, please don’t kill those innocent people and help rescue Hanye’s grandfather!” Canghai Mingue wiped her tears as Qing Shui lifted her up by supporting her arms.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tears rolled down from Qing Hanye’s face as she turned around and ran. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why did you do that?” Canghai Mingyue asked softly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Let’s go to the Immortal Sword Sect and finish our business with them first.” Qing Shui forced a smile at Canghai Mingyue. He didn’t understand why he lashed out at Qing Hanye in the first place. But he couldn’t bring himself to apologize to her since he didn’t think he was wrong at all.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Forget it, let’s not think about that for now!” Qing Shui shook his head and sorted out his thoughts.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After that, Qing Shui arrived at the Immortal Sword Sect!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Immortal Sword Sect had already received news of their members’ deaths at Qing Shui’s hands. It was devastating to receive dire news about the deaths of their three members, especially when they were Elders. They took it as a threat and heightened their security with more guards.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The three Elders didn’t even manage to land a blow on that kid, yet they died by his hands. What should we do now?” An elderly man with a head of white hairs paced around the Immortal Sword Sect hall as he spoke. His hairs drooped down until they reached his waist. Back then, this man was one of the four elderly men who would always stand behind the Grand Elder. He was known as Elder Xiong, the strongest martial warrior amongst the four elders. However, he has since taken over the rights of being the head of the sect.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Elder Xiong, if we can find that person, she might be able to help you.” A middle-aged man from below piped up, frowning as he tried to think of a solution.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Who?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“That person from the Southern City Furniture Store!” The middle-aged man said &nbsp;mysteriously.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Wang Xing, do you mean the Sword Demon Huang Qing?” Elder Xiong’s eye brightened up.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes. No one else would be able to save us except Sword Demon Huang Qing from the Sword Tower.” Wang Xing said in a more serious tone.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Elder Xiong went silent. He knew that woman was a legendary Peak of Martial King warrior in the Greencloud Country who wielded a three feet long Greenedge Sword as her main weapon. She was also an official guard of the Sword Tower with status above an Elder, but she was never in Sword Tower doing her job. Instead, Huang Qing had been situated in the Southern City Furniture Store in the past recent years. No one even knew how old she was, but she was known to have a beautiful appearance. Even though her name was Huang Qing, others had given her the title of Demon Sword. Eventually, everyone started to call her Demon Sword Huang Qing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Moreover, no one knew why she joined Sword Tower since she had already risen to the level of the Peak of Martial King. Her origins were unknown to many, but some rumors pointed her origins back to the Central Continents, while some said she was from Eastern Victory Divine Continent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Wang Xing, would she come if we ask?” Elder Xiong frowned.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I am not sure. Immortal Sword Sect has always been affiliated with Sword Tower. Since she was an official guard of Sword Tower, she should be obliged to come and help us.” Wang Xing said after he thought about Elder Xiong’s question for a while.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Then go with Old Fu. Make haste and come back as soon as possible.” Elder Xiong stressed heavily on their swiftness to the situation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes, sir!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Wang Xing and a quiet elderly man left quickly after that!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…..</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, please spare them if they stop their resistance!” Canghai Mingyue pleaded to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Don’t worry, Mingyue. There are hundreds and thousands of disciples who are unrelated to our business. I will listen to you, but I can’t promise I will have mercy on them once they start revolting. Remember, they didn’t have mercy on us when we came back then.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had already equipped the Golden-Ringed Battle Armor and the Big Dipper Sword. Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li had also equipped the Tricolor Battle Skirts and boots respectively.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It became more convenient for Canghai Mingyue to store items inside the Interspatial Silk Satchel that Qing Shui had given to her. She and Huoyun Liu-Li were made aware that Qing Shui was in possession of an interspatial item, but they never inquired him on it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stood on the left side of Canghai Mingyue while Huoyun Liu-Li held the Demonic Stonegold Rabbit King in her arms and stood on her right side. The three of them walked towards the Southern Ancient Pass slowly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They felt a unique feeling at this moment!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They were getting closer to the Immortal Sword Sect. They could even see a number of people wearing a white Immortal Sword Sect uniform moving about!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hundreds of people wielding a longsword emblazoned with the Immortal Sword Sect emblem suddenly appeared in front of their path. All of them seemed to be roughly in their 30s.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Some looked nervous, and some of them looked fearless. Some scanned the area, as if they were looking for a place to escape.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was obvious what they were here for. They weren’t meant to defeat him, only obstruct him as decoys and impair his arrival to the Immortal Sword Sect. They took out their sharp swords, which refracted the light from the sun on their shiny surface, and were ready to die for their cause.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui frown in disapproval. He could tell that his opponents were trying to stall for time by using their weakest pawns as scapegoats.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Do they have higher-skilled martial warriors as their backup? Or maybe they were able to call upon a skilled warrior?” Qing Shui was skeptical about the situation, or else the Immortal Sword Sect elders would not have sent their weakest warriors to defend themselves.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Either they wanted to sacrifice their men as a way to sate Qing Shui’s hunger for blood, or they intended to increase his bloodlust….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui went closer to the mass of sect disciples. He used his imposing force as a way to urge their escape to prevent any unnecessary bloodshed. These men could not stave off Qing Shui’s aura, as a few of them had already “slided down the slope” and disappeared from sight.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As soon as that happened, the others quickly followed and ran away! After all, it would be insane to willingly seek one’s doom when they were offered the option to live.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After they escaped, another batch of people appeared. These people were also in their 30s, but their strength felt unbalanced as a whole. They may be stronger than the previous group, but their maximum strength could only be placed at the Peak of Houtian.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui began to cast an imposing force once more so that they would retreat. They were no match for him, which was why Qing Shui felt that it was unnecessary to even start a fight with them. From the beginning, it was destined to be a rough journey for them to travel.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Then, after about a hundred meters!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A group of Elementary stage Xiantian martial warriors appeared!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stopped and waved one of his hands into the air!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He summoned the Diamond Demonic Boar from the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li were shocked at the sudden appearance of the beast. It was their first time seeing an actual Diamond Demonic Beast appearing in front of them. However, it was expected for them to be surprised since this was a rare sight to witness!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was able to let off the martial warriors below the level of Xiantian, but he could not do the same for the Xiantian martial warriors blocking his path. Although they had obtained special privileges to disregard some mediocre rules and regulations, all of their actions - whether good or bad, would have an influence against the society.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After he had taken three breaths waiting for movement, no one did anything! Qing Shui decided to make the first move and flung his hand in the air while commanding the Diamond Demonic Boar to kill the mass of people in front of him!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Diamond Demonic Boar went on a rampage against the Xiantian martial warriors akin to “a tiger amongst a flock of sheep”. The martial warriors tried to retaliate by stabbing their swords into its body. However, the boar let out a sharp painful cry while continuing its murderous spree.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ahh!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ahhhh!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The air was filled with endless piercing screams. Blood spilled over every inch of the ground, staining every path with corpses. It was at this time that Qing Shui experienced an uncertain change inside him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">What a bloody and messy murder!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The whole scene was a definition of a merciless massacre. He would have been one of them if he didn’t meet the saviors of his life.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt calmer after seeing the pool of blood on the ground!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He felt like going all the way now that he had made his decision to walk this bloody path. It would not be considered a shame to die by the blade of a sword. Their death would be tantamount to a mighty general who fought to the death in a battlefield. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After a while, everything went silent. Qing Shui knew he was getting closer to the Immortal Sword Sect as he caught a glimpse of the gate not far from where he was standing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There were about a hundred people guarding the front of the gate. The youngest of them all was grizzled with streaks of white hair, and a few more were already covered in a full set of white hairs. Even though they looked old, they were clearly vigorous and energetic. However, they also felt quite anxious about the outcome of this fight when pitted against Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mingyue, Liu-Li!” As soon as he called out to them, Qing Shui immediately summoned Firebird from the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The ladies were not taken by surprise by the summoning because they had already anticipated Qing Shui being in possession of a Beast Tamer’s “Interspatial Beast King Medallion”!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Essentially, the Beast Tamer’s “Interspatial Beast King Medallion” had a similar function to that of a Interspatial Silk Sachet, but instead of random non-living items, it could only keep beasts that had been tamed by its owner.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The “Interspatial Beast King Medallion” was made from the energy harnessed by a Beast Tamer, which would be imbued into a “Jade Crystal Beast Bone” to create a whole new dimension identical to the dimension inside the Interspatial Silk Sachet.</p>
