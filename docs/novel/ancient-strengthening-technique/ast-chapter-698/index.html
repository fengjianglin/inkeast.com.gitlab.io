 <p><strong>AST 698 - ‘Paralyzing’ Effect, Immortal Fox Lake</strong></p>
 <p>Obscure Realm Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was feeling really happy at this very moment because after reaching the Obscure Realm, there was a chance for the Heavenly Thunder Slash to stun enemies. The duration of the effect would depend on their strength.</p>
 <p>The only thing he was uncertain about was the chances of his opponents getting stunned. However, Qing Shui had a feeling that it wouldn't be big or else it would be too heaven defying. It goes without saying that this attack was definitely going to turn out to be really dangerous. Once warriors became as strong as Qing Shui, getting paralyzed for even an instant can lead to fatal injuries.</p>
 <p>The reason why Qing Shui dedicated lots of time and hard work into training the Heavenly Thunder Slash, was all for this very function, to stun opponents. After all, the Heavenly Thunder Slash at both the Obscure Realm and Truth Realm provided the same 30% boost to his raw strength.</p>
 <p>Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thrust out his fist!</p>
 <p>A few faint violet light spots flashed across his fist. In between the spots, it seemed as if there were threads binding them together as they shone, making it feel illusory.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui watched as the electrical thunderweb sort of thing attached itself to his fist, this was one of the effects of Obscure Realm. Qing Shui knew that the so called electrical thunderweb was the thing that was capable of stunning opponents.</p>
 <p>Snap!</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui thrust out his fist, a clear noise could be heard. There was also an extremely weak snake hissing noise mixed in it.</p>
 <p>The breakthrough of the Heavenly Thunder Slash this time caused Qing Shui to be incomparably surprised. For a long time he had stopped having much hope of the Heavenly Thunder Slash reaching the Obscure Realm because whenever he thought that it would break through, he would be disappointed. Eventually, he found out it wasn't something that could be achieved within one or two days. Ever since then, there were no longer even traces of it happening.</p>
 <p>This was how Qing Shui forgot about it. Even though he would still cultivate it consistently everyday, he wouldn't think about when it would break through. This was truly an unexpected joy for Qing Shui. He was sure that the Heavenly Thunder Slash would play a crucial role in some of his battles to come.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was more adapted to fighting long battles. The longer the battle, the better the chance of successfully stunning his opponent. As soon as the stunning effect appeared, Qing Shui would be able to perform his killer move at that very instant.</p>
 <p>At the instant the opponents were stunned, their body’s resistance to any form of attacks would drop. This was the unique ability of a stunning effect.</p>
 <p>The night went on peacefully. On the second day, the two set off on their journey towards the Immortal Fox Lake located at the center of the valley. Qing Shui had already found out that the center part of the Immortal Fox Valley was very dangerous.</p>
 <p>Immortal Fox Lake was located right in the middle of the Immortal Fox Valley. In other words, it was the most dangerous place. Also, the Immortal Fox Lake provided the area with water that contained the most spiritual energy, the most powerful demonic beasts would be found living in that area.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, Hai Dongqing got the Silver Spirit Beast. This reassured Qing Shui a little. Hai Dongqing told Qing Shui about the two powerful abilities which the Silver Spirit Beast possessed, making him also look forward to seeing them.</p>
 <p>Silver Spirit Protection!</p>
 <p>When the Silver Spirit Beast used this battle technique, a powerful reflective force would be formed around his body. The effect would last for fifteen minutes. During that time, even though it couldn’t initiate any attacks, it would also be protected from all sorts of enemies’ attacks. It could choose to either run away or clash against warriors or demonic beasts in his way.</p>
 <p>It’s an insane battle technique for survival and it was at least a false Divine Skill</p>
 <p>Qing Shui told her to not worry about him and use this battle technique if ever they were to run into a situation where there was no way out. The Silver Spirit Beast was still considerably fast when it comes to running and flying. It had the formidable speed element battle technique, Silver Spirit Flash.</p>
 <p>Silver Spirit Flash!</p>
 <p>Upon using it, the caster would be able to receive a significant speed boost with no time restrictions. The more exhaustion the caster suffered from, the more significant the increase in speed would be. At most, the caster would experience a five times increase in speed.</p>
 <p>These were the two battle techniques of the Silver Spirit Beast that Qing Shui knew about. Merely these two techniques were already enough to make the Silver Spirit Beast a top-notch mount. Additionally, Qing Shui could already tell that the Silver Spirit Beast had insanely powerful offensive type battle techniques just from these two battle techniques.</p>
 <p>All of these helped Qing Shui lessen his worries over Hai Dongqing. Qing Shui felt a lot less anxious than before. However, it was now Hai Dongqing’s turn to be worried for Qing Shui. After all, no matter how strong Qing Shui was, it would still be impossible for him to fight a large group of Peak Martial Saint demonic beasts alone.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, are you sure that you can proceed or step back freely?” As the two proceeded towards the center part of the valley, Hai Dongqing felt more and more nervous. She wasn’t nervous for herself. On the contrary, she was feeling nervous for Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“I’m fine. You’re the one i’m worried about. I’m scared I won’t be able to take care of you.” Qing Shui had the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s Instantaneous Diamond Evasion. Most importantly, he also possessed the Nine Continent’s Boots.</p>
 <p>“You don’t have to be worried about me. If we were to run into any crisis, you have to remember to take care of yourself. The Silver Spirit Beast can help you escape.” Hai Dongqing said seriously.</p>
 <p>“This is a Vital Essence Pill and this is a Gale Pellet. The Vital Essence Pill can instantly replenish the energy which you consumed whereas the Gale Pellet can help you double your speed for fifteen minutes. You can also stack the effect with other pills to increase the boost. This is a Clear Wind Fruit. On your first time taking it, it can help both permanently boost your speed by 50% and simultaneously provide a temporary 50% boost in speed for fifteen minutes. Of course, the effect can be stacked with other pills.” Qing Shui passed the medicinal pills to her while explaining to her about each and every one of their functions.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing was aware of how precious these things were, but for now, she could only accept them. She realized that she was becoming more and more indebted to the man in front of her. She no longer knew how she could repay him because it was something which she could never afford to pay back.</p>
 <p>The demonic beasts, which they ran into along the way, were also getting more and more powerful. Later on, they even ran into huge herds of demonic beasts. The two had no choice but to avoid them. Only in this moment did they get to experience how terrifying a colony of huge demonic beasts were. Those at Peak Martial Saint Grade were particularly terrifying.</p>
 <p>Just like this, Hai Dongqing followed Qing Shui and the two were constantly on the move for a week. If they didn’t see any demonic beasts, they would ride on their demonic beasts and rush through. Whereas if they ran into some not so powerful demonic beasts, they would summon their own demonic beasts and go head-to-head with them. Now that they’re getting closer and closer to Immortal Fox Lake, the speed at which they progressed also slowed down as the demonic beasts which they ran into got stronger and stronger.</p>
 <p>Dong-dong…...</p>
 <p>Following a loud noise, the ground below their feet started shaking. The noise came all the way through from afar. Very quickly, they could see an enormous beast the size of a small mountain in the distance.</p>
 <p>It was a yellow colored enormous beast. Its appearance resembled that of both a turtle and a chameleon. Its limbs looked thick but a bit short. Despite this, its entire body looked as if it was made of diamonds.</p>
 <p>It had an enormous head with an oversized mouth. The mouth was full of sharp teeth, letting out an eerie aura which made people tremble from head to toe.</p>
 <p>Earth Dragon Beast!</p>
 <p>As soon as Qing Shui spotted the big guy, he started feeling anxious. The Earth Dragon Beast was an enormous and formidable demonic beast. It didn’t really have a dragon’s bloodline within its body. To be more precise, it could only be considered to be an enormous beast. It has a malevolent and fierce physical appearance and it’s known by others as the Earth Dragon Beast.</p>
 <p>It should be almost the White Jade Jiao’s equal in terms of strength. However, Qing Shui was still a bit worried because this was a fierce demonic beast. Not only that but quite often it would appear in groups, which was what truly concerned Qing Shui the most.</p>
 <p>Only one Earth Dragon Beast appeared this time. It was about thirty meters long, yet it already made people felt that it was really huge. This was because other demonic beasts mostly had long and thin bodies while the Earth Dragon Beast’s size was comparable to that of a small mountain in terms of both the length and width.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing Qing Shui, Hai Dongqing, Diamond Gigantic Elephant and Silver Spirit Beast, the Earth Dragon Beast let out a mad scream and charged towards them. Maybe because it usually moved in groups, it never experienced any kind of danger. In any case, they thought that it would be alright as long as they charged in towards their target like a swarm of bees.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui first observed his surroundings. When he noticed that the Earth Dragon Beast was the only thing within sight, he quickly summoned the Fire Bird and immediately tossed bundles of Heavenly Talismans at it.</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>Fiery Golden Eyes!</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>After that, the Fire Bird let out a reverberating chirp and its whole body glowed red!</p>
 <p>Phoenix Dance of the Nine Heavens!</p>
 <p>After that, a jet-black colored flame</p>
 <p>Art of Pursuing!</p>
 <p>Combination Sword Technique!</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Kong-kong…...</p>
 <p>“Run quickly, there are going to be even more Earth Dragon Beasts in a while.” Qing Shui told Hai Dongqing to leave quickly.</p>
 <p>This time, it was fast and easy to kill the Earth Dragon Beast because it had a weakness. It was already really slow to begin with, so as Qing Shui continued to weaken it, its speed was basically considered to be crippled. The Fire Bird on the other hand, was incomparably fast, especially when it was in the state of Dancing Phoenix of the Nine Heavens.</p>
 <p>The Earth Dragon Beast could do nothing but get beaten up. Its desperate roaring noise caused Qing Shui to feel fearful. Luckily, the weakened Earth Dragon Beast couldn’t take any of the Fire Bird’s fierce attacks.</p>
 <p>In a little while, the enormous Earth Dragon Beast had already been burnt to ashes. Qing Shui quickly left with Hai Dongqing who was stunned. She was still immersed in the shock she experienced a while ago.</p>
 <p>A demonic beast with strength almost equivalent to a human warrior that passed Peak Grade One Martial Saint. To think that it would take him only a moment to burn it to ashes without any chance of a counterattack. What kind of strength would it require for someone to do that?</p>
 <p>She only saw Qing Shui moving occasionally and initiating a few attacks and the Earth Dragon Beast was already almost burnt dead by the mighty Fire Bird. How could this not amaze her.</p>
 <p>Only now did she finally understand that the amount of strength that Qing Shui demonstrated in the past was only the tip of the iceberg. He was already able to kill an Earth Dragon Beast just with his demonic beasts, so what kind of strength did he truly possess? He was so young. The most terrifying thing about him was the incredible rate at which his cultivation grew.</p>
 <p>Back when they were in Green Cloud Continent, Hai Dongqing already felt that this man was extraordinary. Later on, she realized that the rate at which his cultivation level progressed was incredibly fast and to her surprise, during the time when he came to Central Continent, he had already achieved this kind of level of strength.</p>
 <p>Along the way, Qing Shui yet again eliminated a few demonic beasts almost at the level of the Earth Dragon Beast. Luckily, he had the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, It would only take the Fire Bird half an hour in the real world to use the Phoenix Dance of the Nine Heavens because of the different time flow between the realm and the external world.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui weakened his enemy, particularly when it was with the Poison Needle Sting of the Jade Emperor Queen Bee, he would be able to fatally wound his enemies in the State of One with Elephant. But he would need to use the Critical Damage technique.</p>
 <p>By now, the two had long since retrieved all of their demonic beasts. They continued their journey to the Immortal Fox Lake with caution. The Immortal Fox Lake was already within sight.</p>
 <p>The Immortal Fox Lake wasn’t really big. Nevertheless, it should most likely still have a diameter which exceeded twenty li. Traces of spiritual fluctuations could be felt coming out of the jade green lakewater. The plants in this place were shockingly close to each other. This was also a place where Qing Shui and Hai Dongqing could hide.</p>
 <p>Constantly there were enormous demonic beasts and flying beasts appearing from the side of Immortal Fox Lake. Normally, they would leave after they finished drinking the water here. Of course, there would be some that preferred to stay here. In fact, some would even begin laying prone on the ground to take a nap.</p>
 <p>Both Qing Shui and Hai Dongqing hid in the gaps between three enormous trees. Even though it was only considered a gap, it had enough space for three people to stand side by side in it. The three enormous trees with unequal height together formed a gap the size of a small room.</p>
 <p>From a large demonic beast’s point of view, there were almost no gaps in this place. This was the best hiding spot which Qing Shui and Hai Dongqing found after looking around for a long time.</p>
