 <p><strong>AST 921 - Killing with Heart Toxin Talisman, The Dust Settles, Spirit Gathering Formation</strong></p>
 <p>Pale faced Qing Shui had suffered quite heavy injuries and found it hard to fend off this sabre attack. He took out the Crystal Physique Card the old man had given him, slapping down two Crystal Physique Card on himself, one to increase his defense, another to increase his speed.</p>
 <p>At the start, Qing Shui didn’t want to rely on external items but eventually, he didn’t have any choice about using them. After applying them, when he took out a speed reducing Crystal Physique Card and wanted to throw it out, he quickly took out a Heart Toxin Talisman and threw them toward the old man who was now not very far away.</p>
 <p>The Heart Toxin Talisman would definitely hit and the other speed reducing item seemed like it would hit as well...</p>
 <p>The Crystal Physique Card he had slapped down on himself instantly fused into his body and a layer of “shell casing” seemed to have formed on the surface of his skin. At the same time, his body was filled with energy, especially in his legs.</p>
 <p>This was the feeling of having his speed augmented!</p>
 <p>The old man gradually slowed down before he stopped not far away from Qing Shui, causing Qing Shui to feel puzzled. Even though the effect of the speed reducing Crystal Physique Card was very good, it shouldn’t be to the extent of causing his opponent to come to a stop.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw his eyes, he finally understood that it was because his Heart Toxin Talisman had taken effect. Right now, that murky pair of eyes was filled with pain and regret...</p>
 <p>In one look, Qing Shui could guess that this old man had done something which he had regretted before and it was something that was unknown to others. However, it was something which could make him regret for life. To him, it should be like a nightmare.</p>
 <p>A scene that the old man could never forget appeared before the old man’s eyes. Or rather, it could be said that he could no longer differentiate if it was reality or a dream. It was because it was something he had done and right now, he was looking right at it.</p>
 <p>He saw the scene of him killing his wife and children. In that scene, he had totally lost his mind. He now knew that he had been framed by other people and someone had used “Mesmerizing Heart Powder” on him. He only knew of this at a later time. Back then, the other party had wanted to push him to his wits end.</p>
 <p>His wife and kids had called out to him repeatedly, asking him to wake up. There were also two young kids who were only three years old and were crying out and calling for their father. However, he still killed them...</p>
 <p>The old man trembled. He had gotten stronger since then and although he had wiped out the entire clan of his enemy, it wasn’t enough to erase the regret in his heart, especially when he recalled the innocent cries of his three year old son and daughter calling out for him, their father…</p>
 <p>They were still kids and they were his kids. To think that he could actually bear to do such a thing to them. For so many years, he had been woken up from his sleep due to the pain of this “mental agony”. Up to today, he had not married another woman and did not have more kids of his own.</p>
 <p>“Daddy…”</p>
 <p>In the scene, two helpless young kids were grabbing onto his leg, calling out to him nonstop.</p>
 <p>A trickle of blood flowed down the corner of his lips. No matter if one was evil or good, they were still human and they would still have emotions. This event could be said to be a burden weighing down on the old man’s heart. Every time he recalled it, he would have the urge to kill himself. And every time, his heart would be as if it was being cut repeatedly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw that blood kept flowing down from the corner of the old man’s lips and heaved a sigh of relief. The fact that the old man was injured was secondary. Most importantly, a mental injury would cause more damage than a physical one.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had not expected that the Heart Toxin Talisman could actually cripple this old man. He knew that it could bring up what was troubling one the most. Which person could live a life without any regrets, one in which they had done no wrong? No one was perfect and the Heart Toxin Talisman could let them recall what they regretted or what that had pained them the most. In that moment the person’s mental state would become extremely fragile and might even go crazy from the agony. The Heart Toxin Talisman could also make people who were rash develop an illusion, causing them to feel numb and to do things they would never usually dare to do.</p>
 <p>This was how terrifying the Heart Toxin Talisman was. It attacked one’s mind!</p>
 <p>The Heart Toxin Talisman was meant to be used for dealing with evil people and it would be best if it was an evildoer who had a hint of humanity, so that it could be used to attack the person’s mind. However, if the person was cold-blooded, it would be practically useless. However, it would still be possible to numb the opponent through one’s desires. It was impossible for one to be completely void of emotions and desires…</p>
 <p>It was evident that this old man had yet to attain the stage of “devoid of emotions”. He had already lost. Qing Shui was in no hurry to take action. Right now, he would be able to kill him easily.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui didn’t do it. He wanted to let the old man think back to the past or rather to repent. Although it was painful, sometimes it was a means of recollecting the past. Therefore, he didn’t take any action.</p>
 <p>The old man trembled slightly before he said, “Can you promise me one thing?”</p>
 <p>His voice was very hoarse. Qing Shui also felt that the old man’s vitality was running out. He had only half a day of life span left at most.</p>
 <p>When a person was on his deathbed, even his words would sound kind. Moreover, it wouldn’t hurt for him to listen. Therefore, Qing Shui nodded.</p>
 <p>“I have half a day left to live at most. But you don’t have to worry. I’ll kill myself. I only hope that you don’t harm my ride. I hope to let it bring me to where I want to die.” At this moment, the old man’s face seemed very serene.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hesitated before he nodded.</p>
 <p>“Sky Prison Sect has already been disbanded and will not be able to get back on its feet. This is fate” as if he could sense Qing Shui’s emotions, the old man said gradually.</p>
 <p>Hearing the old man’s words, Qing Shui could now rest assured. The issue with the Sky Prison Sect was over. He nodded and looked at the old man. Both of them fell silent. Qing Shui was waiting, waiting for the old man to leave.</p>
 <p>The old man looked at the sun which was as bright as ever. However, the old man’s heart was heavy. After so many years, he still couldn’t get past himself. He had always thought himself to be a heartless person, but he now knew that he had just been deceiving himself all this time.</p>
 <p>Their fight had started in the air and eventually it was moved to the ground. The old man looked toward the other old man who had been corroded by the Corrosive Poison Web and was not far from him. The old man then thrust his Sky Prison Sabre into his chest.</p>
 <p>He could now be reunited with his wife and children. He could now explain to them what had happened back then. He could repent before them. He missed them a lot…</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood there quietly, looking at the old man who slowly fell down but was wearing a serene smile. Qing Shui let out a long breath. The old man could be said to be free now.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui placed the old man onto that Wolf-Headed Jadewater Hawk, not evening moving the sabre. He watched as the Wolf-Headed Jadewater Hawk left his vision and it was only then that fresh blood trickled down the corner of his lips.</p>
 <p>He wiped it off. His injuries were not very serious but were not light either. However, he could treat them himself. He put away the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb and the other violet colored Sky Prison Sabre.</p>
 <p>“He’s won!” Mu Qing looked at that silhouette which was not considered very tall. However, at this moment, she felt that he was even taller than the mountain peak which had reached into the clouds.</p>
 <p>“He’s won!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Many people from the Mu Clan heaved a sigh of relief. At a point of life and death, many of them felt very scared. Maybe a lot of them might not be afraid of death but they couldn’t withstand the atmosphere before death arrived. Moreover, many of them couldn’t really let go of everything and would definitely have things they couldn’t put down. It was like how people who committed suicide tended to be people who no longer had anything in this world which they would miss and they felt disheartened with this world.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, more people came to pay their respects at the wake. As time passed by, more and more powerful sects from the city sent people over. There were even some from reputable sects and clans who were no weaker than the Sky Prison Sect who had sent representatives.</p>
 <p>There were also people from Dong Clan and Sun Clan as well.</p>
 <p>All the way until the afternoon, when they were preparing to move the coffin, the sounds of someone coming to pay their respects were heard.</p>
 <p>The Godly Sword Clan has arrived!</p>
 <p>Many people from the Mu Clan were stunned. To think that the most powerful sect in the city, the Godly Sword Clan had come. Mu Fengyang quickly stepped up, dressed in his mourning clothes. At this stage, they still got a shock when they heard that people from the Godly Sword Clan had come.</p>
 <p>More than ten people came. The one in the lead was a middle-aged man who stood upright, wearing a set of white clothes with some parts colored gold. A crimson long sabre was embroidered on the clothes, giving the elegant and handsome man an additional sharp disposition.</p>
 <p>“Senior, I heard that the Mu Clan’s Old Ancestor passed away. Our Old Ancestor has sent us here to pay our respects” the middle-aged man put his hands together and said to Mu Fengyang.</p>
 <p>“Please help extend my thanks. This way please!” Mu Fengyang said calmly.</p>
 <p>What person was Mu Fengyang? How could he not understand the reason why they had come? There could only be two possibilities. The first one was because the Mu Clan now had the right to enter the circle of the strongest factions in the city. Thus, the Godly Sword Clan had come forth to build good relations and become friends or allies with them. Another possibility was that they were here to check out their abilities and then, while they were still suffering from casualties, to nip this potential threat in the bud while it was still growing.</p>
 <p>However the representatives the Godly Sword Clan had sent were juniors. Therefore, chances were that it was the first possibility. This was a great chance for the Mu Clan.</p>
 <p>After the guy had paid his respects, he didn’t stay long and turned to leave. Mu Fengyang sent him off himself.</p>
 <p>“Senior, after the funeral, Old Ancestor hopes that everyone can meet up,” when Mu Fengyang sent him to the door, the guy said softly to Mu Fengyang.</p>
 <p>“Alright, I’ll definitely find a day and head over in person.”</p>
 <p>“Senior, there’s no need to send us off any further. We’ll take our leave!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Qing Shui watched from afar as the man left. The Godly Sword Clan did very well and didn’t pursue the “insignificant” things. For example, with Mu Clan’s old man dead, who was it who had killed the two old men from the Sky Prison Sect? Even if they knew that it was him, they didn’t ask. After all, they were here to attend the funeral.</p>
 <p>The funeral procession went ahead as planned. A good time was selected for the old man to be buried. It was a tiring day mentally for Qing Shui and he went back for an early rest.</p>
 <p>In the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui laid down on the bed, feeling relaxed. Everything had come to a close and he had reaped a lot of rewards. It was a pity that he wouldn’t be able to return for the new year. The things here should still take some time. He had promised Mu Clan’s old man and he would need to help the Mu Clan strengthen their standing here a little bit more before he left.</p>
 <p>Cultivation, creating formations, drawing talismans…</p>
 <p>Refining poison, tempering treasures, forging…</p>
 <p>There were many things which Qing Shui had to do. Every day Qing Shui would set up the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation once but he would fail every single time. He was now used to it. It was as if it would be abnormal if he were to succeed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know he was stubborn. Right now, the Duality Minutest Formation and Nine Palace Steps had reached quite high levels. It would be very hard to bring them to a higher level. He would need more time.</p>
 <p>The Five Elements Minor Formation was a training which required coordination with other people and thus Qing Shui didn’t study too much into it after he had taught it to Mu Qing and the others. Right now, other than studying the Nine Palace Eight Trigrams Formation, he spent most of his effort on the Spirit Gathering Formation.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui had set up the formation before and could do it despite barely succeeding, there were many benefits to the Spirit Gathering Formation. For example, if some precious medicinal herbs were used to set up the formation, it could allow the medicinal herbs to grow better and their quality would be raised greatly as well. It could also be used to improve the demonic beasts’ growth. It could even be used to increase the rate of his cultivation if he were to set up the formation next to him when he was cultivating.</p>
