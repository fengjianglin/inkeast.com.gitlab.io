 <p><strong>AST 884 - Taming A Five-Headed Demonic Spider</strong></p>
 <p>The demonic spider seemed to have lost its battle wits the moment the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace appeared within its vicinity. This kind of situation had happened before, and the affected beast would be weakened greatly in terms of its power and it would be inflicted with intense fright as well. If the beast was used for demon refining, it would rather fight to its death than subject to itself to the immolation to the demon refining. Of course, it would not retaliate as long as Qing Shui wasn’t planning on using it for demon refining.</p>
 <p>The Five-Headed Demonic Beast fixed its gleaming green eyes on the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace with uneasiness. The beast remained still, and somewhat ignored Qing Shui who was standing on the side. He didn’t mind one bit and continued to assess the situation between the beast and the furnace.</p>
 <p>Capturing the demonic beast was initially difficult, as the spider possessed a strength that may prove to be too powerful for Qing Shui to handle. However, the spider’s powers were already debuffed, and he also had the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace to assist him in the acquisition process. Hopefully, Qing Shui thought, the capturing process would go much smoother without any sudden problems.</p>
 <p>If he could capture a demonic beast like this, he would be able to cultivate it and make it stronger with the aid of his medicinal pills. Moreover, he had a feeling that he could use those ‘pellets’ to restore the severed heads and this could also allow the spider to gain an exponential increase in its ability.</p>
 <p>The spider already possessed an impeccable strength, which almost felt like the strength verging into the realm of the Martial Emperor. Maybe if he tried it this time……..</p>
 <p>A sense of excitement overwhelmed Qing Shui’s heart as he glanced at the half-crippled Five-Headed Demonic Spider. Both the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and Fire Bird still had a long way to go to achieve their next growth and Qing Shui was already content with the Thunderous Beast as a semi-automatic battle beast with the capability to act accordingly. He had rarely used the Jade Emperor Queen Bee and the Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies in his battles, and the horde of Jade Emperor Bees had been assigned to harvest the Queen Bee Nectar instead.</p>
 <p>Even though the Five-Headed Demonic Spider wasn’t a ranged attacker, the beast had the potential to become even greater and more powerful than its current form. For the time being, Qing Shui deemed the Five-Headed Demonic Spider potentially useful for his subsequent battles. With such potential, this beast could even achieve multiple breakthroughs to become an extremely superior battle beast in its destined future.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s spiritual energy enveloped the Five-Headed Demonic Spider carefully and gently.</p>
 <p>The spiritual energy then promptly entered into the spider’s mind. It was more convenient and easier for Qing Shui as the beast only had one head remaining on its body. If he had to tame this demonic beast while it had multiple heads, he might encounter extreme difficulties in his endeavor - essentially, it would be impossible.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Qing Shui repeatedly hit the surface of the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace as the energy from his body transferred into it in a consistent flow. The gleaming light surrounding the ancient air of the furnace glowed brighter, followed by a series of faint beast callings echoing in the air. The spiritual callings felt magnificent and shuddering, which was sufficient to frighten this demonic beast with absolute certainty.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s spiritual energy continuously disrupted the spider’s spiritual energy as he tried to make the spider recognize his superior power and authority. With the furnace’s terrifying ability, the Five-Headed Demonic Spider had no choice but to concede to its fear as it shivered in uneasiness.</p>
 <p>Just then, Qing Shui took out a pellet that was refined from the core of the deity statue. He had made up his mind - if he could capture this demonic beast, then essentially he had nothing to worry about within the 30,000 li depth of Sky Penetrating Mountains. After all, the Five-Headed Demonic Spider could be considered a powerful demonic beast with a territorial dominance characteristic.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took the Crimson Pellet and placed it in front of the Five-Headed Demonic Beast. He continued to infuse his Qi into the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace while targeting the Five-Headed Demonic Spider with his spiritual energy to distract the beast from resisting the temptations of the Crimson Pellet.</p>
 <p>Demonic beasts and humans were made different. No matter how strong a demonic beast was, its intellectual capability could never be compared to that of a human being. Once the demonic beast had validated one person, it would not change its mind. The stronger the demonic beast was, the more loyal it would become. This was also the case for the Five-Headed Demonic Spider. If it were to accept Qing Shui’s ‘pellet’ willingly, then it would swear loyalty to him for eternity.</p>
 <p>The possibility of the Five-Headed Demonic Spider being a demonic beast king was of no concern to Qing Shui any longer. A demonic beast king could only be captured by experienced beast tamers or those with unique bloodlines, albeit with the same low capture rate. Qing Shui admitted his excellence over beast tamers, but as for the cultivators with a unique bloodline, he had only heard rumors about them and never had the chance to acquaint himself with one.</p>
 <p>Time was ticking away and Qing Shui began to feel nervous. When he caught the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable back then, he had used a Flower of Life to tame it. Now that he had encountered the Five-Headed Demonic Spider in this area, he decided to capture it first before he began his journey to find the Sky Penetrating Grass at the peak of the mountain.</p>
 <p>The Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies though, were an unexpected case. They were easily captured after they had succumbed to the presence of the Jade Emperor Queen Bee.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know if the Five-Headed Demonic Spider had other weaknesses but he was certain that the spider was half a step into the Martial Emperor realm - its breakthrough was near.</p>
 <p>However, the demonic spider could easily lose its life whilst pursuing the breakthrough to Martial Emperor if was not careful. Demonic beasts have a stronger desire for power compared to most human beings. In their world, the laws of the jungle were everything - the strong would always rule over the weak.</p>
 <p>Qing laughed as he saw the Five-Headed Demonic Spider struggling to escape from the temptations of the Crimson Pellet. The spider was tempted by its desire, but couldn’t bring itself to fall into Qing Shui’s trap. This was his plan all along - it was crucial for the demonic beast to recognize its owner for the taming process to be complete. Most demonic beasts would not recognize a weak person as their owner. In the spider’s perspective, Qing Shui could be considered strong since he was able to severe four of its heads at once, much to its contempt.</p>
 <p>Demonic beasts have simple thoughts, any form of assault - sneak attack or by poisonous means - were essentially the same to them. In a way, that might have contributed to the spider’s hesitation toward the pellet. Of course, Qing Shui’s Primordial Demon Refining Furnace definitely had a huge effect on this spider, but the most lethally enticing factor right now would be the Crimson Pellet in front of its eyes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui currently had an 80% chance of capturing the spider. With a boost of confidence, he took out eight more Crimson Pellets and swayed them in front of the demonic beast. He did so to tempt the spider into submission as the Crimson Pellets could only be consumed twice at most. Anything more would be useless and ineffective.</p>
 <p>After the time it took for an incense to burn had passed, the Five-Headed Demonic Spider finally opened its enormous mouth.</p>
 <p>With a smile curved on his face, Qing Shui was quite ecstatic as he took a Crimson Pellet and hurled it into the Five-Headed Demonic Spider’s mouth.</p>
 <p>It was a success!</p>
 <p>This spider was truly a demonic beast at the Peak Martial Saint level. Even so, he believed that the beast could potentially become a Martial Emperor of the lowest level in due time. Even though Qing Shui didn’t have a good understanding of the Martial Emperor grade, he had a feeling that the Golden Jiao and the woman in the crystal coffin were both Martial Emperors of the lowest level as well.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought that it would be best for the Five-Headed Demonic Spider to quickly advance into the Martial Emperor Realm since it had already become his own demonic beast after all.</p>
 <p>The spider gave a loud piercing screech, as if it was telling Qing Shui that it had become significantly stronger.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui approached the spider with his physical senses suppressed and his spiritual sense expanded. The energy capacity of the Five-Headed Demonic Spider kept increasing at an accelerated rate, flowing violently between its veins to refine every part of its body.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, one of the severed parts of the spider began to form an obscure flesh surrounded by blood, until the figure finally began to form into a ferocious head. The head seemed slightly different, with the color of the head becoming as white as the moon. Qing Shui discovered that the spider had forced out a fresh new head with the use of its energy despite it being painful to do so. The spider wouldn’t have become this miserable had Qing Shui not sliced off its heads in the first place.</p>
 <p>The third pellet!</p>
 <p>Fourth pellet!</p>
 <p>And the fifth pellet!</p>
 <p>The pellets had allowed the Five-Headed Demonic Spider to not only recover its powers fully, but to allow the spider to grow stronger in the process. The growth of the spider had essentially confirmed his suspicion, that the core used for the concoction of the Crimson Pellet was indeed from a powerful Divine Beast.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn't care less whether the core was from a Divine Beast or not. As long as the Crimson Pellet could benefit him in a long run, then it was enough. Qing Shui was elated as he looked at his demonic beast proudly. He had finally succeeded in taming the Five-Headed Demonic Spider on his own.</p>
 <p>The energy capacity of the Five-Headed Demonic Spider had slowly returned to normal. As the beast cocked its head toward Qing Shui again, he took out another Crimson Pellet and fed it to the spider.</p>
 <p>The Five-Headed Demonic Spider remained still as it slumped onto the ground as Qing Shui looked on silently and patiently. He could feel a large portion of the energy within the spider fluctuating rapidly and increasingly forceful.</p>
 <p>Screech!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was almost deafened by the piercing cry of the spider!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui opened his eyes and retreated immediately, while at the same time, the Five-Headed Demonic Spider exuded a faint layer of light akin to the glow of the pale white moon.</p>
