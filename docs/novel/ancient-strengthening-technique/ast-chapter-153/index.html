  <p><strong>AST 0153 – Golden Needles, Strengthening of the Constitution</strong></p>
  <p>“Mother, I may be leaving Hundred Miles City after the new year. What plans do you guys have? Will everyone follow me to settle down in Cang Lang Country or remain in Hundred Miles City?” Qing Shui felt that he needed to get this problem resolved!</p>
  <p>After hearing Qing Shui’s words, everyone in the Qing Clan, including Qing Yi, all turned silent. Qing Yi raised her head and looked towards the rest. “Everyone, speak up. Do we stay in Hundred Miles City or head to Cang Lang Country?”</p>
  <p>“Brother Qing Shui, what is Cang Lang Country like? Is it even more beautiful?” Qing Bei yearningly said as her eyes brimmed with stars.</p>
  <p>“I have no idea. I have not been there before!” Qing Shui looked at her curious gaze speechlessly!</p>
  <p>“Our roots are in Qing Village. It doesn’t matter whether we’re at Hundred Miles City or Cang Lang Country. It’d be good if there are many opportunities in Cang Lang Country. If settling there is too rough, we might as well stay in Hundred Miles City!” Qing Yi eventually raised her concerns.</p>
  <p>“Actually, if we were to go to Cang Lang Country, there would still be plenty of opportunities for us. I have some things with me that can aid our growth in Cang Lang Country. You guys only have to decide whether to go or not!” Qing Shui thought about it. After the new year, he would have 500 Drunken Fragrance Fruits. This alone would allow them to set up a shop and feed the whole Qing Clan. There would be even more chances in the future!</p>
  <p>Qing Yi saw that all three generations of the Qing Clan had passion in their eyes. Actually, Qing Yi had also looked forward to Cang Lang Country. After all, it was the most developed city in Cang Lang Country, and had the highest population due its numerous clans.</p>
  <p>“Then it’s decided. If there are no issues, we will all head to Cang Lang Country. Old Master supports Qing Shui in all his decisions. So whether or not we will go will depend on Qing Shui!” Qing Yi smiled and said</p>
  <p>Qing Yi’s words made the three generations of Qing Clan overjoyed. Who among the younger generation had not looked forward to the outside world?</p>
  <p>“Mother, what about Grandpa and the rest? Would they be going with us too?” Qing Shui recalled that there was still his Grandpa, two uncles, and an old man guarding the Qing Clan’s library in Qing Village!</p>
  <p>“When we head back during the new year, we’ll discuss with Old Master. We’ll sort out the details later!”</p>
  <p>Ever since he had made the decision to move, Qing Shui increased the amount of sales of the black fish and turtles in Yu He Inn so that they could get some more revenue. After all, there was already quite a substantial amount of black fish in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
  <p>After having his morning meal, Qing Shui decided to make a trip to the Night Fragrance Court!</p>
  <p>Regardless of the era, the sex industry would always be the most prosperous and profitable. Qing Shui looked at the endless stream of customers of the Night Fragrance Court. Many people entered and left!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui, who had broken through to the 4th layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, could clearly hear the cries of people indulging in sex. Qing Shui headed straight up the stairs and to the top!</p>
  <p>There were still two ladies on guard. Qing Shui could not help but recall the time he had walked in and saw the nude bodies of the Wenren sisters. He especially thought of Wenren Wu-Shuang’s posture that would make one’s blood veins pop… </p>
  <p>When Qing Shui saw Wenren Wu-Shuang again, there was an obvious distance between the two of them. Qing Shui was not thick-skinned enough to tell her that he wanted her when he already had Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
  <p>And there was also Mingyue Gelou. Qing Shui started to feel that his emotional intelligence was very low, and his skin was not thick enough!</p>
  <p>“Wu-Shuang. After the new year, we’ll be heading to the Skysword Sect in Cang Lang Country. It is likely that the whole Qing Clan will be moving to Cang Lang Country. What are your plans?” Qing Shui started to think that he really would have no chance with this beauty with a charm unparalleled in his generation.</p>
  <p>If one day Wenren Wu-Shuang were to jump into the arms of another, Qing Shui would definitely feel bad. All men have their own selfish motives. Qing Shui was no exception. Moreover, what Qing Shui valued most, other than kinship, was women. He hoped to have a few pretty wives and children to pamper him in the future so that he would be able to see the heartwarming scenes when they are happy.</p>
  <p>“I can leave anytime. You can just inform me!”</p>
  <p>While it was still a light smile, Qing Shui felt that within, there was quiet resistance, rejection, refusal, and even a tinge of hatred!</p>
  <p>“This is for you. It can increase your powers by a substantial amount!” Qing Shui handed Wu-Shuang a small porcelain bottle with two Small Revitalizing Pills and said.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui!” When Qing Shui was about to leave, Wenren Wu-Shuang stopped him!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was puzzled as he turned to look at Wu-Shuang! Earlier, Qing Shui had wanted to bear the pain and erase all thoughts of Wenren Wu-Shuang!</p>
  <p>“You said that you would put in effort to chase me and not let me be married to those despicable men. You have to remember what you said!”</p>
  <p>When Qing Shui left, Wu-Shuang’s magical words still resounded in his ears!</p>
  <p>“Seems like my skin is still not thick enough, and I do not have enough confidence. There are countless beauties across the nine continents. If I hope to get my hands on a few more, it wouldn’t be possible without powers and thick skin!” Qing Shui recovered from Wu-Shuang’s last words, and stood even taller and sturdier than before!</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, do I still need to take off my clothes for the acupuncture?”</p>
  <p>At night, Qing Shui wanted to apply acupuncture on Mingyue Gelou to boost her potential and strengthen her constitution. At the same time, he wanted to further expand and strengthen her meridian energy channels!</p>
  <p>Seeing how awkward Mingyue was, Qing Shui could not help but think about how she could still feel shy so easily even after they had sex for a few times before! What Qing Shui enjoyed the most was how demure and pure she looked when they were doing the indecent act!</p>
  <p>“It’s easy to get into trouble with clothes on! If not, shall your husband help you take them off?” Qing Shui liked the shy look Mingyue had whenever he teased her. It was very charming!</p>
  <p>“I’ll do it myself!” Mingyue said, flustered!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui saw her clothes being taken off one after another, revealing that soft and flawless skin. Under Qing Shui’s gaze, the snow-white skin was dyed in a light- pink shade, and had a scent of sweet fragrance to it.</p>
  <p>It was the first time Qing Shui had seen a woman slowly undressing herself in front of him. Furthermore, she was a charming, seductive, and young married woman!</p>
  <p>He could not help but reach out his hand and grab onto that well-rounded mound. He caressed it while the other hand reached for that rounded bosom. The smoothness, tenderness, and the springiness of it made one crave for more!</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, didn’t you say that you are applying acupuncture on me?” Mingyue gasped slightly and said.</p>
  <p>“Your husband is applying a special ‘acupuncture’ first so that I can have full concentration when I’m applying the acupuncture later!” Qing Shui grinned and kissed those red lips that formed a slight smile.</p>
  <p>The room was filled with cries and gasps, as well as the occasional slapping sounds!</p>
  <p>After a round of sex…</p>
  <p>Mingyue Gelou laid on the bed, naked and with her eyes closed. On the other hand, Qing Shui was neatly dressed, feeling refreshed and energized. While he still felt an urge to go for another round when he saw Mingyue’s beautiful body, he was no longer out of control!</p>
  <p>The nine golden needles moved around on Mingyue’s body as she cried out in a voice that seemed to sound as if she was in pain and joy!</p>
  <p>Feeling uncomfortable, she opened her two eyes slightly and looked at Qing Shui with a slightly seductive face. But it was too bad that Qing Shui could not enjoy himself at the moment. After all, many of the acupoints involved were important; once the damage was done, it would become a major problem!</p>
  <p>To strengthen the constitution, one had to expand and fortify the meridian channels to achieve the effect of cleansing the impurities in the body!</p>
  <p>Gradually, a layer of grey-colored sweat that had a slight odor covered Mingyue’s body. It was tolerable, but strongly smelled of pheromones.</p>
  <p>It was also why Mingyue’s face had turned beet red, and her beautiful eyelids were also shut tightly!</p>
  <p>After a while, Qing Shui gradually drew out all the needles. After Mingyue had gasped from the release of the needles, he carried her into the bathroom!</p>
  <p>He had held back the heat that had been growing in him during the long period of acupuncture. Now that it was over, he would naturally need to release it!</p>
  <p>After cleansing the impurities, Mingyue seemed to have an additional layer of glow and charm to her. Qing Shui had gotten someone to make him an especially big bathtub. The water level was only at the waist level!</p>
  <p>Mingyue Gelou felt like crawling into a hole as she held on to the sides of the bathtub. Her full bosom was perched up high, allowing Qing Shui to thrust loudly from the back!</p>
  <p>The sound of each thrust made her embarrassed beyond words. It was so comfortable that she wanted to cry out, but she did not wish to make too much noise. She was afraid that she would be seen as a bad woman!</p>

 <p>“Qing Shui, didn’t you say that you are applying acupuncture on me?” Mingyue gasped slightly and said.</p>
 <p>“Your husband is applying a special ‘acupuncture’ first so that I can have full concentration when I’m applying the acupuncture later!” Qing Shui grinned and kissed those red lips that formed a slight smile.</p>
 <p>The room was filled with cries and gasps, as well as the occasional slapping sounds!</p>
 <p>After a round of sex…</p>
 <p>Mingyue Gelou laid on the bed, naked and with her eyes closed. On the other hand, Qing Shui was neatly dressed, feeling refreshed and energized. While he still felt an urge to go for another round when he saw Mingyue’s beautiful body, he was no longer out of control!</p>
 <p>The nine golden needles moved around on Mingyue’s body as she cried out in a voice that seemed to sound as if she was in pain and joy!</p>
 <p>Feeling uncomfortable, she opened her two eyes slightly and looked at Qing Shui with a slightly seductive face. But it was too bad that Qing Shui could not enjoy himself at the moment. After all, many of the acupoints involved were important; once the damage was done, it would become a major problem!</p>
 <p>To strengthen the constitution, one had to expand and fortify the meridian channels to achieve the effect of cleansing the impurities in the body!</p>
 <p>Gradually, a layer of grey-colored sweat that had a slight odor covered Mingyue’s body. It was tolerable, but strongly smelled of pheromones.</p>
 <p>It was also why Mingyue’s face had turned beet red, and her beautiful eyelids were also shut tightly!</p>
 <p>After a while, Qing Shui gradually drew out all the needles. After Mingyue had gasped from the release of the needles, he carried her into the bathroom!</p>
 <p>He had held back the heat that had been growing in him during the long period of acupuncture. Now that it was over, he would naturally need to release it!</p>
 <p>After cleansing the impurities, Mingyue seemed to have an additional layer of glow and charm to her. Qing Shui had gotten someone to make him an especially big bathtub. The water level was only at the waist level!</p>
 <p>Mingyue Gelou felt like crawling into a hole as she held on to the sides of the bathtub. Her full bosom was perched up high, allowing Qing Shui to thrust loudly from the back!</p>
 <p>The sound of each thrust made her embarrassed beyond words. It was so comfortable that she wanted to cry out, but she did not wish to make too much noise. She was afraid that she would be seen as a bad woman!</p>
