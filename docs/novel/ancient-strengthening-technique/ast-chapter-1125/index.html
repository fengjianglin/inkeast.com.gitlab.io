 <p><strong>AST 1125 - Yu Ruyan's True Feelings, Back to Qing Clan</strong></p>
 <p>After hearing Qing Shui's words, Yu Ruyan nodded. Her eyes became misted and she wore a smile. She wasn't able to get Qing Shui to let go of her hand after a slight attempt and thus she let it be. Although it was under the table, the others could still tell.</p>
 <p>Since there was no need to cultivate at night, Qing Shui had more free time. He went around the rooms and once again wondered when he would be able to share a bed with all of his wives. However, he knew that it would be difficult just thinking about it.</p>
 <p>Luckily, Qing Shui had lots of energy. He first went to Hai Dongqing's and Di Qing's room and after a round of sex, he was pushed away. He was told to look for their other sisters.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that this was atrocious. In the World of the Nine Continents, there wasn't a fixed system of one husband to one wife. Of course, there were also many who stayed true to their partner. However, there weren't many strong men who only had one woman.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had quite an enjoyable time during this period. He just didn't take Yiye Jiange and Wenren Wu-shuang, let alone Yu He. After coming out from the two ladies' room, Qing Shui went straight to Yu Ruyan's room.</p>
 <p>During this period of time, Qing Shui didn't have any overly close contact with Yu Ruyan. The most he would do was hold her hand. Knocking on her door and seeing her slightly panicky expression, Qing Shui felt his heart tugging. He wanted to be someone she could rely on, someone who could make her happy.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that he was too much of a male chauvinist sometimes. However, he didn't feel such emotions toward his women, or rather, this kind of emotions didn't exist towards them. He loved them, loved everything about them. It was just like how it was for Yiye Jiange, where he would willingly do a lot of things just for her.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui locked the door, took Yu Ruyan's hand and led her to the couch at the side. Her clothes were very neat although it was already very late. He didn't know if she hadn't been sleeping or if she had put on her clothes again.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw that there wasn't sleepiness in her eyes and said, smiling, "Are you waiting for me? Why haven't you sleep when it's so late?"</p>
 <p>"I won't think of you." Yu Ruyan said unnaturally. Her voice was mature and drowsy. Additionally, she also had an intelligent disposition similar to Hai Dongqing's.</p>
 <p>"Ruyan, I hope that you can be happy but I don't know what to do." Qing Shui took her hand and they sat down next to each other on the couch.</p>
 <p>Although Yu Ruyan was neatly dressed, her clothes were very thin. Qing Shui sat very close to her and he could even sense her body temperature. There was also a nice fragrance coming from her.</p>
 <p>This lady was one of those from the Portraits of Beauty, and she had a divine body. It was just like when they had gotten together out of blunder, the feeling was the same, as if she was still a virgin. Her skin was beautiful as jade, soft and tender with great elasticity. There was also her expression... She was an extremely traditional woman through and through and thus was very conservative towards that topic. Even now, Qing Shui felt as if he hadn't completely gotten a hold of her heart yet.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, I'm already very happy. Ruyan is blessed to have met you and be saved by you twice." After saying this, Yu Ruyan smiled. Affinity was really something very amazing. Like what he said, their affinity had probably been for as long as a thousand years.</p>
 <p>"You're really happy? I don't wish for this to be the reason..." Qing Shui drew closer to her beautiful face and asked.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, there's always a reason to liking someone but it might not be just a single reason. Although you have saved me twice, it doesn't mean that I'll have to be together with you just because you saved me twice!"</p>
 <p>"Then Ruyan, you're saying that you like me?" Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan blushed and nodded slightly.</p>
 <p>"Then can I raise a request?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>"No!" Yu Ruyan said straightforwardly.</p>
 <p>"Eh, why?" Qing Shui choked.</p>
 <p>"You're smiling like a hooligan..."</p>
 <p>"Alright, since you say that I'm like a hooligan, then should I be doing something? Otherwise, I won't be worthy of this address." Qing Shui rubbed his hands together as he looked at Yu Ruyan.</p>
 <p>"What do you want?" Yu Ruyan blushed. However, she wasn't scared. Instead, she was embarrassed.</p>
 <p>"Make your choice. Do you want me to force a long kiss on you or do you want to give me a peck? You can only choose one. You're given the time for one breath to consider. The time starts now." Qing Shui smiled and drew in closer as he rubbed his hands together.</p>
 <p>"Neither..."</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan hadn't finished her words yet when Qing Shui took one of her hands and pulled her in. Her soft and beautiful body fell into his arms and went soft.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly landed a kiss on those tender lips and leaned back on the couch. This was a three seater couch but it was very wide. It was about over a meter and was like a small bed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui lay there while Yu Ruyan lay in his arms and hugged her tightly. The moment they fell, she loosened the grip on her teeth and Qing Shui's tongue entered.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan struggled a little initially but gave in after a short while. Her tongue even slowly answered Qing Shui's kiss while he greedily sought for more and sucked, as if he wanted to take all her tongue into his mouth.</p>
 <p>His two hands felt around her perky butt which was smooth and tender to touch, his palms grasping her tightly.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan panted as she struggled to part from Qing Shui's lips. One of her hands even pressed down on the hand that Qing Shui had on her butt, not letting him move, "Qing Shui..."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at her misted beautiful eyes and her flushed face. Seeing that she was avoiding his gaze slightly, he lifted his head slightly and pecked on her lips, "I'll listen to you. If you want me to leave, I'll leave immediately. I won't let you do something you're not willing to."</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, it's not like that... You're asking me to... before them... you're a rascal!" Yu Ruyan said, embarrassed.</p>
 <p>"What so embarrassing about this? They've thought that we're together since long ago. Didn't you know?" Qing Shui asked, astonished.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan: "..."</p>
 <p>"I thought that it was because you're not willing to be with me. Ruyan, you're having a reaction." Qing Shui's finger entered her butthole.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>After morning practice the next day, everyone sat down to have a meal together.</p>
 <p>"Sister Ruyan, you're even more beautiful today!" Wenren Wu-shuang sat opposite Yu Ruyan and smiled as she spoke to her.</p>
 <p>Hearing Wenren Wu-shuang's words, the other ladies all looked at Yu Ruyan. Di Qing and Hai Dongqing smiled and looked towards Qing Shui. Di Qing then smiled and said, "The reason why Sister Ruyan has become more beautiful today is thanks to Qing Shui."</p>
 <p>Thankfully, there were no outsiders here. Yiye Tian, Lin Zhanhan, Little Fatty, and Luan Luan were all not around. They intentionally tried to leave more time for Qing Shui to spend with the ladies.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange ate calmly while Yu He looked at Qing Shui with a teasingly gaze.</p>
 <p>"Alright, let's eat. Did you not have your fill?" Qing Shui grinned and said as he looked at Hai Dongqing and Di Qing.</p>
 <p>The two of them let out a 'tsk' and stopped talking.</p>
 <p>In the afternoon, Qing Shui and the others bade farewell to Qiu Feng. Qing Shui said that he'll be back before the Ancient Great Formation was activated and then headed back with the others.</p>
 <p>The journey back was very calm. Even without taking Qing Shui into consideration, the strength of this group of people was not to be neglected. On the way, whenever Luan Luan came across a demonic beast, she would continue to tame them. With the Beast King Medallion, it was easy for her.</p>
 <p>They returned to where Yiye Tian was staying and brought along his wife and Yiye Tong before they continued on their journey. The Nine Continents Steps was very amazing and powerful, and very soon, they entered the wilderness between the two continents.</p>
 <p>They didn't encounter any danger as they passed by the wilderness. Even when they came across a horde of demonic beasts, their safety was ensured. The journey became more boring after they entered the wilderness since it was just alternating between cultivating and traveling. They could only set up tents and rest in the wilderness as well.</p>
 <p>Even though it was a boring journey, it was a fruitful one. After close to one month, they got close to Central Continent. When Qing Clan moved out from Greencloud Continent, Qing Shui had decided on staying in Central Continent since it was located in the middle of the Five Continents and it would be convenient no matter where they had to travel to.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw the familiar manor, he felt especially happy. This was his home and it felt good to be back. It was only because he had a home that he wouldn't feel lonely. Home was one's spiritual harbor.</p>
 <p>Fair Wind City. The Fair Wind City of today suddenly had a great influx of population. There was no need to explain why. Qing Shui and Qing Clan was here. The matters with Buddha Sect, Demon Gate and the others had already spread out. Knowing that a certain area had an expert would make people feel safe. It was because they wouldn't have to worry about their city being destroyed and thus get affected.</p>
 <p>With someone strong was around, no one would dare to recklessly kill the innocent and they wouldn't dare to destroy the city. It was because such a course of action would be an insult to the expert in the area!</p>
 <p>When the group appeared at the entrance to Qing Clan's manor in Fair Wind City, everyone came out with excited smiles. Many people gathered around as well.</p>
 <p>Ming Clan was around too. News about the Lion King's Ridge had spread all the way here, or rather, it could be said that it had been disseminated very far. Ming Xian, Ming Chen, and many others had all come.</p>
 <p>"Brother Qing!" Ming Xian greeted happily.</p>
 <p>"Brother, come, come in and have a seat." Qing Shui went over to grab Ming Xian and Ming Chen as he spoke.</p>
 <p>"Brother, you've just come back, so you should reunite with your family first. Tonight, I'll set up a feast at my place. We'll have a drink then." Ming Xian smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't insist and smiled, saying, "Alright, I'll definitely be there!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui waved to the surrounding people and then went up to hug his mother and family. Luan Luan stood on the other side of Qing Yi and shared with her grandmother stories about Qing Shui, praising him to the skies.</p>
 <p>The Third and Fourth generations in Qing Clan also came over. Qing Yi got his son to go accompany his kids. Qing Shui could only carry one in each arm, Qing Yu and Qing Yan.</p>
 <p>Qing Ming pouted at the side. Qing Shui squatted down while carrying his two daughters and said with a smile, "Ming`er, you're a man and you must be strong. If anything happens, you must learn to carry it on your on shoulders. Look at Zun`er."</p>
 <p>Qin Yin and Qing Zun had grown quite a lot and they appeared to be a lot more mature and understanding than other kids of their age. They wouldn't lose out to the kids from those great clans.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Ming was the opposite. He had a weird temper, dressed weirdly, and didn't even think in the same way as others. He tended to like same dark things that shouldn't be shown in public.</p>
 <p>"Father, if you're biased, just say you are. Don't give such lousy reasons. Am I so easily deceived?" Qing Ming said teasingly. His pouting lips now curled downwards, as if he was in contempt.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt as if there were black lines on his head. Mingyue Gelou was extremely poised, so this kid could only take after him. Was he so actually so dark...?</p>
 <p>"Rascal, how are you talking to your father. Are you asking for a beating?" Mingyue Gelou said angrily as she walked over.</p>
 <p>"You shouldn't beat kids. If you can't handle them, let mother do it." Qing Shui smiled and said to Mingyue Gelou.</p>
 <p>"Come, rascal, let Father give you a present." Qing Shui put out one hand to Qing Ming while carrying the two giggling lasses.</p>
