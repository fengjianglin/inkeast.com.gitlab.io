 <p><strong>AST 801 - The Arrival of Baima Aristocrat Clan, Battle, The Powerful Petal Rain Under the Skies</strong></p>
 <p>He controlled the primordial flames in his hands until he ran out of the Qi of Strengthening Technique. It was then did Qing Shui sat down to rest and recover as he contemplated over what had not been done properly and why had the "Heart of Roc" not reach the small success stage.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had not manage to bring it to the small success stage even when it was time for him to exit from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. This made him feel a little helpless since the people from Baima Aristocrat Clan should be coming today.</p>
 <p>It was already past one o'clock in the morning and Qing Shui had used up all the time he had in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. It was a pity that he still wasn't able to bring the "Heart of Roc" to the small success stage. However, he could still sense that the primordial flame balls' prowess had increased by quite a lot.</p>
 <p>Of course, it was still far from comparable to if he had achieved the breakthrough and had its prowess increased to become two times stronger. Although he was just a tad away from the small success stage, the increment to its power was only at 20% but if he were to reach the small success stage, it would be two times as strong as before.</p>
 <p>Exiting the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui laid on the bed. It was already starting to turn bright out. It was already about seven o'clock in the morning. He pushed opened the door and left the room.</p>
 <p>When he went to the backyard, he noticed that there were already quite a number of them. Those who stood closer to Qing Shui greeted him and then continued with their training.</p>
 <p>Although the morning sun had not risen fully, there was already a hint of red in the east. Qing Shui knew that it would not take long for the sun to rise up and he started to practice his Taichi.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>After breakfast, no one spoke but the atmosphere was clearly different. Qing Shui knew that it was because the Baima Aristocrat Clan was coming. He smiled and said to the other, "No need to be nervous, it'll be fine."</p>
 <p>"Baima Aristocrat Clan is after all, a great aristocrat clan. The people coming this time would definitely be stronger than before. Qing Shui, you must be careful. We can't help you much." Qing Luo smiled and said helplessly.</p>
 <p>"Grandfather, there's no need for you to worry, your grandson has the confidence to deal with this." Qing Shui smiled and said casually.</p>
 <p>After the meal, everyone went back to their own stuff but none of them left the residence. Although they appeared very relaxed, no one was actually feeling so.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the sky and then suddenly leaped up to look into the far distance, waiting for the Baima Aristocrat Clan to come. He hope to be able to get this settled as soon as possible.</p>
 <p>After this event, Qing Shui felt that he would really be able to relax for quite a bit of time. He planned to use this break to slow down and strengthen his martial techniques.</p>
 <p>Time passed by very slowly. Qing Shui was not anxious but just looked into the distance calmly. When he saw a few black dots flying toward them, he immediately went forth. He hoped that they could at least not fight above Qing Residence or even, not above Heavenly Palace. However, he couldn't leave too far away either.</p>
 <p>"Daddy!"</p>
 <p>Luan Luan shouted at Qing Shui stepping in the air to stand next to him. She was already a Martial Saint and now, standing next to him, her excited face appeared to be slightly flushed.</p>
 <p>"Luan Luan, hold onto this." Qing Shui passed a few Gale Pellet to her and then called out for the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. He let her sit on the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and also had the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable sit next to her.</p>
 <p>"Lass, later on, no matter what happens, don't come down." Qing Shui also stood on the elephant and said.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, Daddy, can I call out my Earth Devouring Mice and Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear?" Luan Luan asked excitedly.</p>
 <p>"Of course you can. You need to rely on them in the future." Qing Shui smiled and said before looking at the large black bird which was closing in.</p>
 <p>Dark Crane!</p>
 <p>After seeing clearly what the opponent's demonic beast was, Qing Shui did not say anything but rook out the Soulshake Bell which had already leveled. After giving it some thought, he decided to use it later. After all, things would not be able to end peacefully between them and since that was the case, he might as well take action first.</p>
 <p>"Luan Luan, call out your demonic beasts. Later on, wait for my signal and just attack." Qing Shui said to Luan Luan.</p>
 <p>"Mmm." Luan Luan excitedly called out her demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>The five large Dark Crane got increasingly closer and the people on top of them also came within sight. Almost all of them were elderly and even those who were youger were not that much younger themselves and were　over a hundred years old.</p>
 <p>"They really think very highly of themselves. These should be the best elites of the Baima Aristocrat Clan." When Qing Shui saw their setup, he immediately unleash his killing intent at full powers.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw these people, he was not worried in the least. He was fully prepared. And other than the old man in the lead who might be a little tricky to handle, he had the means to settle the others within a short period of time.</p>
 <p>Ning!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui called out the Fire Bird and then fed it a Gale Pellet. He held Luan Luan's wrist and in an instant, appeared on the Fire Bird's back. "It's better to stay on the Fire Bird, it's safer here. Feed it one of that pill I gave you earlier once every 15 minutes. Remember, don't come down. You just need to command you Earth Devouring Mice to work together with me."</p>
 <p>"I'll listen to what Daddy says." Luan Luan hugged Qing Shui and said happily.</p>
 <p>Softly patting Luan Luan on the head, Qing Shui returned to be back on the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. By then, the other group had already stopped two hundred meters away.</p>
 <p>Cultivators had great vision and hearing. Moreover, those large flying demonic beasts took up quite a large space in the air. Right now, both parties were staring at each other.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had seen them earlier. The old man in the lead was a little tricky to deal with but he didn't feel as strong as the old man with the Dragon-Headed Cane. And although the others were strong as well, to the current Qing Shui, they were nothing.</p>
 <p>Baima Qiufeng looked at the young man and his pupils contracted. He felt that this person was extremely dangerous. And when his gaze landed on the girl on the Fire Bird, he could tell with one glance that Luan Luan was very young and that she was a Martial Saint.</p>
 <p>Elementary Martial Saint!</p>
 <p>Although she was only an elementary Martial Saint, the old man felt that she was another demonical existence like that young man. She had over ten demonic beasts around her, each of them had the level of a Grade Four Martial Saint or higher. Most importantly, they were Earth Devouring Mice...</p>
 <p>"Get to it!" The old man suddenly let out a loud bellow and five Dark Crane immediately flew toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't expect this old man to be so decisive and to be so vicious. Thankfully, he was prepared and with two whistles, the Fire Bird quickly retreated.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Qing Shui shook his Soulshake Bell toward the five large Dark Crane.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had great confidence in the Soulshake Bell. Almost the same moment he had shook it, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant unleashed a Mighty Elephant Stomp.</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the effects of his attacks. Out of the five Dark Crane, one died on the spot, one escape, one went into frenzy, attacked the people around it and was slammed dead by the old man. Another old man who had been caught unaware had his head smashed by its sharp claws.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui retreated, he saw them scattering out and then grouping back together and charging toward Qing Shui. At this moment, Qing Shui threw out the most deadly area attack he had with his hidden weapons.</p>
 <p>Petal Rain Under the Skies！</p>
 <p>The pitch black 10,000 Years Coldsteel Needles shot out with a loud wailing voice. Qing Shui was the most confident with his hidden weapon attacks. To dare to challenge a great aristocrat clan, what he could rely on was his poison and hidden weapons.</p>
 <p>The Solitary Rapid Fist which Qing Shui had picked up very very long ago was targeted toward having flexible hands and was the foundations for Qing Shui's hidden weapons. It was also because of this skill that he was able to have such success in his hidden weapon today.</p>
 <p>Fourteen!</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui unleashed the "Petal Rain Under the Skies", the twenty-four people from the other side split into two batches by the Mighty Elephant Stomp, with six on one side and eighteen on another. The target for his Petal Rain Under the Skies was the group of eighteen.</p>
 <p>Fourteen of them died on the spot!</p>
 <p>Although this result was within Qing Shui's expectation, Qing Shui secretly felt very happy. To be able to wipe out over half of them... this was sufficient to leave a shadow in their hearts.</p>
 <p>Although the other party was quite stunned by this outcome, they quickly spread out. They did not have much knowledge of such hidden weapons but still knew a thing or two about them, especially one that covered such a large area. The poison on the hidden weapons were definitely extremely precious and when they had spread out, it wouldn't be possible for him to use the same technique on every single person.</p>
 <p>Their guess was right. However, this was what Qing Shui wanted—for them to be separated. This would give him more opportunities.</p>
 <p>Since the fight had started, there was no need for them hide anymore. He quickly called out the Thunderous Beast and brought out the Thunder God and the Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p>Just then, the old man in the lead had charged forth!</p>
 <p>Everything till now happened in just an instant.</p>
 <p>Seven Star Armored Vest!</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demons!</p>
 <p>Fiery Golden Eyes!</p>
 <p>Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui no longer had the time to use the Heavenly Talisman but these were sufficient. And now, with the State of One with Elephant, he unleashed the Combination Sword Technique with the Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, together with the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, was sent flying backward. What had made Qing Shui happy was that the level of this elder was not comparable to Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan's Old Ancestor, at least, not when he was holding the Dragon-Headed Cane.</p>
 <p>Although he was pushed back, after the old man's abilities were weakened, Qing Shui's Seven Star Armored Vest was fully able to withstand the attack. As long as he could withstand the attacks, it would not be scary to be faced off against him.</p>
 <p>It was only now that Qing Shui had seen the old man's weapons. It was a huge scythe. He had a Black Gold Devil Scythe and Evil Dragon Tooth in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal but there was no one around him who uses a scythe. He had thus decided to leave them aside for him to refine weapons in the future.</p>
 <p>This huge scythe was very similar to the Black Gold Devil Scythe and was even more like the scythe of the death god. The moment he came into contact with it, Qing Shui could sense a huge throwback trembling force from it.</p>
 <p>It was another good item. This trembling force could, in a way, increase the elderly's prowess by quite abit. If not for this trembling force, Qing Shui would not have to be sent flying and he wouldn't feel any pressure in the slightest.</p>
 <p>Art of Pursuing!</p>
 <p>After another collision, Qing Shui used the Art of Pursuing and leaped up from the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's back. While in mid-air, he took a Gale Pellet and his speed increased tremendously.</p>
 <p>Speed was power. Speed could counter everything!</p>
 <p>Violet Lightning Strike!</p>
 <p>Right now, the Thunderous Beast next to Qing Shui paralyzed an elder with a Violet Lightning Strike. Luan Luan immediately commanded her Earth Devouring Mice to swarm up...</p>
 <p>Just then, the remaining eight people dashed toward Luan Luan. However, the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear let out a huge bellow.</p>
 <p>A spread of pure red flames landed quickly like rain, stopping the old men in their tracks.</p>
 <p>Fiery Meteor Shower！</p>
