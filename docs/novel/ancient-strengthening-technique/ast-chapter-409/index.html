  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 409 - A plentiful gain, inner core, the change in Misty Palace Mistress</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Millennium amethyst, Canfeng dewdrops……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After opening up a bright case, Qing Shui discovered two kinds of medicinal ingredients that he needed. They were both within the prescription of Wind Water Primordial Pellet. Unfortunately, he didn't know when he would be able to find that Nine-Winged Golden Cicada. Thinking about it made Qing Shui gloomy.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Continuing on, so long as it was a medicinal herb, Qing Shui would throw it into the Realm of Violet Jade immediately. Qing Shui stopped looking through the bright case because he discovered that within the ones he opened previously, there were none with a medicinal age that was lower than one thousand years.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At that moment, Qing Shui felt really comfortable. This feeling of having a fortune falling from the sky was indeed gratifying. Compared to suddenly having a lot more top-notch equipment in the rucksack while playing games, this was many times more satisfying.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Moving on forward, a lot of bright cases with unique characteristics were discovered. They were all rectangular shaped in varying sizes. The large ones were the size of two human heads whereas the small ones were only the size of a fist.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What is this?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui suspiciously opened up one of the larger sized bright cases.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was a milky white spherical object inside. The spiritual fluctuation within it could be felt. Qing Shui was no stranger to this object.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Demonic Beast’s core!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the core of demonic beasts. Nevertheless, it was the inner demonic beast pill that was more than a thousand years. Qing Shui felt that its size was almost the same as the inner pill of the millennium huge snake king, except that it was slightly bigger.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This thing was even more precious compared to the millennium medicinal herbs. An important fact was that in the world of the nine continents, within the unknown deep mountains and woodlands, there were actually a lot of millennium medicinal herbs, two millennium, three millennium, even though they were not all over the land. However, those places were especially dangerous.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Therefore, formidable warriors who were poor would not appear in the world of nine continents. The precondition was to be formidable enough.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Demonic Beast Forest and Giant Beasts Mountain were places like this. The fortune within was astonishing but simultaneously, there was also a great risk. In the world of nine continents, there were very few people who dared to enter these two places. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After that, Qing Shui once again opened up a bright case that was almost the size of the previous one,except it was a bit bigger. After he opened it, it was a red demonic beast’s core.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The age of the demonic beast’s core was judged by its color.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Demonic beast’s cores that lasted only for a millennium or less were milky white in color. The cores that ranged from one to two millenniums were red in color. Those that ranged from two to three millenniums were orange, three to four millenniums were yellow, four to five millenniums were dark green, five to six millenniums were green, six to seven millenniums were blue and those that ranged from seven to eight millenniums were purple.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was said that the demonic beast’s core that lasted for more than ten thousand years were rainbow colored.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the unknown inner pill in his hand. It was dark red and seemed like it was an inner bladder that was close to two thousand years. When he refined his own Golden Innate Pellet, he was lacking these exact inner pills.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Every core would need warm nourishment for at least a thousand years. Of course there would also be exceptions. In those years, the deeper the color of the inner demonic beast pills, the closer they would be to the years counted later in this time. Just like Qing Shui’s core that was dark red, it indicated that it was already near two thousand years, so it was already a core of two millennium. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The change in colors of the demonic beast’s core didn't actually happen as soon as it reached the year count. They were the same as a human’s breakthrough - only after it broke through would its color change. Each time it broke through, its strength would increase in folds. Of course, the difficulty of it breaking through was even more difficult than that of humans. After all, it could only advance into the next color after a thousand years.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were some low grade demonic beasts that would sometimes take in the most valuable treasure of some kind of medicines which led to them living for three thousand years. However, the core within might only be red, or even milky white in color. Therefore, the colors were actually a judgement of the demonic beasts’ strength. Of course, the longer it took to measure the strength would mean that the core was more precious. For cores in the same year, the deeper the color, the more valuable it was. For the cores of the same color, the longer the years, the more valuable it was.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">These kinds of dark-red colored inner pills were already really precious. There were still inner pill cases that were even bigger than the case that contained the dark red colored inner pill. Qing Shui had stopped opening them up one by one. He immediately kept all of them in the Realm of Violet Jade.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, an iron swelling with such a strong spirit energy?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Take it away!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After one round, Qing Shui took away almost seventy percent of the things in Yan Clan’s treasure pavilion. Qing Shui felt that the remaining things were not useful to him. For example, some of the weapons and armors that he forged himself with his current level were much stronger than what remained. The materials were also not that good. That was why Qing Shui abandoned them right away.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For this one round, Qing Shui stayed for one and a half days. When he walked out of the treasure pavilion, he once again used the golden lock to lock up the cell. Seeing as dawn appeared to the east of the sky, he knew that the sky would very soon light up completely.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A silent Qing Shui went back to his room. Actually from the time Qing Shui went out to the time he returned, the owner of the Misty Palace had been looking at him in front of the window. However, Qing Shui didn't sense it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Every time she looked at Qing Shui, there was an unusual feeling. Ever since the pleasant and romantic dream-like incident, she had been tortured by Qing Shui for a really long time. A feeling of being touched by a pair of warm hands would often arise on the front part of her breast.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This damned little bastard, so lecherous, thinking quietly about these things every day.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Actually, she didn't know that everyday in the Realm of Violet Jade, Qing Shui would think about it once. However, if it was changed to the owner of Misty Palace, it would be thirty times a day, though Qing Shui had thought about it more than that.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The heavenly face below the scarf of the owner of Misty Palace was actually a bit scarlet, so much so that the pupils that didn't contain any impurities also turned misty at this moment.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, no one saw it. No one had seen how she looked when she got polluted by the smell of the world of human mortals. It was just that very quickly, she would recover back to her usual expression in an instant. After she became constantly aroused, she knew that it would be very difficult for her to be like how she once was previously.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the morning, Qing Shui still delivered breakfast to the Misty Palace Mistress. This time, both of them even had the meal together. The both of them said very little. Qing Shui picked out the things that he had to say. He was absolutely unable to let go in front of her.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui acted very weird. To her, he didn't actually think of having her like how he had Huo Yun Liu-Li and Canghai Mingyue. However, for some reason, he just hoped that she would look up to him. He didn't want to be looked down upon by her. Therefore, Qing Shui was scared that he would say the wrong things. He was scared that it would make her unhappy.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took out the copied training method for Divine Arm Clearing, Divine Feet Clearing and the title pages that the owner of Misty Palace gave him, together with all of the Plum Blossom Wine and put it on the table.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You still have Interspatial silk sachet? Haven’t you given it to Mingyue?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Misty Palace Mistress looked at Qing Shui strangely. After all, how precious the Interspatial silk sachet was could not be estimated. That was something that needed the fur of the Martial Saint Demonic Beasts. Furthermore, for it to work, it would also need to be from special Martial Saint Demonic Beasts. What was more precious was that the method of making this Interspatial silk sachet was particularly rare.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The most famous people who were capable of refining Interspatial silk sachet were none other than the great refining family Mu Clan that was in Eastern Victory Divine Continent. Therefore, the people who had the Interspatial silk sachet would normally be people of great background. My own Interspatial silk sachet……” The Misty Palace Mistress shook her head.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui nodded while smiling. “Yeah yeah!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Misty Palace Mistress extended her hand and put away all of the things on the table. She also had an Interspatial silk sachet. On the table, only the plum blossom wine, a cauldron that was slightly bigger and two delicate small wine bottles remained.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She was distracted at the moment she received the Divine Arm Clearing and a few of the animal skin papers of Divine Feet Clearing. When she saw the papers on top, she looked at Qing Shui strangely for a while. However, she didn't say anything.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that it was because she felt the spiritual fluctuation on it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Today, she was still not wearing her veil. She and Qing Shui were separated by only a small side table. They were so close that he could smell the aroma that emitted from her body. It resembled the faint and sweet scent of cymbidiums. It also resembled the delicate fragrance of orchids and even though it was very faint, Qing Shui was infatuated with it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Looking at the heavenly face that was pretty to the point of shaking one’s core, it was like the doings of gods. Never would Qing ShuI've thought that a woman could be this pretty.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Misty Palace Mistress extended a pair of snow weeds to open up the lid of the cauldron. Immediately, that familiar aroma assailed his nostrils, an icy mist-like gas even floated out from it. It was cool and greasy to the heart, causing her to be absent-minded for a moment.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Slowly, she filled up seventy percent of a small wine bottle. Right when she wanted to fill up the other bottle, Qing Shui hurriedly stopped her.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Isn’t this helpful for breakthrough? I won’t drink it then……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui said that, he felt incomparably awkward and regretful. He felt like he had done something wrong. As he looked at the Misty Palace Mistress, his face felt a bit hot.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yet, the Misty Palace Mistress smiled while she looked at Qing Shui. This time, she really did smile. Qing Shui saw her neat white teeth that were beautiful and brilliant, it made him lost in thought.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright, why are you not willing to drink with me?”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Misty Palace Mistress saw Qing Shui’s infatuation, but she didn't feel disgusted with it. She found that she actually didn’t hate the pair of clear eyes.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Slowly, she once again filled up seventy percent of the wine bottle.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui came back to his senses and held up a small wine bottle with a bitter smile. “Thank you for saving my life from the most unpleasant moment. I will not say any good things, in the future, I will return the favor with a realistic action.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I look forward to your arrival. As for returning the favor, there is no need. In the future, it will be fine as long as you can let me drink this kind of alcohol often. Only you should have this. This is the most delicious drink I've ever had.” Misty Palace Mistress held up the wine bottle.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ding!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It collided softly for a moment and the both of them finished it in one go.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She kept the ancient cauldron and the wine bottle on the table in the Interspatial silk sachet. Even Qing Shui’s wine bottle was put away.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, I should leave now!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that the Misty Palace Mistress would leave very soon. However, he didn't think that it would be this soon. Yesterday, she said that she would stay here for up to two days, so he didn't expect that it would only be for only a night and a half. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I will send you!”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No need. I don’t think I will greet them. You greet them in my place.”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Today when we go to the Guo Clan, we still have to thank them. What do you say, sister?” Qing Shui smiled slightly while looking at Qing Qing&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing slightly knitted her brows.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I am your sister. Whoever does not treat you well, I will treat them back the same way in folds. However, whoever treated you well, I will do so to them in folds, too. Is that OK?”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at Qing Qing. She was still smiling faintly. It was just that the expression was particularly serious.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yeah!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing smiled slightly while she nodded to Qing Shui. Now, at least he could see her smile. Even though it was faint, he could still confirm that it was a smile.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Guo Clan was also influential in Yan City. Even though Guo Clan’s clans head Guo Yanglong was only a courtyard protector of Qin Clan in GreenCloud Continent, it was already considered a supreme honor in a place like Yan City in Yan Jiang Country. Quo Clan, Lai Clan, Luo Clan, the reason why it could stand up to Yan Clan and Xiao Clan was because there was the existence of Guo Yanglong.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Who asked Qin Clan to be so protective of errors. This was also why Guo PoLu dared to interfere face to face with Elder Master Xiao. It was also because of this that Qing Qing was able to hold on until Qing Shui and the others rushed here.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Guo Clan mansion, compared to Xiao Clan, was considerably smaller. No matter in terms of the imposing manner, or the construction, they were obviously lower by one grade. There were also only four standing guards at the doorway.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Everyone, please come in!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was startled. “ Do I not need to notify anyone?”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No need, I will bring everyone in.” The expression when this guard looked at Qing Shui had a considerable amount of admiration.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui touched his nose. “ When have I become so popular……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This person took Qing Shui and his party and walked into Guo Clan. Among the remaining three people, there was once again one more person who left quickly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After all, Guo Clan was also an influential clan. Even though it was not as luxurious as Yan Clan or Xiao Clan, at the end of the day, it was still an influential clan. The things that should be in the design of the courtyard was all there.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As he stepped on the stony surface, it gave out a clear and rigid “Pa-pa” noise. The noise echoed far away. Qing Shui constantly looked at the buildings that were around him and some of the unskilled workers or disciples and protector of Guo Clan.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were people whose eyesight would give out light when they saw Qing Shui and the party. There were also those who would not have much reactions. There would also be people who didn't even look at Qing Shui and the party.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After walking for quite a distance, a group of seven or eight people were seen walking towards them from the opposite side. The person who was leading was a robust middle-aged man. He was really strong, but his face was handsome. When he saw Guo PoLu in the back, he knew that the person who was leading was the Guo Clan’s clan head Guo Yanglong. In the middle, there were two elderly men with white hair and &nbsp;youthful faces.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mister, I am on the way! Sorry for greeting you from far away, please forgive me!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The man’s loud and clear voice came through from far away. It made people feel really amiable and respectful.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After hearing the noise, Qing Shui felt that Guo Yanglong truly had good fortune. This kind of man should be able to attract girls. Having a pretty boy’s face but also the muscles of a masculine man, adding the manly voice, this was precisely the kind that a lot of girls liked the most.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Women criticized that pretty boys were not manly enough, and also criticized that masculine men were not handsome enough. That was why a lot of the women liked tall, powerful, and also capable handsome men…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui looked at Guo Yanglong, he felt that this man was truly this kind of man!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Uncle was too formal, you can just call me Qing Shui!” Qing Shui smiled while he greeted Guo Yanglong.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Haha, alright. Today, we are all happy. Come, let’s all go in!” &nbsp;Guo Yanglong laughed while leading Qing Shui and the party to the largest pavilion building.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Qing!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As Qing Shui saw Guo PoLu almost putting all his sights on Qing Qing, he could not help but want to laugh. Contrary to what one might think, this Guo PoLu was an affectionate person, even though Qing Shui could not confirm anything, he could still sense the sincere look.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was just that when Qing Shui saw the his sister's expression, he already knew that Guo Polu’s journey would be very difficult. No matter what, Qing Shui decided to give Guo PoLu a chance. As for whether it would work out, it would depend on his own actions.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was actually not that outstanding in terms of getting along with other people. However, as for Guo Yanglong, everyone was also happy when they were chatting with each other. The atmosphere was more active particularly when they talked about some of the unusual things in the continent.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The more one sees, the more knowledgeable one would be. Compared to Qing Shui, Guo Yanglong had more knowledge and experience. At the moment when he was talking to Qing Shui, he didn't neglect the others. He waited until they arrived at the hall. There were some women from Guo Clan that were present, therefore, when they sat down, it was almost like two seats combining together. On the left were all men and on the right were all women.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that this Guo Yanglong was indeed meticulous despite what one might expect.&nbsp;</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 409 - A plentiful gain, inner core, the change in Misty Palace Mistress</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Millennium amethyst, Canfeng dewdrops……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After opening up a bright case, Qing Shui discovered two kinds of medicinal ingredients that he needed. They were both within the prescription of Wind Water Primordial Pellet. Unfortunately, he didn't know when he would be able to find that Nine-Winged Golden Cicada. Thinking about it made Qing Shui gloomy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Continuing on, so long as it was a medicinal herb, Qing Shui would throw it into the Realm of Violet Jade immediately. Qing Shui stopped looking through the bright case because he discovered that within the ones he opened previously, there were none with a medicinal age that was lower than one thousand years.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At that moment, Qing Shui felt really comfortable. This feeling of having a fortune falling from the sky was indeed gratifying. Compared to suddenly having a lot more top-notch equipment in the rucksack while playing games, this was many times more satisfying.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Moving on forward, a lot of bright cases with unique characteristics were discovered. They were all rectangular shaped in varying sizes. The large ones were the size of two human heads whereas the small ones were only the size of a fist.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What is this?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui suspiciously opened up one of the larger sized bright cases.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was a milky white spherical object inside. The spiritual fluctuation within it could be felt. Qing Shui was no stranger to this object.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Demonic Beast’s core!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was the core of demonic beasts. Nevertheless, it was the inner demonic beast pill that was more than a thousand years. Qing Shui felt that its size was almost the same as the inner pill of the millennium huge snake king, except that it was slightly bigger.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This thing was even more precious compared to the millennium medicinal herbs. An important fact was that in the world of the nine continents, within the unknown deep mountains and woodlands, there were actually a lot of millennium medicinal herbs, two millennium, three millennium, even though they were not all over the land. However, those places were especially dangerous.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Therefore, formidable warriors who were poor would not appear in the world of nine continents. The precondition was to be formidable enough.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Demonic Beast Forest and Giant Beasts Mountain were places like this. The fortune within was astonishing but simultaneously, there was also a great risk. In the world of nine continents, there were very few people who dared to enter these two places. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After that, Qing Shui once again opened up a bright case that was almost the size of the previous one,except it was a bit bigger. After he opened it, it was a red demonic beast’s core.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The age of the demonic beast’s core was judged by its color.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Demonic beast’s cores that lasted only for a millennium or less were milky white in color. The cores that ranged from one to two millenniums were red in color. Those that ranged from two to three millenniums were orange, three to four millenniums were yellow, four to five millenniums were dark green, five to six millenniums were green, six to seven millenniums were blue and those that ranged from seven to eight millenniums were purple.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was said that the demonic beast’s core that lasted for more than ten thousand years were rainbow colored.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the unknown inner pill in his hand. It was dark red and seemed like it was an inner bladder that was close to two thousand years. When he refined his own Golden Innate Pellet, he was lacking these exact inner pills.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Every core would need warm nourishment for at least a thousand years. Of course there would also be exceptions. In those years, the deeper the color of the inner demonic beast pills, the closer they would be to the years counted later in this time. Just like Qing Shui’s core that was dark red, it indicated that it was already near two thousand years, so it was already a core of two millennium. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The change in colors of the demonic beast’s core didn't actually happen as soon as it reached the year count. They were the same as a human’s breakthrough - only after it broke through would its color change. Each time it broke through, its strength would increase in folds. Of course, the difficulty of it breaking through was even more difficult than that of humans. After all, it could only advance into the next color after a thousand years.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There were some low grade demonic beasts that would sometimes take in the most valuable treasure of some kind of medicines which led to them living for three thousand years. However, the core within might only be red, or even milky white in color. Therefore, the colors were actually a judgement of the demonic beasts’ strength. Of course, the longer it took to measure the strength would mean that the core was more precious. For cores in the same year, the deeper the color, the more valuable it was. For the cores of the same color, the longer the years, the more valuable it was.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">These kinds of dark-red colored inner pills were already really precious. There were still inner pill cases that were even bigger than the case that contained the dark red colored inner pill. Qing Shui had stopped opening them up one by one. He immediately kept all of them in the Realm of Violet Jade.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, an iron swelling with such a strong spirit energy?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Take it away!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After one round, Qing Shui took away almost seventy percent of the things in Yan Clan’s treasure pavilion. Qing Shui felt that the remaining things were not useful to him. For example, some of the weapons and armors that he forged himself with his current level were much stronger than what remained. The materials were also not that good. That was why Qing Shui abandoned them right away.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">For this one round, Qing Shui stayed for one and a half days. When he walked out of the treasure pavilion, he once again used the golden lock to lock up the cell. Seeing as dawn appeared to the east of the sky, he knew that the sky would very soon light up completely.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A silent Qing Shui went back to his room. Actually from the time Qing Shui went out to the time he returned, the owner of the Misty Palace had been looking at him in front of the window. However, Qing Shui didn't sense it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Every time she looked at Qing Shui, there was an unusual feeling. Ever since the pleasant and romantic dream-like incident, she had been tortured by Qing Shui for a really long time. A feeling of being touched by a pair of warm hands would often arise on the front part of her breast.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This damned little bastard, so lecherous, thinking quietly about these things every day.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Actually, she didn't know that everyday in the Realm of Violet Jade, Qing Shui would think about it once. However, if it was changed to the owner of Misty Palace, it would be thirty times a day, though Qing Shui had thought about it more than that.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The heavenly face below the scarf of the owner of Misty Palace was actually a bit scarlet, so much so that the pupils that didn't contain any impurities also turned misty at this moment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, no one saw it. No one had seen how she looked when she got polluted by the smell of the world of human mortals. It was just that very quickly, she would recover back to her usual expression in an instant. After she became constantly aroused, she knew that it would be very difficult for her to be like how she once was previously.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the morning, Qing Shui still delivered breakfast to the Misty Palace Mistress. This time, both of them even had the meal together. The both of them said very little. Qing Shui picked out the things that he had to say. He was absolutely unable to let go in front of her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui acted very weird. To her, he didn't actually think of having her like how he had Huo Yun Liu-Li and Canghai Mingyue. However, for some reason, he just hoped that she would look up to him. He didn't want to be looked down upon by her. Therefore, Qing Shui was scared that he would say the wrong things. He was scared that it would make her unhappy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took out the copied training method for Divine Arm Clearing, Divine Feet Clearing and the title pages that the owner of Misty Palace gave him, together with all of the Plum Blossom Wine and put it on the table.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You still have Interspatial silk sachet? Haven’t you given it to Mingyue?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Misty Palace Mistress looked at Qing Shui strangely. After all, how precious the Interspatial silk sachet was could not be estimated. That was something that needed the fur of the Martial Saint Demonic Beasts. Furthermore, for it to work, it would also need to be from special Martial Saint Demonic Beasts. What was more precious was that the method of making this Interspatial silk sachet was particularly rare.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The most famous people who were capable of refining Interspatial silk sachet were none other than the great refining family Mu Clan that was in Eastern Victory Divine Continent. Therefore, the people who had the Interspatial silk sachet would normally be people of great background. My own Interspatial silk sachet……” The Misty Palace Mistress shook her head.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui nodded while smiling. “Yeah yeah!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Misty Palace Mistress extended her hand and put away all of the things on the table. She also had an Interspatial silk sachet. On the table, only the plum blossom wine, a cauldron that was slightly bigger and two delicate small wine bottles remained.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She was distracted at the moment she received the Divine Arm Clearing and a few of the animal skin papers of Divine Feet Clearing. When she saw the papers on top, she looked at Qing Shui strangely for a while. However, she didn't say anything.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that it was because she felt the spiritual fluctuation on it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Today, she was still not wearing her veil. She and Qing Shui were separated by only a small side table. They were so close that he could smell the aroma that emitted from her body. It resembled the faint and sweet scent of cymbidiums. It also resembled the delicate fragrance of orchids and even though it was very faint, Qing Shui was infatuated with it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Looking at the heavenly face that was pretty to the point of shaking one’s core, it was like the doings of gods. Never would Qing ShuI've thought that a woman could be this pretty.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Misty Palace Mistress extended a pair of snow weeds to open up the lid of the cauldron. Immediately, that familiar aroma assailed his nostrils, an icy mist-like gas even floated out from it. It was cool and greasy to the heart, causing her to be absent-minded for a moment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Slowly, she filled up seventy percent of a small wine bottle. Right when she wanted to fill up the other bottle, Qing Shui hurriedly stopped her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Isn’t this helpful for breakthrough? I won’t drink it then……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui said that, he felt incomparably awkward and regretful. He felt like he had done something wrong. As he looked at the Misty Palace Mistress, his face felt a bit hot.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yet, the Misty Palace Mistress smiled while she looked at Qing Shui. This time, she really did smile. Qing Shui saw her neat white teeth that were beautiful and brilliant, it made him lost in thought.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright, why are you not willing to drink with me?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Misty Palace Mistress saw Qing Shui’s infatuation, but she didn't feel disgusted with it. She found that she actually didn’t hate the pair of clear eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Slowly, she once again filled up seventy percent of the wine bottle.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui came back to his senses and held up a small wine bottle with a bitter smile. “Thank you for saving my life from the most unpleasant moment. I will not say any good things, in the future, I will return the favor with a realistic action.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I look forward to your arrival. As for returning the favor, there is no need. In the future, it will be fine as long as you can let me drink this kind of alcohol often. Only you should have this. This is the most delicious drink I've ever had.” Misty Palace Mistress held up the wine bottle.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ding!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It collided softly for a moment and the both of them finished it in one go.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She kept the ancient cauldron and the wine bottle on the table in the Interspatial silk sachet. Even Qing Shui’s wine bottle was put away.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, I should leave now!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that the Misty Palace Mistress would leave very soon. However, he didn't think that it would be this soon. Yesterday, she said that she would stay here for up to two days, so he didn't expect that it would only be for only a night and a half. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I will send you!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No need. I don’t think I will greet them. You greet them in my place.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Today when we go to the Guo Clan, we still have to thank them. What do you say, sister?” Qing Shui smiled slightly while looking at Qing Qing&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing slightly knitted her brows.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I am your sister. Whoever does not treat you well, I will treat them back the same way in folds. However, whoever treated you well, I will do so to them in folds, too. Is that OK?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at Qing Qing. She was still smiling faintly. It was just that the expression was particularly serious.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yeah!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing smiled slightly while she nodded to Qing Shui. Now, at least he could see her smile. Even though it was faint, he could still confirm that it was a smile.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Guo Clan was also influential in Yan City. Even though Guo Clan’s clans head Guo Yanglong was only a courtyard protector of Qin Clan in GreenCloud Continent, it was already considered a supreme honor in a place like Yan City in Yan Jiang Country. Quo Clan, Lai Clan, Luo Clan, the reason why it could stand up to Yan Clan and Xiao Clan was because there was the existence of Guo Yanglong.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Who asked Qin Clan to be so protective of errors. This was also why Guo PoLu dared to interfere face to face with Elder Master Xiao. It was also because of this that Qing Qing was able to hold on until Qing Shui and the others rushed here.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Guo Clan mansion, compared to Xiao Clan, was considerably smaller. No matter in terms of the imposing manner, or the construction, they were obviously lower by one grade. There were also only four standing guards at the doorway.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Everyone, please come in!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was startled. “ Do I not need to notify anyone?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No need, I will bring everyone in.” The expression when this guard looked at Qing Shui had a considerable amount of admiration.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui touched his nose. “ When have I become so popular……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This person took Qing Shui and his party and walked into Guo Clan. Among the remaining three people, there was once again one more person who left quickly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After all, Guo Clan was also an influential clan. Even though it was not as luxurious as Yan Clan or Xiao Clan, at the end of the day, it was still an influential clan. The things that should be in the design of the courtyard was all there.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As he stepped on the stony surface, it gave out a clear and rigid “Pa-pa” noise. The noise echoed far away. Qing Shui constantly looked at the buildings that were around him and some of the unskilled workers or disciples and protector of Guo Clan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There were people whose eyesight would give out light when they saw Qing Shui and the party. There were also those who would not have much reactions. There would also be people who didn't even look at Qing Shui and the party.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After walking for quite a distance, a group of seven or eight people were seen walking towards them from the opposite side. The person who was leading was a robust middle-aged man. He was really strong, but his face was handsome. When he saw Guo PoLu in the back, he knew that the person who was leading was the Guo Clan’s clan head Guo Yanglong. In the middle, there were two elderly men with white hair and &nbsp;youthful faces.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mister, I am on the way! Sorry for greeting you from far away, please forgive me!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The man’s loud and clear voice came through from far away. It made people feel really amiable and respectful.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After hearing the noise, Qing Shui felt that Guo Yanglong truly had good fortune. This kind of man should be able to attract girls. Having a pretty boy’s face but also the muscles of a masculine man, adding the manly voice, this was precisely the kind that a lot of girls liked the most.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Women criticized that pretty boys were not manly enough, and also criticized that masculine men were not handsome enough. That was why a lot of the women liked tall, powerful, and also capable handsome men…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui looked at Guo Yanglong, he felt that this man was truly this kind of man!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Uncle was too formal, you can just call me Qing Shui!” Qing Shui smiled while he greeted Guo Yanglong.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Haha, alright. Today, we are all happy. Come, let’s all go in!” &nbsp;Guo Yanglong laughed while leading Qing Shui and the party to the largest pavilion building.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Qing!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As Qing Shui saw Guo PoLu almost putting all his sights on Qing Qing, he could not help but want to laugh. Contrary to what one might think, this Guo PoLu was an affectionate person, even though Qing Shui could not confirm anything, he could still sense the sincere look.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was just that when Qing Shui saw the his sister's expression, he already knew that Guo Polu’s journey would be very difficult. No matter what, Qing Shui decided to give Guo PoLu a chance. As for whether it would work out, it would depend on his own actions.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was actually not that outstanding in terms of getting along with other people. However, as for Guo Yanglong, everyone was also happy when they were chatting with each other.
