 <p><strong>AST 1117 - Golden Ni Lion, 15 Minutes, nimbus Strength, Buddha Torched Eyes</strong></p>
 <p>Another thing which puzzled Qing Shui was that the old man’s abilities even in the other Four Continents wouldn’t allow him to tame a Golden Ni Lion. Qing Shui knew a little of the Golden Ni Lion. It was an extremely strong demonic beast which has dragon’s blood or some other ancient blood lineage.</p>
 <p>The old man had every reason to feel confident. If it was really a Golden Ni Lion, then the results of the fight would be more or less settled. Of course, Qing Shui would have no problems in escaping but, could he? He would need some time to activate the Nine Continents Step, but he wasn’t sure if he would have that time.</p>
 <p>Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring!</p>
 <p>If that happened, it should be still possible to escape with the ladies using the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Rings. Thinking of this, Qing Shui felt a little more relieved. At most, they could just hide if he really couldn't handle it.</p>
 <p>It wasn't as if Qing Shui didn't believe what the old man’s words. That old man, as well as the over ten people whom Qing Shui had killed, were all old monsters from the other Four Continents. In addition, the world's regulations in the Sealed Northern Ice Emperor Region was slightly weaker than in other regions. The horrible weather here caused people here to have better physiques when compared with people from other areas.</p>
 <p>"Since you have the Golden Ni Lion, why didn't you use it earlier?" Qing Shui activated his Focused Concentration and asked as he looked at the old man.</p>
 <p>"You should know that with my abilities, I'm not able to seal the Golden Ni Lion into this Demonic Beast Token. Additionally, one of the Golden Ni Lion’s limbs is seriously injured. However, don't doubt its abilities." The old man looked at Qing Shui and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't know why the old man was telling him all these things. All the others in the surroundings could hear him as well. They all listened anxiously since it also concerned their own life and death.</p>
 <p>The old man looked at Qing Shui and said with a smile, "This Golden Ni Lion only has 15 minutes of lifespan left but it was jointly sealed by other members of the Beitang Clan and myself in the other Four Continents. Therefore, the moment it comes out, it will kill me."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui now understood the reason. This Golden Ni Lion which had 15 minutes of lifespan left hadn't been tamed by the old man. He had only wanted to let the Golden Ni Lion use this 15 minutes to cause a massacre.</p>
 <p>It wouldn't be strange if the Golden Ni Lion were to kill the old man since he was the one who had sealed it and they were enemies. It would then continue to attack the strongest person in the vicinity. This was due to a demonic beast's instincts, since those who were powerful would be a threat to them.</p>
 <p>The old man might not have wanted to bring this out until the very last moment since letting the Golden Ni Lion would mean that he would die. However, now that things had come to this stage, he had decided to let the Golden Ni Lion run wild for this 15 minutes. 15 minutes should be sufficient for it to wipe out at least half the people around here.</p>
 <p>"Sir, can I ask you a question?" Qing Shui gave it some thought and asked.</p>
 <p>"Go ahead. As long as it's something which I can say, I'll definitely tell you." The old man looked at Qing Shui calmly.</p>
 <p>"What is the strength of the strongest person you've seen in the other Four Continents?" Qing Shui was very curious about the strength of the people in the other Four Continents and also wanted to know if there was anyone in the False God or Divine Realms.</p>
 <p>The old man fell silent for a moment before saying slowly, "In the other Four Continents, the strongest person I've seen is one with a strength with ten thousand nimbus."</p>
 <p>This time around, the old man's voice was so soft that only Qing Shui could hear it. It was clear that the old man didn't wish for the others to hear what he said. Qing Shui understood and replied in a voice which only the old man could hear, "How much is ten thousand nimbus?"</p>
 <p>"Ten thousand stars is the equivalent to one nimbus!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. Ten thousand stars were equivalent to one nimbus. What a terrifying strength this was. Even if he were to reach the other Four Continents, the strongest attack he could make would only be about several hundred nimbus. There seemed to be a very great gap.</p>
 <p>"Thank you!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't question the old man about the realm a person with a strength of ten thousand nimbus was at. He knew that the old man wouldn't speak further. A strength of ten thousand nimbus made Qing Shui's heart go into a turmoil. What kind of situation was it in their other Four Continents? He wouldn't think that there were Martial Emperors everywhere in the other Four Continents but rather, most of the inhabitants should still be ordinary people. However, some major sects such as Formation Immortal Sect would probably have very powerful characters amongst them.</p>
 <p>It might be that one would only be able to pursue the peaks of martial arts in the other Four Continents.</p>
 <p>"Young man, are you ready? 15 minutes. If you can hang on for 15 minutes, it's your win." The old man looked at Qing Shui and gradually activated the Demonic Beast Token he held.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>The scene that followed caused everyone to feel stumped and horrified as a violent aura slowly spread out. Next, a huge demonic beast which was a hundred meters long appeared. The beast was covered in golden color all over. Its huge body was like that of a lion but it had a stretched ratio compared to a normal one, its tail was like that of a fish and was very long. It was several tens of meters tall but it had a big head like that of a Jiao Dragon. Even the horns on its head were several meters long.</p>
 <p>To think that golden-colored flames would be coming out from all over its body!</p>
 <p>This was a seriously injured Golden Ni Lion?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could only sense the pressure gushing toward him. However, what made many astonished was the next thing which the Golden Ni Lion did!</p>
 <p>After letting out a huge bellow, it swallowed the old man in one mouthful...</p>
 <p>Putting aside the fact of whether the old man had any strength to retaliate, the old man had at least smiled and looked at Qing Shui as he let the Golden Ni Lion swallow him up.</p>
 <p>Everyone panicked, but they didn't dare to move recklessly. Only those who were near the Golden Ni Lion started to shout and run away but their shouts seemed to have alarmed the Golden Ni Lion.</p>
 <p>With a flash of its huge figure, it appeared next to the people who were anxiously making their escape. The lion spewed out golden-colored flames from its mouth, turning these people into ash.</p>
 <p>The Five Elements Golden Flames was the sharpest flame and it could destroy almost everything. Entering the golden flames would subject one to an experience similar to being cut up by countless spinning blades...</p>
 <p>With that, many people didn't dare to move anymore. It was as if those who were more anxious to run would die first. In such a short moment of time, over a hundred people had died again. Qing Shui stood there, unmoving. As long as the time passed, they would be fine.</p>
 <p>Actually, he could also use the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring to enter the formation and then use the ring to temporarily leave the place with the other people, returning after 15 minutes. However, he knew that he mustn't do that now. He needed to inspire a sense of awe in the rest of the people here.</p>
 <p>There wasn't much time left. When the others didn't move, the Golden Ni Lion suddenly dashed out towards Qing Shui. Qing Shui was shocked. The old man was so confident that after devouring him, it would definitely attack Qing Shui next.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui casually struck out with the Nine Continents Mountain to block the beast for a short while before quickly calling out the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, the Thunderous Beast, and the Six-Headed Demonic Spider. The situation wasn't looking good and the aura exuded by the lion made Qing Shui on tenterhooks. There must be a reason why the old man was so confident.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The Nine Continents Mountain was slapped back by the Golden Ni Lion but it remained intact. Qing Shui controlled the Nine Continents Mountain to move above the Golden Ni Lion, ready to smash down anytime.</p>
 <p>Descending Heavens Talisman!</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demons!</p>
 <p>Fiery Golden Eyes!</p>
 <p>Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't say anything more. As long as there were things which could be used to weaken it, he just dished them out, using as many as he could!</p>
 <p>In the middle, he even used the ring to moved several times within a small area.</p>
 <p>Thunderbolt!</p>
 <p>The Demonic Spiders called out by the Six-Headed Demonic Spider went up and surrounded the Golden Ni Lion.</p>
 <p>It would be fine if he could tide through these 15 minutes. Qing Shui felt that using the demonic beasts such as the Thunderous Beast and Six-Headed Demonic Spider was a good choice. The latter was able to summon many demonic spiders, including some four-headed ones. All of them dashed out toward the Golden Ni Lion without fearing death.</p>
 <p>The Golden Ni Lion continued to roar out furiously, killing a large number of the demonic spiders. During this time, the Six-Headed Demonic Spider also continuously shot out spider webs to entangle the Golden Ni Lion but there wasn't much effect. Although the Six-Headed Demonic Spider was very powerful now, its web could only come into contact with the Golden Ni Lion's body for just a short moment before they were burned.</p>
 <p>The same went for the Corrosive Poison Web. Qing Shui knew that the gap between their abilities was much too great.</p>
 <p>Flying Spider Silk!</p>
 <p>After using this, its speed would increase by six times. This ability would last for 15 minutes. It could be used three times every day.</p>
 <p>The Six-Headed Demonic Spider continued to spew out its corrosive web all over the place, allowing the other demonic spiders to be able to either make use of the webbing to either dodge or entangle the Golden Ni Lion. Although the Golden Ni Lion was strong, it would need to take some time before it could completely burn and destroy all these demonic spiders.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>It might be because the demonic spiders or the Thunderous Beast's Thunderbolt had infuriated the Golden Ni Lion but it started to dash in a straight line, leaving a tunnel of golden flames with it standing in the middle. It looked just like a demon from the deep abyss.</p>
 <p>Golden Flame of Life!</p>
 <p>When the demonic spiders got close to the fire tunnel, they would be burned to ash.</p>
 <p>The weakening effects from earlier still had some effect. At least right now, Qing Shui had less of an urge to escape.</p>
 <p>Diamond Buddha Devil Staff, fourth stance, roiling five seas!</p>
 <p>The brilliant golden staff was like a slope as it smashed down towards the Golden Ni Lion.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui controlled the Nine Continents Mountain and smashed it down on the Golden Ni Lion!</p>
 <p>Thunderbolt!</p>
 <p>The Thunderous Beast continued to attack with its Thunderbolt. Qing Shui didn't wish to let it use the Violet Lightning Strike right now. Although it had a 100% chance of inducing paralysis, the gap between their strengths was far too huge. If the paralyzing effect wasn't even effective for a short moment, it would be useless.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The Golden Ni Lion spewed out a huge golden fireball against the golden staff. An explosion occurred and the golden staff shattered in the air.</p>
 <p>Even after it had been weakened, the Golden Ni Lion was still much more powerful than Qing Shui. He couldn't accurately estimate its strength.</p>
 <p>Buddha's True Eyes, Buddha Torched Eyes!</p>
 <p>The huge Buddha's eyes suddenly opened, his eyes as if golden spheres of light. It was extremely brilliant.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui once again formed signs with his hands.</p>
 <p>Diamond Buddha Devil Staff, fifth stance, heaven crushing!</p>
 <p>A golden staff that wasn't much bigger than earlier appeared. However, this time it was a pure golden color. There was even a sitting Buddha image on it, exuding a heavy and dignified aura.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's spirit energy was slightly faint now.</p>
 <p>Biting down on his tongue, he pushed down with his hands!</p>
 <p>The huge golden staff pressed downward at a rapid speed, moving much faster than before.</p>
 <p>Violet Lightning Strike!</p>
 <p>At this moment, the Thunderous Beast and Qing Shui communicated through their consciousness and it used the Violet Lightning Strike.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>An instant of paralysis was induced and the huge staff smashed down hard with an overwhelming pressure just as the Golden Ni Lion was about to spew its golden flames.</p>
 <p>Boom! Roar!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui performed this attack with is full power and he had even used his final trump card, the fifth stance of the Diamond Buddha Devil Staff. He wouldn't have been able to perform this in his earlier condition but his Buddha's True Eyes had the ability to allow him to ignore the restrictions of his level and perform this attack.</p>
 <p>Buddha Torched Eyes!</p>
 <p>This wasn't an attack but it allowed him to increase his strength for a breath's time, allowing him to use techniques which he couldn't use normally.</p>
 <p>The Golden Ni Lion was struck and sent backward for over a hundred meters, its expression a bit dispirited. During this time, the Thunderous Beast's Thunderbolt continued to land on it.</p>
 <p>With the Golden Ni Lion's abilities, it basically could ignore an attack like the Thunderbolt. However, the Violet Lightning Strike from earlier had given it a tough time. The Violet Lightning Strike had targeted its eyes. Although it had thought that it would be able to avoid the attack, it actually only missed its eyes but still struck its body.</p>
