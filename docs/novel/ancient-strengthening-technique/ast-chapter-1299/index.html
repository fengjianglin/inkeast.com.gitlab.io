 <p><strong>AST 1299 - The most powerful king of assassination, King of Hell</strong></p>
 <p>“She is from Ling Clan. Of course, she is my girlfriend. We have been getting along well with each other. However, Heifeng Clan is said to be really powerful. They are also really arrogant. I have always wanted to beat them to a pulp.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had never heard of Ling Clan before. Before he left last time, Qing Shui had remembered most of the clans nearby. It was just that back then, there were not any Heifeng Clan or Ling Clan. If they used to be normal clans, Qing Shui would not find that too surprising. However, the important part was that Qing Ming made them sound very powerful. Could they have happened to move here from outside?</p>
 <p>However, when he thought about how Qing Ming was just a wimpy kid, how strong could they be his eyes?</p>
 <p>“Oh, little brat, do you know what a girlfriend does?” Qing Shui asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, are you trying to corrupt this child!” At this moment, Mingyue Gelou protested coquettishly. She approached them and looked at the two speechlessly.</p>
 <p>“I know, I know, they’re just like you and mother.” Qing Ming said, looking like he understood things clearly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked a bit awkward until Qing Ming quickly went on to add one more sentence. Hearing that, Qing Shui’s expression became a lot better.</p>
 <p>“A girlfriend is your future wife. She is someone who you are supposed to marry.” Finally, Qing Ming managed to say something normal. Prior to this, even Qing Shui had got the shock of his life. He thought that this child might have seen something he was not supposed to.</p>
 <p>“Gelou, can you tell me about these two clans?” Qing Shui asked Mingyue Gelou with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Those two clans just moved here a year ago. Ling Clan is really low-profile but it seems like these two clans know each other. It seems like the reason that Heifeng Clan moved here was precisely for Ling Clan. In comparison, Heifeng Clan tends to be more arrogant. But still, they wouldn’t go too overboard.”</p>
 <p>“Have you seen our son’s girlfriend before?” Qing Shui asked with a smile.</p>
 <p>“I have seen her before. She is a very delicate and fine-looking girl. It’s just that she is four or five years older than him.” Mingyue Gelou said speechlessly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned and looked toward Mingyue Gelou, only to see her rolling her eyes at him. This was because among Qing Shui’s women, the youngest one was basically still one or two years older than himself. Now, it turned out that his son had also looked for a girlfriend a lot older than himself. Could this be something to do with the genetics?</p>
 <p>“I am really curious though, that little girlfriend of his, why would she like someone who’s so young?” Qing Shui asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know either. I don’t know what kind of spell that brat cast on the girl. It seems like they get along quite well with each other,” Mingyue Gelou said. When it came to problems concerning Qing Ming, she seemed a bit out of ideas as well.</p>
 <p>“Ming`Er, you are still quite young……”</p>
 <p>“Father, are you trying to say that I’m still a child? What’s important is my cultivation!” Qing Ming interrupted Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui heard this, he instantly became aware that Mingyue Gelou had been mentioning this quite frequently. He knew that if he was to say something like this, he would bring the opposite effect. Hence, he could only reply by saying, “No, daddy won’t stop you. Let’s talk about the problems regarding your cultivation. Don’t you want to step on your opponents?”</p>
 <p>“I do want to step on them but i’m still very young. The only thing I am good at is my slightly faster speed. The only thing I am capable of doing is running. There is no power to it,” Qing Ming said after a few thoughts. Despite being quite young, across the continents, children who matured early would tend to already understand quite a lot of things.</p>
 <p>“Speed is the only thing which can never be beaten among the various martial arts across the world!”</p>
 <p>While speaking, Qing Shui took out a leaf and casually tossed out a knife. Then, he shot out the leaf.</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>A clear noise of metal snapping was heard.</p>
 <p>“Ming`Er, you may still not be that strong. But if you have absolute speed, you will definitely be able to beat your opponent with just one strike. There are a lot of weaknesses to the human body like their eyes, throat, and acupoints. There’re a few acupoints that could easily severely injure your opponent, allowing you to instantly kill them. That’s as long as you possess absolute speed.”</p>
 <p>Actually, Qing Shui did not mention the fact that both speed and strength were connected. With speed, there would be strength. Only through having a certain strength would one be able to make themselves faster.</p>
 <p>As Qing Ming looked at Qing Shui snapping the knife with a leaf, an excited look flashed across his eyes. Even though the leaf shattered, the knife was also snapped. This very leaf was capable of killing someone. To people at his age, this would somewhat still be extremely impressive to them.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not mention how powerful he was himself. He did not want his son to think that he could do whatever he liked just because he had a powerful father. Only by relying on yourself would one be able to live long. Only through this would they mature. Hence, despite Qing Ming’s young age, Qing Shui would still need to let him understand this principle.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, can I also cultivate up to this kind of speed?” Qing Ming asked really excitedly.</p>
 <p>“As long as you cultivate well, I guarantee that you will be able to manage ten times this speed. Hell, even a hundred times shouldn’t be a problem. You might even be able to kill some huge demonic beasts without much effort.” Qing Shui said with a smile. He had to draw out a satisfying blueprint for them.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, don’t lie to me!”</p>
 <p>“You are my son, what will I get from lying to you?” Qing Shui rubbed Qing Ming’s head.</p>
 <p>Qing Ming let out a happy smile. He laughed just because of what Qing Shui said.</p>
 <p>“Here, take off your clothes. Daddy will help you out a little.” Qing Shui took out the Golden Needles.</p>
 <p>Mingyue Gelou smiled as Qing Ming took off his clothes.</p>
 <p>“Mommy, I don’t have to take off everything do I? I am already old enough,” Qing Ming said with a bitter face.</p>
 <p>“Little brat, so you will still feel embarrassed? I used to help you shower last year as well. What’s wrong? You are already feeling embarrassed after getting a girlfriend?” Mingyue Gelou could not help but tease him.</p>
 <p>She was a very composed woman who possessed a pure and noble aura. But the mark between her eyebrows made her look a bit flirtatious, causing her to be fatally attractive. Similarly, she also tended to pamper Qing Ming. Even if she beat him, she would tend to hold back a little. Qing Ming might have been mischievous and the only things he tended to do was fighting with others and doing things which would surprise everyone. However, in terms of showing respect to his seniors, he was just like everyone. He also took extra care of the children younger than him within Qing Clan. He could fight with others for his brothers and sisters. Even if he was no match for them, he would still proceed to fight.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew about all of these things. Hence, in his eyes, this little brat was still considered a little man. Of course, both Qing Zun and Qing Yin were also the same. So far, Qing Zun is the one with the highest achievement. Qing Ming, on the other hand, took the side path. Qing Zun was just like Nature Energy, whereas Qing Ming was like the Emperor’s Pernicious Aura.</p>
 <p>“Ming`Er, in the future, take cultivating your speed and the Nine Palace Steps as a priority. Of course, the Solitary Fist is no exception. Your body is suited to cultivating speed. In the future, you will turn out to be the most powerful solitary warrior in battle. Speaking of this, are you interested in being an assassin?” Qing Shui asked while giving him an acupuncture treatment.</p>
 <p>It’s fairly easy for Qing Shui to unlock the body physique of Qing Ming’s body. Qing Ming himself did not really need to do anything. Hence, considering how boring it was, it’s better to have a conversation with each other.</p>
 <p>“Assassin? Do they kill people secretly?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and shook his head, “There's quite a few kinds of assassins. The ones which you’re talking about are tiny assassins. The only thing they are capable of is dealing a sneak attack and assassinating their opponents. Most of the assassins across the continent are these kinds of assassins.</p>
 <p>“Oh, actually, I am also really interested in this. I wonder what kind of an assassin the most powerful assassin is?” Qing Ming was getting more curious.</p>
 <p>“The most powerful assassin is like the king of hell. He can kill whoever he wants, even if there were a lot of people defending that particular person, he will still be able to kill them in front of everyone. He has the most powerful one-hit kill. He is capable of overcoming formations as well as breaking through the crowd. He can disguise as anyone he wants. He specializes in poisons, knockout drugs, and many things more. They are capable of doing everything.” Qing Shui said in an attempt to guide him.</p>
 <p>“Ah, assassinating, poisons, disguise, escaping. I like all of them……” Qing Ming said excitedly.</p>
 <p>Mingyue Gelou could not help but have a strong headache trying to listen to him. It was up to the point where she felt like just letting out her hands to give this little brat a beating. Nor did she understand why Qing Shui was trying to educate Qing Ming about this.</p>
 <p>Basically, Qing Shui’s Golden Needles had already been scattered across Qing Ming’s body. Last time, Qing Shui had already helped him built up a foundation. To all cultivators a foundation must be built while they’re young. This was very important. Last time, Qing Shui had precisely helped him to build a foundation in his speed. This might also be the reason that he awakened his Body of Wind.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, it feels as if my body is getting lighter.” Qing Ming said in shock.</p>
 <p>“Try to feel it more carefully!” Qing Shui only said this once. After that, he quickly poked the Golden Needles with both hands.</p>
 <p>After roughly an hour, Qing Shui stored the Golden Needle after removing them from Qing Ming’s body, “Go shower. After that, try your best to run using Ghostly Steps and Nine Palace Steps for two hours.”</p>
 <p>Most of the things across Qing Ming’s body were black filth particles. This was the result of Impurities Cleansing. As Qing Ming looked at the dirt and odorous scent across his body, he chuckled and ran away. Even he found himself to be very stinky. But other than being deeply concerned, he did not see any changes in Qing Shui and Mingyue Gelou.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui grabbed Mingyue Gelou and they sat down together on the ground.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, if Ming`Er keeps on retaining this attitude of his, I’m afraid he might take the wrong path,” Mingyue Gelou said with a bit of worry.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, we cannot forcefully try to change our children. We need to show them guidance. Especially for children like Ming`Er, the more you try to stop him, the more he will try to defy you. With this kind of thought in his heart, it will be very easy for him to truly walk up the wrong path.” Qing Shui was not really too worried about it.</p>
 <p>“Ming`Er isn’t suited to be an assassin with his body physique.”</p>
 <p>“He possesses the Body of Wind. It is a precious kind of body type. It is unrivaled in terms of speed. Additionally, this little brat possesses a somewhat gloomy heart, he is suited to be an assassin. Of course, my son will definitely not be an assassin who works for others. If he is to be an assassin, he would have to be the king among the assassins, the king of hell.” A look of pride flashed across Qing Shui’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, don’t let him kill that many people. It often won’t end well for murderers.” Mingyue Gelou was still a bit worried.</p>
 <p>“Killing people is always better than getting killed by yourself. Besides, whether you are good or evil really depends on your heart. By holding onto your heart, nothing you do will feel over the line. I have also been called a demon lord who murders people by many. Do you find me scary?” Qing Shui smiled and looked at Mingyue Gelou.</p>
 <p>“You aren’t. Even if you happen to really be a demon lord who kills people, I will still follow you. It’s something which I decided to do of my own will so I will I not have any regrets.”</p>
 <p>“Is there anything more to not be satisfied with other than having a wife like you? We all take different paths. Don’t worry, with me here, no one will be able to endanger the two of you. Let alone the fact that Ming`Er will definitely be an unordinary person in the future. Actually, I find the little brat’s attitude quite alright too.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>In the morning, Qing Shui took out some time to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. At night, he still needed to accompany them. With what had happened yesterday night, Qing Shui was not going to repeat the same thing again tonight. In any case, he was going to stay over the house for quite a few days. Hence, he would stay for up to an entire night in each of their rooms and accompany them to talk about their private things. Of course, during the conversation, they would still do the things which they loved doing.</p>
 <p>At night, Qing Shui pushed open Yiye Jiange’s room door because she would be leaving tomorrow.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange looked beautiful like a fairy in her sleeping gown. It felt as if she was not stained by even the slightest aura from the secular world. Her hair was scattered out like clouds. Despite this, its beauty was something which ordinary hair could not compare to.</p>
