He was terrified that the Spirit Fish would eat some of his precious little fish. The current pond could already be considered as a small lake. It was quite deep with several rock mountains and caves inside it. Each kind of fish and tortoise had their own space where they swam. Only this Spirit Fish was by itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; It's a pity that Qing Shui could only fish one of them up. He hoped to catch another one, so at least this one would have a partner. Now that he had the Spirit Fish, Qing Shui could relax his mind. It would act as a guide when he leaves for Sea King's Palace later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Spirit Fish could be raised, but not tamed. Whenever Qing Shui was inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he would try to communicate with it as he raised it, so he could at least become its friend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; During these two years, Qing Shui's strength had continuously increased, but he felt that it was still too slow, even though it looked very fast to outsiders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The time within the Realm of the Violet Immortal after converting the 2 years wasn't insignificant. His raw strength had increased by 1000 suns, reaching 6000 suns and raised his strength by 11 points. It was mainly because his strength had increased steadily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately, what made Qing Shui dissatisfied was that the time duration of 2 years wasn't enough to make a substantial breakthrough. His strength still hadn't reached the False God Stage. If only he were to overcome one False God Tribulation, his strength would increase by one-fold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Qing Shui really wanted to go through the False God Tribulation right now. Then, his strength would increase very quickly. Although it was dangerous, riches always came along with danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Qing Shui was quite willing to challenge this danger because he didn’t want to promote his strength little by little. If others knew that he felt that his speed was 'little by little,' perhaps they would feel extreme despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Even if others knew Qing Shui had the Realm of the Violet Immortal, they'd theorize something else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The benefits that this realm gave Qing Shui weren't as simple as the extension of time. Naturally, the extension of time was one of its most important effects. As time can change everything, in front of it, everything was vain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

Regarding them, Qing Shui had his own methods to make them feel assured.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Moreover, he didn't desire absolute loyalty from them. If they just took care of the internal affairs properly and didn't do anything to harm the Imperial Cuisine Hall, they'd have a lot of freedom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Coming to the backyard living room, Yin Tong, Tian Yi, and Lan Lingfeng were drinking. Xue Nuo, Yu Niang, Ziche Sha, and the rest with the few children were upstairs. Qing Shui could hear their voices.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Brother, how about it? It's already been two years. You shouldn't take this matter to your heart. It is bound to happen when the time comes. Perhaps one day, there might be a possibility that your wife voluntarily appears again."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, Brother-in-law. Elder Sister is quite strong." Xue Nuo came down from upstairs while laughing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Qing Shui shook his head. Humans were such chaotic beings. If the affair were related to themselves, everything would become obscure. This was what it's meant by the words - Those who are involved can't see clearly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; 3 years had already passed and since Qing Shui had been waiting during those 3 years, the actual time duration since he hadn't seen Yi Ye Jian Ge was over 10 years!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Qing Shui didn't remember clearly and also didn't want to have such thoughts. If he thought of her, he'd feel urged by the desire to see her, but now, it wasn't possible to see her even if he wanted to. This only made him feel sadder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Strength, I still need more strength. If I have enough strength, I can go to the Sea King's Palace myself to get to the bottom of this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; In those two years, the strength of Qing Shui's demonic beasts had also increased a lot. Though slower compared to his speed, he was pleased, especially regarding the Dragon Slaying Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Dragon Slaying Beast's strength had increased by one fold, and its size had already become the same as a camel and the bigger its build grew, the more terrifying it was. With its current build, even massive demonic beasts would fear fighting it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The stronger the Dragon Slaying Beast was, the bigger its figure grows, and the quicker its speed becomes. The pace at which its build grows is very slow. Initially, it resembled a calf, and just within these two years, its strength had increased so much that its build became the size of a camel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; With its current build, it could also act as a mount and display its entire might. The appearance of the Dragon Slaying Beast was very flashy and incomparably sharp. It could easily instantly kill even a super-huge demonic beast. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had already entered the stage where its progress became slower. Qin Shui knew that haste would make waste. The winner was the one with the firmer foundation. Although others could promote their strength, they didn't dare to do so because the disparity between their foundation and boundary was too wide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Qing Shui's boundary and foundation were in sync currently. Unfortunately, he was unable to find the breaking point to be promoted to a higher stage, and it also wasn't like some roadblock had appeared. He was merely habituated with increasing his strength rapidly and felt uneasy with his current promotion speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; After 2 years, Qing Shui was planning to take a look at Kunpeng Mountain. He had never thought of going there before, but he and the Dragon Slaying Beast had made quite the progress. As for the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and the Hellfire Phoenix, their strength wasn't able to surpass levels and fight. The Thunder Beast though had become more terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Legend states that the Thunder Beast possessed a Divine Beast bloodline and was an existence which was at the peak of the food chain. Their numbers were also very few. The reason Qing Shui wanted to leave for the Kunpeng Mountain Ranges was to let the Thunder Beast make a breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Thunder Beast!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Its raw strength was 100 suns. This progress speed was quite fast as compared to before. Although its figure hadn't grown, its skills became stronger. Since its control skills were stronger and its core ability was to control an area, the Dragon Slaying Beast would match with it to instantly kill the enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Violet Thunder Protection: It was the exclusive skill of the Thunder Beast. Its raw strength would increase by a hundred-fold with zero consumption. It works autonomously and would cause the enemy to be stunned if they received an attack. It also could cancel two of any enemy attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Qing Shui wasn't surprised at the ability of Violet Thunder Protection to increase its strength hundred-fold because of the bloodline Thunder Beast possessed. Perhaps it may even exceed a hundred-fold later on. Even the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and Hellfire Phoenix hadn't surpassed that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Thunderbolt: By using its core, it issues an attack which contains the power of thunder. The attack itself deals eight-fold damage, and the distance limit is six kilometers. There is also a stun effect in the attack which would reduce the speed, and slow down reaction speed. It would also cause self-inflicted fatigue, as the consumption of Thunderbolt was 20 times that of a regular attack.</span></p>

Its strength was 15 times a normal attack and has a 100% chance of stunning the enemy. The stun time depends on the enemy's strength. This skill could be used six times every three hours.</span></p>

The skill duration is 30 mins and needs a gap of one hour after for every two uses.</span></p>

Zero consumption. Uses violet thunder to condense a battle armor which could cancel out 50% of physical and spiritual attack strength!

Therefore, it needed to first guarantee its own survival. This Violet Lightning Armor was a pretty heaven-defying skill. Adding to the Violet Thunder Protection skill, this combo could cancel out half of the injuries made by the enemy and also increase its attack and defense power.</span></p>

And the probability of success was very low if there's a considerable gap between their strengths. Even if the skill was defeated, it could be used continuously until it activates successfully, but there needs to be a gap of few minutes between every successive try.</span></p>

Its attack strength reached 7 million suns and its defense reached 17 million suns. The Thunder Beast could cancel 70% of the enemy's attack, and under Qing Shui's hands, its defense had become stronger. After all, the Thunderous Beast's forte was control and not direct attacks.</span></p>

Compared to two years before, the Thunder Beast was stronger now. And Qing Shui felt that it still had a lot of space left to improve.</span></p>

Yin Tong and Lan Lingfeng also wanted to accompany him, but he refused them. He felt it would be easier to retreat if it was him alone.</span></p>

Naturally, since he was traveling on land, he made use of the Nine Continents Steps.</span></p>

There appeared a change two times in the Five Elements Divine Flag and a point appeared in the Western Oxhe Continent. Moreover, the Five Elements Divine Flag could carry four people now, a total of 5 including Qing Shui. But it wasn't possible to use the husband and wife transmission skill.</span></p>

In the first day, Qing Shui had reached the entrance of Kunpeng Mountain Range and noticed there were many people there.

Its borders were relatively safe. The deeper a person goes, the more dangers he faced. Qing Shui took a look around at the tents placed here and discovered several strong auras, so he decided to stop here for half-a-day before proceeding further.</span></p>
