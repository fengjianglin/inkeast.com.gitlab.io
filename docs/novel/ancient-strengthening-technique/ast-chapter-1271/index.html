 <p><strong>AST 1271 - Potential of the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider, Puppet </strong></p>
 <p>It was always been said that every women had the hidden potential to be fairies. There were women who would give a lot of men the impression that they were fairies, whereas some would only leave that impression to a single man.</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, Qing Shui had the feeling that Di Chen was a fairy who was only meant for himself. He looked at her extremely beautiful face and eyes which could topple over a city. There was a bit of cunningness hidden within the shy smile on her face. Nothing more beautiful than this could be imagined.</p>
 <p>Just like this, Qing Shui cuddled her quietly as they talked to each other. He waited until Di Chen fell asleep, only then did he slowly got up. It was almost time for him to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>As of now, the pace at which his strength increased was already really slow. At least during this period of time, it progressed very slowly. However, he could use this opportunity to stabilize his strength and refine his treasures. He could also use this time to create some medical ingredients.</p>
 <p>As soon as he entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, a powerful spiritual energy bombarded him in his face. This familiar aura which Qing Shui felt made him really quite satisfied. Whenever he looked around the entire place which belonged only to himself, he would feel really happy.</p>
 <p>Both the Fire Bird and Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant were strengthening at an extremely fast pace. Qing Shui was able to feel it really clearly. The rate at which the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant improved in particular really amazed Qing Shui. It was likely that these were the remnant strength left behind by the Fire Dragon. After all, the bloodline of the Fire Dragon was still really pure.</p>
 <p>Throughout this period of time, it had already increased its raw strength by 3,000 nimbus. Furthermore, instead of slowing down, the speed at which it improved became faster. Of course, this was also partly because of the time ratio within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal as the time within it was considerably long.</p>
 <p>The one which gave Qing Shui the most surprise was the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider. As of now, the pace at which it grew was already beyond Qing Shui’s knowledge. It had already eaten one-third of the Thousand Years Gloomy Fruit and the part which it ate had already started to bloom.</p>
 <p>This might have something to do with the spider growing out its seventh head. This caused the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider to ascend up to its top-grade and further led the Ancient Bloodline within its body to go through Blood Awakening, which resulted in an incredible fast rate of improvement. Even though it couldn’t be compared to the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, its strength had increased by as much as one fold.</p>
 <p>Its body seemed even stronger. The Seven-Headed Demonic Spider belonged to a control type demonic beast. If its strength increased by 10%, its controlling ability would increase by at least 30%. Hence, since its strength got multiplied by one fold this time, it could be considered that its controlling ability had increased by as much as three folds.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui kept having the feeling that the strength of the current Seven-Headed Demonic Spider was a lot stronger compared to before. He couldn’t help but to look into it with his Heavenly Vision Technique.</p>
 <p>Its raw strength had reached as much as 30,000 nimbus, which was equivalent to three sun worth of strength. This was already an unexpected surprise. How strong was the current Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and the current Fire Bird? Hence, Qing Shui knew that a noble bloodline must be flowing within the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider’s body. It was just that he didn’t know what kind of demonic beasts it was a descendant of.</p>
 <p>Five Qi Origin: The innate battle technique of the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider. Permanently increase its raw strength by 30 times. Zero consumption.</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui finally understood why the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider was this strong, it was because the Five Qi Origin had doubled in effect.</p>
 <p>Corrosive Poison Web: The Seven-Headed Demonic Spider unleashed an attack with an inescapable net. The attack contained powerful corrosive poison and was very sticky. The tough spider silk couldn’t be cut with blades. The damage brought upon by the poisonous web was three times its raw strength.</p>
 <p>Poison Silk Entanglement: The Seven-Headed Demonic Spider could unleash a poisonous silk and initiate attacks within a distance of around 2,000 meters. It could entangle enemies and was extremely fast. The stickiness and toxicity of the poisonous silk was even stronger. The attack prowess of it was five times its raw strength.</p>
 <p>Spider Swarm Attack: Unique ability owned by a king of demonic beast. It had powerful armies around it which could coordinate with it to unleash attacks. The armies around it could evolve at most up to Six-Headed Demonic Spider.</p>
 <p>A change had also occurred to the Spider Swarm Attack. Now, Qing Shui finally understood that the demonic spiders around the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider couldn’t surpass it in terms of strength. After all, the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider was a king. This was a kind of rule and pressure.</p>
 <p>Flying Spider Silk: Passive battle technique, zero consumption. Permanently increase speed by ten times.</p>
 <p>The Flying Spider Silk has also gone up from the original eight times to the current ten times. Furthermore, it was a passive battle technique. Qing Shui was already really satisfied with this.</p>
 <p>Sharpness: All of the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider’s eight legs were incomparably sharp. They also had extremely powerful toxicity and penetrating effect.</p>
 <p>Unyielding Shield: The defensive strength of the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider was extremely strong.</p>
 <p>Demonic Spider Golden Armor: Increase the toughness and sharpness of the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider’s body by four times. It also increase the spider silk toughness, toxicity and stickiness by four times. Moreover, it also increase the body’s perseverance and endurance by one fold. Zero consumption!</p>
 <p>The increase in the capability of the Demonic Spider Golden Armor made Qing Shui felt unusually happy. The reason was it could boost the Seven-headed Demonic Spider’s controlling capability and ability to deal damage.</p>
 <p>Under the effect of Five Qi Origin, the strength of the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider was able to achieve 93 sun. The attack used to rot poisonous web was worth 279 sun while the offensive prowess of Poison Silk Entanglement could reach around 465 sun.</p>
 <p>This ability was quite decent, but it could only be considered as decent. If one was to engage in true battles, this was still fairly weak. However, the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider also had the Demonic Spider Golden Armor. This could help make the body of the spider four times as steady and sharp, and could increase the Demonic Spider Spider Web’s toughness, toxicity and stickiness by four times. Furthermore, it would also increase its endurance and perseverance by one time with zero consumption.</p>
 <p>Hence, the controlling strength of the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider could achieve a net worth of more than 1,000 or 2,000 sun. The current Seven-Headed Demonic Spider was still undergoing an increase in its strength. He believed that in the future, the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider should be able to rival against the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and Fire Bird.</p>
 <p>In comparison, the Thunderous Beast was a lot more inferior to it. Despite so, it still had a quite decent speed as the Spiritual Qi within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was abundant after all. The time within was also really sufficient.</p>
 <p>Following on, Qing Shui refined his magic weapons. He would refine them once everyday. If there was no accidents, he would definitely not delay it. Other than this, Qing Shui would also look for some stuff which could help increase the grade of his magic weapons. As long as these objects could ascend in grade, he felt that he would be able to charge around the entire Western Oxhe Continent violently along with his demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>On the second day, after he woke up, Qing Shui carried on to do his morning practice like usual. Even though today was the last day of the year, his cultivation was still the most important to himself. Of course, he would do his morning practice as Qing Shui planned to bring them to stroll around the dynasty today as a way for them to have fun. Today would definitely be a really noisy day.</p>
 <p>“Since we’ve got nothing to do today, how about we go shop around the city after we finish our meal?” Qing Shui suggested in the middle of their meal.</p>
 <p>“Alright!”</p>
 <p>“I’m nearly going to die of boredom here.”</p>
 <p>Both Qing Sha and the Seventh Princess quickly trailed each other’s footsteps.</p>
 <p>For them, going out was now a fairly easy task. The group surrounded themselves with each other. Qing Shui used one of his hand to grab Di Chen’s hand whereas the other to grab the Eldest Princess’ hand. The two girls followed on to grab the hands of the other three girls and together, they formed a circle. Only after that did Qing Shui used the Nine Continents Steps Effect.</p>
 <p>Divine Dragon King Dynasty!</p>
 <p>After continuously using the Nine Continents Steps Effect for around ten times, Qing Shui stopped using it. He needed to reserve the remaining times to go home. After he inquired from other the people did he only found out that this place was the Divine Might Dynasty.</p>
 <p>The Divine Dragon King Dynasty was a peak third grade dynasty. Of course, it had been passed down since a long time ago. As for their true strength, only the Divine Dragon King Dynasty themselves would know about it.</p>
 <p>The old man from the Heaven Secrets Academy had advised him before to not look down on any dynasties, even including the first grade dynasties. As far as dynasties were concerned, they would all have their continued tradition. It wasn’t really surprising if a monstrous existence would appear after these many years. The most important part about it was to see what extent of monstrousness the monster could get. According to legends, there had been a lot of cases of a First Grade State Master suddenly skyrocketing in strength and ended up as a Fourth Grade, or maybe even a Fifth Grade in strength. Of course, these were all only recorded in history. When a man got to the top, all of his friends and relatives would go there with him. A lot of them didn’t just end up like this without a baseless claim. Hence, it had always been said that anything could happen.</p>
 <p>The Divine Dragon King Dynasty was located up north from the center of the continent. It was considered as a particularly advanced dynasty. Even if it was to be compared to Fourth Grade forces, almost no difference could be spotted. The group strolled around the wide and advance street as they looked around.</p>
 <p>The street was filled with a kind of festive atmosphere. Compared to before, the colorful costumes seen on the street looked a lot more festive.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and the group were somewhat really eye-catching across the street. After all, the girls around him were all extreme beauties that might not even appear once in a hundred years. Qing Shui’s appearance was also quite attractive. Hence, along their way, they caused a lot of people to admire them. The men would admire Qing Shui whereas the women would envy the girls around him. They envied them for looking more beautiful than themselves.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, look! There is someone selling puppets there!” Yan Jinyu spoke out suddenly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. As he thought about puppets, he got reminded of the Joyous Sage which he met last time. Yu Ruyan, Tantai Xuan and himself had once met the Joyous Sage. Furthermore, their strength got boosted to the extreme upon meeting him once. The old man also seemed to have a lot of puppets.</p>
 <p>Hence, Qing Shui was a bit sensitive to the word puppets.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw that the person who arranged the puppets was also an old man. However, he wasn’t the Joyous Sage. Seeing that Yan Jinyu felt really enthusiastic, he smiled and responded: “It seems like Sister Yan likes puppets. Why don’t we go and take a look?”</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu smiled and nodded. Despite the fact that her beauty was below Di Chen and the Eldest Princess, she still had her own unique charm.</p>
 <p>The group came out precisely to relax themselves. Hence, since someone found something they were interested in, they would naturally go and have a look at it. Qing Shui also enjoyed watching them. In his mind, he constantly hoped to run into some nice treasures. He thought to himself that as long as he managed to encounter a treasure, he would be able to figure out a way to buy it.</p>
 <p>The group walked towards the stall of the old man that sold the puppets. There were more than a thousand of puppets in front of the old man. Qing Shui only spotted it at the moment when Yan Jinyu shout out previously. There were a lot of people around the stall. Only when he was up close did he realize that there were a lot of puppets and they had a variety of sizes and colours. Some of them had three different colours and some had four.</p>
 <p>The old man looked really old and was really kind. At first glance, Qing Shui found that he somewhat shared a bit of resemblance with Santa Claus. The majority of the people near the stall were children, but there were also some young men and women.</p>
 <p>The puppets looked really exquisite. The traces of it being handmade could be seen at one glance. Upon learning things from the old man, Qing Shui found out that the puppets were made by the old man himself.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui asked for more than a hundred of them at one go and gave two puppets to each of them. He treated it as helping the old man with his business, and the quality of the puppets were quite fine as well.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, do you like these puppets? You asked for so many of them.” Di Chen asked with a smile.</p>
 <p>“They’re not bad. I plan to keep them so that our babies can play with them in the future.” Qing Shui looked at her with a smile.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn’t too loud when he said that, but Di Chen was able to hear it very clearly. Her face turned red. She gave him a glare and remained silent. Despite so, she felt something which couldn’t be expressed in words deep in her heart. It was quite new, especially when she heard the word ‘babies’ being mentioned.</p>
 <p>“Little brother, please wait!”</p>
 <p>At the moment when Qing Shui was about to leave, the old man called out to him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stopped and looked at the old man: “Old man, is everything alright?”</p>
 <p>“Seeing that like the puppets so much, I have a few puppets with me left by my ancestors. Since they are of no use to me, I think I’ll give them to you.” The old man handed Qing Shui a bag.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could tell that the old man was really serious as he accepted the bag. The bag didn’t seem really big and appears that there wouldn’t be a lot of puppets inside. But compared to ordinary puppets, the puppets in the bag was a lot heavier.</p>
 <p>At the moment when Qing Shui looked into the bag, he was stunned. The puppets inside didn’t really have bright and beautiful colors. In fact, they looked really ancient. However, prior to this, Qing Shui had subconsciously used his Heavenly Vision Technique.</p>
 <p>Puppet Marionette!</p>
 <p>People who equip the said puppet could withstand attacks up to a certain extent. Following different grades, the amount that could be withstood would differ. The wearer needed to insert Spiritual Qi into it. It could be refined. It was also required for it to recognize an owner.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw more than ten of them inside the bag and was extremely surprised. There really was such good stuff in the world.</p>
 <p>“Old man, this is too precious. It’s something which I cannot take.” Qing Shui wasn’t acting. He didn’t like to accept too much benefits from strangers. Even though he had yet to know what Puppet Marionette was, he was certain that it was something really valuable.</p>
 <p>“Since you can tell that this thing is precious, you are all the more suitable to have it. This is fate. I think I’ll give this to you as well.” The old man took out an old book and passed it over to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Puppet Marionette Encyclopedia!</p>
 <p>This was a very evil name for a book!</p>
