 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Qing Shui felt that this matter wouldn't implicate too many parties, there were always exceptions. No matter who were to encounter such exceptions, they would feel down as a result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That's still fine. As long as they aren't too powerful, it'll be fine. The Sea King Palace needs to get stronger and it's even more so for the two of you. This place is very near to the Sunset Palace and it isn't safe either." Qing Shui said helplessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There's no need for you to be too worried. Maybe the Sea Dragon Palace wouldn't be willing to get involved in such a trifle matter." Muyun Qingge said calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This lady whose beauty was in no way inferior to Yiye Jiange had a very unique identity. She was from the Drakaina tribe. This tribe was few in numbers and all of them had very noble statuses. They were the royal family in the oceans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This royal family was different from the royal families in the dynasties. It was a nobility that came with their bloodline. It was like one's disposition and wasn't something that could be changed as easily as clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought of her bloodline and it was only now that he realized that he could stimulate her bloodline. Both Muyun Qingge and Yiye Jiange were now at the early stage of the Peak God Grade and if he were to help Muyun Qingge now, he might be able to help her attain a breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about these ideas, Qing Shui felt like trying them out. After all, if Muyun Qingge were to get stronger, Yiye Jiange wouldn't lose out either. The two of them were as close as sisters and it was a good thing for them no matter which of them became stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Miss, I have a way to raise your cultivation level. Are you willing to try it out?" Qing Shui said directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge looked at Qing Shui in astonishment, "Can it be done?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Yes. This is the power of the blood in your body. I don't know if it'll work on Jiange but it'll definitely work on you. Now is the time when we need more power. Would you like to give it a go?" Qing Shui asked, reservedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright." Muyun Qingge nodded. There had already been times when Qing Shui had to give her treatments so she was no longer afraid that Qing Shui would do anything to her. Moreover, after such a long period of time, she had also realized that this man wasn't bad. After all, how bad could a man be when he could be Yiye Jiange's husband?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui helped Muyun Qingge stimulate her potential, he didn't try to hide it from anyone. He got Yiye Jiange to be on guard at the side. This time around, Muyun Qingge wore a thin layer of clothes which were loosely-fitted. However, her beautiful figure still exuded a lethal attraction. The bumps on her chest lifted up her thin layer of clothes and that perfect shape made Qing Shui's throat dry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had already seen her without clothes but it had been a long time ago. Right now, he had a slight urge to remove her clothes for her, to sense that charming taste for himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui tried hard to control his emotions. He saw Muyun Qingge's slightly teasing gaze and a hint of blush on her face. Yiye Jiange didn't stay in the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange knew that the reason Qing Shui asked her to stay is to make it clear that there was nothing between him and Muyun Qingge. Of course she wouldn't stay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge was now acting very strange. This man's wife was outside and she was also her sister. But right now, Muyun Qingge felt as if she was doing something being her back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The method of stimulating potential was still through acupuncture. Moreover, now that Qing Shui had the Benevolent Golden Buddha, the effect had been doubled. This was a huge breakthrough and there were tremendous benefits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were some special areas that required acupuncture as well. For example, on her chest. The gold needles were all nine inches in length and when Qing Shui pushed in the needle, his hand trembled and touched that peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Muyun Qingge was required to wear very light clothes, she wasn't wearing anything inside and the exterior layer was very thin as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's hand felt that protruding point at the peak. It was a very clear feeling. Muyun Qingge shivered and her face immediately turned flush red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Muyun Qingge didn't say anything. She had let out a soft groan earlier that was beyond her control. She had secretly blamed Qing Shui, not knowing if this man had done this intentionally. After all, when Qing Shui was applying acupuncture on her chest, she didn't look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was now feeling very awkward and unsettled. It was as if he had intentionally taken advantage of her. He mustn't try to explain himself. The more he tried to explain himself, the worse the situation would become.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luckily, everything else thereafter progressed very smoothly. Still, the beautiful body that was right in front of his eyes made Qing Shui flustered. Yiye Jiange was fortunately around so he won't have to hold it in for these few days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A drop of mysterious blood essence formed in Muyun Qingge's body. This was the Drakaina's Dragon God’s Blood. Qing Shui kept using his Heavenly Vision Technique and when he saw that drop of Dragon God Blood Essence, he heaved a sigh of relief. As long as this succeeded, the first attempt would be successful. Furthermore, Qing Shui was sure that Muyun Qingge would become a Divinity in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she wouldn't be too powerful. This drop of blood essence in Muyun Qingge's body was like a weak spark. Still, it soon showed signs of being able to cause a great fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the Gold Needle Constitution Nurturing technique, the blood in her body started to seethe. Qing Shui had helped her to strengthen her foundations and nurtured her constitution twice. That, in addition to her unique physique, was the reason why Qing Shui would dare to help her stimulate the powers of her bloodline. Very soon, she would face her greatest False God Tribulation and if she could get through that, she would become a Divinity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before the False God Tribulation arrived, Qing Shui carried Muyun Qingge and appeared outside the Divine Cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The False God Tribulation was both very amazing and powerful. A thunderbolt landed despite there being a thick layer of seawater. it seemed to totally disregard the powerful obstruction of the water. This was the first time Qing Shui had seen such a powerful thunder tribulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had only experienced the False God Tribulation once; he had always been full of anticipation to encounter it. It was because, with each occurrence, he would become a lot more powerful. It was a pity that even if he had attained a breakthrough to the Divine Grade and attained a breakthrough to the Ninth Heavenly Layer, he still wouldn’t have encountered any False God Tribulations. This made Qing Shui felt very depressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge had no problems at all, fending off the thunderbolts. Even when a powerful thunderbolt came down at the very end, she managed to pull through. When everything calmed down, Qing Shui was very happy when he sensed the aura coming from Muyun Qingge. She was at about 300 Dao force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn't considered bad but Muyun Qingge still couldn't sense Qing Shui's abilities. This young man's strength was truly unfathomable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite that, Muyun Qingge still felt very happy. She was now a Divinity as well. This was a very great improvement as there were no Divinities in the Ice Ocean Domain. They only existed in the North Ocean Domain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter the whereabouts, the Divine Grade was a symbol of power. Muyun Qingge sensed the Divinity Spirit in her Dantian. She could see that the Divinity Spirit in her Dantian was a mini version of herself. It looked quite nice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was very happy as well. Yiye Jiange stayed next to Qing Shui and when she saw that Muyun Qingge had gone over it successfully, she was very happy as well. She went up and took Muyun Qingge's hand. The two ladies chatted happily as they headed toward where Qing Shui was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Thank you!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge's life had been saved by Qing Shui and this breakthrough was something he had realized for her. Moreover, the Divinity Spirit was the ability of Ancient Divine Drakainas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ancient Divine Drakaina Chant: Increases the individual's overall defense by six folds. Also increases all abilities by one fold. Will not be affected by seduction and immunity to negative influences to poison and mind. Battle prowess increased by 50% while in water. When outside of water, the individual's battle prowess will not decrease. Has a suppressing effect on life forms in the water and the effectiveness is not defined. The level can be increased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the breakthrough, Muyun Qingge was now a lot stronger than before. Under the effect of the Divine Heavenly Technique, her abilities were even stronger. Her attacking prowess had now reached 600 Dao force and when in water, it would be at 900 Dao force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was terrifying enough. Sensing the great power she had, Muyun Qingge felt an indescribable sense of achievement. There was nothing in this world that was greater than power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There's no need to stand on ceremony. We are friends. This is something that I can do and I didn't have to put in much effort." Qing Shui shook his head and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, the two of you should stop being so polite with each other. Come. This is a day worth celebrating. Let's go get some food and celebrate for Sister Qingge."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them returned to the Divine Cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This place was already home to the two ladies. They had spent a very long time here. As long as the Sea King Palace was fine, they would stay here. This was also a transport point for the Qing Clan so this place was also a great place for Qing Shui. He had a room to himself here and the two ladies had their own rooms as well. With Yiye Jiange here, this was a home for him. A small home.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere was very good. This time around, the two ladies spoke more and Qing Shui less. Most of the topics were about the things in some ocean domains. It was only now that Qing Shui realized that Muyun Qingge knew a lot about the ocean and she seemed to know many things in the North Ocean Domain very well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge and Qing Shui had a few cups of wine. Qing Shui and the two ladies had whipped up the food together and the wine they drank was the best Plum Blossom Wine with the longest age. The two ladies even drank a small vat of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stayed behind. The ladies seemed to have many things to talk about and went to one of the rooms. Qing Shui felt anxious from all the wait yet didn't know what to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thankfully, when it got a little later and had turned dark, Yiye Jiange returned to her room. The moment she reached her room, she was wrapped into an embrace. The familiar aura revealed who it was. Other than Qing Shui, there wasn't anyone else around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui accurately landed a kiss on her soft lips, greedily sucking on them. His hands masterfully removed her clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, Sister Qingge is next door." Yiye Jiange quickly said in a soft voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"So what about it? She can't stop a couple from doing their stuff, right? This is something that concerns the future generation." Qing Shui smiled and said, going down for another kiss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time around, Yiye Jiange didn't resist anymore and returned the kiss. However, she made sure not to make any sounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, when cultivators reach a certain level, they would be able to find out what was happening next door without even making the effort to listen. However, Qing Shui didn't care about that anymore. He had been burning up from the episode with Muyun Qingge earlier in the day, and now, he was entangled with Yiye Jiange without any restrains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange tried very hard to not let out any sounds but would still occasionally cry out. Qing Shui felt that he was especially excited today. It wasn't just him though. He could feel that it was the same for Yiye Jiange. It was because Yiye Jiange had reached orgasm very quickly, taking only half the time that she usually did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was all because Muyun Qingge was next door. They knew that Muyun Qingge would definitely be able to hear the sounds and motions in this room and anyone would be able to know what they were up to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge had attained a breakthrough in her cultivation and her spiritual sense was extremely clear. Moreover, her amazing spiritual sense could allow her to see everything within 100 meters. They would be clearly reflected in her mind and it was as if everything that was happening next door was right before her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scene of Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange making out was clearly presented before her. She tried closing her eyes and keeping it close all the time, but it was useless.</span></p>
