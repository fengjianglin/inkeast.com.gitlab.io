  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 456 - Absolute beauty Liu-li, Visitor from the Jin Clan, Golden Jade Eagle</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-li became angry!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Having finish her dinner, Canghai Mingyue laughed as she told Qing Shui, “Qing Shui, Liu-li is angry. Hurry and coax her.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Oh, who provoked our Lui-li. Tell me and I will cut him into eight pieces. He actually thinks he can live after provoking our beautiful, intelligent, heroic, righteous, elegant, noble, refined, and gentle miss Liu-li.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Teehee. Why it is you, you big baddie! Hrm, I don’t care. You’ve got to compensate me.” Huiyun Liu-li said like the rascal she was after being clearly amused by Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that Huoyun Liu-li was not actually angry, therefore he was very happy upon seeing her laugh. He looked at Huoyun Liu-li, laughed, and said: “Ok, I definitely will compensate you. In fact it is a must.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took out the Violet Earrings he just obtained not long ago!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Once the Violet Earring was taken out, Huoyun Liu-li immediately lit up with resplendent radiance. Qing Shui knew that Huoyun Liu-li would definitely like this pair of Violet Earrings</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Wow! It’s so beautiful!” Huoyun Lui-li sighed as she stretch her hand out to take it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After fiddling around with the earrings, Huoyun Liu-li happily hugged Qing Shui for awhile. After seeing Qing Shui in a daze, she pushed him away.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui is the best!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui laughed. Then, he accidently noticed that Canghai Mingyue and Mingyue Gelou were smiling at him and Huoyun Liu-li. However, Qing Shui felt that in their eyes was a subtle hint of gloom and jealousy</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Gloomy and jealous?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Could it be because he gave Huoyun Liu-li the Violet Earrings but didn’t give them anything?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As his strength grew, Qing Shui realised that his “Minute Subtlety” grew stronger as well. He could even feel these emotions.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Shui could not be sure, as it was just a feeling!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui took out the remaining two Violet Earrings and gave them to Canghai Mingyue and Mingyue Gelou. The two girls also received them happily.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was just too beautiful. The two girl did not even think about rejecting it!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Oh, how strange, I can feel that my strength have increased a bit.” Huoyun Liu-li, having already wore the Violet Earrings, exclaimed in surprise</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“En, yes, however the amount is little.” Canghai Mingyue and Mingyue Gelou also wore theirs.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yuchang is about to wake up, i’m going up to take a look!” Mingyue Gelou said merrily, then headed toward the stairs to go up.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Is there anymore things for me?” asked Huoyun Liu-li as she looking at Qing Shui with hope.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could only take out the pair of Violet cloud swords and give them to the two girls!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Wow, Qing Shui, you are awesome, it’s violet as well.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not understand why it was all Violet either. The Huoyun Liu-li of today was dressed in violet and had a violet cloud sword. She wore violet earrings, violet boots, and a violet belt…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the beauty that was akin to a piece of violet porcelain, the violet air that surrounded the charming forehead of this women so sexy it caused people to stop breathing. The charm that exuded from her became even more grandeur. Between every frown and smile flowed a certain grace.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Huoyun Liu-li saw that Qing Shui was staring at her, she blinked her long and sexy eyes and walked over with a sway. Giving off a nice fragrance, she asked: “Does it look good?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Very good!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Where does it look good!” Huoyun Liu-li narrowed her eyes. Her pupils could move any man’s hearts.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Everywhere looks good!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Then where is the best looking part!” Huoyun Liu-li blinked and said with an enticing voice.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The butt!” Qing Shui shifted his gaze downwards…&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Go to hell!” Huoyun Liu-li lighted pounded on his chest for awhile before succumbing to laughter.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Huoyun Liu-li was pounding on Qing Shui’s chest, he hugged her and said in a low voice: “You demoness. If you try to seduce me again, I will rape you.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">[TL notes: 妖精: Demoness, chinese expression for alluring women.]</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Come on, I’m not afraid of you!” Huoyun Liu-li whispered into his ear seductively, then stuck out her soft pink tongue and licked Qing Shui’s ear lobe.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was shocked, after which he helplessly pushed her away. This demoness knew that with Canghai Mingyue at the side, he could not do anything to her. Every time she was in such a situation, she would take the chance to sexually provoke him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Shui was unwilling, he could only push her aside. She had caused his body to have a reaction. If he kept hugging her, it would not be a pleasure but a torture.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Kekeke. Qing Shui, your face has gone red. Being able to cause you embarrassment makes me very happy!” Huoyun Liu-li said happily as she looked at the slightly red-faced Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After awhile, Mingyue Gelou lead little Yuchang down. When Yuchang saw Qing Shui, she happily jumped over.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Daddy!”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was alarmed. This young lass was too daring, simply jumping off the flight of steps. Qing Shui quick caught her. Every time he hugged this young girl, he felt some special emotions.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It might be because her life had been saved by Qing Shui, or it could be because he channeled in some of his Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique into her back then. Although she was not reborn as a completely new person, it made Qing Shui feel that there was a faint connection between them. It was a very warm feeling and he would like to do everything in his power to give her happiness.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui played with the young girl for a few moments. Then, Mingyue Gelou brought out the dishes she made for the young girl. However, children were not able to sit still and eat, therefore a few of them had to surround her, coaxing her to finish her food.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment Cang Wuya and another old man came in.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, Elder Jin is here to look for you!” Cang Wuya said as he laughed gently.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mr. Qing Shui, this old fogey Jin Shang is here to thank you for saving Zheng`er, if I did not see Elder Cang I would not have known where to find you.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing shui looked at this scholarly old known as Jin Shang and felt that he was the same type as Chang Wuya. However, regardless of trivial comparisons, Jin Shang had a stronger air of nobility.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Elder Jin, just call me Qing Shui. Me saving him was just a matter of convenience. You don’t have to mind it too much.” Qing Shui smiled as he handed little Yuchang over to Mingyue Lelou.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The Jin clan has already prepared a banquet, and everyone is coming over. Let this old fogey express my gratitude to you.” Jin Shang said, smiling at Qing Shui. However, his gaze and tone of voice was able to envelop everyone in the room, causing them to feel his sincerity.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Elder Jin, this is too much of an hassle. Furthermore, it was inconvenient for you to travel all the way here.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It was no trouble at all. This is necessary because you have saved Zheng’er. Even if you wanted anything from the Jin Clan, I would give it to you.” Jin Shang said seriously.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui heard Jin Shang’s words he was shocked. Coming from a clan like the Jin clan, there were not many who were able to say what he had. This required a great resolution and, at the same time, it showed how highly they thought of him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although Jin Shang repeatedly invited Cang Wuya and the three girls, they all rejected it. Finally, Qing Shui and Jin Shang left.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Outside, in the skies was a huge Golden Eagle. When it spread its wings it was close to a hundred square metres in area. Its wings when stretched was over 10 metres. Under the sunlight, it was glittering gold and its might looked uncomparable. (Qing Shui’s firebird and Canghai MingYue’s Golden Winged Thunder Condor was also about 10 metres in length and width. The previously mentioned 100 metres was actually the area in square metres.)</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui recognised this flying beast. The Golden Jade Eagle was a famous type of flying beast with Elementary Martial King strength. Any snake type demonic beast would avoid it, even if they were Peak Martial Kings. Even though the Golden Jade eagle would lose if they fought.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The whole body of the Golden Jade was like steel. Its claws and beak were the most lethal weapons, and its speed was strangely fast. The only weakness was it lack of endurance.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It has just been a day, yet I can no longer see through you.” Jin Shang laughed as he looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that Jin Shang was still able to see through his powers yesterday. Now, however, he was unable to.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Elder Jin, you really should just call me Qing Shui!” Qing Shui urged him once again. Qing Shui had a good impression of this old man, and furthermore, he was the hall master of the Golden Throne Palace.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Then this old fogey will dispense with the formalities.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that with his current level of power, it was normal for him to be addressed as mister. What’s more, he had saved the life of Jin Changzheng. Seeing that Jin Shang personally came to invite him, Qing Shui could feel his sincerity and therefore felt that this Jin Clan was worth making friends with.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not give any explanations and Jin Shang did not ask any further questions. The Heavenly Palace's nine halls were not far apart from each other if one were to ride on a flying beast.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Soon, a huge hall appeared in front of Qing Shui’s eyes</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Golden Throne Palace!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was a familiar name to Qing Shui as he heard about it frequently in the past. It was just that he had never seen it with his own eyes before. Today, however, he could have a close up view of this Golden Throne Palace of the Heavenly Palace.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The glittering great hall was only smaller than the Lingxiao Treasure Hall by a little. It was a dazzling sight, and seeing it from the outside would already cause one to be moved. It gave the impression of a prosperous palace.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Golden Jade Eagle kept flying past the hall until it arrived at a courtyard. Only then did it land.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, we have arrived, let us dismount!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui agreed and followed Jin Shang in dismounting the Golden Jade Eagle.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The front of the courtyard did not seem as luxurious as the outside. In fact, it seem a little simple. Everything here seemed dull. The rock gardens, bridges, forests…they seemed to be primitive, without too much decorations.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As Qing Shui followed Jin Shang as they passed through these scenic gardens, he lamented in his heart that such a wealthy clan had so much. Even his Qin clan still had stuff like ponds or rock gardens. In comparison to to his past life, all these were considered luxurious. However, all these were the results of the World of the Nine Continents being so big and having so much people. Everything was very convenient here.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The number of people in the courtyard was not many, only a few protectors as well as the servants and the odd job labourers. However, Qing Shui could sense that they were all Elementary Xiantian stage. This was not surprising, as even the weakest person in the heavenly palace was a Xiantian.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Going past the last rock garden, there was an eye catching pavilion. This was the largest pavilion in the courtyard. Although it was only 3 stories high, it was larger than the four surrounding stories pavilion, especially the first floor. Qing Shui felt that it was like a palace hall.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not understand why it was all Violet either. The Huoyun Liu-li of today was dressed in violet and had a violet cloud sword. She wore violet earrings, violet boots, and a violet belt…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the beauty that was akin to a piece of violet porcelain, the violet air that surrounded the charming forehead of this women so sexy it caused people to stop breathing. The charm that exuded from her became even more grandeur. Between every frown and smile flowed a certain grace.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Huoyun Liu-li saw that Qing Shui was staring at her, she blinked her long and sexy eyes and walked over with a sway. Giving off a nice fragrance, she asked: “Does it look good?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Very good!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Where does it look good!” Huoyun Liu-li narrowed her eyes. Her pupils could move any man’s hearts.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Everywhere looks good!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Then where is the best looking part!” Huoyun Liu-li blinked and said with an enticing voice.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The butt!” Qing Shui shifted his gaze downwards…&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Go to hell!” Huoyun Liu-li lighted pounded on his chest for awhile before succumbing to laughter.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Huoyun Liu-li was pounding on Qing Shui’s chest, he hugged her and said in a low voice: “You demoness. If you try to seduce me again, I will rape you.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">[TL notes: 妖精: Demoness, chinese expression for alluring women.]</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Come on, I’m not afraid of you!” Huoyun Liu-li whispered into his ear seductively, then stuck out her soft pink tongue and licked Qing Shui’s ear lobe.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was shocked, after which he helplessly pushed her away. This demoness knew that with Canghai Mingyue at the side, he could not do anything to her. Every time she was in such a situation, she would take the chance to sexually provoke him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Shui was unwilling, he could only push her aside. She had caused his body to have a reaction. If he kept hugging her, it would not be a pleasure but a torture.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Kekeke. Qing Shui, your face has gone red. Being able to cause you embarrassment makes me very happy!” Huoyun Liu-li said happily as she looked at the slightly red-faced Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After awhile, Mingyue Gelou lead little Yuchang down. When Yuchang saw Qing Shui, she happily jumped over.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Daddy!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was alarmed. This young lass was too daring, simply jumping off the flight of steps. Qing Shui quick caught her. Every time he hugged this young girl, he felt some special emotions.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It might be because her life had been saved by Qing Shui, or it could be because he channeled in some of his Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique into her back then. Although she was not reborn as a completely new person, it made Qing Shui feel that there was a faint connection between them. It was a very warm feeling and he would like to do everything in his power to give her happiness.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui played with the young girl for a few moments. Then, Mingyue Gelou brought out the dishes she made for the young girl. However, children were not able to sit still and eat, therefore a few of them had to surround her, coaxing her to finish her food.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment Cang Wuya and another old man came in.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, Elder Jin is here to look for you!” Cang Wuya said as he laughed gently.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mr. Qing Shui, this old fogey Jin Shang is here to thank you for saving Zheng`er, if I did not see Elder Cang I would not have known where to find you.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing shui looked at this scholarly old known as Jin Shang and felt that he was the same type as Chang Wuya. However, regardless of trivial comparisons, Jin Shang had a stronger air of nobility.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Elder Jin, just call me Qing Shui. Me saving him was just a matter of convenience. You don’t have to mind it too much.” Qing Shui smiled as he handed little Yuchang over to Mingyue Lelou.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The Jin clan has already prepared a banquet, and everyone is coming over. Let this old fogey express my gratitude to you.” Jin Shang said, smiling at Qing Shui. However, his gaze and tone of voice was able to envelop everyone in the room, causing them to feel his sincerity.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Elder Jin, this is too much of an hassle. Furthermore, it was inconvenient for you to travel all the way here.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It was no trouble at all. This is necessary because you have saved Zheng’er. Even if you wanted anything from the Jin Clan, I would give it to you.” Jin Shang said seriously.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui heard Jin Shang’s words he was shocked. Coming from a clan like the Jin clan, there were not many who were able to say what he had. This required a great resolution and, at the same time, it showed how highly they thought of him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although Jin Shang repeatedly invited Cang Wuya and the three girls, they all rejected it. Finally, Qing Shui and Jin Shang left.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Outside, in the skies was a huge Golden Eagle. When it spread its wings it was close to a hundred square metres in area. Its wings when stretched was over 10 metres. Under the sunlight, it was glittering gold and its might looked uncomparable. (Qing Shui’s firebird and Canghai MingYue’s Golden Winged Thunder Condor was also about 10 metres in length and width. The previously mentioned 100 metres was actually the area in square metres.)</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui recognised this flying beast. The Golden Jade Eagle was a famous type of flying beast with Elementary Martial King strength. Any snake type demonic beast would avoid it, even if they were Peak Martial Kings. Even though the Golden Jade eagle would lose if they fought.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The whole body of the Golden Jade was like steel. Its claws and beak were the most lethal weapons, and its speed was strangely fast. The only weakness was it lack of endurance.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It has just been a day, yet I can no longer see through you.” Jin Shang laughed as he looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that Jin Shang was still able to see through his powers yesterday. Now, however, he was unable to.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Elder Jin, you really should just call me Qing Shui!” Qing Shui urged him once again. Qing Shui had a good impression of this old man, and furthermore, he was the hall master of the Golden Throne Palace.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Then this old fogey will dispense with the formalities.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that with his current level of power, it was normal for him to be addressed as mister. What’s more, he had saved the life of Jin Changzheng. Seeing that Jin Shang personally came to invite him, Qing Shui could feel his sincerity and therefore felt that this Jin Clan was worth making friends with.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not give any explanations and Jin Shang did not ask any further questions. The Heavenly Palace's nine halls were not far apart from each other if one were to ride on a flying beast.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Soon, a huge hall appeared in front of Qing Shui’s eyes</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Golden Throne Palace!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was a familiar name to Qing Shui as he heard about it frequently in the past. It was just that he had never seen it with his own eyes before. Today, however, he could have a close up view of this Golden Throne Palace of the Heavenly Palace.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The glittering great hall was only smaller than the Lingxiao Treasure Hall by a little. It was a dazzling sight, and seeing it from the outside would already cause one to be moved. It gave the impression of a prosperous palace.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Golden Jade Eagle kept flying past the hall until it arrived at a courtyard. Only then did it land.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, we have arrived, let us dismount!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui agreed and followed Jin Shang in dismounting the Golden Jade Eagle.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The front of the courtyard did not seem as luxurious as the outside. In fact, it seem a little simple. Everything here seemed dull. The rock gardens, bridges, forests…they seemed to be primitive, without too much decorations.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As Qing Shui followed Jin Shang as they passed through these scenic gardens, he lamented in his heart that such a wealthy clan had so much. Even his Qin clan still had stuff like ponds or rock gardens. In comparison to to his past life, all these were considered luxurious. However, all these were the results of the World of the Nine Continents being so big and having so much people. Everything was very convenient here.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The number of people in the courtyard was not many, only a few protectors as well as the servants and the odd job labourers. However, Qing Shui could sense that they were all Elementary Xiantian stage. This was not surprising, as even the weakest person in the heavenly palace was a Xiantian.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Going past the last rock garden, there was an eye catching pavilion. This was the largest pavilion in the courtyard. Although it was only 3 stories high, it was larger than the four surrounding stories pavilion, especially the first floor. Qing Shui felt that it was like a palace hall.</p>
