 <p><strong>AST 1406 - Eldest Daughter of the Watermoon Clan</strong></p>
 <p>“Both of you, please come in. What do you need? We have Steamed Swordfish, Trinity Lobster, Braised Sea King Crab……”</p>
 <p>When they entered, an enthusiastic man came up to welcome them.</p>
 <p>“Just serve us your best dishes!” Qing Shui didn’t bother to listen further. Both of them could eat anything, so he decided to let the waiter serve them a few of their best dishes.</p>
 <p>“Alright, please wait for a moment.”</p>
 <p>This area was a big hall and Qing Shui intended to stay here because there would be people who ran their mouths with news inside the inn. Regardless of whether this information were correct or not, this place would have a lot of it at least. Qing Shui was accustomed to listening for news whenever he went to an inn.</p>
 <p>The service was quick. There were about ten dishes being served onto their table within fifteen minutes. The aroma of the food was perfect. Even Qing Shui, who frequently consumed the food in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, could sense the authenticity of the aroma - it was a cuisine of absolute freshness.</p>
 <p>“Have you heard? Someone from the Watermoon Clan is going to take their revenge against Waterwolf Clan.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, a voice rang out. Qing Shui had been paying close attention to everything but when he saw Qing Sha shivering, as if she was about to stand up, he quickly extended his hand and held her down. He could see the movements in her eyes - it was a type of excitement and an unspeakable restlessness.</p>
 <p>“Watermoon Clan? Wasn’t Watermoon Clan destroyed entirely?” Someone else immediately questioned the statement.</p>
 <p>“Rumor has it that there were two people who escaped the tragedy. They are the sisters of the Watermoon Clan. The eldest sister took the younger one and escaped,” the man who previously made the statement said casually.</p>
 <p>“The Watermoon Clan is quite unlucky. Both clans have been friends for generations and they are said to be closer than any brothers will be. Shuiyue Tian’s acquisition of the powerful battle technique has instead helped the Waterwolf Clan to achieve their goal. Those who know about it now will not say anything. After all, it’s because of that battle technique that the Watermoon Clan was able to achieve such great accomplishments. The Sea Dragon Dynasty is huge, so no one will suspect whether the actions of the Waterwolf Clan are right or wrong. If it were other people, they might choose to do the same thing.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was now certain that Qing Sha was definitely Watermoon Clan’s youngest daughter. However, why wasn’t she together with her elder sister? Was she lost?</p>
 <p>However, if he thought about it further, it could be a possibility. Her elder sister wanted revenge but she wasn’t willing to let Qing Sha suffer the same hardship she was facing, so she sent her away, allowing her to become an ordinary person and allowing the last of the bloodline of the Watermoon Clan to survive.</p>
 <p>In the World of the Nine Continents, ability was the only thing that would not base itself on gender. It could be passed down from generation to generation in a family.</p>
 <p>“Then do you know how that person from the Watermoon Clan is doing currently?”</p>
 <p>“I’m not sure. I heard that she’s trapped inside the capital city while being injured too. At this point, it will be difficult for her to escape,” said the first man who spoke earlier.</p>
 <p>“Winner takes all. Watermoon Clan is destined to disappear from history. With the Waterwolf Clan already successful now, the strength of the power of the Western Oxhe Continent to rival against the Waterwolf Clan is quite weak, let alone the Watermoon Clan themselves.”</p>
 <p>…….</p>
 <p>“My girl, let’s go!” Qing Shui pulled up Qing Sha gently.</p>
 <p>“Mm!”</p>
 <p>“Wait for me for a moment!”</p>
 <p>This area was also a city but not where the Waterwolf Clan was located. This clan was located at the true capital city, which was also on an island. To reach that island, Qing Shui would need to ask for directions in order to go there.</p>
 <p>“My friend, can you give me the directions to go to the capital city?” Qing Shui asked with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Who are you, don’t interrupt our conversation,” a young man standing at one side scoffed unhappily.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also became impolite - as there was no time to do so - and slapped that man swiftly, knocking him down. That young man fainted immediately.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned to look at the other man.</p>
 <p>This man stared at Qing Shui, wondering why he would look for someone like him. But he was very certain that this must have something to do with the conversation he had before. He began to feel unsettled.</p>
 <p>His eyes were darted everywhere.</p>
 <p>“Don’t think too much. Just lead the way. It’s because you guys mentioned about the capital city earlier. I don’t have the mood to think of another way. And you better not think of looking for someone to fight me. Whoever you seek is useless. If you interrupt my affairs, I will not hesitate to kill you,” Qing Shui said calmly.</p>
 <p>“Alright, I will lead you immediately. I hope you don’t break your promise,” the man replied quickly.</p>
 <p>And so, Qing Shui and Qing Sha flew to the island where the capital city was with this man.</p>
 <p>The appearance of the Hellfire Phoenix immediately stunned that man. From then on, he didn’t think twice about the situation. Just like Qing Shui said earlier, someone as powerful as him would never plot scheme against someone like him.</p>
 <p>Even though the distance to the capital city was quite far, he had Hellfire Phoenix to hasten the journey. Moreover, Qing Shui directly used the Nine Continents Steps after he had asked thoroughly about the distance!</p>
 <p>Because of that, Qing Shui and the other two managed to arrive at the island of the capital city after just under two hours of traveling.</p>
 <p>The appearance of the Hellfire Phoenix left a lot of people in a state of shock.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui was able to confirm that this was the place he needed to find, he finally freed that man. In addition, he rewarded him quite handsomely. Because there were medicinal pills inside, that man would be able to enjoy the benefit of the reward for the rest of his life.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go find Waterwolf Clan directly!” Qing Shui said with a grin.</p>
 <p>Qing Sha was now a bit excited and Qing Shui could feel her emotions. After all, the hatred from many years ago had been building up pressure on her. Furthermore, she would be able to find justice for the loss of the lives of her parents and sisters today.</p>
 <p>“That person from the Watermoon Clan has been caught. I heard she will be burnt alive at the Heavenly Wolf Platform today.” At that moment, there were noises resonating from the path ahead. Qing Shui has good hearing as he was able to hear those sentences.</p>
 <p>“Really? Then the Waterwolf Clan is trying to tell everyone that this is the result of revolting against the royalty of their clan.”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. The Watermoon Clan shouldn’t have come. The eldest daughter of the Watermoon Clan has suffered for so many years and killed less than 20 members of the Waterwolf Clan. In spite of that, that’s good a show of spirit.”</p>
 <p>“The Waterwolf Clan too, they had good relationship with the Watermoon Clan initially. They shouldn’t go as far as to burn her alive. That’s too cruel.”</p>
 <p>“This is called ‘making an example of someone’. Besides, the eldest daughter of the Watermoon Clan did kill about 20 of the Waterwolf Clan’s best cultivators.”</p>
 <p>………</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t hesitate. He went up directly and inquired about the Heavenly Wolf Platform. This time, he got an easy answer. It was located at the busiest main square in the central area.</p>
 <p>Since they wanted to make an example of the eldest daughter, it would be great if more people could witness the punishment. Because of that, the place they chose for the execution would also be the busiest place in the city.</p>
 <p>The distance to the platform was considered near, so Qing Shui and Qing Sha quickly ran towards their destination. The eldest daughter of the Watermoon Clan had been exacting her revenge for one and a half years already. She specialized in stealth assassinations and her actual strength was considered impressive. In one and a half years, she managed to kill 20 of Waterwolf Clan’s best cultivators.</p>
 <p>She was a thorn in Waterwolf Clan’s side. They weren’t able to capture her after multiple attempts in between the assassinations. This time, they sent out the best assassins in their household and were able to prevail against the eldest daughter of the Watermoon Clan by breaking her meridians, crippling her cultivation in the process. They tied her to the pillar on the Heavenly Wolf Platform and decided to execute her by burning her with fire.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui and Qing Sha managed to arrive at the Heavenly Wolf Platform, there was already a crowd surrounding the area. Qing Shui didn’t call back his Hellfire Phoenix, so everyone was surprised at the appearance of a giant black demonic beast.</p>
 <p>Some people thought that it resembled a phoenix but the existence of a black phoenix was very rare, so they couldn’t be certain of it. However, they were still deeply affected by the menacing aura of this demonic beast.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui focused his gaze at the most conspicuous area on the platform. A woman with her hair disheveled and her body stained in blood was hanging from a stone pillar. Below her was lumber of high quality already arranged for the fire.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui tried to focus on the person on the stone pillar but couldn’t get a clear picture. Suddenly, a pernicious aura beside him was unleashed. At that moment, the artifact that Qing Shui had used to suppress her pernicious aura has lost its effectiveness.</p>
 <p>“All of you will have to die!”</p>
 <p>The pernicious aura soared through the sky. Qing Sha’s silhouette shuffled from Hellfire Phoenix to the sky and flew towards the stone pillar in the public square.</p>
 <p>“Stop! Who are you? We will kill you without mercy if you take another step closer.”</p>
 <p>When the guards defending the square saw someone trying to charge through, they quickly went up to prevent her from doing so.</p>
 <p>“Die!”</p>
 <p>Qing Sha struck out with her palm, shooting a grey aura akin to that of an arrow and penetrated two people who tried to stop her. Both of them died immediately, on the spot.</p>
 <p>When the guards defending the square witnessed their deaths, they quickly swarmed towards Qing Sha like bees.</p>
 <p>However, the disparity of strength between these people and Qing Sha was too great. Qing Sha’s power had soared and broke the limit, multiplying her strength by a number of degrees. Moreover, these people were already considered dead in her eyes.</p>
 <p>She killed them without restraint or mercy. If Qing Sha didn’t kill these people, her hatred would never be relieved.</p>
 <p>Boom boom!</p>
 <p>Qing Sha only used a few breaths of time to kill and evaporate those who had intercepted them, leaving a few drops of blood on the scene.</p>
 <p>“Insolence, who are you? How dare you come and cause a ruckus here?”</p>
 <p>An old man who was the leader of the guards stood forward.</p>
 <p>Qing Sha spoke no words and quickly rushed towards the old man, raising her hand to shoot an arrow of pernicious aura.</p>
 <p>“You are seeking death?! Kill her! At the same time, take out your flame tubes and shoot at the sky.”</p>
 <p>There were a number of guards present but a portion of them had already been killed off by Qing Sha earlier on. There were now half the number, yet these men were not able to stop Qing Sha, not even for a second.</p>
 <p>And just within a few seconds, none of the guards of the Waterwolf Clan were left in the square.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui called back his Firebird and was already standing beside Qing Sha.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Qing Sha rose into the air and released the blood-covered woman from the stone pillar. This woman was tied with chains that punctured through her ribs, collarbone and shoulder blade. That was the reason she was covered in blood.</p>
 <p>Looking at her situation, Qing Shui was incredibly angry. Qing Sha was even more furious than him - her anger had shot through the roof.</p>
 <p>This woman had already fainted for quite some time but when Qing Sha released her from the stone pillar, she woke up, possibly from pain. Her face was covered in blood, as well as her disheveled hair, which was also covered in dust. There were two streaks of horrifying scars across her face, making her seem a bit ferocious.</p>
 <p>Her scars seemed like they were made a long time ago.</p>
 <p>The woman seemed calmed when she saw Qing Sha and said softly, “Illusion. It’s another illusion. Am I dying?”</p>
 <p>Her voice was coarse and crackling.</p>
 <p>“Elder sister, I’m Little An. Elder sister, I’ve come,” Qing Sha couldn’t endure any longer and cried.</p>
 <p>“Little An, this isn’t a dream, isn’t it?”</p>
 <p>The woman looked at Qing Sha in surprise before looking at her surroundings.</p>
 <p>“Little An, why have you come? Run away quickly. I’m fine on my own. If anything happens to you, I will not die peacefully. Didn’t I tell you from the beginning to not come back here ever?” said the woman, agitated.</p>
 <p>“Sis, I came to save you. I will annihilate the entire Waterwolf Clan.” At that moment, Qing Sha’s pernicious aura rose to the heavens. Those around her felt uncomfortable, yet this woman didn’t feel anything. Qing Shui didn’t feel discomfort either.</p>
 <p>Perhaps the pernicious aura could be directed willfully?</p>
 <p>“Little An, you are not their opponent. While they aren’t here yet, leave quickly. Leave as far as you can……”</p>
 <p>“Haha, you can’t leave. Since you have killed the members of the Waterwolf Clan, you are against the Sea Dragon Dynasty. No one will be able to save you. You lot are rebels.” An old yet forceful voice rang out in the air.</p>
 <p>About a hundred people appeared in the sky.</p>
 <p>“Rebels? If the Sea Dragon Dynasty vanishes, then we won’t be considered rebels, will we?” Qing Shui spoke without raising his head. After that, he took out the chains punctured through the woman’s body with proficiency.</p>
 <p>He had the Golden Needle. The woman did not feel any pain as the chains were being taken out of her body.</p>
