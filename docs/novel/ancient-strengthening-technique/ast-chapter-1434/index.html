 <p><strong>AST 1434 - Entering The Divine Shrine, Stone Boar Beast, Treasure Box</strong></p>
 <p>In an instant, Qing Shui and the Battle God Statue swapped positions. After the swap, Qing Shui directly entered into the middle of the formation. At the same time, the Demon Lord also entered the formation. Both of them were stunned once they were inside.</p>
 <p>Ancient Formation!</p>
 <p>This was the Ancient Formation? Qing Shui could see that there was fog everywhere. Additionally, there was a heavy killing intent around and an Eight Trigrams drawing at the bottom of the formation. Moreover, Qing Shui saw that within the formation, there was an elder who was struggling inside.</p>
 <p>He was not certain what this formation was, but he knew that this was at least a type of trap formation. In terms of killing techniques, it had the Battle God Statue outside. After a while, the struggling elder finally found the door to leave the formation.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui observed for a bit and figured it out. If they moved forward more than halfway towards position the formation, the Battle God Statue will give up on attacking. He looked at the Demon Lord and said, “Don’t leave the formation. Move at least one half of the way and wait for me there.”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the Battle God Statue rushed over with the momentum of a stampede!</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Step!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s footwork helped him completely dodged all of the Battle God Statue’s attacks. The Battle God Statue that had been tangled did not look like it was using extra effort. Earlier, Qing Shui wanted the Demon Lord to wait for him so they could enter together without being ambushed.</p>
 <p>When the Demon Lord arrived at the location that was a bit more than halfway through the formation, Qing Shui flashed over and instantly appeared next to the Demon Lord’s side. He appeared very close her, to the point where he could smell her fragrant scent</p>
 <p>The entrance to the formation was already this difficult to deal with, the lower palaces would undoubtedly bring unprecedented danger to them. Since Qing Shui had already encountered the Ancient Divine Shrine, he wanted whatever it was inside.</p>
 <p>Though he had never seen this Ancient Divine Shrine before, he knew that there were good items inside. Any Ancient Divine Shrines with restrictions were bound to have good items inside.</p>
 <p>Once Qing Shui and the Demon Lord left the formation, they felt a strong sense of danger and was followed up by an overwhelming killing intent. It felt like an overflowing energy that was rushing towards them</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not think too much. This power was too strong, so he grabbed onto the Demon Lord’s hand and instantly cast his Nine Palace Steps.</p>
 <p>He did this because his spiritual sense had already locked on to something a while ago.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps, Vanish!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and the Demon Lord disappeared from their location!</p>
 <p>Bang bang bang……</p>
 <p>The place where the two stood before suddenly turned into a complete mess, even refined gold would turn into dust at that level of destruction. The two of them, hand-in-hand teleported several thousand of meters away. Only after they managed to stand firm on the ground did Qing Shui turned around to look at who had attacked him and the Demon Lord. It was a group of three elders, but he did not know which one of them had attacked.</p>
 <p>Regardless of what or whom, it was without a doubt a Sure Kill Heavenly Technique.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, his hand felt a feeling of softness and warmth. It felt so delicate that it could melt his heart and had a miraculous feeling that he could not describe with words. He finally noticed that he was still holding the Demon Lord’s soft hand.</p>
 <p>“Can you let go?” The Demon Lord’s voice was cold but it was natural, without any emotional fluctuations.</p>
 <p>“Yes, of course, I can. I really like you, you should consider me first,” Qing Shui smiled as he said. Last time, he already thought it through. Towards this woman he had to be as thick skinned as the city’s walls or otherwise, he would have no chance. Since there was no worst result, anything would be better than their current stalemate situation.</p>
 <p>The Demon Lord did not think Qing Shui would suddenly be so bold. He suddenly said these words in front of her, and she responded in her usual coldness, “I don’t like you, nor do I like men.”</p>
 <p>“…” Qing Shui almost choked until he was half dead.</p>
 <p>As he heard those words, Qing Shui was ecstatic within his heart. Those words were proof that there were emotional fluctuations within the Demon Lord’s heart. Even if it was little, he had already filtered out the other words she said.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui could see the situation within this Battle God Mountain. Other than the center of the formation was a giant, divine shrine.</p>
 <p>Ancient Divine Shrine!</p>
 <p>This building exceeded even the heights of the clouds, the upper levels were emitting an ancient aura. It was covered with an everlasting, ancient-like aura that made people’s heart tremble.</p>
 <p>There was no Guardian Ancient Beasts in sight. They currently should be inside the divine shrine.</p>
 <p>The three elders across from them were all wearing different clothes. One of them wore the clothing of the Sword Heart Pavilion. No wonder the elder from the Sword Heart Pavilion was so arrogant, one of them had already rushed in here.</p>
 <p>“Just like those outside, all of you are not real men but men without any balls,” Qing Shui said directly towards the people on the other side. Even if they were far away, they could still hear him clearly.</p>
 <p>The Demon Lord did not look at Qing Shui. However, her body was still swaying slightly, as if it was restraining something.</p>
 <p>“Since you guys came out, then we shall fight here until one side dies. This will save us from having a battle later,” the elder in the middle elder with a vigorous appearance said.</p>
 <p>“You think that if we don’t stop you, you could successfully enter the Ancient Divine Shrine?” Qing Shui laughed as he looked at the opposition.</p>
 <p>“Without your interference, of course, we can enter the Ancient Divine Shrine,” one of the elders said with utmost confidence.</p>
 <p>“Have you heard of the Guardian Ancient Beasts?” Qing Shui laughed as he asked.</p>
 <p>“Of course we have. Are you telling me there are Guardian Ancient Beasts here? If there was a formation technique outside, then there will be no Guardian Ancient Beast inside. Do you not know this common knowledge?” One of the elders mocked.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought about what the Ancient Fire Snake had said. There should be no mistake on what it said, the spiritual intelligence of beasts was strong. He laughed, “I won’t stop you guys, but do you dare to enter the Ancient Divine Shrine?”</p>
 <p>“You’re just deliberately trying to complicate things. If that is the case, we will just enter first.” The elder finished speaking and entered the shrine hall.</p>
 <p>The surrounding area was filled with towering ancient trees. They were rare, but most of the trees were only pine trees. They looked especially vigorous and gave off a feeling of standing tall and never conceding until the end.</p>
 <p>The Demon Lord didn’t react as she watched the elders enter. This woman was forever frigid. In a certain sense, people wouldn’t feel that they were being snubbed. She was just like a crane in a flock of chicken. Moreover, she was not just like any other crane but a red-crowned crane. She emitted a sense of self-assured superiority. Rather than feeling that she gave them a cold shoulder, people would feel unworthy of standing next to this heavenly beauty</p>
 <p>Within the Ancient Divine Shrine, nothing could be heard. It was as if a stone had sunk into a deep, silent ocean.</p>
 <p>“We should enter, let’s see what good stuff is inside,” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
 <p>“En, be careful!” The Demon Lord thought for a bit and said. She then slowly moved towards the Ancient Divine Shrine.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was ecstatic in his heart. This time, he felt that those words carried something different.</p>
 <p>The Ancient Divine Shrine was too big, it was larger than any open area mall in his past life. It was also not as simple as several dozen stone houses, the architecture of the building must have taken a long time to build. The materials used were also unique and had a special restriction, it could resist earthquakes and even counteract any force. Unfortunately, these materials could not be used to make an armor, otherwise, it would be invincible.</p>
 <p>Once they entered, they could see a huge space before them.</p>
 <p>Stone Beast!</p>
 <p>There was also an ancient and old looking box. The three elders stood outside, one of them was injured.</p>
 <p>“How is it? Does this count as a Guardian Ancient Beast?” Qing Shui greeted them as he walked.</p>
 <p>“This is the first stage of the shrine, it’s not easy to attack this Stone Beast. Its strength is formidable and nothing can shake it. That treasure box should have a treasure inside, why don’t you guys try to see if you can get it or not?” One of the elders said slowly as he looked at Qing Shui and the Demon Lord.</p>
 <p>“Can you not take it though? If you can’t make it through you should probably retreat.” Qing Shui looked at the elder.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, we’re giving you a chance. If you don’t want to take it or are you waiting for us to defeat the Stone Beast and then steal the treasure box?” The elder looked at Qing Shui, seemingly wanting to annihilate both of them.</p>
 <p>“I don’t have time to play with you guys as I have to go to the next level. You guys enjoy your time with the Stone Beast!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the door behind the Stone Beast when he spoke.</p>
 <p>The Stone Beast in front of them looked like a giant stone boar. It was 300 meters tall, with a giant grey body that would leave anyone speechless. The Stone Beast was given Divine Sense. It was carved out of a special type of rock. Its movements were simple and it only relied on its fierce power, sharp claws, and jaws. These were enough to make it unbearable for some.</p>
 <p>“Dream on. If you don’t beat the Stone Beast, you can’t enter,” The elder said with disdain as he looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Watch how we enter.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui summoned the Dragon Slaying Beast, then he suddenly rushed towards the Stone Beast.</p>
 <p>This Stone Beast’s divine sense only allowed him to move within a certain perimeter. Once something had entered the perimeter, the Stone Beast would attack it.</p>
 <p>To guard the treasure box and door behind it, the area the Stone Beast could move around was not large. However, trying to kill the Stone Beast from afar was impossible. Qing Shui did not know if the indomitable Dragon Slaying Beast could pass through the Stone Beast or not.</p>
 <p>With this Stone Beast’s Divine Sense, if the Dragon Slaying Beast’s beast could not break through, then the Dragon Slaying Beast would be sent flying. The Dragon Slaying Beast’s indomitable abilities weren’t able to penetrate everything, especially this Stone Beast. However, it could be possible.</p>
 <p>The door behind the stone beast was open. They could enter as long as they could pass thru the Stone Beast. However, the stone door was not very big and was also blocked by the Stone Beast. Even if they could lure it away, it would still block the door. It was a type of guardian that would guard the objective even in death.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used the Nine Palace Steps but no matter what he did, the Stone Beast would not leave the vicinity of the stone door. It would also continuously attack using the mystical powers of its body. The Stone Beast was like a robot that would never get tired. Other than eliminating it, there seemed to be no other way to enter.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not know how he would deal with this tricky situation in front of him. He already landed many attacks on the Stone Beast but it seemed that Qing Shui’s attacks had no effect on it.</p>
 <p>“Haha, all words and nothing to show for. Doesn’t your actions result in the same thing…”</p>
 <p>The elder took the opportunity to mock Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was a bit annoyed. The Dragon Slaying Beast constantly cast Ice Bullet Attack on the Stone Beast several hundreds of times. However, this was his only method.</p>
 <p>Ignoring everything to do with level or grades, it had a chance to freeze the target.</p>
 <p>Even if the chance was small, it was still a chance. Qing Shui was waiting for it.</p>
 <p>“I say, are you guys even going to make it. If not, retreat then. In any case, you guys won’t be able to retrieve the treasure here, so stop trying to get yourselves in trouble.”</p>
 <p>Pow!</p>
 <p>After the elder’s words were finished, the giant Stone Beast was frozen by a large piece of ice on its body. Qing Shui once again grabbed the Demon Lord and blinked without any hesitation.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps, Displacement!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was the king within the Nine Palace, allow this giant statue to shift slightly was still alright, there was a crack that would allow one person to squeeze through, they rushed towards the crack. The Dragon Slaying Beast had already passed through.</p>
 <p>He also squeezed through as they flashed over. At that moment, Qing Shui and the Demon Lord were facing each other. He could feel the softness in front of his chest and the light touch of her lips on his, the feeling was intoxicating. In this small crack, the two of them were glued together. It was a tight fit to get through, especially when the Demon Lord’s breast were so plump.</p>
