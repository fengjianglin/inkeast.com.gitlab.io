 <p><strong>AST 729 - Kill</strong></p>
 <p>Zuoshi Yi was stunned upon hearing Qing Shui’s words. The same thing also happened with the others. The reason why they spoke so much before was only to make Qing Shui realize the enormous gap in strength between Zuoshi Clan and Qing Clan.</p>
 <p>However, the outcome truly exceeded his expectations. Zuoshi Yi looked quite pale and unsightly. At the time when he came, he had already promised Zuoshi Yun that he would help him achieve his goals by all means.</p>
 <p>He was aware of the capability of Heavenly Palace and Qing Clan, which was why he brought four people along. The five of them were more than enough to make both Heavenly Palace and Qing Shui lower their heads.</p>
 <p>“Haha, Qing Shui, the youngest patriarch from Heavenly Palace, the Heavenly Palace that is remarkable in your eye is just like an ant to Zuoshi Clan. Even you would be easily dealt with. If Zuoshi Clan had wanted it, we can eliminate Heavenly Palace and Qing Clan in an instant.”Zuoshi Yi was really furious. After all, he spoke so much only to be rejected by Qing Shui. This was the first time he met someone so insensible.</p>
 <p>Whenever supreme aristocratic clans were mentioned, everyone would try to keep a good distance from them. They would even go so far as to politely allow the supreme clan to take away people from their clan. If the people were to turn down their request, they would do it by force. Often, no one would utter a word in order to protect the entire clan.</p>
 <p>“Foolish!” the previous things that Zuoshi Yi mentioned didn’t manage to release all the anger in him. He once again opened his mouth and spoke.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t say anything. He extended his hand and the next thing that was seen was a one meter grey flame. After that, he shrank and compressed it until it was the size of a baby’s head and looked back at Zhuoshi Yi.</p>
 <p>“Very soon, you’ll find out who’s the foolish one.” Qing Shui took everything slowly after he finished speaking. He didn’t rush to attack them.</p>
 <p>“Haha, you still dare to attack me?” Zuoshi Yi stared at Qing Shui with a disdainful look.</p>
 <p>“Initially, I was planning to let all of you live. But now, I have changed my mind.” When Qing Shui was done talking, he abruptly shot out the Primordial Flame Ball in his hand.</p>
 <p>Meteor Smash!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui has already locked onto his Qi in advance so that he wouldn’t be able to avoid the flame balls even if he wanted to. When Zuoshi Yi avoided it for the first time, he came to realize that the formidable flame balls were able to change trajectories. For a moment, he felt anxious.</p>
 <p>“Attack! Cripple him first!” Zuoshi Yi ordered the four men behind him loudly.</p>
 <p>Taichi Cloudhand!</p>
 <p>Taichi Single Whip!</p>
 <p>Pa-pa!</p>
 <p>The power that Qing Shui was using now was definitely below that of a Grade Five Martial Saint, yet he was still able to toy with them as he pleased.</p>
 <p>Ka…...</p>
 <p>The entire main hall was filled with mournful cries, noises of bones cracking and loud howling noises. At this moment, Zuoshi Yi felt that the bewildering young man in front of him was getting more and more unreal. The information that he received about him seemed to be inaccurate. Even though Qing Shui once managed to eliminate the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, but according to the rumors, it was because he had people to assist him with it. Additionally, the people from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord wasn’t really that strong.</p>
 <p>The Primordial Flame Ball was getting closer and closer to Zhuoshi Yi. Zhuoshi Yi once again avoided it. As he swung his hand, a huge thing with jet black scales all over its body appeared in front of him.</p>
 <p>Copper Black Bull!</p>
 <p>The Copper Black Bull was a Grade Six Martial Saint demonic beast. It was fifteen meters long and four meters tall. Its unique features were its incredible strength and the sturdy skin on its body. Additionally, there was three meter long and curvy sharp bull’s horns on its head. The appearance of the Copper Black Bull made the main hall looked a lot smaller.</p>
 <p>Mou!</p>
 <p>The Copper Black Bull stopped the Primordial Flame Balls with its thick horn.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Mou! A mournful cry resounded. More than half of the black bull’s three-meter horn was burnt despite it being the sturdiest part of the Copper Black Bull’s body. The Copper Skin Black Bull madly stomped around the place, not knowing if it was because it was in pain or if it was angry.</p>
 <p>Zuoshi Yi was finally feeling panicked. The Copper Black Bull was his ultimate weapon. In addition to that, he also witnessed Qing Shui beating up the four people until their bones cracked. Two of them were already at their last gasp.</p>
 <p>“Just what kind of strength does he possess?” In just a short while, Zuoshi Yi had sweat all over his head. His back was also wet with his own sweat.</p>
 <p>“If you dare to kill people from Zuoshi Clan, the only thing that awaits you will be the destruction of your sect and clan!” Zuoshi Yi screamed at Qing Shui in an attempt to intimidate him. However, he didn't know that his action only resulted in Qing Shui’s death sentence for him.</p>
 <p>Ah!</p>
 <p>A mournful scream was heard. Qing Shui immediately broke one of the men's necks leading to his immediate demise. Qing Shui looked back at Zuoshi Yi with a playful look. After that, he continued burning the corpse on the ground with his Primordial Flame Ball until nothing was left, making it looked as if the person had never appeared before. He also killed and burnt one of the elderly men to death.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s action caused Zuoshi Yi to panic even further. He actually dared to kill two of his men. That just meant that he had no intention of letting any of them survive. Now, the only thing he could do was to try his best to escape from here.</p>
 <p>Moo!</p>
 <p>The Copper Black Bull let out a loud scream. Its body suddenly expanded slightly. The jet black scale-like skins all over its body turned more jet-black and shiny. It abruptly tightened up its enormous body and charged towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Zuoshi Yi quickly ran outside without showing any concern towards the two injured comrades of his.</p>
 <p>Xiu-xiu!</p>
 <p>Two silver needles were shot at really high speed. They right away pierced through his brain and killed him. Qing Shui had countless methods of killing someone who was at this caliber. After that, he immediately used the Primordial Flame to burn and clean up the place. Even the entire main hall was burnt to nothing.</p>
 <p>In any case, there were still quite a few main halls here. Since this main hall has got dead people before, Qing Shui felt that it's better to just burn it right away to avoid leaving any evidence.</p>
 <p>“Are you alright?”</p>
 <p>Di Chen walked up to Qing Shui and looked at him in worry.</p>
 <p>“They’re just one of the small fries among those rascals. Inform our clan members to not tell anyone that they died in Qing Clan.” Qing Shui said after thinking for a while. It would be better if he could drag it out for a while.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, but I have a feeling that more people from Zuoshi Clan will come.” Di Chen knitted her brows.</p>
 <p>“Don't worry about it, we have been through so many things. You don't have to be scared of Zuoshi Clan.”Qing Shui remembered that they were only warriors with strength ranging from one star to three stars. In fact, there were also only very few people with strength that was worth three stars. Besides, he didn't want to worry Di Chen.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took a look around Qing Clan. Even though the speed at which they progressed in their cultivation was quite fast, when compared to the supreme clans, the difference was still like comparing a firefly with a bright moon. The outstanding talent of aristocratic clans were an essence accumulated over more than ten generations. It's something which they earned step by step.</p>
 <p>Now in Qing Clan, other than Qing Shui being the stronger one, there were still Di Chen, Yiye Jiange, Canghai Mingyue and Mingyue Gelou. Being a Grade Four Martial Saint, Di Chen was the strongest among them. Qing Shui would think of a way to help her get even stronger. Canghai Mingyue, Mingyue Gelou and Yiye Jiange were all Grade One Martial Saints. Soon, it should be the pinnacle period for them to significantly hone their skills. For Qing Shui had yet to give them a few his medicinal pills and fruits.</p>
 <p>Additionally, there was still Luan Luan. Qing Shui had high expectations for her.</p>
 <p>On the second day, Cang Wuya and Fei Wuji came. Qing Shui brought the two to another main hall. The old master took a particular liking to the two little brats. Normally, he would visit this place from time to time. It might have been because of the kind heart this old man possessed, the two little brats got along really well with him. But it was different in Fei Wuji’s case. Canghai Mingyue walked in with a pot of tea: “Grandpa, Martial Uncle Fei, I'm coming in.</p>
 <p>After a while, Huoyun Liu-Li, Mingyue Gelou and the others also joined in. They spent quite a long time with Cang Wuya. Di Chen was also really familiar with Cang Wuya and Fei Wuji.</p>
 <p>That's as far as Cang Wuya could progress with his strength. There was no longer any improvement in it. Fei Wuji on the other hand, he managed to have a considerably significant increase in his strength. He has already caught up to Cang Wuya and became a Peak Martial King Warrior. However, it should be really hard for him if he wanted to break through to Martial Saint. Qing Shui planned to give him some Fruit of Five Elements later on.</p>
 <p>“Old Master, I will be going to Southern Viewing Continent with Martial Uncle Fei in a while to settle Old Ancestor’s wish before he passed away. Do you still want to go?” Qing Shui smiled and looked towards Cang Wuya and Fei Wuji.</p>
 <p>Cang Wuya’s eyes turned bright. Fei Wuji on the other hand, was stunned. At the time when Old Ancestor passed away, he told them before that Qing Shui could go there once he became a Grade Five Martial Saint. Fei Wuji knew that Qing Shui’s strength had long since exceeded that of a Grade Five Martial Saint but he never said that he wanted to go. He also couldn't rush him. He failed to live up to his own expectations… he needed to rely on others for his own stuff.</p>
 <p>He has also had the thought before that Qing Shui might not go to Southern Viewing Continent since it was located so far away. He would have to climb up mountains and cross rivers in order to go there. Not only so, it would definitely be packed with danger too. Slowly, Fei Wuji no longer had any hopes, even though Qing Shui had promised to go before, he never told him when he would do it.</p>
 <p>“I'm old and would not be much of a help. I'll get Bai Gui to go with you.” Cang Wuya chuckled. He was really happy at the moment. Even though Old Ancestor was his master, he couldn’t do anything for him. But now, things were different, knowing Qing Shui, Mingyue, the little brat, and everything that he had now, were all given by Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“That's good too! After we’re done running our errands, we will come back and tell you about the good news.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>“Yes, today is a really happy day for me.” Cang Wuya’s bright laugh rang.</p>
 <p>“Martial Uncle Fei, upon finishing Old Ancestor’s wish, you are still going to do one more thing. Only after that will Old Ancestor truly be at peace.” Qing Shui smiled and looked at Fei Wuji.</p>
 <p>“I know, I will get married right away as soon as I'm back from South Viewing Ministry Continent.” Fei Wuji replied seriously.</p>
 <p>To him, heading to South Viewing Continent was the most important thing. As long as it could help to clear up the burden in his heart, he would go. To him, there was nothing more important that this.</p>
 <p>“Alright, then it's decided. We’re about to celebrate new year this year. So, let's go to Southern Viewing Continent after new year.” Qing Shui remembered about Zuoshi Clan. Before he went, there were still some things he would need to sort out.</p>
 <p>Three days went on peacefully. Actually, Qing Shui was quite worried but he knew that Zuoshi Clan would definitely not turn up in full force. This way, he could still fight for some time. Around twenty one star to three stars warriors, if they came separately in three times, Qing Shui felt that he would stand a chance against them. This was his worst case scenario.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was also really concerned. He spent these few days cultivating like crazy. He didn't intend to break through, he only wanted his strength to be more stable and more sturdy.</p>
 <p>Yet another three days passed. There was yet to be any news from Zuoshi Clan. Qing Shui thought about it and realized that he was rushing too much. The journey from Green Cloud Continent to Pingyang Country was quite far apart. They wouldn't be able to rush here in such a time. Moreover, Qing Shui also felt that there was something weird about this incident, for example, Zuoshi Yun sent Zhuoshi Yi to take Wenren Wushuang back. These things may have been done secretly since other people from Zhuoshi Clan weren’t aware of them.</p>
 <p>There’s a huge possibility for that. And also, since the journey is quite long, they will have difficulty coming here too. This is great, if they are far away from us, it would be hard even for them to investigate the incident. There’s a chance that this incident will end quietly. Qing Shui was having wishful thoughts</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, there’s always a huge gap between wishes and reality. After a month, the people from Zhuoshi Clan still showed up. Furthermore, they came to Qing Clan right away.</p>
