Right now, the two of them were hugging each other, and there seemed to be something hard near her lower abdomen. She knew what it was, and this made her feel a little more anxious and panicky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Lingyan, I had thought in the past that you didn't like men."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they had intercourse on their first encounter, it was because Tantai Lingyan had been drugged and was out of control despite still having a clear conscious. Thereafter, with her cold personality, Qing Shui had always thought that an ice beauty like her didn't like men.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was unable to imagine how an icy beauty like her would be like when she was in a man's embrace. Would she let out breathtaking cries? What would she look like during sex? Would she reach an orgasm?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"To be honest, it's true that I didn't like men before I met you."Tantai Lingyan said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at her in surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It's not that I like people of the same sex. That's why that person from the Five Tiger Immortal Sect drugged me in an attempt to change me. I don't know what that drug was, but it would make a woman develop favorable impressions toward the man who is close to her. I have no idea if this is true or not." Tantai Lingyan shared some of the things from her past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and looked at Tantai Lingyan, "I ended up reaping the advantages!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What are you talking about?" Tantai Lingyan glared at Qing Shui, embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Then is it because of the effect of that drug that you like me now?" Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"No, I'm very clear about this. If it's the effect of the drug, then I wouldn't have let you leave back then." Tantai Lingyan said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui liked what she said. This showed that he was very charming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Lingyan!" Qing Shui called out softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hmmm? What's the matter?" Seeing that Qing Shui appeared a little awkward, Tantai Lingyan didn't understand what's wrong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I want..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at Tantai Lingyan's beautiful peaks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan naturally knew that Qing Shui wanted to do something, but she didn't know what exactly did he want to do. She was afraid that Qing Shui would take her right away as she wasn't prepared yet. If she were to get married to Qing Shui one day, things might take its course, and they would reach the final base.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I want to kiss there..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Qing Shui said this, he looked at Tantai Lingyan. This woman had her head lowered, turning very red. Even her tender ears had turned red, and her snow-white neck was also covered in pink.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To think that she was so sensitive...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You aren't allowed to do anything else..." Tantai Lingyan hesitated a little as she said softly, feeling embarrassed as she looked at this man who would never change in this lifetime.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What made Qing Shui agitated was that Tantai Lingyan didn't object. Qing Shui quickly nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui set up a simple formation on the mountain's peak and even set up a tent and brought out a comfortable bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui carried Tantai Lingyan and placed her on the bed, letting her lean against it at a 45 degrees angle. She was very nervous now, and Qing Shui could sense her heartbeat. She had her hands before her chest, feeling at a loss as she grabbed onto her clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui found it very funny to see her being so anxious. Mentality wise, she was a virgin. A few decades ago, even though they had sex once, it wasn't considered as a comfortable one. There would more or less be some traumas from that incident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wanted to wipe away her traumas from back then as well; thus, he was raising this request today. Qing Shui knew that her body was very sensitive. In the past, there was also once when he had let her feel “comfortable”. It could be partially due to this reason that she had allowed this today. Otherwise, she might not have agreed to his request...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui lowered his head and kissed on her lips once again. Tantai Lingyan gradually relaxed, and her hands moved to wrap around Qing Shui's neck while he skillfully removed her clothes. Tantai Lingyan might have known it, but she didn't stop him. It was only when her two snow-white peaks bounced out that she trembled and didn't dare to open her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Lingyan, open up your eyes and take a look. They are so beautiful."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at those perfect breasts that were longer in nature. Although they weren't massive, they weren't small either and were in the perfect shape. At one glance, one hand wouldn't be able to hold it entirely, and the pink tips at the peak exuded a lethal attraction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were upright, and their shapes didn't seem to deform at all. They trembled and emitted a light fragrance. Even when she was half seated up like this, her flat stomach didn't show any hints of a bulge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan's hands grabbed onto Qing Shui's clothes on the outside of his arms. She slowly opened up her eyes and saw that her upper body was completely presented before this guy. She felt an indescribable sense of embarrassment, not daring to look into his eyes. Her heartbeat was also getting faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui slowly put up his hands and covered the beautiful peaks. That wonderful feeling made his heart beat faster and Tantai Lingyan trembled, closing her eyes quickly. Qing Shui didn't get her to open her eyes anymore. After all, this was their first time, and there were plenty of chances in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui activated his Soft-Tendon Hand Technique, making Tantai Lingyan tremble even more. He lowered his head and gently sucked on the tip, brushing it softly with his tongue and then sucking it greedily. Together with the Soft-Tendon Hand Technique, the beautiful figure under him suddenly shivered abruptly in just a few breaths' of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui sensed her figure tensing up slightly then trembled, letting out a soft and suppressed cry. She shut her eyes tightly and clenched her teeth tight, not allowing herself to cry out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's tongue swirled around on the tips of her breast and at the same time, his Soft-Tendon Hand Technique pressed down on the Lingtai acupoint on her back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan, who had just reached an orgasm, trembled once again. This time around, her tightly clenched teeth came loose, and she let out a breathtaking cry. Although it wasn't a loud cry, it was enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She unconsciously wrapped her arms tightly around Qing Shui's neck, not allowing him to move. Her body continued to twitch in a rhythm, and a strange fragrance extended out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stopped using his Soft-Tendon Hand Technique and only kissed her tender breast, burying his head in them and not letting off that smooth stomach either. His hands continued to move around her body, and when they reached the inner of her upper thigh, he realized that her clothes in that area were wet.</span></p>

Her cheeks were flushed red, appearing indescribably charming. Right now, at least half of her icy-cold aura was gone. She wanted to change her clothes and grabbed Qing Shui's hands, "I want to change my clothes..."</span></p>

Go outside and wait for me."</span></p>

Qing Shui jokingly said next to her ear.</span></p>

Tantai Lingyan whispered softly. It was as if saying this had sapped all of her strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Then do you want to go through it one more time?" Qing Shui suggested.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>

Tantai Lingyan came out after a change of clothes and Qing Shui swiped her off her feet, carrying her horizontally and then slowly walking along the path on the mountain's peak. "When I knew of the matters with the Five Tiger Immortal Palace, I had thought of heading back and bringing you here. However, after some thoughts, I decided to wait a little longer so that by the time I look for you, we can settle this matter thoroughly together."</span></p>

We'll work hard together and make preparations. When the time comes, we'll go and wipe out the Five Tiger Immortal Sect together." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
