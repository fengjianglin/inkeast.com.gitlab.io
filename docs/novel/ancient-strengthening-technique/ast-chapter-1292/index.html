 <p><strong>AST 1292 - Significant Increase In Strength, First Grade Five Elements Divine Flag, Golden Dragon Silkworm , Blood Ice Silkworm</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui kept his thought to himself. As a whole, things were developing better and this was already enough for now. He adjusted his state to its peak and began to refine the powerful force.</p>
 <p>This time, the advancement towards the huge gate of Heavenly Dao had enabled Qing Shui to absorb the energy a few months in advance. These few months were accounted from time in the real world, hence, he was really happy. This way, he would be able to do many things in advance.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>By the time when Qing Shui dissolved the force, his body swiftly became filled up with powerful energy. Even though it was really powerful, he didn’t really feel much danger from it, at least not as dangerous as the previous two times. This didn’t mean that the energy he absorbed this time wasn’t as comparable as the last time, it was just that the ‘container’ within his body had expanded significantly. This was the huge benefit brought upon by the advancement towards the huge gate of Heavenly Dao.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui fully concentrated to absorb this energy. He wouldn’t let his guard down just because he didn’t feel much danger. Caution was the parent of safety. Qing Shui operated his body with all his force to absorb this energy.</p>
 <p>His organs were slowly getting stronger. The Blood Essence within his body was also slowly becoming more and more abundant. His muscles, bones, as well as his spirit energy were growing. The Golden Star and Nebula within his Sea of Consciousness, along with the Golden Pellet within his Dantian, also grew as well.</p>
 <p>A golden light enveloped around him. The violent energy within his body slowly decreased while it surged around. Following the reduction in energy, his strength slowly increased.</p>
 <p>By the time Qing Shui had completely refined it, seven days have already passed within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. This time, Qing Shui didn’t look as exhausted as before. No changes had actually occurred around his body, unlike the first two times when his body was covered with bloodstains.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui opened his eyes and as he tried to sense the strength around his body, he smiled.</p>
 <p>He now had a strength worth 20,000 nimbus, which was equivalent to two suns of raw strength. Prior to this, he only had strength worth 12,000 nimbus. By refining the strength this time, his strength had increased by 8,000 nimbus. Compared to the previous two times, the increased amount was about twice as much.</p>
 <p>The increase this time was only in his raw strength and nothing else. Qing Shui didn’t really feel depressed about it, after all, he was really quite satisfied with the progress he made this time.</p>
 <p>His physical attacking prowess had achieved 3,700 sun under the effect of his Seven-colored Pellet, Big Dipper Sword, Demonic Beast Manifestation Armor and Golden Pellet. The attacking prowess of the Nine Continents Mountain on the other hand, could achieve 7,400 sun.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn’t help but to smile. Even if he was to only smash the Nine Continents Mountain into the land, how many people in the Western Oxhe Continent could actually stop him? The Nine Continents Mountain also carried along a tremendous shield force. Even if it was to clash against someone that had a strength worth 10,000 sun, with its 7,400 sun worth of strength, the Nine Continents Mountain would still be able to push it back.</p>
 <p>Under the effects of the Seven-Colored Pellets, Arhat Rosary Beads, Big Dipper Sword, Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation, Golden Pellet, and Divine Nebula Formation, his Spirit Energy could actually nearly achieved a strength worth 7,400 sun. If he was to use the Seal of Roc, it would be around 13,000 sun worth of strength. If the chance to double the attack prowess was met, it could even achieve a terrifying strength of 26,000 sun.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui happily sensed the abundant energy across his body. Now, he had stepped across the huge gate of Heavenly Dao. He now had a powerful force of suppression towards the warriors who have yet to step across it. Hence, his real strength would actually turn out to be even more terrifying.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, who was full of energy, started to plan his path for the future. The refinement this time made him felt that he was one step closer towards the Eighth Heavenly Layer. When he turned around, he could see the long staircase below. Of course, if he was to look up, he still couldn’t see the end of it. However, Qing Shui was aware that a day would come when he would be able to finally see the huge gate towards the Eighth Heavenly Layer.</p>
 <p>The False God realm was somehow still blurry from his sight, however, he stopped thinking about it. He had already managed to interact with the Heavenly Dao. HIs strength was constantly improving. The day when he could finally achieved the False God realm would definitely come.</p>
 <p>Refine his magic treasure!</p>
 <p>Not only did his Blood Essence fill up, compared to before, there seemed to be more Blood Essence within his Blood Essence Pool. The energy contained within the Blood Essence had also gotten more powerful.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui’s heart thumped. A two-inches long golden dragon had actually appeared in front of him.</p>
 <p>Bone Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm!</p>
 <p>Originally, it was already a tiny golden silkworm but this time, its strength had increased. The changes in the Blood Essence Pool had actually caused this tiny thing to break through early.</p>
 <p>Its body was now about twice as big as before. It was exquisite to the point that it was hard to describe with words. Its dragon horn, and also its tiny head, had started to look like the head of a tiny dragon. Most importantly, two fine and delicate tiny claws had started to grow on its body.</p>
 <p>The claws were located just below its tiny head, the tiny little silkworm was only the size of a thumb. Its body looked really slender and balanced. He assumed that at least two more tiny claws would grow on its rear end.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, it wasn’t a real dragon. It only shared a bit of dragon’s bloodline. This was an ancient mutated species. Normally, this kind of thing was parasitic and would grow on the body of powerful demonic beasts and humans. Despite this, there were few, or maybe none, who would be able to rear it to this kind of state like Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui tried to communicate with it mentally and found out that the communication was successful. However, he only managed to communicate with it through his will. He somehow had a feeling that this little brat was a spirit and seemed to understand Qing Shui’s intentions a lot. After all, this tiny thing grew up by sucking his Blood Essence.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui put it back to the Blood Essence Pool. He noticed that slight changes had also happened to the two Ice Silkworm. A few blood lines had appeared across the Ice Silkworm’s body.</p>
 <p>Blood Ice Silkworm!</p>
 <p>It went through a mutation!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt really happy. It didn’t matter if it was his demonic beasts or his medicinal herbs that mutated. Normally, there would be significant benefits everytime a mutation happened.</p>
 <p>The Blood Ice Silkworm was still at its infancy stage. Its body was now almost at the same size as the Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm. If it continued to grow bigger, he would have to keep it inside the realm.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui decided to smelt his magic treasures. In the past, he was reluctant to even skip it once, but he had already skipped doing it for about seven to eight days. From now on, he wouldn’t dare to skip smelting even for a day.</p>
 <p>On the 60th day, the Five Elements Divine Flag gave out a bright five-colored light. Qing Shui got so surprised that his heart started beating loudly.</p>
 <p>It ascended in grade.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, who was too occupied to care about any more things, quickly looked towards the Five Elements Divine Flag.</p>
 <p>Five Elements Divine Flag (Husband)!</p>
 <p>First grade. Could be refined with Blood Essence once everyday. For now, one checkpoint could be set up within the map on the Five Elements Divine Flag. The amount of checkpoints would increase in accordance to the ascension in grades. The users could shuttle back and forth between the checkpoints. It could be used once every month.</p>
 <p>State: Already recognized its owner.</p>
 <p>It could teleport the person to the holder of the Five Elements Divine Flag (Wife), or vice versa. There was no restriction to it. It was only limited to the two people that possessed the Five Elements Divine Flags.</p>
 <p>He could finally set up one checkpoint and could also use it once a month. This was already quite desirable for him. Qing Shui right away entered the space within the Five Elements Divine Flag and looked towards the map of the World of the Nine Continents.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui looked towards it, he felt a bit sad. It was just as what the woman had said, only the map of the five continents lit up. When it lit up, it meant that he could only set up checkpoints within it and not on other locations.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the most precise map of the World of the Nine Continents. Even with this map, each place couldn’t be that easily spotted. The maps which he got from the market were all relatively small scaled. Of course, they also had the maps for one or more continents but normally, they wouldn’t be this accurate. A lot of the locations around the World of the Nine Continents were also very hard to locate precisely as the methods to exchange information around here weren’t that advanced. Another reason was that the World of the Nine Continents was just too huge.</p>
 <p>Central Continent!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked towards the Central Continent located among the five continents. He wasn’t sure if he could change the location of the checkpoint in the future. After a while, he shook his head. It didn’t matter if he could change it or not, for now, the Nine Continents Steps still couldn’t manage to travel back and forth across the entire distance between the Nine Continents. The outlook for the future was also not that great since it was too difficult for the Nine Continents Steps to level up at this point. Basically, he didn’t have the slightest idea when it would ascend up to its next grade. Even ten years might not be enough. However, with its current capabilities, it was still very useful when used it within a continent.</p>
 <p>It’s as if there was some magical power acting around Qing Shui’s finger when he pointed it towards where Central Continent was. It should be quite close to the Qing Clan’s courtyard.</p>
 <p>As soon as Qing Shui pointed at it, a red, round spot appeared. With this spot marked, Qing Shui felt incomparably happy.</p>
 <p>There was finally one checkpoint. As long as he wanted to, he could just head back right away. Furthermore, if he intended to come back here, he could just transport himself back to the woman. After all, there was no limitations between the two users of the Five Elements Divine Flag.</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui felt really great to have such an ability. But as he thought deeper into it, he got a bit upset. It seemed like this situation was a gain and loss to him. Qing Shui suddenly thought about where the woman would end up if she was to transport to him while he was inside the realm.</p>
 <p>It might very likely transport her to a spot inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal where he was at.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stopped thinking about this question. He desired to go back really strongly, however, there were still some stuffs he needed to solve here. The only thing he feared was not being able to transport back here once he left, but of course, the possibility of this to happen was very small. He thought about it just in case as a precaution for emergencies.</p>
 <p>On the next day, Qing Shui came out really early. Morning Practice!</p>
 <p>The increase in strength had led to a drastic change in his charm as well as his state. Suddenly, Qing Shui turned around only to find the woman was looking towards here from the pavilion.</p>
 <p>At the moment when she spotted Qing Shui looking back, the woman moved very quickly and within the span of a few breathing times and arrived next to Qing Shui. At this moment, it was his turn to be shocked.</p>
 <p>Surprisingly, the woman’s strength was worth around 20,000 nimbus.</p>
 <p>As much as Qing Shui was surprised, the woman felt even more so than him. His strength actually increased by so much in just a while. She looked at Qing Shui with shock in her beautiful eyes. He felt that her eyes were really familiar. It’s just the same as watching an enormous potential stock on the market back in his previous incarnation.</p>
 <p>“I might go back to the five continents soon. By then, I might need to stop near you when I come back.” Qing Shui felt the need to inform her about it.</p>
 <p>At the moment when the woman heard Qing Shui mentioned the word ‘teleport’, she actually revealed a rarely seen weird look. After that, she asked in shock, “Your Five Elements Divine Flag has achieved its first grade?”</p>
 <p>“I have got a few unique things. Unfortunately, they won’t be able to help you.”</p>
 <p>“Understood, set up the checkpoint around the five continents.”</p>
 <p>“On its first grade, the checkpoints can only be set around the five continents.”Qing Shui explained in a slightly upset tone.</p>
 <p>The woman revealed a happy smile upon seeing Qing Shui’s face. After that, she said something which made Qing Shui uncertain how he would react to. “By the time you teleport, you better not teleport right beside me when I’m in the shower.”</p>
 <p>“I won’t. It won’t be that coincidental.” Qing Shui said, embarrassed.</p>
 <p>“Hey, little brat, are you feeling embarrassed or do you think that I’m not qualified enough for you?” The woman really enjoyed seeing Qing Shui’s cramped up face.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was a bit stunned when he heard what the woman had said. He realized that he was actually unable to find an accurate answer. But there was one thing, this woman wasn’t really that old, she just looked so mature like a ripened fruit with its juice ready to come out.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui thought of the juices of ripe fruits, he couldn’t help but to remember the moisture he had seen on her nightgown. It was her juice…...</p>
 <p>Naturally, Qing Shui’s expression didn’t manage to escape the woman’s gaze. She immediately extended her hand and put it on his chin. Qing Shui was once again stunned. This action of hers made him felt like he was being bullied.</p>
 <p>“You rogue brat, where do you think you are looking at? Believe it or not, I’m going to eat you up.”</p>
 <p>Despite the woman’s holy and mature look, the things which she said made Qing Shui uncertain whether he should cry or laugh. He helplessly extended his hand and pushed down her hand which was on his chin.</p>
