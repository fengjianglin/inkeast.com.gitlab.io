 <p><strong>AST 1298 - The Feeling of Happiness, Qing Ming’s girlfriend?</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui, who thought all of this through, felt really relaxed deep in his heart. After all, all of his family members still had quite a long time to live. Even his grandpa alone had almost 300 years worth of lifespan. Without saying, the others would have even more lifespan. A lifespan of 300 years was definitely enough, it was enough for Qing Shui to get everything ready. He believed that in the future, by relying on his own alchemy and strength, he would definitely be able to change them.</p>
 <p>Everything had been settled and the entire family was in harmony. During night-time, Qing Shui couldn’t wait to get to their bedrooms. However, it was just what Huoyun Liu-Li asked, who would he go to first?</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue’s room!</p>
 <p>Both Qing Zun and Qing Yin had long since gotten separate rooms for themselves. Qing Shui knocked open the door to Canghai Mingyue’s room immediately squeezed himself into it. When that happened, Canghai Mingyue’s face slightly blushed. She shot Qing Shui a glare and closed the door.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately carried the beauty up and walked towards their bedroom.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue had a very sexy body. She extended her white arms and put them around Qing Shui’s neck. It had been almost three years since they last met. It was always said that absence makes the heart grows fonder. When an ordinary woman met the man that she loved, she needed a way to release the feeling of how much she had yearned for him.</p>
 <p>When a male and a female missed each other up to a certain extent, only by mating would they be able to help resolve the passion they had for each other. Qing Shui didn’t make any extra moves. He immediately stripped both of their clothes off. While they enjoyed the moment, the two squeezed themselves into a warm and cosy greenhouse.</p>
 <p>At that instant, a pleasured voice came through as Qing Shui madly kissed Canghai Mingyue. Meanwhile, she also responded back to his feelings passionately. It was very rare to see her so active and this time, it seemed as if she was really able to let herself free. Her passion made Qing Shui even more agitated. While he moved, he started to kiss her all over her body.</p>
 <p>They moved their lower body very quickly. While this happened, both Qing Shui’s hands and mouth hadn’t stopped for even a second. He constantly lifted her spirit all the way to its peak. One by one, Qing Shui started to use different positions with her.</p>
 <p>At this moment, this very magnanimous and majestic woman was actually feeling a bit shy and reserved. Despite this, she still promised Qing Shui a lot of positions to make him thoroughly enjoy the entire process both in and out.</p>
 <p>On top of the soft and comfortable bed, a dampness could already be seen on top of the white blanket. Qing Shui who came to a stop laid beside Canghai Mingyue. He hugged her attractive and slender body very tightly.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, why don’t you go to them.” Canghai Mingyue said gently while she curled up within Qing Shui’s arms.</p>
 <p>“So you are going to throw me away after you were done using me?” Qing Shui teased her with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Bleh, a filthy mouth can never utter decent language.” Canghai Mingyue revealed a grumpy smile. After their moment of pleasure, her face looked so beautiful that words alone were not able to describe it. Especially the current flirtatious look on her face.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that she was doing things out of good intentions. Hence, he smiled and put on his clothes. He leaned over to the side and hugged her before he kissed her once again. He put his hands under the blanket and only left after she pouted at him again playfully.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui noticed that one night was still relatively short. Luckily, he started off early. Now, he knew that everyone was selfish with love as he had to rush for every single room. Furthermore, there were a few problems which were concerned themselves. They were some problems which couldn’t be discussed too thoroughly.</p>
 <p>Until now, Qing Shui was still unable to figure it out. Was loving someone to the extreme an act of selfishness? Even if it had been his own children, a lot of people would be biased. Of course, this wasn’t a desirable thing to do.</p>
 <p>Actually, Qing Shui had also been feeling that men and women’s love should be selfish. The deeper one fell for someone, the harder they would find it to have another person in their heart. But now, he realized that some things just weren’t as he thought. He loved every single one of his women, so much that he could say that he loved all of them all the way to his bones. For them, he could battle against everyone. He wouldn’t even care if he was to throw away his life.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head. Could every man's love be this extensive? Or was it only the case that they preferred new things over old ones. Qing Shui had never felt that he was someone like that, but he also couldn’t afford to only stick to one woman. Hence, he would try his best to love all of them. Besides, he truly loved each and every one of them too.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui only went into Zhu Qing’s room at late midnight. He first went to Canghai Mingyue, Di Qing, and Hai Dongqing. Those that didn’t have children or were not sleeping with their children before finally settling down were in Zhu Qing’s room.</p>
 <p>Zhu Qing opened the door and immediately hugged Qing Shui. He felt tenderness towards her and hugged her back. She knew that until now, the woman had yet to go to bed. If he hadn’t shown up today, even though she wouldn’t have said anything, Qing Shui was aware that she would still wait for him. If that happened, he would feel quite bad. Hence, despite the fact that it was quite late now, he would still come even if it had been later.</p>
 <p>“Darling, have you missed me?” Qing Shui whispered in her ear.</p>
 <p>“Yes, I have been missing you every single day. Sometimes, I would even feel the urge to get to you right away.” At this moment, Zhu Qing happily hugged Qing Shui. She was hugging him very tightly.</p>
 <p>“Me too, is Long`Er asleep?” Qing Shui whispered in her ear.</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>“Then why don’t we have fun in the living room first? I missed you…..” Qing Shui gently bit her delicate earlobe.</p>
 <p>Zhu Qing had the body type of a tiny woman with well-rounded and plump breasts. Despite her small body size, her breast looked really huge and rich. She had a perfect body proportion and had a kind of beauty that words alone couldn’t describe. She had the flirtatious expressions which belonged to that of a mature yet petite woman.</p>
 <p>“I won’t say it!” Zhu Qing felt really sensitive. She was already gasping for breath because of Qing Shui. Soft panting noises could be heard from time to time. Despite the fact that Qing Shui had already entered quite a few rooms, it wasn’t really a problem with his current body physique.</p>
 <p>“You really won’t say it?” Qing Shui unleashed his Soft-Tendon Hand Technique. This hand technique specialized in dealing with the sensitive parts of a woman’s body. Furthermore, it also had instantaneous effects. And now, Qing Shui precisely unleashed it on the sensitive parts of Zhu Qing’s body.</p>
 <p>“You bastard! I want it, Qing Shui, give it to me. Zhu`Er wants it!” Zhu Qing whispered to Qing Shui’s ears while she clenched her teeth.</p>
 <p>The two started violently to roll around in bed and kissed each other all over their bodies. Each time they did it, they started to demand something from each other’s bodies.</p>
 <p>After going through a storm together, Zhu Qing laid down on Qing Shui’s body. The sky was already at dawn. Qing Shui observed the languid and satisfied expression of hers. The well-rounded snow white breasts of hers pressed themselves right against his chest.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the thing in front of him and couldn’t wait to eat it up. He moved his head forward and whispered in Zhu Qing’s ear, which made her face to turn really red. She bit her lips and slowly moved up her body to put her plump breast into Qing Shui’s mouth.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Both Yu He and Wenren Wu-shuang headed off to the Eastern Victory Divine Continent to look for Mu Qing, hence, they weren’t at home. It had been a year since they went there, and if there was no any problem, they should be coming back this year. In any case, Qing Shui would come back in the future. Hence, he didn’t really plan to go look for them in the Eastern Victory Divine Continent.This time, Qing Shui didn’t control himself when he was with Hai Dongqing and Di Qing. They also wanted children and he had no objections against it.</p>
 <p>In his previous incarnation, Qing Shui was aware that a lot of women were afraid to suffer. They were afraid that their body might lose its original shape. In any case, they just didn’t want children. The number of burdens they got from having a child was somehow still fairly heavy. But from Qing Shui’s perspective, he felt that a woman who had never given birth and become a mother for her entire life would often leave something regrettable in their life.</p>
 <p>In any case, he already had children of his own. It was considered really early for warriors at his age to have children. In comparison, his women were slightly older than him. But age wasn’t a factor to the warriors, it was mainly their cultivations, looks, and lifespans that came into play.</p>
 <p>Even if some old demons that were a hundred or even a thousand years of age, if they were to run into Qing Shui, they would have to address him as their senior.</p>
 <p>In the world of martial arts, only the strong would be respected by others.</p>
 <p>During his morning practice, Qing Shui noticed that his children were also there. Even though Qing Long was absent, he could see Qing Yun there. That little lass was using the Nine Palace Squares. Qing Shui didn’t know who taught her that but that little lass was jumping around very joyfully just like a little fairy.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that he had managed to find an unusual kind of peace deep in his mind. He went on and approached them. When Qing Yun saw Qing Shui, she happily called him. “Daddy!”</p>
 <p>“Little lass, who taught you this?” Qing Shui asked curiously. “Mommy taught me this, she told me that by doing this, I would be able to run fast!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t continue his morning practice, instead, he went on to guide his children through it. Both Qing Zun and Qing Yin’s talent could be considered to be quite decent. Almost every parent would like children like them and of course, this included Qing Shui as well.</p>
 <p>The child who gave the most headache to others was Qing Ming. For children like this, they had outstanding talents and compared to Qing Zun, he would only be better than him, not inferior to him. But normally, the path which they took in their life would be slightly crooked compared to others.</p>
 <p>It had always been said that some people tend to take up bad habits easier than the good ones. Qing Ming was precisely this type of kid. One small wrong step was all it took for children to turn into monsters, an ambitious and ruthless person for their generation. It was assured that they would end up very powerful in the future, but people like them enjoyed taking paths contrary to those what normal people would take. For example, they would tend to go head to head against those upright people who were immaculately dressed.</p>
 <p>That was why the people from the Qing Clan had headaches. Qing Ming was a child who dared to do great mischief. He tended to always shock people with the things he said and even Mingyue Gelou herself was out of ideas on how to deal with him. Sometimes, she would hit him by spanking his butt but despite this, he just wouldn’t change his habit no matter what. Qing Yi, Qing Shui’s mom on the other hand, really liked Qing Ming and tended to side with him. Hence now, Qing Ming would listen to his grandma’s words.</p>
 <p>Qing Luo, Qing Shui’s grandpa, would no longer discipline this generation. Every time he saw them, he would only get happy. For disciplining, it was left up to the other people, from either Qing Yi or Qing Shui’s generation to do it.</p>
 <p>“Little brat, why don’t you come here and have a talk with me!” Qing Shui said to Qing Ming.</p>
 <p>Yesterday, Qing Shui took out quite a lot of stuff. Added on that he shared quite a decent relationship with the brat. Despite Qing Shui not spending enough time with him, Qing Shui’s name as well as the things which he did was still greatly admired by the brat. It’s always been mentioned that fathers were the heroes of their children. At the very least, they were to the children while they were still young.</p>
 <p>“Alright daddy, how powerful are you now?” Qing Ming asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Qing Shui looked at his son with a playful look.</p>
 <p>“That big carbon head from the Heifeng Clan got beaten up by me. it’s said that their clan is quite strong. Will they be able to threaten mom with their strength?” Qing Ming said after he thought for a while.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui remembered Qing Ming’s face yesterday which was covered in dirt and asked curiously, “Did you beat him really severely?”</p>
 <p>“I have broken an arm and a leg of his. I got surrounded by his family members. Luckily, I managed to escape really fast or else, I assume that I would have been beaten half-dead.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his head. He had never heard of the Heifeng Clan but he still smiled and asked, “Why do you hit him?”</p>
 <p>“He actually dared to steal my girlfriend. That’s why I hit him. That charcoal head actually dared to snatch away my woman.” Qing Ming said in a disdained tone.</p>
 <p>As soon as Qing Shui heard what he said, he got totally worn out and collapsed. How old was Qing Ming? He was just a nine-year-old child. Was this something which should be coming out from the mouth of a child at nine years of age? But as he thought about his past incarnations, he realized that there had been similar situations like this as well. It was just that those from his previous incarnation didn’t go to the extent of breaking other’s arms and legs.</p>
 <p>It went without saying that the children across the nine continents tend to mature at quite an early age. Despite this, it was still a bit too soon for Qing Ming. What made Qing Shui really shocked was when he mentioned the sentence “he dared to steal my woman”......</p>
 <p>“Yes, father will support you. Whose daughter is that girlfriend of yours? Is she really your girlfriend?” Regarding this problem, Qing Shui still had a bit of headache about it. He couldn’t stop him. The only thing he could do was to guide him, especially when it was a child like Qing Ming.</p>
 <p>“She is from the Ling Clan. Of course, she is my girlfriend. We share quite a good relationship with each other. But it’s said that the Heifeng Clan is very powerful. They are very cocky as well and I just really feel like beating him up.”</p>
