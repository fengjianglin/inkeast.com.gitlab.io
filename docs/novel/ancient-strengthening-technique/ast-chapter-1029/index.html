 <p><strong>AST 1029 - Devil Staff Technique, Meeting Little Fatty Again</strong></p>
 <p>After the engagement, Qing Shui had a beauty in his arms and was enjoying the warmth. Earlier, his strength had increased by 20 stars, while Di Qing’s had grown by 30 stars.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui once again cleared another Heavenly Meridian.</p>
 <p>Another one of the Heavenly Meridians had been cleared, increasing Qing Shui’s confidence in his assumption. He didn’t even know what to think about everything. Was he really going to get all of the ladies in the Portraits of Beauty?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned when he thought of this. Currently, he had already somehow encountered all of the ladies who were in the portraits which he possessed. He had even had that encounter with the lady in the crystal coffin. However, he had only known that she was one of the beauties in the portraits after their encounter.</p>
 <p>One didn’t necessarily need to be with the ladies in the Portraits of Beauty in order to clear his Heavenly Meridians. It could probably work with any woman who had a unique physique. Qing Shui had always felt that the twelve Portraits of Beauty weren’t all-inclusive. However, those who were depicted by the portraits were definitely the cream of the crop.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had grown a lot stronger and had even gone all the way with Di Qing. However, he hadn't impregnated Di Qing. Before he had lost his cool, he had told her about it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui planned for them to have kids only after they'd moved to the other four continents. It might be because she was embarrassed that Di Qing didn't say much. She just hugged Qing Shui and nodded.</p>
 <p>Di Qing was also a Martial Emperor and with the 30 star increase in physical strength, she was now at 260 stars.</p>
 <p>She was quite astonished at this. Qing Shui only told her that this was due to their Duo Cultivation.</p>
 <p>The earlier crazy and intoxicating scene made Qing Shui go into ecstasy. How many men had fallen to the beauty of women?. Beauty was a powerful, terrifying thing. If not for his strong willpower, he suspected that he would’ve drowned in beauty by now many times over.</p>
 <p>They huddled together all the way until sunrise. Di Qing fell asleep, but Qing Shui stayed awake. He still wanted to proceed with his morning practice. Looking at the lady who had fallen asleep in satisfaction, he also felt very satisfied.</p>
 <p>When it was time for their meals, Qing Shui didn't let anyone disturb Di Qing. The other ladies all smiled and looked at Qing Shui. They had guessed what had happened and they knew that this day would eventually come.</p>
 <p>The ladies didn't find it strange. It was within their expectations for Di Qing to become Qing Shui's woman. Moreover, there were still a few others outside. They seemed to have gradually gotten used to this life and even found it enjoyable.</p>
 <p>It was late morning when Qing Shui headed out. He had already seen the black spots that were looming in the distance. There were over twenty of them.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui frowned and walked out of the Qing Clan. He called out the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and flew toward the black dots, which were getting increasingly bigger.</p>
 <p>The Buddha Sect! It was still Buddha Sect. He saw the over 20 huge Swiftshadow Dragons in the distance, with people riding on them.</p>
 <p>"Seems like there's going to be a tough battle this time around!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui mumbled as he looked at the incoming people. With a glance, he could see the person heading the group and the Swiftshadow Dragon he was on. It was an old man who appeared fat, but had the strength and aura of an iron tower. He wasn't fat, but was rather too strong, too big, and too tall. He didn't show any signs of old age.</p>
 <p>The most terrifying thing was his cultivation level. It made Qing Shui tense up as he immediately circulated his powers to the maximum. This old man was too strong.</p>
 <p>State of One with Elephant!</p>
 <p>Area Dominance!</p>
 <p>This time around, Qing Shui didn't show any hesitation in using his trump cards. It was only with these that he felt that he could go up against the opponents. He stared at the old man and the others.</p>
 <p>The Diamond Reverend looked at the young man and, in that instant, his eyes filled with brilliant light as bright as the stars. Even his hands were trembling. He saw a young man who was comparable, or maybe even superior to his disciple.</p>
 <p>"You guys have all lived very long lives, but you seem to be getting increasingly old-fashioned and inflexible. I don't want to say much, but only wish to say one thing. You guys will regret this and there's no medicine for regret which you can buy." Qing Shui said calmly. To those old men, there was a strange feeling from his voice.</p>
 <p>If not for the fact that Qing Shui had killed the Buddha Sect's Ten Elders, they would’ve definitely found this to be a joke. However, they didn't think it was funny now. They merely had a very strange feeling. This young man was as unfathomable as a complex puzzle.</p>
 <p>"Young man, you're really very strong, but there are some things that we have to do. It's like what you've said, we might regret it. However, sometimes, people are unable to change despite knowing that they'll regret their decision. Maybe people will only give in after even more people feel regret. Before that happens, nothing will change." The Diamond Reverend frowned and said slowly.</p>
 <p>Looking at the old man's tall, tower-like figure, Qing Shui knew that what the old man had said was true. He didn't know what status the old man held in the Buddha Sect, but it seemed that he couldn't stop this from happening.</p>
 <p>The Diamond Reverend could to some extent choose his actions, but in the Buddha Sect he was merely a strong expert, one of many. Moreover, since he had already agreed to it, he would need to live up to his words. He felt that the young man was very strong, but he didn't think that his side would definitely end up on the losing end.</p>
 <p>There were some things which one couldn't afford to fail in. Failure would imply death. This was now that kind of situation!</p>
 <p>Set up the formation!</p>
 <p>The people behind the Diamond Reverend immediately stood in position, but they didn't activate any attacks. The Diamond Reverend took a step forward, and a big staff that was as thick as an adult's leg appeared in his hand. It was over three meters long. Right now, the Diamond Reverend lifted his head and looked toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Young man, let's start!" The Diamond Reverend looked to Qing Shui and said.</p>
 <p>"Alright!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's firm gaze locked onto the old man, and the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant let out a cry.</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demons!</p>
 <p>Diamond Sword Qi!</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Dragon Elephant Evasion!</p>
 <p>Art of Pursuing!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui completed all these in an instant and charged forward in the State of One with Elephant.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The huge sound caused Qing Shui to take a step back, while the other party remained unmoving. Qing Shui was astonished to see that the opponent's physique and strength seemed very powerful and strong.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui had already attained his goal. The Diamond Sword Qi and Art of Pursuing had caused his opponent's speed to be greatly reduced. This was what he had wanted to achieve.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps, Nine Palace Confusion Steps!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, together with the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, flashed forward once again, attacking with a Sword of Sixth Wave using his Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p>The Diamond Reverend's countenance changed and the great staff in his hands was used to block Qing Shui's Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p>This time around, the Diamond Reverend retreated multiple steps while Qing Shui only took one step back.</p>
 <p>Right now, the two were still checking each other out. Qing Shui knew the estimated strength of this old man, but he didn't know if the old man had any trump cards up his sleeves.</p>
 <p>Break!</p>
 <p>The Diamond Reverend let out a huge bellow as he swung the huge staff. A stream of golden light flashed on his body and at the same time, Qing Shui could clearly sense that the negative effects he had applied on the old man had completely disappeared. That wasn't all. The old man also seemed to have become stronger.</p>
 <p>"Young man, try out my Devil Staff Technique!"</p>
 <p>The huge staff exuded a bright golden light and in that moment, it seemed to be filled with spiritual intelligence. It then smashed down towards Qing Shui with the might of heaven and earth. Although it wasn't fast, it seemed as if the huge staff was coming in from all directions.</p>
 <p>Devil Staff Technique, First Stance, the World Changes!</p>
 <p>It was spirit energy again!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head. It seemed like after reaching this level, spirit energy was very important. However, their spirit energy seemed to be very weak compared to his and after having been weakened by another 70%, they posed no threat at all to him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't dodge, but just swung his Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p>The long sword in Qing Shui's hand, which appeared to be three feet long, now seemed as if it was tens of millions of jin heavy. It slowly moved to receive the attack from the huge golden colored staff.</p>
 <p>Countering heavy with light！</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>A deep sound rang out and a gray colored wave of essence was sent outward, centered on the pair’s location. Even the air exploded. Both Qing Shui and the old man took one step back.</p>
 <p>After having spent a night with Di Qing, Qing Shui's improvement in his cultivation was quite high. It was a pity that, due to the world's regulations, the actual increase to his strength was not a lot. However, having one of his heavenly meridians cleared gave Qing Shui a mysterious feeling. His spirit energy was condensed and the realm of his spirit energy cultivation had also increased. It was a very amazing feeling.</p>
 <p>"Again!"</p>
 <p>The old man's eyes gleamed, as he once again took a huge step forward pushing down with his huge staff. This time around, he was more than twice as fast as before.</p>
 <p>Devil Staff Technique, Second Stance, Crush Mountains and Rivers!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could feel how powerful this attack was. He fiercely counterattacked with his Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p>Sword of Sixth Wave!</p>
 <p>A series of explosions rang out and Qing Shui retreated another step back. The old man was also pushed back. This time around, Qing Shui knew that it was the effect of Shield Attack.</p>
 <p>The Diamond Reverend was extremely surprised. He knew his own abilities well and it was an eye-opener to see a young man have such great achievements at his age. At the same time his will to battle surged.</p>
 <p>He slowly started to spin his staff, and the pressure it exuded progressively grew as a stream of brilliant golden light was sent out. A golden pillar of light gradually encompassed the old man.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the old man's inner aura and moved his sword to his left hand as he grabbed the Violet Star Thunder God with his right.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps, Nine Palace Heaven Defying Stomp!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood on top of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, making quick steps as he charged out towards the old man who stood like an iron tower.</p>
 <p>Raging Blow!</p>
 <p>At this moment, the huge staff came down with an overwhelming pressure. Qing Shui's eyes were wide open.</p>
 <p>Devil Staff Technique, Third Stance, Splitting the Heavens!</p>
 <p>Ten Thousand Great Thunderbolt!</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qing Shui didn't even think of trying to use the Big Dipper Sword and its 20% success rate. It was more practical to use the Violet Star Thunder God's Raging Blow.</p>
 <p>Moreover, what Qing Shui wanted was the Ten Thousand Great Thunderbolt!</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>With a strong push, Qing Shui disappeared from the back of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. With a flash, he appeared behind the old man using his Nine Palace Steps. He then smashed the Violet Star Thunder God toward the old man's head.</p>
 <p>Everything happened in only an instant.</p>
 <p>At that moment, a golden colored hand imprint encompassed the old man and Qing Shui's Violet Star Thunder God smashed down on it. Although he smashed the imprint, the temporary paralyzing effect on the old man had also disappeared.</p>
 <p>Spirit energy battle technique. It was spirit energy yet again.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head and looked at the person who had performed that technique with the gold hand imprint. It was an old man who appeared to be extremely skinny. The monk robes he was wearing appeared to be very large on him.</p>
 <p>He was exuding powerful spirit energy waves. However, Qing Shui's gaze landed on the person next to him. It was a young "giant" who was a good fight for the old man from earlier. He also had a body that was like an iron tower, and he exuded a violent strength. Right now, the young man was looking at him as if fire was spewing out from his eyes. However, his gaze changed very quickly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was also extremely astonished. It was Little Fatty. His face hadn't changed much. It was the Little Fatty he had once brought back home with him. After having stayed at the Qing Clan for some time, Qing Shui was told that he had left with a monk of great stature.</p>
