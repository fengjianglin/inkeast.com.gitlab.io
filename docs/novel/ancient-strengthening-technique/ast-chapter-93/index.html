 <p><strong>Chapter 93 First Alchemy Experience.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 0093 – First Alchemy Experience</strong></p>
  <p>Qing Shui deeply etched the location of Wenren Wu-Shuang in his mind. She had gone to the Xue Clan of Heavenly River City. According to Wenren Wu-Gou, the Xue Clan’s Alchemist, Xue Dingjiang, was the sworn brother of their teacher, so if Wenren Wu-Shuang sought out an alchemist in Heavenly River City then without a doubt, she would definitely pay Alchemist Xue a visit.</p>
  <p>After he left the Night Fragrance Court, Qing Shui was seriously contemplating if he should go after Wenren Wu-Shuang. However, even if he went, what could he do? </p>
  <p>Strolling around the streets with no intentions in mind, thoughts of the laughter of Wenren Wu-Shuang surfaced in his mind. The visage of a lovely woman almost on the level of a celestial immortal, kept surfacing in his mind.</p>
  <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui felt a gust of wind blow past. This kind of wind was not formed by the movements of air currents or the weather, but was instead caused by someone running at a fast speed running right in the direction of Qing Shui, as though he was invisible. </p>
  <p>Qing Shui was pretty unhappy about such a situation. </p>
  <p>Obviously this person was either blind, or trying to seek him out for trouble. With his speed, especially after eating 2 of the agility-enhancing fruits, it was a simple matter for him to dodge. However, he was feeling really frustrated, and coincidentally someone wanted to become his outlet for unleashing his frustrations. He might as well accept. </p>
  <p>“Bang!” A youth collided into Qing Shui.</p>
  <p> “Ahhhh!” A voice shrieked.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at the 23-24 year old youth who was knocked to the ground. The dark-skinned youth had a huge frame, and was wearing a martial warrior uniform.</p>
  <p>“F*ck your mother! You even dare to knock the little brother of this young master down. Don’t you know who the boss is in Hundred Miles City?” A weird-sounding voice rang out.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui furrowed his brows as he looked at the figures standing behind the youth. The one in the lead was about 25-26 years old, with a pale countenance, and wearing an expensive embroidered robe. He was also the one that was staring in contempt at Qing Shui, scolding him as if he were scolding an idiot.</p>
  <p>In his mind, Qing Shui had already regarded this person as a retard. Although his temper was good, he hated it if anyone insulted his mother. A look as sharp as swords, flickered in his eyes as he stared at the youth.</p>
  <p>“What are you looking at? F*ck your mother you son of a b……”</p>
  <p>“ARGHHH!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui moved, with a speed as fast as the sparks from lightning. He aimed a kick at the crotch of the youth, as the sound of nuts cracking rang out, causing the scalps of those who witnessed it to turn numb.</p>
  <p>“If you don’t want to die, take this trash and scram!” Qing Shui said, without turning his head back.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was akin to a demon in the eyes of the remaining crowd. In the blink of an eye, their young master was sprawled on the ground, with no hope of a father’s day anymore.</p>
  <p>The remaining crowd stared at each other for a moment, before quickly picking up the young master and rushing away.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui calmed himself, and then leisurely strolled back to the Qing’s Clan Medical Store. He was still immensely unhappy. He had wanted to kill the youth earlier for the insult to Qing Yi, but ultimately, he had stayed his hands. He didn’t want to dip his hands in blood because of a fool. </p>
  <p>However, what he didn’t notice was that there was a shadowy silhouette stalking his movements and monitoring his actions. A strange glow glittered in the eyes of the shadowy silhouette as he informed others about what he had just witnessed.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui didn’t notice, in his mind he was only concerned with the concoction of the Five Dragon Pellet. However, he did not have the recipe. Stressing himself, he forced himself to think back during the times when he had played [Western Fantasy] back in his previous world, trying to recall the memories of his game knowledge. Two 1st-grade medical pills, together with two 2nd-grade medical pill would be able to create a 3rd-grade medical pill through synthesis.</p>
  <p>His eyes brightened, “Even if it fails, I have nothing to lose even if it fails.”</p>
  <p>The main thing now was for Qing Shui to find 2nd-grade medicine. 1st-grade medicine was very common. 2nd-grade medicine referred to the herbs that were at least 100 years of age. Qing Shui directly went back to the Medical Store, and took a few stalks of 100 year old herbs.</p>
  <p>Damn. </p>
  <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui suddenly halted in his steps. He had suddenly realized that he did not have a cauldron for concoction purposes. </p>
  <p>Wasting no time, Qing Shui proceeded to the Firecloud Blacksmith store again. Truth to be told, the reason he went back wasn’t because the Firecloud Blacksmith store was a store with products superior to others. It was obviously because of the lovely store assistant.</p>
  <p>As he entered, the middle-aged man passionately called out, “Young Master, what do you need? Our store possess sufficient amounts of all kinds of weaponry. Even if there’s something that you want that we don’t have, we would be able to manufacture it for you if you give us three days of time.”</p>
  <p>“Oh, Uncle, does your store sell concoction cauldrons that are used by alchemists?” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
  <p>“Yup, yup we do. You can take a look, we store them inside the eastern room. They cost 10 taels of silver for one.” The middle-aged uncle pointed to a room as he replied with smiles on his face.</p>
  <p>Alchemist, this was a profession that burned money, so usually, only rich clans would be able to afford grooming an Alchemist. Qing Shui exclaimed in his heart, “F*ck, this lousy quality cauldron actually cost 10 taels of silver. Even with talent, without money, one would never be able to amount to anything.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui took a look at the cauldrons manufactured from common materials. For 10 taels of silver was indeed tough to buy a good quality cauldron, as he finally selected one, before leaving.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui didn’t return to the Qing Clan’s Medical Store. He went to a remote location before entering into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He focused on the memories unlocked in his sea of consciousness, as he mixed the various herbs together. The 4-leaf Flower as well as Fleece Flower Root were separated into portions. The reason why Qing Shui selected the Fleece Flower Root was because its properties consisted of detoxifying poison, improving blood circulation, restore Qi as well as smoothing out the dead air within the inner organs. It was able to increase the immunity of the body against poisonous substances.</p>
  <p>Once everything was prepared, Qing Shui used the primordial flames technique to start boiling the mixed herbs within the alchemy cauldron. Much to his surprise, this low-quality cauldron was able to withstand the heat of his primordial flames!</p>
  <p>After a while, Qing Shui increased the intensity of the flames, as the sounds of the water seething got increasingly louder. An hour later, when Qing Shui could no longer sustain his primordial flame technique, only then did he hear the sounds that indicated a successful concoction.</p>
  <p>“Success?” Qing Shui felt incomparably joyful. Usually, if pill concoction was a failure, there would be a mini-explosion of some sort.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s hands trembled as he lifted the lid, only to discover a white layer of cloudy powder at the bottom of the cauldron.</p>
  <p>“What is this?”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was stunned for a moment. He scooped the white cloudy powder out from the cauldron. The quantity was very meager as there was only a pinch worth.</p>
  <p>“Is this 3rd grade medicine?” Qing Shui suspiciously questioned himself. Why is it in a powdered form.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui sunk himself deep inside his sea of consciousness, trying to find hints of what this cloudy powder might be.</p>
  <p>“Ai! Golden Sore Ointment?”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s eyes brightened as he discovered that he had somehow successfully concocted a medicine from his sea of consciousness!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was immensely joyful after his first successful attempt. Immediately, he restarted the whole process, only pausing to recover his Qi before igniting the primordial flames again and again.</p>
  <p>The greater the hope, the bigger the disappointment. All of his later attempts produced nothing but Golden Sore Ointment. </p>
  <p>“How can I concoct the Five Dragon Pellet?” He asked himself as he poured all the cloudy powder into a jade bottle.</p>
  <p>He went into meditation in order to recover the energy spent after he decided to stop for the day, when suddenly, a progress-bar like thing suddenly appeared under the Golden Sore Ointment segment in his sea of consciousness!</p>
  <p>“Experience Bar, 0.5%. 99.5% more experience needed to unlock the next pill on the list, the Small Revitalizing Pellet.” Qing Shui smiled. At last, he had finally embarked onto the path of becoming an Alchemist!</p>

 <p>Qing Shui was immensely joyful after his first successful attempt. Immediately, he restarted the whole process, only pausing to recover his Qi before igniting the primordial flames again and again.</p>
 <p>The greater the hope, the bigger the disappointment. All of his later attempts produced nothing but Golden Sore Ointment. </p>
 <p>“How can I concoct the Five Dragon Pellet?” He asked himself as he poured all the cloudy powder into a jade bottle.</p>
 <p>He went into meditation in order to recover the energy spent after he decided to stop for the day, when suddenly, a progress-bar like thing suddenly appeared under the Golden Sore Ointment segment in his sea of consciousness!</p>
 <p>“Experience Bar, 0.5%. 99.5% more experience needed to unlock the next pill on the list, the Small Revitalizing Pellet.” Qing Shui smiled. At last, he had finally embarked onto the path of becoming an Alchemist!</p>
