 <p><strong>AST 1295 - Return To The Qing Clan, It Is Very Warm At Home</strong></p>
 <p>Everytime Qing Shui thought about this lady, he was unable to describe his own feelings. It was like a slab of piercing-cold ice block, and even if it was warmed up, it wouldn't gain heat.</p>
 <p>After he returned to the manor, Qing Shui only left a letter behind telling them that he had gone out. In his letter, he told them to focus on their cultivation and to take care of themselves. In the room, he prepared to head out for the five continents.</p>
 <p>This was the first time he would use it and he felt very agitated. He entered the Five Elements Divine Flag and then reached out his hand to tap out toward the sole red top.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui's finger tapped on it, his consciousness blurred out for a moment. He knew that the two Five Elements Divine Flags would only require a thought from him to activate the transportation. However, this wasn't possible when one pinpointed the location to be transported to.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, when he regained his consciousness, he was already in a new place.</p>
 <p>Central Continent!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked around, his feelings were indescribable. To be able to reach the five continents in the blink of an eye... How long had he been thinking of returning to the five continents? It was because even if after five years was up, he would only be able to bring the few ladies over and he won't be able to stay on the five continents. However, he could now come to the five continents and take a look at the Qing Clan. In the future, wherever possible, he would be able to come back every month.</p>
 <p>He could use the Five Elements Divine Flag once a month.</p>
 <p>Back then, the place he had set up the flags was around where the Qing Clan was at. Even if there were some discrepancies, it wouldn't be too much. After he looked around and confirmed his directions, he performed the Nine Continents Steps directly.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui set the location to be around Qing Clan on the map in the Five Elements Divine Flag, the map was small, unlike how big the actual Central Continent was. Just a bit of an error would mean that he would be brought very far away.</p>
 <p>Thankfully, the current Nine Continents Steps was still very amazing. After a few uses, he was already very close to the Fair Wind City where the Qing Clan was located in. He called out his Fire Bird and flew toward the Qing Clan's direction.</p>
 <p>This time around, it hasn't been the longest since he had left and it hadn't even been three years. However, it might be due to the distance between the regions they were in that made him felt that the trip had been the longest.</p>
 <p>The Fair Wind City had already appeared before him. Qing Shui was very agitated. He had initially thought that it would be after ten or even 20 years by the time he returned. After all, the Ancient Teleportation Array would only be activated once every five years. And it was basically impossible for Qing Shui to use the Ancient Teleportation Array to return for five years before heading back.</p>
 <p>He hadn't expected that the lady from the Putuo Mountain had the Five Elements Divine Flag. This thing was beyond precious for Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>He saw it, Qing Shui saw the Qing Clan. The Fair Wind City seemed to be even more prosperous than before. There weren't many people in the five continents who could pose a threat to the Qing Clan. The Buddha Sect won't do anything, nor would the Demon Gate. Moreover, the Qing Clan did have some powerful cultivators. The few ladies' abilities were considered top-notch in the five continents and it had been close to three years. Qing Shui had left behind quite a lot of medicinal herbs and stuff behind back then. Right now, their cultivation should have been brought up to another level.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, the Qing Clan's entrance appeared before him. Qing Shui felt very agitated. There were no guards at the entrance, but she saw that a beautiful little lass was walking out. She was about four to five years old and was wearing a pink one-piece dress. Her hair was combed into many little plaits and she appeared to be very adorable.</p>
 <p>Although it had been close to three years since they had met, and she had grown by quite a bit, Qing Shui could tell that this was Qing Yun, the daughter he and Yun Duan had.</p>
 <p>When the lass saw Qing Shui, she was clearly stunned. Her big eyes which were like crystals seemed to have a hint of confusion in them as she looked at Qing Shui. After all, she wasn't able to remember much stuff back then. Or maybe, she could still remember a little bit, but right now, she shouldn't be able to recognize Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui made his smile even more endearing, but the lass took a step back and asked, "Who are you? Why have you come to my home?"</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui maintained a bright smile, he felt dejected inside. It was because he hadn't been a good father. Just as Qing Shui was about to say something, a voice rang out.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui!" A surprised voice rang out. It sounded a little hoarse, but it was seductive yet graceful.</p>
 <p>It was very pleasant.</p>
 <p>Yun Duan walked out. Although she had given birth to a daughter, she hadn't changed. It was just that there was now an additional poised aura added to her charms. She had a very beautiful face and her exquisite features had a poised and dignified aura to them. The aura she exuded wouldn't make one felt that she was cold but she was still able to be indifferent and keep others at bay. However, when she saw Qing Shui, she wore a happy smile.</p>
 <p>Her beautiful curves would make one crazy. She was well-embodied yet didn't appear to be plump. Each and every part of her body exuded a crazy seductive power. This was especially so for her beautiful, intelligent looking, and graceful eyes which were lethally seductive.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Yun Duan and felt extremely happy as well. He quickly walked over while Yun Duan pounced into his arms, embracing him tightly.</p>
 <p>"The lass is around. Don't be neglecting her." Qing Shui gave her a tight hug and then quickly said.</p>
 <p>Yun Duan quickly let go of Qing Shui and bent down to pick up Qing Yun. "Lass, haven't you been pestering to look for your father? He's your father, quick, call him."</p>
 <p>The lass looked at Qing Shui curiously. She should have some impression of him, but she pouted and said, "Mother, don't lie to me."</p>
 <p>Yun Duan pressed her hand against her own forehead, "Lass, haven't you seen your father's portrait before? Go on, is it because you have some conditions? You're such a sneaky one."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. That was right, the lass' gaze earlier clearly showed that she had recognized him. After all, there was his portrait at home as well. By right, it was impossible for her to not recognize him.</p>
 <p>Now that he heard from Yun Duan's words that the lass actually wanted something, Qing Shui said happily and said, "Yun`er, go ahead and tell me. I'll give you whatever you want."</p>
 <p>"Really?" Qing Yun blinked her big crystal-like eyes and said happily.</p>
 <p>"Of course!" She was just a four to five-years old child. No matter what she ask for, he would be able to grant her wish.</p>
 <p>"I want you to be together with my mother." The lass blinked her big eyes and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gave it a lot of thought and felt that she would want a lot of stuff. However, the only thing which didn't occur to him was this.</p>
 <p>"Yun`er, change one. Father is busy. Why would you request for this?" Yun Duan hugged Qing Yun tightly and asked, puzzled.</p>
 <p>"Mother often calls out for father in your dreams and says that you miss him." Qing Yun giggled and replied.</p>
 <p>Yun Duan blushed and pinched Qing Yun's nose as she looked at Qing Shui, embarrassed.</p>
 <p>This time around, Qing Shui managed to hug the little lass. He took Yun Duan's hand with his other hand and walked toward the Qing Clan.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, how did you manage to come back? I thought you will take many years before you'll be able to come back?" Yun Duan knew this very clearly, and thus she was elated to see Qing Shui back. She tightened her grip of Qing Shui's hand.</p>
 <p>"Isn't it because that I miss you all that the heaven has given me something. If all is successful, I'll be able to come back and stay for a few days every month." Qing Shui felt agitated on the thought of the Five Elements Divine Flag. Even that lady was having a clearer impression in Qing Shui's mind. He was very thankful toward her.</p>
 <p>"Really?" When Yun Duan heard what Qing Shui said, her beautiful eyes shone as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Since when has your husband lied to you?"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Yun Duan walked into the Qing Clan. Very soon, the other members of the Qing Clan all got news that Qing Shui had returned. Almost everyone who was home came out, the excitement they felt was indescribable.</p>
 <p>"Father!"</p>
 <p>"Brother Shui!"</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui!"</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at all the familiar faces, feeling overwhelmed with emotions. He gently put Qing Yun down and walked up to Qing Yi and gave her a hug.</p>
 <p>"Mother, have you been well?"</p>
 <p>Qing Yi smiled and pat Qing Shui on the head, "Mother is fine. How have you been? Has it been hard?"</p>
 <p>"After seeing mother and my wives, I don't feel that it's hard anymore." Qing Shui smiled happily and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then greeted his grandfather and the rest, followed by his wives, cousins, and then the children. Qing Zun and Qing Yin have grown up. The children in this world went through puberty early and children over ten-years old would already seem to be quite big.</p>
 <p>"Father!"</p>
 <p>"Father!"</p>
 <p>Both Qing Zun and Qing Yin called out happily as they took Qing Shui's hands.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Zun and Qing Yin were twins, they didn't look alike. Qing Zun looked a little like Qing Shui while Qing Yin looked more like Canghai Mingyue. Qing Yin's height had already reached Qing Shui's heart level and appeared very delicate and magnanimous.</p>
 <p>Qing Zun and Qing Yin were both righteous-looking people, like those members of aristocratic clans. However, they appeared slightly more righteous than them.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hugged both Qing Zun and Qing Yin. Qing Zun felt a little shy since he was already a big boy now, while Qing Yin, on the contrary, wrapped her hands around Qing Shui's neck endearingly.</p>
 <p>After he put down Qing Zun and Qing Yin, Qing Shui looked toward Qing Ming. Having not met him for several years, Qing Shui felt that this boy was surprisingly mature with a devilish hint. Along with Qin Zun, they were clearly at the opposite sides of two extremes.</p>
 <p>"Do you have anything against me?" When Qing Shui saw Qing Ming, he felt more relaxed.</p>
 <p>The others also looked at this father and son pair amusingly.</p>
 <p>"How would I dare? You're my father." Qing Ming looked at Qing Shui and said with a smile. However, Qing Shui felt that his smile was a little fake.</p>
 <p>"You rascal. Are you asking for a beating? How dare you talk like this to your father?" Mingyue Gelou felt helpless as well. This child would only listen to Qing Yi and no one else. He tended to do things that would catch others by surprise, but wouldn't do any evil acts that would bring great harm to others. However, he often fought with the kids from the other clans. For this, he had often received a beating from Mingyue Gelou.</p>
 <p>"Mother, even if you like Father a lot, I'm the child you've given birth to. You can't always be beating me up." Qing Ming looked at Mingyue Gelou, aggrieved.</p>
 <p>Mingyue Gelou's face turned flushed red as she twisted his ears both in anger and in amusement.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui appeared even happier now. This kid was different, but Qing Shui felt that his physique was very unique. Qing Shui had sensed that Qing Ming had a physique which had a rare wind attribute.</p>
 <p>Wind came under the wood attribute in the five elements. It seemed that Qing Ming was suited to become an assassin, to take the path of independent killing. Qing Shui gave it a lot of thought. Of course, he would also have to take Qing Ming's views into consideration.</p>
 <p>"Why, are you feeling that your mother treats me well but not you?" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, what are you talking about?" Mingyue Gelou looked at these two people who were her closest kin, not knowing what to say.</p>
 <p>"No. Mother treats me extremely well."</p>
 <p>"Really?" Qing Shui asked.</p>
 <p>"Of course. I'm her son, of course she'll treat me well." Qing Ming continued to speak in a matter of fact tone.</p>
 <p>"Rascal, let's have a man-to-man talk later."</p>
 <p>It was only after that did Qing Shui took Qing Yan's hand. Qing Yan was a bit of an introvert, however, when she saw Qing Shui, she was very happy. After all, she recognized Qing Shui and the moment Qing Shui squatted down, she pounced on him and wrapped her hands around his neck.</p>
