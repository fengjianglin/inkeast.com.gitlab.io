 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline"><strong>AST 2333 - Neutralizing Poison, Sky Fox Race</strong></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, the woman was feeling very emotional, but her attention was soon attracted by the venom in that bowl in front of her. Other than having a foul stench, it was pitch-black like ink or dripping oil. However, it was thicker and had a sticky consistency.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was very confident in his capabilities. With his medical skills in addition to the Nature Energy, as well as his Force of Rebirth, he had the confidence that he would be able to cure this person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the beginning, the woman felt that her face had a very cool sensation, but soon, she felt a hint of heat. She didn't notice it at the start, but as the intensity of the heat became increasingly higher, she started to realize that it wasn't a delusion. It was because she felt as if she was being scorched by fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For someone her caliber, an ordinary fire wouldn't be capable of making her feel hot at all. Very soon, it didn't just feel hot but also very painful, and yet the woman didn't make a sound. This pain was really nothing to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This pain was due to Qing Shui channeling the Area Dominance and Nature Energy, all in order to purify the poisoned area of her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without realizing it, the woman’s entire body gradually relaxed, and she somehow felt as if she had gotten stronger. Her face had never felt so comfortable before. In the past, it had always felt a little numb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the contrary, Qing Shui's face was covered in sweat. He drew back the needles and didn't realize that his sweat was dripping down. They landed on the woman's hand and despite him not noticing it, the woman did. She raised her head, and her heart throbbed when she saw Qing Shui being very seriously taking out the needles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Go ahead and feel it. Are there any more venom remaining?" Qing Shui said happily after he kept all of the needles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman felt as if she was dreaming. This poison had always been a sharp sword that hung over her head all this while. Under such a situation, who would be able to live a relaxed life?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She sensed it and realized that she had never felt so relaxed before. She had regained the sense of touch on her face like how it had been in the past. However, she knew that those scars were still there. Therefore, she decided to not look at her reflection in the mirror and instead said to Qing Shui, "Thank you very much!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I asked for your help previously, and you didn't say much back then either. There's no need to stand on ceremony. You should rest today after I applied some medicine for you. From tomorrow onwards, I'll start to help you remove the scars, but it'll hurt a little. I'll need to shave off those scars."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Is that really possible?" the woman was surprised again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yes. The new skin that grows out will be exactly the same as it was before," Qing Shui said seriously. The reason he dared to do this was because he had a powerful regenerative touch as well as some medicinal pills. Otherwise, this wouldn't have been possible. Even medicinal pills that could bring a person back to life or regrow the flesh might not have been able to allow her to regain her previous appearance. After all, the affected area was her face, and there were many small details. In this aspect, his Bones of the Living Dead was a very powerful regenerative ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm not afraid of pain. That little pain won't mean much." A strong hope rose up in the woman's heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui applied some medicine on her face just in case of any remnant venom left behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After applying the medicine, Qing Shui took the two bowls of poison. The woman stopped Qing Shui and said that she would do it herself, but Qing Shui smiled and said, "I'll ask for these two bowls of poison. I'll return it to your martial brother in the future."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman sighed. "Suit yourself."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui didn't go back but stayed in the Divine Rain Sect. After all, the treatment would take several days. During the treatment, she would need to recover and have the medicine reapplied every few days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Divine Rain Sect's sect leader had yet to come out from his seclusion, and Qing Shui merely asked about him casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yuchi Ding came to look for Qing Shui to have a drink together. Their relationship was more of a blossoming friendship after an exchange of blows. Qing Shui had gotten quite a lot of benefits from Yuchi Ding. That Divine Battle Puppet was definitely a heaven-defying treasure. Oh, there was also that rod that looked just like a whip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui had put it aside after taking a quick look at it back then. He hadn’t felt the need to take a second look. It was because after getting the Divine Battle Puppet, Qing Shui didn't care much about the whip. He realized that he had yet to see what kind of item it was and had forgotten about it during this period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After drinking some wine and eating some food with Yuchi Ding, Qing Shui returned to his accommodation, a bamboo manor not far away. He then entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having recalled that whip, Qing Shui entered to take a closer look at it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This whip was about two meters in length. It looked like a staff but possessing the characteristic of a rubber band, being slightly softer. However, it had about one foot of its length that was real solid. Therefore, it was really a whip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly Vision Technique!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui still needed to rely on the Heavenly Vision Technique after all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">God Striking Whip!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the sight of these words, Qing Shui was stunned. This name was too domineering. This place was different from Qing Shui's previous world. Therefore, some of the existences in his previous world didn't have any relation with this place, and this whip wouldn't be able to suggest anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui quickly looked to see what it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">God Striking Whip</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A divine whip from the ancient times. Legend has it that it could strike down gods, but it is now damaged and its prowess isn't comparable to how it has been before. However, it is still quite a good divine whip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Requires owner recognition. After owner recognition, it can recover by 20%.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Additional passive ability--God Striking Power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">God Striking Power: Increases the ability to ignore defensive abilities and attacking prowess of the opponents by 30%. With each attack, it has 30% chance of increasing attacking prowess by one fold, 10% chance of increasing attacking prowess by two folds, and 3% chance of increasing attacking prowess by three folds. It can ignore 20% of the target's damage reduction abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Method for owner recognition: Insert three drops of blood essence and temper with the origin divine power for one week.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui felt very agitated. It was yet another item from the ancient era and was a domineering one at that. However, it was also damaged. There was no need to talk about how domineering it had been. &nbsp;As expected of its name of being able to strike down gods. This weapon would give the user a great exhilaration when used to strike the opponent. The chances, especially the 30% chance of a one-fold increment to the attacking prowess was too great. Even the 3% chance mentioned at the end wasn't low either. After all, when two experts on the same level exchanged blows, the speed of the battle would be very fast. They could instantly strike out many attacks, and in such moments, chances played a huge role. If the user of this whip were to hit the lucky chance of damage multiplier, the battle would turn into a slaughter instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, when Qing Shui read to the very end, the few words on it made him speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only to be used by the Sky Fox race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just these few words alone made Qing Shui toss this whip into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. It was completely useless. In usual circumstances, even if he didn't use this whip, he could give it to someone around him. Now it was hopeless since it could only be used by the Sky Fox race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only someone from the Sky Fox race could go through the owner recognition process. Otherwise, the user wouldn't be able to enjoy those abilities, and he/she wouldn't be able to unleash its true prowess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sky Fox race... Qing Shui had heard of them before. It was said that there were people from the Sky Fox race in the Upper Three Regions. The Sky Fox race was a great clan in the nine continents, yet their numbers weren't great. However, each and every one of them was a powerful fighter, especially when they had reached the level of a Nine-Tailed Sky Fox. Their figures would be able to easily cover up the sky and the sun, and they would have powerful Heavenly Techniques.&nbsp;</span></p>
