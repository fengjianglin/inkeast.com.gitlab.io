 <p><strong>AST 1355 - Is it curable? Young Lass</strong></p>
 <p>How many years had it been? He also didn’t know how he managed to live through these years. He was already insensitive to it, and yet at the same time, he also felt that it was a bit hard to accept it. He quickly stood up. “Old Ancestor, forget it. No one can cure me.”</p>
 <p>Tianhe Renmo’s voice was very rough. There was also a kind of bitterness in it. Even he himself had already lost count of how many times this happened. There had already been at least 8,000 to 10,000 doctors and alchemists who came to treat him. On some occasions, there would even be multiple people who visited him in a day.</p>
 <p>“As long as there is the slightest hope left, you shouldn’t give up. Are you willing to take things as it is now? Don’t you want to get her back?” The old man said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“I do. If it was the me in the past, I would definitely be able to take him down easily. But now, he could blow me away with just one breath of his.” Tianhe Renmo said.</p>
 <p>Which men would be willing to admit defeat? It was only when they were forced to a corner and could no longer do anything would they decide to accept a compromise. For a man like Tianhe Renmo, it was more difficult to make him say these kinds of words than killing him. Yet, he had still spoken it out. Regardless of how tough one may be, he would still have his fragile side.</p>
 <p>“You have already been trying to treat it for so many times, will you mind trying it for a few more times? These are the two Miraculous Physicians from the Imperial Hall. You have also eaten things from the Imperial Hall before.” The old man was trying to talk him around.</p>
 <p>“I will listen to everything the Old Ancestor said. I am already so old and yet I have to make you worry all the time.” Tianhe Renmo said bitterly.</p>
 <p>“Foolish child, do you know why I give you the name Renmo?” The old man also let out a sigh and asked an irrelevant question.</p>
 <p>“No.” Tianhe Renmo shook his head.</p>
 <p>“You have the pure heart of a demon, your life is destined to have one grave danger in it. The demons are a miraculous existence, they possessed miraculous magic but at the same time, the demons are also murderers. Renmo, I am hoping for you to become someone who can take notice of your own state of heart from time to time. I also hope that you can miraculously make it through the calamity that you have to face in your life.” The old man was also a bit upset. If Tianhe Renmo had been well and healthy, the Tianhe Clan would definitely have been able to make another step forward, so much that even the clans from the Continent’s City wouldn’t dare to provoke the Tianhe Clan.</p>
 <p>“Sorry for the trouble, Miraculous Physicians.” Tianhe Renmo said to Qing Shui and Yuan Su.</p>
 <p>“Don’t mention it. Once you are cured, we will be rewarded too.” Qing Shui said with a smile</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that Tianhe Renmo actually didn’t carry too much hope. Both Qing Shui and Yuan Su’s age were too young. Besides, no one knew about his condition better than Tianhe Renmo himself. His meridians had been cut off and his Dantian was very badly damaged. He was already considered to be extremely lucky that he managed to barely stay alive.</p>
 <p>“That’s something that should be done!” The old man said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Tianhe Renmo was also smiling. Despite this, he continued to remain silent. The only thing different now was that his smile looked a lot more real than before.</p>
 <p>The group made their way to the living room. With each other being on both sides of the tea table, Qing Shui took Tianhe Renmo’s pulse. To other people, they might be unable to do it, but to Qing Shui, it was still something which he could do without any problem. It was just that the time needed for this treatment would be a bit longer.</p>
 <p>“Miraculous Physician Qing, how is it?”</p>
 <p>Seeing Qing Shui retrieved his hands, the old man opened his mouth and asked. Even though his voice sounded really calm, when one tried to listen to it carefully, they would be able to tell that he was a bit concerned about it.</p>
 <p>“It can be cured, but……”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui said, his brows knitted.</p>
 <p>“But?”</p>
 <p>“It’s just that it might take quite a bit of time to do it.” Qing Shui said as he looked at the old man.</p>
 <p>“Take a bit of time? How long will that be? Are you purposely trying to drag it on despite knowing that it isn’t treatable? There have been a few doctors who did the same thing before you.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, a tall and sturdy old man said in an unsatisfied tone.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui calmly moved his sight towards the old man. The old man had round eyes and a nose of a lion. His mouth looked really wide, giving people an impression that he was a dignified old man. When Qing Shui saw his expression, he knew that he wasn't purposely trying to make things difficult for him, he was just trying to judge the matter as it stood.</p>
 <p>“Yanxu, you mustn’t act so rudely.” The old man said and stopped him. After that, he looked at Qing Shui with an apologetic look. “I am sorry for what happened, Miraculous Physician Qing. Please don’t take it to heart.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head. “What the old man said just now was right. It’s very hard to let people believe me without an accurate time. How about this, one month, within one month, I guarantee he will recover. I wonder if this time is acceptable to you?”</p>
 <p>It was very seldom that an old man could act so politely to someone of the junior generations with his identity as a False God Warrior. Even the False God Warrior from the Yehuang Clan had never shown himself before.</p>
 <p>“One month?” The old man said in shock and even the others were extremely surprised.</p>
 <p>“Is it too long? How about 25 days? It cannot be any shorter than that. Any shorter, even I myself won’t feel confident that I can manage it.” Qing Shui knitted his brows and said seriously.</p>
 <p>“No no, isn’t that too short?” Upon hearing what Qing Shui said, the old man responded quickly.</p>
 <p>“Oh, if that’s the case, let’s make it a month then. But I can only help treat his injury here for up to a week. I will have to head back after a week. So, by then, he will need to come to the Imperial Hall for his treatment.” Qing Shui said seriously after he thought for a while.</p>
 <p>“It doesn’t matter where we carry out the treatment. By then, I will head there along with Mo`Er myself.” The old man said kindly. This was the first time he heard someone who was sure that it could be treated in a month. For this kind of injury, one month was something which they could overlook very easily.</p>
 <p>“Since it has been decided, I will help him perform a treatment now. After a while, you guys will know whether it can be cured or not.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The speed at which Qing Shui treated Tianhe Renmo was very fast. Qing Shui helped Tianhe Renmo recovered a bit of his Dantian and some of the nearest meridians within it. He also activated the powerful self-healing ability within Tianhe Renmo’s body. Even though his self-regenerating ability was very powerful, it still needed Qing Shui’s assistance or else, it still wouldn’t be able to function well.</p>
 <p>At the moment when Qing Shui collected back his needles, Tianhe Renmo was surprised. He looked at Qing Shui with astonishment in his eyes. How many years had it been? How many medicinal pills had he eaten? He had even tried the Bones of the Living Dead medicinal pill. Despite all of these, all they did was to turn him into an ordinary person.</p>
 <p>The medicine Bones of the Living Dead was too precious. They wouldn’t look for anyone just to experiment with it. The rumor about people experimenting with it was true. After all, even aristocratic clans wouldn’t have too much of this kind of pills. They might only have one to two of them. Hence, no one would actually experiment on it.</p>
 <p>Tianhe Renmo had the right to use it. Unfortunately, it didn’t help him to recover his meridians and Dantian. It might be that with his lost strength, the medicine also lost its effect and was unable to absorb it completely. If it was the case of a strong warrior losing one leg, recovery might be possible…...</p>
 <p>Or maybe, the quality of the medicinal pills of the Bones of the Living Dead was poor, hence, when a person without cultivation consumed it, it wasn’t able to draw out any effect…</p>
 <p>At the moment when Qing Shui walked out from Tianhe Renmo’s bedroom, everyone else other than Yuan Su all crowded over.</p>
 <p>“Miraculous Physician Qing, how was it?”</p>
 <p>“Is it treatable?”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>For a moment, Qing Shui simply smiled and didn’t say anything.</p>
 <p>“You are truly a Miraculous Physician. Judging by this kind of progression, I assume that I will be well again within a month.” Tianhe Renmo said happily. No one else would feel happier than himself.</p>
 <p>“Alright, alright, this is too great!”</p>
 <p>“This is great. The banquet is ready. Miraculous Physician Qing, I am sorry to have offended you. Please forgive me for it.” Tianhe Yanxu said a bit embarrassingly.</p>
 <p>“It’s nothing. This only means that you are also hoping that I will be able to cure Brother Mo’s injury.”</p>
 <p>Both Qing Shui and the old man were talking to each other while walking. Yuan Su, on the other hand, stood beside Qing Shui. Throughout the entire time, she basically didn’t say anything and only quietly stood beside him.</p>
 <p>The shock which the old man felt in his heart was something which only he himself was aware of. The strength of this doctor was very formidable, as he could control the life and death of a lot of people. So long as his medical expertise was sufficiently powerful, there would be numerous people pursuing him like he was the latest trend in fashion.</p>
 <p>There weren’t actually many people in the banquet. Both Tianhe Yu and Tianhe Hao were also present, they were very happy. Everyone toasted with Qing Shui and even the old man was no exception. He could sense that Qing Shui was very terrifying. He was not in the slightest inferior to Tianhe Renmo when he was in his peak state. He was able to sense an enormous energy within Qing Shui’s body.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, his medical expertise was top-notch. For now, the old man may have been a lot more powerful than Qing Shui, but the old man was aware that it wouldn’t take long before Qing Shui surpassed him. Hence, he could lower down his position in front of him very easily. In fact, merely with Qing Shui’s identity as a Miraculous Physician, he didn’t feel any pressure to do so.</p>
 <p>Naturally, Qing Shui wouldn’t brag about it and also gave face to the old man. By maintaining a good relationship with the Tianhe Clan, it would only benefit him in the future when he traveled to the Continent’s City. Additionally, Qing Shui had managed to overhear something previously. It was likely that Tianhe Renmo had a few grudges with one or more clans within the Continent’s City.</p>
 <p>At night, Qing Shui stayed behind in the Tianhe Clan. The Tianhe Clan had thought that Qing Shui and Yuan Su was husband and wife, and only offered them a courtyard. Actually, there were also a number of buildings in the courtyard, hence, there weren’t many problems with it.</p>
 <p>It was just that at night, Yuan Su was living in the same building as Qing Shui. This place had a living room and two bedrooms, one for each of them. Hence, there really weren’t any problems with it. However, the two still had the memories from the past deep within them, which was why it was a bit awkward to them.</p>
 <p>“I am going to have a nap.” Yuan Su ran back to her room like she was trying to flee at the moment when she finished speaking.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. He shook his head as he went back to his room to enter the realm.</p>
 <p>Now, he spent the majority of his time on cultivating medicines. On his return trip this time, he could constantly use the Origin Returning Pill until he reached peak Martial Emperor at one go. I</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that his own strength as a peak Martial Emperor would at least be worth 500,000 sun. He was confident about it. Or perhaps, it might be even more than that. However, according to the rules across the nine continents, the strength of peak Martial Emperor mustn't exceed 500,000 sun. Rules were rules, but Qing Shui was convinced that there were still exceptions.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, the most heaven-defying existence that he had. This was also the biggest treasure he had in his opinion. If he was to consume two pills every year, even though it could already be considered as very fast, compared to his speed now, it would only be slag. The reason why Qing Shui had managed to reach such great height at such a young age precisely because he had the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Qing Shui felt that he was already almost equal to the other old monsters in existence in terms of age.</p>
 <p>The Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal only consisted of purely time. It didn’t really help grow any experience and there was the only conception. Hence, if the time was really long, the only thing he would feel was that the time was very long. He wouldn’t have the aura belonging to a powerful old-existence, causing people to think that he was an old monster just by looking at him. Hence, strictly speaking, Qing Shui was still really young.</p>
 <p>Refining medicinal pills, cultivating his own body, and strengthening his own foundation, Qing Shui neglected his sleep and forgot about food while doing all of these within the realm. A person who aimed to be successful ought to be able to withstand loneliness and had a great willpower.</p>
 <p>Other than to help Tianhe Renmo by performing acupuncture and giving him some medicinal pills, he also wandered around the nearby places along with Yuan Su. The Tianhe City was huge and was like the Yehuang Country City. Aristocratic clans could be found anywhere. Similarly, aristocratic clans were also the place which was the most capable of nurturing hedonistic sons.</p>
 <p>They only wandered for less than half a day, yet they had already managed to walk a very long distance. However, the encounter with Wan Ku this time made Qing Shui really shocked, or rather, he wasn’t even sure if it was Wan Ku, as the person he met was a woman.</p>
 <p>The woman was very beautiful and sexy, and the way she dressed was very openly provocative. Her short skirt barely covered her well-rounded bum and her breasts were so full that it caused her skin-tight cloth to bulge. Her snow-white, lanky legs were covered by a pair of tall white boots.</p>
