 <p><strong>AST 1062 - Bodhi Tree, Earth Jiao, Bodhi Fruit</strong></p>
 <p>The people in his previous life had a better understanding of the Bodhi Tree. For instance, the Buddha had only become enlightened after sitting under the Bodhi Tree. The Bodhi Tree was also known as the wisdom tree, the enlightening tree, and the awareness tree. In any case, it was indeed a mystical tree. It was even said that the relationship between the Bodhi Tree and Buddha was particularly deep.</p>
 <p>“Are you sure that this is the Bodhi Tree?” Qing Shui looked at Little Fatty suspiciously, not knowing of the effects of this Bodhi Tree in the World of the Nine Continents.</p>
 <p>“I’m certain. Although this Bodhi Tree is still small, it is one of the most precious Bodhi Trees.” The Little Fatty was particularly surprised.</p>
 <p>“What is the use of this Bodhi Tree?” Hai Dongqing asked, her gaze was fixed on the little tree.</p>
 <p>“Legend has it that the Bodhi Tree was bestowed upon by the Buddha a strong power of knowledge, and cultivating under the Bodhi Tree can increase the speed of cultivation of one’s spirit energy and techniques. What is even more praiseworthy is that it can greatly increase one’s probability of comprehending the perfection of those techniques.” The Little Fatty thought about it before saying.</p>
 <p>“That strong?” Qing Shui knew the difficulty of cultivating spirit energy. At the later stages, it was absolutely necessary to cultivate spirit energy. Of course, this required a strong gift in cultivating spirit energy. Body refining was still the more mainstream method, and only a few could master the cultivation of spirit energy.</p>
 <p>The Bodhi Tree is precious, and it is no less than any other sacred object. It is a pity that it is inflexible to new conditions. Thus, it cannot be moved or it will die. Therefore those who are lucky enough to meet this Bodhi Tree will have to stay behind. If not, they have to give it up.”</p>
 <p>The Little Fatty actively replied. After saying that, he added on,“There will definitely be Guardian Beasts near the surroundings of the Bodhi Tree, and they will not be that easy to deal with.”</p>
 <p>“Uncle Fatty, what kind of Guardian Beasts are they? Why have I not seen them before?” Luan Luan asked with great interest.</p>
 <p>“That is something that I’ve only heard of. It seems that the Guardian Beasts of the Bodhi Tree are always the same. According to legend, they are all Earth Jiaos, a type of demonic beast that can be both flying and land-bound. They are much stronger than a regular Jiao and their bodies also contain the Dragon Bloodline,” the Little Fatty laughed.</p>
 <p>“Earth Jiao?” Qing Shui was surprised. Although he had seen a few demonic beasts with the Dragon Bloodline before, he only had some cursory knowledge about the rumoured Dragon Bloodline. The dragon had all sorts of descendents and word was that the dragon was rather lewd. Therefore, there was a possibility in which demonic beasts would have possess the Dragon Bloodline. It was only that such a Dragon Bloodline would be very thin.</p>
 <p>It was said that a python had to reach a certain realm in order to turn into a Jiao. However, that required a long time and a great opportunity would be needed for it to be able to transform into a Flood Dragon.</p>
 <p>Moreover, it was also rumoured that the Flood Dragon had the form of a dragon. A horn similar to that of a dragon would grow from its head. That was why it was also known as a Horned Dragon. Although it was not considered a true dragon, the strength of it was still similarly scary.</p>
 <p>“Little Fatty, are you saying that the Earth Jiao is in the ground?” Qing Shui pointed to the ground while looking at the Little Fatty.</p>
 <p>“It should be, but I’m not sure. However, Brother Qing Shui, be careful. The Earth Jiao is rumoured to be very strong.” Little Fatty warned him nervously.</p>
 <p>“I am aware. I will not fight with it for the time being, at least not today. We’ll run after we get the Bodhi Tree tomorrow.” Qing Shui thought for a moment before having this idea.</p>
 <p>Just in the vicinity of the area, he found a spot to set up a formation for safety purposes. While everyone cultivated, Qing Shui sat there quietly looking at the bright Bodhi Tree. Although they had said that the tree could not be moved, he felt that his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal could keep it alive. If the transplant failed, he could only blame himself for not having any luck.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui stared blankly at the tree, a wave of strong aura stirred in his heart. Fortunately, he was in the formation and was relatively safe. He looked around for the source of the aura and found that it was precisely from the Bodhi Tree.</p>
 <p>Could it be the Earth Jiao?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s interest was aroused and he looked closely at the Bodhi Tree. In that moment, he saw an unforgettable scene. Suddenly, about a hundred meters from the Bodhi Tree, the ground cracked. A huge malevolent head emerged from the depths: a Jiao head, with its horn similar to that of a deer…...</p>
 <p>It really was the head of a dragon. Qing Shui had seen this drawing of a dragon head fifty times in his previous life, and this dragon head was brown in colour. The brownness reduced the grandeur of the head, but made it become much more sinister.</p>
 <p>Its head was huge and about the size of a house. Within a moment of using its technique, its large brown body had churned out over fifty meters. However, this still wasn’t its full length. It continued to spiral up towards the sky incessantly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stared blankly as the leviathan completely rose up into the sky. Its thick and strong body was about two hundred meters long and as it rolled out, it scattered a boundless killing intent, making the Heaven and Earth appear gloomy.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had seen many things and been through many trials, but the scene of this leviathan bursting out of the ground still absolutely shocked him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could not sense the exact strength of the Earth Jiao, but he knew that he was not strong enough to deal with it. This made Qing Shui afraid about the strength that strong demonic beasts in the Five Continents could possess.</p>
 <p>Only when the Earth Jiao disappeared did Qing Shui let out a sigh and turn back to see the others laughing and shaking their heads.</p>
 <p>They had all seen the frightening scene. Fortunately they were in the formation. Otherwise, if the Earth Jiao had seen them, something terrible would have resulted. He had used up the Nine Continents Steps effect and if they were to run, they would not have anywhere to go.</p>
 <p>“Little Fatty, if this Earth Jiao runs to a populated city, wouldn’t it be a huge catastrophe?” Qing Shui asked.</p>
 <p>“You don’t have to worry about this. The Earth Jiao is unable to leave these ten million miles of ice and snow.” the Little Fatty said very seriously.</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Qing Shui was relieved. In this case, he did not need to care if it was dead or alive. There was still a chance he could take the Bodhi Tree and run away.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, are you sure you want to kill the Earth Jiao and take away the Bodhi Tree?” Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui and said with surprise.</p>
 <p>“Jiange is still the best. You think highly of your man, I like it. However, I am thinking of just taking the Bodhi Tree away, and not killing the Earth Jiao. I feel that I am weak compared to it.” Qing Shui held Yiye Jiange’s hands in his and said happily.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know what to say about you……” Yiye Jiange laughed as she shook her head.</p>
 <p>“Rumours are that the Bodhi Tree can bear Bodhi Fruits, but there are no regular yearly pattern to the sprouting. Furthermore, the odds of it bearing fruit are rare.” The Little Fatty said while looking at the short Bodhi Tree.</p>
 <p>“Oh, what is the use of a Bodhi Fruit?” Qing Shui had never thought that this type of tree could occasionally bear an unknown number of fruits. This made Qing Shui particularly curious.</p>
 <p>“The Bodhi Fruit is also known as a Wisdom Fruit. A fool that consumed it would become wise. It was said that it could increase spirit energy as well as clear the meridians of the mind. Thus, it was considered a fairly precious fruit not commonly seen in the Main Continent,” the Little Fatty said yearningly as he mentioned the Bodhi Fruit. Could it be that he needed it?</p>
 <p>“Little Fatty, is it possible for this Bodhi Tree to bear a Bodhi Fruit?”</p>
