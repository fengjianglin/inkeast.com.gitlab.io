 <p><strong>AST 750 - Kill, A Little Interlude</strong></p>
 <p>The next day, the party gained a beautiful girl. Qing Shui introduced her to Cang Wuya and the others, and she introduced herself as Ye Yan. Although a few of them didn’t understand why Qing Shui brought a girl back, they still had a friendly conversation with her. They even asked her a lot of questions.</p>
 <p>Perhaps it was because Cang Wuya had a benevolent appearance, the girl seemed to especially trust him. The smile on her face increased so much that Qing Shui could tell the girl seemed to be relieved.</p>
 <p>“Grandpa Cang, is the Greencloud Continent very far from here? Are there many fun places there?” The girl spoke with Cang Wuya during the entire journey, asking all kinds of questions.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui only smiled quietly. This girl seemed to be very quick-witted. From the conversation, he gathered that she had been living here for two years all alone by herself. In the beginning, she still had some money and even sold some jewelry to support her living for a period of time. A while after that, her life gradually declined to the current situation.</p>
 <p>She didn’t explain why her situation had turned out like this. Qing Shui and the rest didn’t probe her for an explanation either. Since they also didn’t know where to go for the time being, they figured they might as well send her home.</p>
 <p>“Grandpa Cang, I have deceived you all. Please leave me here, or else it’ll be impossible for you to escape as well.” The girl suddenly spoke up shortly after they took off on the Fire Bird.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. This girl was indeed a kind one, so she definitely wouldn’t bring them all in harm’s way.</p>
 <p>“Girl, we knew you had stories that you didn’t want to tell. We didn’t force you either, but can you please tell us now? If it’s within our capabilities, we will definitely lend you a hand,” Cang Wuya laughed serenely.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had already told them what happened between him and Ye Yan. Cang Wuya was wise for his age, but old people tended to be softhearted. Although he knew it was going to be troublesome, he still wanted to see if he could do anything to help.</p>
 <p>“I was brought here by force. It’s been two years and I am unable to return because they wouldn’t allow me to. I managed to escape, but they couldn’t find me even after they sealed off every route. If we keep going, they’ll definitely find us. That will get you into trouble too. You are all good people, so you should just leave me here now and go.” Ye Yan gave them a brief explanation. There was a deep display of helplessness and struggles in her words.</p>
 <p>Although her explanation was simple, Qing Shui still caught on to some useful information. At least he had a rough idea on the girl’s situation now. She was obviously caught in the middle of a power struggle.</p>
 <p>“Can you tell us what you know? Maybe we really can help you out.” Qing Shui offered after thinking for awhile. He really didn’t want to get involved in troubles again, but his heart turned soft when he saw how she had no one to rely on, just like how he was back then.</p>
 <p>Ye Yan nodded when she saw the sincere look on Qing Shui’s face, “I am not from Wolf Fang City. I lied earlier because I was afraid that you would be one of them. I am from the Ye Clan of Southern Sea City. My elder sister is in charge of the Ye Clan as of now. Some people among the clan wish to overthrow my sister, but none of them can rival her. So they joined forces with the Wu Clan of Deep Sea City to coerce big sister by forcefully taking me away. They took me to Wolf Fang City, but I was lucky. In their carelessness, I sneaked into a truck and came all the way to Tianyuan City. They already know I am here, but I am small and have been keeping a low profile. I didn’t even dare ride on any rented beast carriages. So just like this, I’ve been trapped here for two years.”</p>
 <p>The Ye Clan of Southern Sea City, the Wu Clan of Deep Sea City, the Wolf Fang City and the Tianyuan City. It seemed like this Tianyuan City belonged to the Wolf Fang City, but this Tianyuan City was at the northernmost part of the Southern Viewing Continent. Needless to guess, Qing Shui was pretty sure that the Southern Sea City would be around the southernmost part.</p>
 <p>For a girl who wasn’t actively engrossed in cultivation, the travel distance of an entire continent was indeed not a small one. On top of that, there were people trying to stop her. However, Qing Shui wasn’t too worried now because their strength would definitely not surpass the Ye Clan. Otherwise they wouldn’t resort to such despicable methods.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, they came all the way here. These people of Wu Clan were very far away from their old nest, so eliminating them here would definitely not be any problem. As long as Ye Yan returned to the Ye Clan, that Wu Clan would definitely be in trouble.</p>
 <p>“Is the Wu Clan very powerful?” Qing Shui asked with a smile. Qing Shui was relieved. It seemed like this wasn’t too much of a problem. Perhaps helping this girl might end up benefiting him.</p>
 <p>“I’m not too sure about this, but they seem to be afraid of big sister,” the girl answered after thinking for awhile.</p>
 <p>“Then, is your sister very strong?” Qing Shui continued asking the girl.</p>
 <p>“Yes, my big sister is very strong, and others think so too. She is also very famous in the Southern Sea Country,” Ye Yan said after thinking.</p>
 <p>“Do you know who Tantai Xianzi is?” Qing Shui couldn’t think of anyone else off the top of his head for comparison.</p>
 <p>“The Tantai Aristocratic Clan. There’s no one who doesn’t know who Tantai Xianzi is. At least for the southern part of Southern Viewing Continent, most people know who she is. Legend says that she has the physique of a celestial, and possess a beauty comparable to that of an immortal,” Ye Yan chuckled at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“So compared to your big sister, who is stronger?” Qing Shui wondered.</p>
 <p>“The Ye Clan cannot be compared to the Tantai Clan. I have never met Tantai Xianzi. Though in my heart, my big sister is the most beautiful, wonderful and powerful person,” Ye Yan said with a broad smile.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui laughed too, “Uncle will bring you back to the Southern Sea City. I shall slay whoever stands in our way. When we arrive to the Southern Sea City, you have to tell your big sister good things about us so she can put us under her protection.”</p>
 <p>Ye Yan was in a shock because these people were still willing to help her despite knowing the truth. She couldn’t believe the whole thing, since people would’ve cast her away by now under normal circumstances.</p>
 <p>Her eyes quickly reddened as she stared at Qing Shui blankly. She forgot what she wanted to say and tears started to roll from her eyes.</p>
 <p>“Why are you crying again? We’re bringing you home to see your big sister. Don’t you miss her?” Qing Shui reached out to ruffle her little head.</p>
 <p>How could she not miss her big sister? The pain of missing her every day was so terrible that she’d rather die. She had been living in the torment of wanting to see her sister so badly that she wished that she was by her side every single day.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, uncle,” Ye Yan said while tugging on Qing Shui’s sleeve. Her grip on his sleeve was very tight, as if fearing that he would run away.</p>
 <p>They were about to reach the Tianyuan City’s gates. Although Flying mounts were not restricted by the city’s gates, it seemed like two smaller sized flying beasts had quickly soared into the sky.</p>
 <p>Ironback Azure Hawks!</p>
 <p>“Oh no, Uncle! Those people on the two Ironback Azure Hawks are from the Wu Clan. What do we do now?” Ye Yan was as anxious as an ant on a hot frying pan. Her face paled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was going to jokingly tell her that he’d give her up as exchange for money, but he changed his mind. He pat the hand that was gripping on his sleeve instead, “Don’t be afraid. With Uncle around, no one can take you away.”</p>
 <p>It was Qing Shui’s first time being called uncle. For his age, it wasn’t exactly incorrect for him to be addressed as uncle. In any case, he was already calling himself one.</p>
 <p>Four middle-aged men stood on the two Ironback Azure Hawks. A smile broke across their faces as soon as they saw Ye Yan, but it was quickly replaced by a frown when they realized that there were others riding on the back of that divine and gigantic Fire Bird.</p>
 <p>“Sirs, please hold!” One of the middle-aged men said politely.</p>
 <p>The other Ironback Azure Hawk left with lightning speed instead.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui calmly looked at the remaining two men, “You’re from the Wu Clan, right? I’m assuming your comrades went off to get reinforcements?”</p>
 <p>The two men weren’t too surprised either. After all, Ye Yan was with them and she knew they were from the Wu Clan. So they quickly laughed along. “We are from the Wu Clan of the Deep Sea City. Sir, you are…?”</p>
 <p>“You don’t have to know who we are. Why are you standing in our way? You think I am easy to be picked on?” Qing Shui laughed playfully.</p>
 <p>“Oh, not at all. Good sir, I am just wondering about your relation with that little miss,” The man replied humbly, knowing very well that one should stay humble when trapped in an inferior situation.</p>
 <p>“Why? Do you guys have any intentions towards my niece?” Qing Shui suddenly raised his voice.</p>
 <p>“She’s not your niece.” Just then, a rough voice thundered from a distance. A gigantic Scarlet Centipede flew over here with a tall, strong and healthy-looking elderly man standing on its back.</p>
 <p>The man was fully dressed in silvery-white simple garbs. Despite his old appearance, his sharp aura was not in the least bit dulled. Qing Shui grinned when he saw the elderly man.</p>
 <p>No matter who that elder man was, he only had the strength of a Martial Saint beginner!</p>
 <p>Actually in the World of the Nine Continents, any Martial Saints were well respected, even the weakest ones. Furthermore, Martial Saints weren’t very common. Although, this kind of a Martial Saint wasn’t capable of withstanding even a single blow from Qing Shui now.</p>
 <p>“Are you from the Wu Clan or the Tianyuan City?” Qing Shui gently inquired the elderly man while gradually exerting his pressure at the same time.</p>
 <p>Since he was a newcomer, he didn’t have any intentions of attracting too much attention. So he’d choose to not use violence for solving issues that could be resolved without the use of force.</p>
 <p>“It doesn’t matter if I am from Wu Clan or Tianyuan City. Leave that girl here and I shall let you all go,” the elderly man told Qing Shui firmly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was startled. It seemed like this elderly man didn’t notice anything about Qing Shui. He must have seemed too young. He didn’t even put Cang Wuya and the rest in his eyes.</p>
 <p>As for Fire Bird, there were too many mythical beasts that were gorgeous looking, yet very useless. As soon as he saw Cang Wuya and the rest, he had opted to disregard the Fire Bird as well as Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Screech!</p>
 <p>“Out of my way!” Qing Shui who was too lazy to talk further shouted at the elderly man across him.</p>
 <p>It was his first time meeting such an inexperienced person. Didn’t he sense the aura the Fire Bird was exuding? Or was he just being arrogant?</p>
 <p>“Uncle, this elderly man is from the Cai Clan of the Tianyuan City. They were one of the biggest clans in the Tianyuan City. Maybe they got a great offer from the Wu Clan,” Ye Yan whispered softly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head. The more you didn’t want to provoke something, the smaller the chance you could avoid them. They were at the Southern Viewing Continent. It was no big deal if they murdered someone, since the foundation of their clan wasn’t set up here.</p>
 <p>“Hmph. You are the first in Tianyuan City who dare to speak to me like this, brat! How reckless of you.” The elderly man brandished the sabre in his hands and immediately lunged towards him.</p>
 <p>His action rendered Qing Shui extremely speechless. Wasn’t he seeking death? Since things had turned out this way, it was unnecessary for Qing Shui to talk any further. As soon as his right hand moved, a light flashed around his sleeve.</p>
 <p>Chi!</p>
 <p>The elderly man, who was a few metres away from Qing Shui instantly stopped dead in his track. A Silver Needle pierced in between his eyebrows. The nine inch long Silver Needle penetrated through the elder’s brain. Both of its ends were visible as it completely pieced though his head.</p>
