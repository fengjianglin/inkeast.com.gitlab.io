  <p><strong>513 - A Glimmer of Hope, Humans Yearn For Familial Affection When They Are At Their Weakest</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“How can this be? Qing Shui, please tell me that everything's a lie.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tears rolled down Shi Qingzhuang’s cheeks as she looked at Qing Shui. The anticipation in her eyes made him feel sad yet a little happy at the same time. He even wished that everything was a lie. But this was the truth. A truth that no one could change.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Don’t be sad. This kind of thing happens to many people every day. Some even die on the spot. I can be considered very lucky.” Qing Shui smiled wryly. He was certainly very lucky to be able to survive after being beaten to such a state by a Martial Saint.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I feel very sad. Seeing you like this made me very sad.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang whispered softly. She was very depressed. Even Qing Shui didn’t expect that she could become like this for him. It seemed like the heart of this icy woman wasn’t as icy as she was on the surface after all.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He gently held up one of her hands. It was a little cold, but Qing Shui felt a trace of warmth in his heart right now. Things had happened and he had already become like this. The people who cared about him were very sad so there was no need for him grumble about anything else. He needed to face reality with an open heart. Only by doing so would he allow them to feel a little better about things.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was all easier said than done. Qing Shui had already been through a few life and death crises. Although he was still reluctant to resign to fate, it had been three months now and he had gradually come to terms with it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I already have no more regrets in my life, although I still have many things that I can’t let go of.” Qing Shui held hands with Shi Qingzhuang and strolled around while looking at the lush medicinal herbs in the medicinal garden.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Not fair, not fair, this is not fair to you…….” Shi Qingzhuang threw herself into Qing Shui’s arms and cried. Her arms were tightly wrapped around his neck.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Wrapping his arms around her smooth waist, he could clearly feel the delicate figure in his arms. But all he could feel right now was warmth. He had no regrets even if his life was to end at this moment. He had already possessed many more things now than in his previous life.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It doesn’t matter if it is unfair. I don’t need it to be fair because I feel very content already!” Qing Shui rubbed his forehead against Shi Qingzhuang’s smooth and fair forehead.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Is there really nothing else we can do?” Shi Qingzhuang murmured.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hehe, I’m afraid not. I should be dead by now. To be able to survive right now is already to defy the heavens. I have already snatched back three years of life from God.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Not five years…..?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled speechlessly. He had accidentally let the truth slip out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why? Why do you still want to deceive me at this point?” Shi Qingzhuang looked at Qing Shui tearfully.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I was afraid that you’d be worried. I am afraid that you’d be sad……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“So you think I won’t be sad if you do this?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Give me a kiss, I’ve missed you,” said a soft and gentle voice.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s qi and blood rushed around his body. It was quite shocking that a cold beauty would utter such words. Staring at her gorgeous cold countenance, Qing Shui immediately leaned forward to wordlessly capture those rosy red lips.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even if he had only three more years left, he did not plan on giving up on Shi Qingzhuang unless she was determined to leave him. Otherwise, he had decided to give all of his remaining time to her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, her words and action earlier had clearly indicated her decision. Qing Shui’s current emotions was a mixture of extreme happiness and some other indescribable feelings. But soon enough, all of these feelings were overwhelmed by lust.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two of them stood amidst the medicinal herbs in the Qing Clan’s medicinal garden. Many medicinal herbs were taller than them. The sun rose from the East, illuminating them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui sucked on those slightly cool red lips and greedily savored the saliva in Shi Qingzhuang’s small mouth. His hands had already found their way to her full and round perky rear before he realized it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They were smooth like satin, soft and very perky. Since it was summer now, both of their clothes were very thin. So thin that Qing Shui could feel her rising body temperature.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His hands groped and kneaded those wonderful globes of flesh, causing Shi Qingzhuang’s delicate body to quiver gently in his arms. However, she didn’t put up any resistance and allowed Qing Shui to do as he wished.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Perhaps, because it had been a long time since Qing Shui had last tasted flesh, he was already sporting a hard-on at the lower half of his body and it was pushing against Shi Qingzhuang. Their pants were getting heavier. Qing Shui was no longer satisfied with just this so he slid his hands into her clothes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As smooth as satin, the wonderful sensation on Qing Shui’s fingers led him to gradually unbutton the front of Shi Qingzhuang’s clothes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, don’t…..”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Before she could even finish her sentence, her lips were once again sealed by Qing Shui’s lips. Qing Shui was now like an ordinary man. It was easy for Shi Qingzhuang to resist him if she wanted to, yet she didn’t do so.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Clothes were shed layer by layer, and Qing Shui’s clothes were removed from his body too. Qing Shui kissed the woman who had her beautiful eyes shut as he caressed her perfect and smooth body.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Embracing Shi Qingzhuang, both of them gradually melted into one!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang held onto Qing Shui tightly. Within an instant, she was emitting soft moans. Qing Shui felt a chill down his spine from that delectable feeling.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just right at this moment, an image appeared in his sea of consciousness!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a scene of a bald man having sex with a bewitching woman!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Unnamed Duo Cultivation Technique?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Before Qing Shui could think of something else, that ‘Yin-Yang Image’ in his mind gradually increased its rotating speed and was emitting a type of golden energy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui kept up with his movements as he sensed the changes in that Yin-Yang Image. That golden ray of light had integrated itself into his bones, meridians as well as his five viscera and six organs.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He realized that the divine energy emitted by that ‘Yin-Yang Image’ was more than usual when he had sex with Shi Qingzhuang, and there was even a difference in its intensity.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The image in his mind kept changing. The postures that he had seen before flashed before his eyes…..</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Was that a Yin-Yang Image or a Taichi Image?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The most fundamental composition of Heavens and Earth, the myriad of living things can be segregated from Yin and Yang. Lone Yin does not lead to birth and sole Yang does not allow growth. When Yin and Yang are integrated, the myriad of living things will resuscitate…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s heart raced. He suddenly had the feeling that this unnamed cultivation art could perhaps be the key to saving his life, or at least restoring him to his former state.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">By the time Qing Shui came back to his senses, Shi Qingzhuang was already limp in his arms while emitting soft, melodious moans. Both of them faced each other, locked in a tight embrace.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Perhaps what Qing Shui saw was a ray of hope. He gently lifted up one of Shi Qingzhuang’s long legs and placed it on the side of his waist as he savored the view of where they were closely connected.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The visual impact made Qing Shui oddly excited. His other hand couldn’t stop fondling her round and full breasts and rear. They were taking their sweet time indulging in the most wonderful and intimate act between a male and female.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qingzhuang!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ngh!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Are you in bliss?” Qing Shui bit on her translucent earlobe.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The only response he got from Shi Qingzhuang was her bite on his chest!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Let me help you get dressed for once!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang looked at Qing Shui’s sincere face and nodded shyly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">………</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Seeing Shi Qingzhuang walking a little oddly, Qing Shui immediately lifted her up in his arms and walked towards the exit of the medicinal garden. The two of them had gone in there for no less than two hours, and on top of that Shi Qingzhuang was carried out by Qing Shui. Anyone would know what had happened in there with just a single glance. They would be guessing that perhaps young people enjoyed making love in the wild…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The moment he came out they were seen by Qing You and the rest. They were grinning slyly as soon as they saw him. Shi Qingzhuang immediately struggled to break free from Qing Shui and fled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, you seem like you are in high spirits!” Qing You smiled mischievously.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled back and didn’t say anything. This kind of thing would be endless if it got started.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A few of them left after chatting with Qing Shui for a brief moment. Qing Shui walked towards the backyard instead. He heart couldn’t sit still at all right now.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">To him, that Unnamed Duo Cultivation Technique was like a live-saving rope to a drowning man. It was still worth a try even if success was not guarantee. But Qing Shui was fretting a little right now.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He needed to find the right woman!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His best options should be the women on the Portraits of Beauty. He felt that this was the only way to know if this would work. However, he couldn’t find anyone. He also didn’t want to hurt others just for the sake of himself, especially the people who loved him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange… Qing Shui wouldn’t even consider it!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Misty Hall’s Palace Mistress and Di Qing were sisters. On top of how the Misty Hall’s Palace Mistress had treated him.... Qing Shui shook his head!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Wenren Wushuang… Qing Shui didn’t even know if this would work out in the first place. Even if it did work out, Qing Shui had intended to take care of her for her whole life. She had also agreed to stay with him. But now, he didn’t even know if he could live longer than three years. So right now he didn’t want to…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He felt very conflicted right now. Three years. Qing Shui smiled bitterly!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Days passed idly. He visited Mingyue Gelou’s bedroom at night. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. Although Qing Shui and Mingyue Gelou were both in the Heavenly Palace, they didn’t have the chance to meet a lot. With this injury, he hadn’t touched her for a few months.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although there were some little changes after a wild night, the effects were still small. The Realm of Violet Jade Immortal’s second layer had opened up after his first time with Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If only such a small effects were yielded now, Qing Shui thought that he’d still inevitably die in three years. But he was clueless on what to do. It had not been easy to do this with Wenren Wushuang.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui remembered about Huoyun Liu-Li and Canghai Mingyue, but he hurriedly shook his head. He was still not sure if they were women from the Portraits of Beauty. On top of that, he had not made any significant progress with them so he didn’t plan on touching them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But when Qing Shui remembered the feelings the two girls had for him, he took tried looking at things from another perspective. His earlier view wavered. If they had true feelings for him, even one day was a wonderful memory.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the end, Qing Shui shook his head and decided to stop thinking about it. He was planning to return to the Qing Residence today. Since he had already reached this point in life, he might as well spend his remaining time happily.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Yi did not stop Qing Shui either. She had allowed him to stay there for a few days before returning. Qing Shui naturally agreed with a smile too.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Qing left the next day, but Di Chen stayed behind. He was going to return to the Qing Residence in the company of Huoyun Liu-Li, Canghai Mingyue, Di Chen and Qing Qing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt conflicted towards Di Chen. He had always felt like he wasn’t worthy of her, and now he felt even awkward in front of her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The five of them returned to the Qing Residence together!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sister Chen! Are you going to stay here for three years?” Qing Shui softly asked Di Chen who was beside him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had been calling her Sister Chen along with the other two girls!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why? Am I unwelcomed?” Di Chen looked at Qing Shui. Her face was partly veiled, but he could still see a faint smile in her incomparably beautiful eyes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“How can that be? I just feel honored. I wonder what am I still worth now for you to stay here.” Qing Shui laughed wryly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You’ve always been thinking for the sake of other people. When will you start thinking for yourself?” Di Chen said softly, as her deep eyes gazed out of the horse carriage.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Some people are worth to sacrificing for. Sometimes you wouldn’t even know why.” Di Chen looked at Qing Shui pensively.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui didn’t understand all. Just like what she had said, sometimes one wouldn’t even know the reason!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Qing Residence was still the same as ever. Most people were either growing crops, hunting or rearing animals. They could be considered a flourishing clan and they lived in a simple and honest life. Qing Shui quite liked this kind of environment.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were two people currently living in the huge Qing Residence - Qing Luo and Lin Zhanhan!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two old men who were playing chess only noticed their arrival when Qing Shui entered the courtyard!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Grandfather!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Lin!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">………..</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Haha, you’re back. Good, good!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Upon Qing Shui’s return, a letter had already been sent to Qing Luo from the Hundred Miles City. The old men were also made aware of Qing Shui’s situation, so that they could make ample mental preparation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Li Zhanhan naturally knew about it, he took a glance at Qing Shui and couldn’t help but to sigh inwardly. Such a gifted genius had to meet his end like this…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After the few girls introduced themselves to Qing Luo and Lin Zhanhan, Qing Shui helped them find some available rooms in the Qing Residence. In the end, he found the courtyard that he had lived in before. It had been only him and his mother living there, but suddenly, now there were five of them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui left the few girls there, he walked towards the living room at the front yard. He was sure that Old Master and Lin Zhanhan must be waiting there for him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He arrived at the front yard shortly. The decoration hadn’t changed much here. It remained the way it was a few years ago. Only the trees had grown a little sturdier and lusher. On top of that, it had also become quieter here now.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He pushed the door to the hall open and saw his grandfather and Lin Zhanhan there. They gave him a small smile when they saw him entering the room.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Come, Qing Shui. Although Grandpa Lin and I are not brothers, we are more than that. We are closer than blood-related brothers. We’ve been looking forward to talking to our grandson today,” Qing Luo chuckled at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A warm feeling welled up inside him. Humans yearn for familial affection when they are at their weakest!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Lin and I know all about your situation. You still have a home and family. It seems like you have returned at a good time,” Qing Luo laughed lightly and pulled Qing Shui into the living room.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The three of them sat down around a wooden tea table. A pot of tea had been prepared and the tea’s fragrance filled the air.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s eyes reddened. He couldn’t get even a word out.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“A man has to be able to take whatever that comes to him. A true man is a man who constantly contends with the Heavens, the Earth and himself, and will never concede to defeat. Every hardship in your life is a test for you,” Lin Zhanhan chuckled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’ve already become like this. What can I still do even if I don’t concede to defeat? I am running out of time.” Qing Shui shook his head with a bitter smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hoho. Are you feeling hopeless because you are only left with three years?” Lin Zhanhan smiled. The words he spoke confused Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Are you curious how I know that?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui nodded!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hoho, because my grandfather had been through a similar situation. But he recovered in the end.” Lin Zhanhan said slowly to Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui couldn’t restrain his excitement. He looked at Lin Zhanhan with his burning eyes, “Grandpa Lin, please enlighten your grandson!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For Lin Zhanhan to tell him this, even when knowing that he only had three more years to live, it seemed like this could be true. What harm was there even if it wasn’t true? He was already out of options right now.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hoho, I am going to tell you even if you didn’t ask. The person who can reverse this state must be someone with a great willpower.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Lin, so there’s still some hope for me?” Qing Shui couldn’t afford to worry too much now. Willpower was something he never lacked. He had been through quite a lot of hardships up to this point in his life.</p>

 <p><strong>513 - A Glimmer of Hope, Humans Yearn For Familial Affection When They Are At Their Weakest</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“How can this be? Qing Shui, please tell me that everything's a lie.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tears rolled down Shi Qingzhuang’s cheeks as she looked at Qing Shui. The anticipation in her eyes made him feel sad yet a little happy at the same time. He even wished that everything was a lie. But this was the truth. A truth that no one could change.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Don’t be sad. This kind of thing happens to many people every day. Some even die on the spot. I can be considered very lucky.” Qing Shui smiled wryly. He was certainly very lucky to be able to survive after being beaten to such a state by a Martial Saint.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I feel very sad. Seeing you like this made me very sad.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang whispered softly. She was very depressed. Even Qing Shui didn’t expect that she could become like this for him. It seemed like the heart of this icy woman wasn’t as icy as she was on the surface after all.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He gently held up one of her hands. It was a little cold, but Qing Shui felt a trace of warmth in his heart right now. Things had happened and he had already become like this. The people who cared about him were very sad so there was no need for him grumble about anything else. He needed to face reality with an open heart. Only by doing so would he allow them to feel a little better about things.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was all easier said than done. Qing Shui had already been through a few life and death crises. Although he was still reluctant to resign to fate, it had been three months now and he had gradually come to terms with it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I already have no more regrets in my life, although I still have many things that I can’t let go of.” Qing Shui held hands with Shi Qingzhuang and strolled around while looking at the lush medicinal herbs in the medicinal garden.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Not fair, not fair, this is not fair to you…….” Shi Qingzhuang threw herself into Qing Shui’s arms and cried. Her arms were tightly wrapped around his neck.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Wrapping his arms around her smooth waist, he could clearly feel the delicate figure in his arms. But all he could feel right now was warmth. He had no regrets even if his life was to end at this moment. He had already possessed many more things now than in his previous life.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It doesn’t matter if it is unfair. I don’t need it to be fair because I feel very content already!” Qing Shui rubbed his forehead against Shi Qingzhuang’s smooth and fair forehead.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Is there really nothing else we can do?” Shi Qingzhuang murmured.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hehe, I’m afraid not. I should be dead by now. To be able to survive right now is already to defy the heavens. I have already snatched back three years of life from God.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Not five years…..?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled speechlessly. He had accidentally let the truth slip out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why? Why do you still want to deceive me at this point?” Shi Qingzhuang looked at Qing Shui tearfully.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I was afraid that you’d be worried. I am afraid that you’d be sad……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“So you think I won’t be sad if you do this?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Give me a kiss, I’ve missed you,” said a soft and gentle voice.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s qi and blood rushed around his body. It was quite shocking that a cold beauty would utter such words. Staring at her gorgeous cold countenance, Qing Shui immediately leaned forward to wordlessly capture those rosy red lips.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even if he had only three more years left, he did not plan on giving up on Shi Qingzhuang unless she was determined to leave him. Otherwise, he had decided to give all of his remaining time to her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, her words and action earlier had clearly indicated her decision. Qing Shui’s current emotions was a mixture of extreme happiness and some other indescribable feelings. But soon enough, all of these feelings were overwhelmed by lust.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The two of them stood amidst the medicinal herbs in the Qing Clan’s medicinal garden. Many medicinal herbs were taller than them. The sun rose from the East, illuminating them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui sucked on those slightly cool red lips and greedily savored the saliva in Shi Qingzhuang’s small mouth. His hands had already found their way to her full and round perky rear before he realized it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They were smooth like satin, soft and very perky. Since it was summer now, both of their clothes were very thin. So thin that Qing Shui could feel her rising body temperature.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His hands groped and kneaded those wonderful globes of flesh, causing Shi Qingzhuang’s delicate body to quiver gently in his arms. However, she didn’t put up any resistance and allowed Qing Shui to do as he wished.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Perhaps, because it had been a long time since Qing Shui had last tasted flesh, he was already sporting a hard-on at the lower half of his body and it was pushing against Shi Qingzhuang. Their pants were getting heavier. Qing Shui was no longer satisfied with just this so he slid his hands into her clothes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As smooth as satin, the wonderful sensation on Qing Shui’s fingers led him to gradually unbutton the front of Shi Qingzhuang’s clothes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, don’t…..”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Before she could even finish her sentence, her lips were once again sealed by Qing Shui’s lips. Qing Shui was now like an ordinary man. It was easy for Shi Qingzhuang to resist him if she wanted to, yet she didn’t do so.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Clothes were shed layer by layer, and Qing Shui’s clothes were removed from his body too. Qing Shui kissed the woman who had her beautiful eyes shut as he caressed her perfect and smooth body.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Embracing Shi Qingzhuang, both of them gradually melted into one!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang held onto Qing Shui tightly. Within an instant, she was emitting soft moans. Qing Shui felt a chill down his spine from that delectable feeling.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just right at this moment, an image appeared in his sea of consciousness!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was a scene of a bald man having sex with a bewitching woman!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Unnamed Duo Cultivation Technique?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Before Qing Shui could think of something else, that ‘Yin-Yang Image’ in his mind gradually increased its rotating speed and was emitting a type of golden energy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui kept up with his movements as he sensed the changes in that Yin-Yang Image. That golden ray of light had integrated itself into his bones, meridians as well as his five viscera and six organs.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He realized that the divine energy emitted by that ‘Yin-Yang Image’ was more than usual when he had sex with Shi Qingzhuang, and there was even a difference in its intensity.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The image in his mind kept changing. The postures that he had seen before flashed before his eyes…..</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Was that a Yin-Yang Image or a Taichi Image?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The most fundamental composition of Heavens and Earth, the myriad of living things can be segregated from Yin and Yang. Lone Yin does not lead to birth and sole Yang does not allow growth. When Yin and Yang are integrated, the myriad of living things will resuscitate…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s heart raced. He suddenly had the feeling that this unnamed cultivation art could perhaps be the key to saving his life, or at least restoring him to his former state.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">By the time Qing Shui came back to his senses, Shi Qingzhuang was already limp in his arms while emitting soft, melodious moans. Both of them faced each other, locked in a tight embrace.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Perhaps what Qing Shui saw was a ray of hope. He gently lifted up one of Shi Qingzhuang’s long legs and placed it on the side of his waist as he savored the view of where they were closely connected.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The visual impact made Qing Shui oddly excited. His other hand couldn’t stop fondling her round and full breasts and rear. They were taking their sweet time indulging in the most wonderful and intimate act between a male and female.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qingzhuang!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ngh!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Are you in bliss?” Qing Shui bit on her translucent earlobe.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The only response he got from Shi Qingzhuang was her bite on his chest!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Let me help you get dressed for once!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang looked at Qing Shui’s sincere face and nodded shyly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">………</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Seeing Shi Qingzhuang walking a little oddly, Qing Shui immediately lifted her up in his arms and walked towards the exit of the medicinal garden. The two of them had gone in there for no less than two hours, and on top of that Shi Qingzhuang was carried out by Qing Shui. Anyone would know what had happened in there with just a single glance. They would be guessing that perhaps young people enjoyed making love in the wild…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The moment he came out they were seen by Qing You and the rest. They were grinning slyly as soon as they saw him. Shi Qingzhuang immediately struggled to break free from Qing Shui and fled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, you seem like you are in high spirits!” Qing You smiled mischievously.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled back and didn’t say anything. This kind of thing would be endless if it got started.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A few of them left after chatting with Qing Shui for a brief moment. Qing Shui walked towards the backyard instead. He heart couldn’t sit still at all right now.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">To him, that Unnamed Duo Cultivation Technique was like a live-saving rope to a drowning man. It was still worth a try even if success was not guarantee. But Qing Shui was fretting a little right now.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He needed to find the right woman!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His best options should be the women on the Portraits of Beauty. He felt that this was the only way to know if this would work. However, he couldn’t find anyone. He also didn’t want to hurt others just for the sake of himself, especially the people who loved him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange… Qing Shui wouldn’t even consider it!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Misty Hall’s Palace Mistress and Di Qing were sisters. On top of how the Misty Hall’s Palace Mistress had treated him.... Qing Shui shook his head!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Wenren Wushuang… Qing Shui didn’t even know if this would work out in the first place. Even if it did work out, Qing Shui had intended to take care of her for her whole life. She had also agreed to stay with him. But now, he didn’t even know if he could live longer than three years. So right now he didn’t want to…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He felt very conflicted right now. Three years. Qing Shui smiled bitterly!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Days passed idly. He visited Mingyue Gelou’s bedroom at night. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. Although Qing Shui and Mingyue Gelou were both in the Heavenly Palace, they didn’t have the chance to meet a lot. With this injury, he hadn’t touched her for a few months.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although there were some little changes after a wild night, the effects were still small. The Realm of Violet Jade Immortal’s second layer had opened up after his first time with Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If only such a small effects were yielded now, Qing Shui thought that he’d still inevitably die in three years. But he was clueless on what to do. It had not been easy to do this with Wenren Wushuang.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui remembered about Huoyun Liu-Li and Canghai Mingyue, but he hurriedly shook his head. He was still not sure if they were women from the Portraits of Beauty. On top of that, he had not made any significant progress with them so he didn’t plan on touching them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But when Qing Shui remembered the feelings the two girls had for him, he took tried looking at things from another perspective. His earlier view wavered. If they had true feelings for him, even one day was a wonderful memory.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the end, Qing Shui shook his head and decided to stop thinking about it. He was planning to return to the Qing Residence today. Since he had already reached this point in life, he might as well spend his remaining time happily.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Yi did not stop Qing Shui either. She had allowed him to stay there for a few days before returning. Qing Shui naturally agreed with a smile too.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Di Qing left the next day, but Di Chen stayed behind. He was going to return to the Qing Residence in the company of Huoyun Liu-Li, Canghai Mingyue, Di Chen and Qing Qing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt conflicted towards Di Chen. He had always felt like he wasn’t worthy of her, and now he felt even awkward in front of her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The five of them returned to the Qing Residence together!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sister Chen! Are you going to stay here for three years?” Qing Shui softly asked Di Chen who was beside him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had been calling her Sister Chen along with the other two girls!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why? Am I unwelcomed?” Di Chen looked at Qing Shui. Her face was partly veiled, but he could still see a faint smile in her incomparably beautiful eyes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“How can that be? I just feel honored. I wonder what am I still worth now for you to stay here.” Qing Shui laughed wryly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You’ve always been thinking for the sake of other people. When will you start thinking for yourself?” Di Chen said softly, as her deep eyes gazed out of the horse carriage.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Some people are worth to sacrificing for. Sometimes you wouldn’t even know why.” Di Chen looked at Qing Shui pensively.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui didn’t understand all. Just like what she had said, sometimes one wouldn’t even know the reason!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Qing Residence was still the same as ever. Most people were either growing crops, hunting or rearing animals. They could be considered a flourishing clan and they lived in a simple and honest life. Qing Shui quite liked this kind of environment.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There were two people currently living in the huge Qing Residence - Qing Luo and Lin Zhanhan!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The two old men who were playing chess only noticed their arrival when Qing Shui entered the courtyard!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Grandfather!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Lin!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">………..</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Haha, you’re back. Good, good!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Upon Qing Shui’s return, a letter had already been sent to Qing Luo from the Hundred Miles City. The old men were also made aware of Qing Shui’s situation, so that they could make ample mental preparation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Li Zhanhan naturally knew about it, he took a glance at Qing Shui and couldn’t help but to sigh inwardly. Such a gifted genius had to meet his end like this…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After the few girls introduced themselves to Qing Luo and Lin Zhanhan, Qing Shui helped them find some available rooms in the Qing Residence. In the end, he found the courtyard that he had lived in before. It had been only him and his mother living there, but suddenly, now there were five of them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui left the few girls there, he walked towards the living room at the front yard. He was sure that Old Master and Lin Zhanhan must be waiting there for him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He arrived at the front yard shortly. The decoration hadn’t changed much here. It remained the way it was a few years ago. Only the trees had grown a little sturdier and lusher. On top of that, it had also become quieter here now.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He pushed the door to the hall open and saw his grandfather and Lin Zhanhan there. They gave him a small smile when they saw him entering the room.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Come, Qing Shui. Although Grandpa Lin and I are not brothers, we are more than that. We are closer than blood-related brothers. We’ve been looking forward to talking to our grandson today,” Qing Luo chuckled at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A warm feeling welled up inside him. Humans yearn for familial affection when they are at their weakest!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Lin and I know all about your situation. You still have a home and family. It seems like you have returned at a good time,” Qing Luo laughed lightly and pulled Qing Shui into the living room.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The three of them sat down around a wooden tea table. A pot of tea had been prepared and the tea’s fragrance filled the air.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s eyes reddened. He couldn’t get even a word out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“A man has to be able to take whatever that comes to him. A true man is a man who constantly contends with the Heavens, the Earth and himself, and will never concede to defeat. Every hardship in your life is a test for you,” Lin Zhanhan chuckled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’ve already become like this. What can I still do even if I don’t concede to defeat? I am running out of time.” Qing Shui shook his head with a bitter smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hoho. Are you feeling hopeless because you are only left with three years?” Lin Zhanhan smiled. The words he spoke confused Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Are you curious how I know that?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui nodded!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hoho, because my grandfather had been through a similar situation. But he recovered in the end.” Lin Zhanhan said slowly to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui couldn’t restrain his excitement. He looked at Lin Zhanhan with his burning eyes, “Grandpa Lin, please enlighten your grandson!”</p>
