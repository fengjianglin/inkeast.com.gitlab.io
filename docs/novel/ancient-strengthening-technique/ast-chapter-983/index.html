 <p><strong>AST 983 - Clearing All Trivial Matters, Gifting You Earthly Paradise As Your Dowry</strong></p>
 <p>Hearing Baili Jingwei's words, Qing Shui looked at him and asked puzzledly, "Why is that so?"</p>
 <p>"Zhu Qing came from a pitiful background and it seemed that she had a trauma from that. It seems like I can be assured now. I hope that you can treat her better." After saying this, Baili Jingwei let out a long exhale.</p>
 <p>"Old Master, don't worry, I know. Don't you know what kind of person I am?" Qing Shui recalled the trauma that Baili Jingwei had mentioned. It should be related to her previous detest of men. Qing Shui knew about this long ago.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Seeing that it was still early, Qing Shui greeted them and prepared to head out to take a look at Earthly Paradise. Since Zhu Qing would stay for two days at most, she would need to hand over some stuff.</p>
 <p>There was no way that Yiye Jiange would go out alone with Qing Shui. When she saw Qing Shui, that scene that would make her panic would appear in her mind. Therefore, Qing Shui ended up going alone.</p>
 <p>Earthly Paradise!</p>
 <p>Standing before the inn which remained as prosperous as before, a lot of emotions surged within him. In the past, Huoyun Liu-Li was the one who took charge here. Thinking back, he felt especially blissfully. Back when he first met Huoyun Liu-Li, it was at the Firecloud Blacksmith Store. He had never expected her to have another identity, which was Earthly Paradise's boss. Additionally, the real boss in the background was Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui walked in. There wasn't a single person here he recognized. He didn't even know if the waitresses were the same as before. The reason he had come was to take a look at Mei Yanxue, to see if she was still doing fine.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui headed upstairs!</p>
 <p>"Sir, would you like to dine or to stay?"</p>
 <p>A waitress walked over and asked politely. It might’ve been because Qing Shui was different from other people or because he had tried to head upstairs directly.</p>
 <p>"I want to meet your boss!" Qing Shui looked at the waitress and said with a smile.</p>
 <p>The waitress frowned. Their boss was extremely beautiful and many people had come to meet her. However, there hadn't been anyone who had dared to barge upstairs directly.</p>
 <p>"I'm sorry, our boss is not free!" The maid continued to smile and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. He had experienced a lot of things in life and judging from this waitress' reaction, he knew that she must have treated him as a lecher. He had no choice but to say seriously, "Then can I trouble you to pass a message to your boss? Just say that I am Qing Shui."</p>
 <p>The waitress hesitated for a moment and headed upstairs. Qing Shui decided to wait here since he was in no hurry. It seemed that the place was doing well. Even though so many years had passed, not much had changed.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, the sounds of a series of quick footsteps came from upstairs. Qing Shui lifted his head and when his gaze landed on a lady, he smiled.</p>
 <p>She was a lady who was like white snow. Her snow white clothes on her beautiful figure gave the feeling that her clothes were tailor-made.</p>
 <p>She had a slender and balanced figure. Most importantly, she had a pair of bulging breasts which seemed as if her clothes could barely hold in. Her eyes were bright and clear. When she saw Qing Shui, she was first surprised before she broke into a happy smile.</p>
 <p>When she smiled, her eyes would squint together like a pair of crescent moons, giving her a great seductive charm. However, she was wearing white clothes which gave a sense of purity. She was an extremely seductive and charming lady.</p>
 <p>The previous lady chef of Earthly Paradise should now be the boss to Earthly Paradise.</p>
 <p>"Brother Qing Shui, you came alone?" Mei Yanxue walked up to Qing Shui happily.</p>
 <p>"Do you not welcome me if I'm alone?" Qing Shui smiled and asked. This lady had addressed him as elder brother the first time they had met. She had done the same now, and that made Qing Shui quite happy.</p>
 <p>"Why would I not? Come, let's go up. You guys haven't visited me after so long." Mei Yanxue headed upstairs with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Have you been well?" Qing Shui looked at the highest storey's hall and asked while smiling.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, I've been fine. It's just that I miss you guys a lot. How are they?" Mei Yanxue seemed to have sunk into her memories.</p>
 <p>"They're fine. They had wanted to come and visit but it's not too convenient. They'll come back and visit you in the future. This is for you." Qing Shui handed her an Interspatial Silk Sachet filled with spices.</p>
 <p>This woman only liked cooking and not training. However, Qing Shui still gave her an opportunity. Using the Xiantian Golden Pellet to let her reach Xiantian, she wouldn't be as tired when managing Earthly Paradise.</p>
 <p>"I'm assured to see that you're fine. This Earthly Paradise is yours. In the future, we'll come back to visit you. There are martial techniques amongst the things I've given you. If you don't like it, it's fine. You can let your most important person practice it. Don't worry, no one will look for trouble here. However, you must still train up a few people you can trust so that you can deal with gangsters and the like."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's words were very clear. It was obvious that he wouldn't come by often in the future and that the place has been given to her. Although Mei Yanxue felt that this was the case, she was still stunned for a short moment when Qing Shui told her this.</p>
 <p>"Brother Qing Shui, this place belongs to Sister Liu-Li and Sister Mingyue... How can it be given to me?" Mei Yanxue shook her head and said.</p>
 <p>"In the future, we might still be able to drop by. Oh, both Liu-Li and Mingyue both have kids now. They told me to pass you a message that Earthly Paradise is their dowry for you."</p>
 <p>"Ahh, you guys already have children? How I wish that I could meet them. You're my elder brother. In the future, you must visit me often." Mei Yanxue appeared slightly down, but she quickly regained her composure.</p>
 <p>"Since you've already called me elder brother, we'll definitely visit you often in the future. Enjoy your life and do what you like to do, which is cooking. No one will come looking for trouble." Qing Shui smiled and patted her on the shoulder.</p>
 <p>"Elder brother!"</p>
 <p>Mei Yanxye hugged Qing Shui. Her family was very ordinary. She liked cooking and had an exceptional talent in this area. Everything she had today was given to her by this guy and his women.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui returned to Skysword Sect, it was already slightly dark and he went straight to Zhu Qing's place. When she saw Qing Shui, Zhu Qing was so happy that she pounced over. This mature lady was very petite and gave the feeling of a docile homemaker. She was also a little wild, a wildness amidst her embarrassment.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't say anything and locked the door and then carried her to the bed. Very quickly, that tempting figure was fully bared before him. Zhu Qing wasn't tall and was about 1.6 meters. However, her body was very proportionate and she seemed very slender. She had an extremely well-rounded pair of breasts and a beautiful bosom. Just one look made Qing Shui's blood boil. Her mature and exquisite face was flushed red and her seductive eyes had the ability to hook one's soul.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>The next morning, Qing Shui left very early. Not wishing for others to know what had happened between them, he went straight to Cloud Mist Peak for his morning practice.</p>
 <p>"Father, you didn't return the whole night. Didn't you say that you were going to woo mother?" When Luan Luan saw Qing Shui, she asked directly.</p>
 <p>"Lass, this has to be taken slowly. I promise you that in the end, your mother will definitely marry me. We've already agreed on this. Don't you believe your father?" Qing Shui said, slightly awkwardly.</p>
 <p>"Of course I trust you. You've promised me. You must make good on your promise." Luan Luan said very seriously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded, "I wouldn't be able to bear seeing your mother getting married to someone else."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew what the lass was thinking. Although he had no blood relation with Luan Luan, they had been father and daughter for so many years. It was just that she felt a little uneasy after getting to know about her background. However, she was related to Yiye Jiange by blood. If he were to become a true couple with Yiye Jiange, then she might feel better. Qing Shui was also troubled by this daughter of his. Qing Shui had treated her even better than he had treated his own daughter, but this lass hadn't been able to get past her own hurdle.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, Yiye Jiange, and Luan Luan had their breakfast at Cloud Mist Peak. Looking at Yiye Jiange who still couldn't meet his gaze, Qing Shui also felt a little embarrassed for her to see that scene. If his other women were to come across this scene, he could still act shamelessly, and even tease them. However, this was Yiye Jiange...</p>
 <p>This feeling was very weird because he loved this woman and respected her as well. He sneaked a look at her and it just so happened that their gazes met. Yiye Jiange had only looked toward Qing Shui because she noticed that he was in a daze during the meal.</p>
 <p>"Father, mother, I'm full. I'll head to the back of the mountains to see if there's anything fun." With that, Luan Luan smiled and left.</p>
 <p>"Be careful!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange said at almost the same time.</p>
 <p>"Jiange!" Qing Shui spoke up, a bit unnaturally.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange was a little anxious as well. She didn't lift her head but continued to eat her meal slowly. Qing Shui didn't say anything either and just appreciated the sight of her having her meal.</p>
 <p>"Why are you looking at me? Eat your meal!"</p>
 <p>"Actually, the strongest impression you've given me was a person who didn't eat food from the human world. To be able to watch you eat is also an enjoyment in itself."</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange was stunned and she lifted her head, smiling, "What's wrong with you today? Are you feeling unwell?"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui: "..."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Later in the morning, Baili Jingwei had a banquet prepared. There was only him and his Martial siblings, in addition to Qing Shui, Luan Luan, and Baili Wufeng. Zhu Qing's face was flushed red throughout, as if she felt very embarrassed.</p>
 <p>This was a simple wedding banquet. When they'd arrived at the Continent's Capital, Qing Shui would prepare another wedding banquet for Zhu Qing. He had done so for all his other women. For those who hadn’t held a wedding banquet immediately, he would always make it up to them.</p>
 <p>"Third Sister, this is an affinity. Congratulations. There's no need to feel embarrassed, this is very normal. Moreover, Qing Shui is also our Skysword Sect's Elder, even if it's just in name." Baili Jingwei laughed.</p>
 <p>When Yiye Jiange saw Zhu Qing's shy and blissful expression, she was very happy. However, there was also an indescribable feeling in her heart. She was truly happy from the bottom of her heart to see Zhu Qing get her happiness.</p>
 <p>She had been in Skysword Sect for very long. This was her home and these people are her siblings. She hoped that everyone here could be happy, especially Zhu Qing.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and the others bade the Skysword Sect goodbye and left. This time around, all four of them got on the Fire Bird for the journey. Zhu Qing and Yiye Jiange were chatting at one end while Qing Shui and Luan Luan were chatting on the other.</p>
 <p>"Father, did you notice that mother seems to be a little jealous?" Luan Luan looked at Qing Shui seriously and said.</p>
 <p>"Is she?" Qing Shui asked, puzzled.</p>
 <p>"Yes, but it’s probably just a little."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>When they returned to Yan City, the members of Qing Clan had already left. After a few polite exchange with Guo Clan and rejecting Lai Clan's warm invitation, they left. Qing Shui wanted to return to the Continent's Capital. Once they reach home, Qing Shui would be able to enjoy some peace and quiet for a while.</p>
 <p>They didn't travel very fast on the way.</p>
 <p>A few days later, they arrived back home. They had basically arrived only a short time after the other members of Qing Clan. When they arrived, there was also a need for some introductions. But although some people were astonished, they were very warm and understanding. It wasn't strange to see anything happen to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>All the people here were very intelligent. It was just like what Yiye Jiange had said. No women would be willing to share their partners with others, but sometimes, they had no other choice. Moreover, they were now very happy and wondered if this blissfulness would continue on just like this.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked on as Canghai Mingyue, Huoyun Liu-Li, Mingyue Gelou, Shi Qingzhuang and the others chatted warmly with Zhu Qing. When Zhu Qing saw the children, she took out the small gifts she had prepared for them.</p>
