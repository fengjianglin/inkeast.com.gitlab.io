 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Treasure-hunting could be one of the most thrilling things. This also applied to Qing Shui and the others. The excitement they had at the moment when they saw the treasures and the shock they received upon seeing it were something words could never describe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For now, Qing Shui wasn’t sure if he still could find more treasure rooms. After all, he had already received quite a number of things around here. The things which he found before seemed to be already the deepest part of the room. He felt that there should no longer be any more hidden rooms within this area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time went on little by little. Qing Shui and the others spent a long time walking around the same place, and Qing Shui’s assumption was proven correct. There was no longer other stuff around here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they have already managed to gain a lot of things from their trip this time. After all, they managed to find two Buddhist treasures around here. The remaining Divine Water Beads and Five Elements Beads were also more or less considered to be semi-divine Grade weapons. If not, they were at least also at False God Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without noticing, almost half a day passed. However, upon leaving the treasure room, the group also didn’t intend to rest. They continued to follow the Dragon Slaying Beast for more treasure huntings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within this short span of time, Qing Shui let the Nameless Heaven Book recognize its owner and instantly received a two times boost in his strength. It wouldn’t take him too much time to do this kind of things. As it was a passive magic treasure, it would immediately raise the owner’s strength. Furthermore, no cultivation was needed for this magic treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment, Qing Shui’s strength was worth around forty-five thousand Dao Force. This could undoubtedly be considered to be a terrifying amount of strength. The increase in strength Qing Shui had gone through made him less worried about the Ocean Demonic Palace. Though he wasn’t sure if he was a frog at the bottom of a well, he felt that the people from Ocean Demonic Palace who he had met so far could no longer be a threat to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the Ocean Demonic Palace itself, he planned to only start thinking about it at a later time, since they had so many branches. In fact, he wasn’t even certain how big a problem the branch they were currently up against could pose to them exactly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had a feeling that Yan Ziyu would probably make his move while they were still inside the Northern Ocean Dragon Mercy Path. He was probably thinking about killing all of them here. Thinking up to this point, Qing Shui revealed a smile on his face. If that was truly the case, he wouldn’t mind leaving all of them here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge looked at Qing Shui in shock. She could feel a slight change happening to Qing Shui’s aura. It seemed to have increased by a considerable amount. This was already the second time it happened. The first time was at the time when Qing Shui was standing in front of the Portrait of World Dominance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was very certain about what she felt. Since she has already been benefited greatly herself, Qing Shui would have most likely acquired almost the same effects as her. The only thing she was uncertain about was whether or not he or she had benefited more on this trip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment, Muyun Qingge was almost equal to the Sunset Palace Mistress in terms of strength. Before this, she used to be inferior to the Sunset Palace Mistress, but now, she was slowly catching up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the direction which Qing Shui took was one of the paths which the least people would take, no one could be seen around here. However, it was because he had the Dragon Slaying Beast with him. The others were unaware of the reason Qing Shui took this path. Qing Shui, on the other hand, was very confident with the decision he made.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was standing in between the two girls. They had slender figures but their breasts were so big that they thoroughly filled up the snow white soft armor in front of their chests. Their curves were incomparably good to look at. It also in a way hinted that they were extremely spongy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge was also not inferior beside the Sunset Palace Mistress, let alone the fact that she had once totally exposed herself in front of Qing Shui himself. Back then, despite laying flat on the bed, her plumped breasts still remained upright and maintained their original shape. Qing Shui’s entire throat couldn’t help but thirst for her snow white and smooth skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge extended her arms and “gently” pinched Qing Shui’s back, “Qing Shui, what are you looking at?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took a deep breath. As he felt the “gentle” pinch behind him, he revealed an awkward smile. He never thought that he would get so mesmerized while looking at the both of them. He even went to the extent of starting to staring directly at Muyun Qingge’s breast. This had caused her to feel really embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sunset Palace Mistress shot a glare at Qing Shui, “You must have enjoyed looking at my elder sister’s breasts, didn’t you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luckily, Shui Yunfeng and his group were behind them, leaving only the three of them together. Since there was quite some distance between them, they weren’t that concerned with being heard by the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge was speechless. She blushed and moved her sight towards the Sunset Palace Mistress. Despite being known for her valiance, with Qing Shui around, she still found a bit of difficulty trying to endure it, “Sister Qingcheng, why don’t you talk to Qing Shui alone about it later?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, let me give you a choice. Either I touch Qingge, or you give them a go.” As the Sunset Palace Mistress was speaking, to Qing Shui’s surprise, she actually extended her arms and squeezed Muyun Qingge’s breasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was immediately stoned. The soft armor which Muyun Qingge was wearing possessed outstanding defensive capabilities. However, they didn’t belong to the armor category. On the contrary, they were more towards being made of soft clothes. The change in shape didn’t look that obvious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge cried out in surprise and immediately slapped away the Sunset Palace Mistress’ hands. Her face looked as red as a sunset glow as she said in a displeased tone, “Sister Qingcheng, you are so mean!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, you haven’t answered me, do they look great?” The Sunset Palace Mistress laughed and looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui rubbed his head. She was such a captivating woman. He proceeded to rub his nose and said, “I have never seen them before, how would I know if they looked great?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sunset Palace Mistress revealed a sly smile on her face, “Well, does that mean that you have seen Sister Qingge’s breasts before?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui got shocked and responded back in a hurry, “No… I have never seen it before…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You little boy… You don’t even know how to speak. Do you consider yourself a man?” The Sunset Palace Mistress rolled her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was speechless. He couldn’t do anything but remain silent. Whether he was a man or not, she would find out for herself if she gave him a try. However, he didn’t dare to say it. The woman he was currently talking to was no ordinary woman. Standing in front of her, there was nothing he could do but be disrespected by her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui!” The Sunset Palace Mistress called out to Qing Shui in a shy and soft tone. Her voice when she said it sounded very alluring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook, causing Muyun Qingge who was beside him to immediately laugh. Muyun Qingge who was supposed to be very shy also found it unusually funny seeing Qing Shui getting disrespected by the Sunset Palace Mistress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when she saw the Sunset Palace Mistress looking at her, Muyun Qingge immediately stopped laughing in fear that she would be her next target to be teased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and looked at the palace mistress, “What’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Once we are out of this place, I will let you take a look at those breasts. Tell me if they look great. Does that sound alright to you?”</span></p>

Qing Shui seemed to be blushing, though it wasn’t really obvious. However, he suddenly happened to notice a slight smiling intention on the corner of the palace mistress’ eyes.</span></p>

He let out his hand and grabbed on her jade-like arm, “Alright!”</span></p>

However, at the moment when Qing Shui grabbed the Sunset Palace Mistress’ hand, she trembled. Though she might look very mature and charming, deep down, she was still a young bird. The reason why she teased Qing Shui was that she assumed that he would definitely not do anything to her. Other than that, it was also because she really liked that man. He was a man with principles as well as a responsible man. Hence, she wasn’t worried if anything would happen.</span></p>

Alright, it’s a deal! By then, I will come and look for you.”</span></p>

Muyun Qingge on the other hand, remained speechless looking at those two, “Look! It has stopped!”</span></p>

This got Qing Shui excited, “Could it be that it has found yet another treasure room?”</span></p>

Yes, it was a treasure room, but he knew this because of the enormous Guardian Beast he saw standing in front. This beast was outside of the treasure room. What shocked Qing Shui for now was that the people from Ocean Demonic Palace were also charging towards this place. But in comparison to Qing Shui, they were a lot further away from the treasure room itself.</span></p>
