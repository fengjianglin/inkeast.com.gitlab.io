 <p><strong>AST 1036 - Voiceless Resonance, Wondrous Appearance, Divine Bodies</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Yu Ruyan. The way he addressed her changed from Lady to directly calling her by her name. Looking at the silent Yu Ruyan, his heart was unsettled.</p>
 <p>This feeling was like a vase suspended in midair that could fall and shatter at any moment. This woman he cared a lot about, Yu Ruyan, was like a vase that could easily shatter. Any negligence on Qing Shui’s part could shatter her, therefore he had always been careful.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan kept her silence for a while before raising her head to look at the cautious Qing Shui. Her heart was warm. This man was always cautious around her and had always cared a lot about her. She could feel it all. This feeling was pleasantly sweet, just like the feeling of being spoiled. Earlier he had said that he missed her and immediately came to see her.</p>
 <p>“I have you in my heart but…”</p>
 <p>“Then no need for ‘but’, I want to hear you say you love me,” Qing Shui said softly while he tried to push his luck further by grasping her hand in one hand and embracing her waist in the other.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan was at a loss for words, nevertheless her face blushed in embarrassment. Seeing her skin that was as soft as snow flushed red, Qing Shui almost impulsively kissed her but resisted his urge, so as to not scare her away.</p>
 <p>“You jerk, don’t push your luck,” Yu Ruyan lowered her head a little, her voice was quiet.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui watched as this mature and graceful woman displayed a bashful and delicate feminine attitude. This type of charm could take a life. Let alone how he was holding her hand and waist at the same time.</p>
 <p>“Sister Ruyan, how about I call you sister? Just say it once, I really want to hear it!” Qing Shui’s heart trembled a little in shame. In front of this woman, his words were a bit petulant and pouty. Luckily it was not to a degree that would leave people with goosebumps.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan was getting softhearted. Unprecedentedly, She had lightly embraced his neck and said softly into his ears, “I love you!”</p>
 <p>The soft voice that reached Qing Shui’s ears was like heavenly music that spiraled about, causing his ears to itch. The softness in her voice made Qing Shui unconsciously embrace Yu Ruyan’s waist tightly.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan sighed without saying another word. Qing Shui had already let go of her hand, now both of his hands were wrapped around her waist. Yu Ruyan’s hands were placed on his shoulder. She looked directly into his eyes.</p>
 <p>Her breasts were firmly pressed against Qing Shui’s chest. Qing Shui looked at Yu Ruyan, “Ruyan, I love you!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had rarely said this before, because he knew that these three words could not be said casually. Especially in his past life, he had never spoken these three words to anyone before.</p>
 <p>He loved his parents, but he was not good at expressing himself. Although in the village he never expressed himself to his parents, he loved them dearly. However, he had never told them during his lifetime.</p>
 <p>On the subject of a man and woman, Qing Shui had stopped on the theory of it in his past life. Although he had a girlfriend, he would only use the word ‘like’ rather than love.</p>
 <p>Love, this word should be spoken by as few people as possible. This was a responsibility; this was heart…</p>
 <p>In this life, these words were used more frequently in the past couple years. He had said it to his mother. Every son and daughter would love their parents. This was love on a family level.</p>
 <p>Others included his women. He originally loved all of them, now that most of them had children, he would say it out loud. After he said it he finally found out that it felt good. Upon hearing that they loved him back, it felt just as nice. Now that he knew, there was a need in saying it.</p>
 <p>Before, he had always felt that love was supposed to be kept in the heart, not something that was said in words. He still agreed with this thought, especially when empty words were compared to actions. However, sometimes the feelings of love needed to be expressed.</p>
 <p>Hearing Qing Shui’s words, Yu Ruyan lowered her head slightly. She was at a loss for words, her elegant and refined face turned red.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui laughed, this traditional woman was very similar to himself. However, he was a man, thus there were times where he had to be thick-skinned.</p>
 <p>“It’s been so long, we should kiss…” This was not the first time Qing Shui acted this way. He had only done this to Huoyun Liu-li and Canghai Mingyue. Though the current situation made him feel uneasy, it was still very exciting. It felt like blood was rushing to his head. It would seem that he would need to strengthen himself more in the future but this talk would come later…</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan did not expect this and stared blankly at Qing Shui. She then extended her hand and knocked Qing Shui’s head, “I already told you not to push your luck, if you speak any further then release me.”</p>
 <p>Looking at the woman that was part displeased and part happy, Qing Shui did not force anything on her. He rubbed his head and pretended to be in pain. With his other hand, he held her tightly.</p>
 <p>“To murder your own husband. My head is damaged. Sister please kiss me or I won’t be able to sleep,” Qing Shui made a small fuss and closed in.</p>
 <p>“Alright, stop pretending,” Yu Ruyan laughed and rubbed his head a little. She knew that she had not used any strength when she hit him.</p>
 <p>Sudden footsteps could be heard. Before they had the chance to separate, the two that were in an embrace saw Duanmu Lingshuang and Hu Yanlin with their child coming over. Although they were a ways out everything could be seen clearly.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan flustered and pushed Qing Shui away, secretly, grudgingly, glaring at him once, then she turned to look at the group that was slowly approaching.</p>
 <p>Their child already learned how to walk, but he was very naughty. Qing Shui was very curious. Duanmu Lingshuang was cool and elegant and Hu Yanlin was straightforward and honest, he did not know who this little fella resembled. He was quite handsome, at least a third like Duanmu Lingshuang. Moreover, Hu Yanlin was bold looking but not ugly.</p>
 <p>With Qing Shui’s help last time, Hu Yanlin’s strength had improved immensely within the last two years. Though he did not have formidable innate talent, his accidental consumption of the Heaven and Earth Spirit Fruit with his current strength would allow him to be an overlord in Duanmu City.</p>
 <p>“Mother, the mister is here!” Hu Yanlin greeted Yu Ruyan respectfully first and then greeted Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Last time he had given the small fella a gift, this time he gave him some Fragrance Fruits to eat.</p>
 <p>“Mother!”</p>
 <p>Duanmu Lingshuang was happy. He could tell by the expression on her face. Duanmu Lingshuang hugged Yu Ruyan’s arm and signaled a greeting to both Qing Shui and Hu Yanlin before walking to the side with her mother.</p>
 <p>“Mister, let’s go rest over there. Yanlin is happy that he could see Mister,” Hu Yanlin, who was holding onto the hand of his son, said to Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui laughed, he had given too much to Hu Yanlin before. Hu Yanlin naturally had seen Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan embracing, but he did not ask. As if pretending nothing had happened, he deeply respected Qing Shui from the bottom of his heart.</p>
 <p>…………………………………………………….</p>
 <p>“Mother, when did Qing Shui get here?” Duanmu Lingshuang asked while laughing. She seemed to have understood a few things. Even her attitude had changed. She was no longer as cold as before.</p>
 <p>Especially since the birth of her son, this created the greatest change in her life. She understood that raising a child was not an easy thing. Naturally after her marriage with Hu Yanlin, she knew that a single woman being the pillar of the Duanmu Clan was not a simple feat. More importantly, there was no one that could understand her since the death of her father. She had never seen any men get close enough to her mother, even though she had once suspected her mother and Qing Shui’s relationship.</p>
 <p>In the beginning, she had been resistant but she had never seen her mother and Qing Shui overstep their bounds. Now that she had seen her mother being intimate with a man, she did not feel any displeasure.</p>
 <p>“15 minutes before you arrived.” It was the first-time Yu Ruyan felt flustered in front of her daughter.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan was at ease with her daughter. She knew her daughter’s personality well. Yu Ruyan had cherished her daughter during the years of her daughter’s upbringing. Yu Ruyan did not even dare raise her voice because this was the last shelter to the loneliness within her heart. She did not dare shatter the only thing holding her together spiritually and mentally.</p>
 <p>That was the reason why she distanced herself from Qing Shui when she realized her daughter had feelings for him. However, as though fate was playing games with her, she had done the inexcusable thing.</p>
 <p>Had her daughter liked him too, Yu Ruyan would have never revealed her true feelings even if she was in love with Qing Shui. She would have silently and willingly watched the two of them become an item.</p>
 <p>Maternal love!</p>
 <p>However, her daughter was already married. Yu Ruyan understood her daughter’s personality. Her daughter would not share a man with any other woman. Therefore, when it was known that Qing Shui already had several women, her favorable impression of him dissipated.</p>
 <p>“Lingshuang, don’t overthink it. Him and I are just friends, it is not what you think,” Yu Ruyan said after sighing.</p>
 <p>Duanmu Lingshung was exceptionally intelligent. The moment she arrived and saw them, especially seeing Yu Ruyan’s expression, she had understood everything. That expression was a maiden in love, containing bits of happiness and fluster.</p>
 <p>“What was I thinking? Mother is the one with a guilty conscience,” Duanmu Lingshuang said while laughing.</p>
 <p>“How dare you tease your own mother?” Yu Ruyan lightly stroked Duanmu Lingshuang’s head.</p>
 <p>“Mother, you’ve done well taking care of all the troubles these last couple years!” Duanmu Lingshuang embraced Yu Ruyan.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan was surprised and embraced her daughter. This time her eyes became moist. Her daughter grew up, a real grown up. She already had her own children so she knew that being a parent was not easy.</p>
 <p>“Silly child, why are you suddenly saying these things to your mother? When mother sees you she does not feel troubled.”</p>
 <p>Duanmu Lingshuang also smiled gently. She thought about her own naughty son and could not agree more. Watching her own child did not feel troublesome at all.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui is someone who could be a match for mother!”</p>
 <p>“Young lady, what are you saying?” Yu Ruyan shouted promptly after being startled.</p>
 <p>“I know a bit. I just want to say, we will always be mother and daughter. You are my dearest mother. As long as mother loves him, I will respect him. I am also very happy that mother has hope for the future. Let the past be the past, some memories are best left inside your heart. Don’t let the living suffer.”</p>
 <p>Duanmu Lingshuang said while smiling and giving Yu Ruyan a kiss, “Your daughter will love you forever!”</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan was going to say something. Even though she had a guilty conscience, in front of her daughter she had to hold up a front. She was the mother, she should be able to maintain her front. But after listening to her daughter’s words, she could not help but sigh. She embraced her daughter without saying anything.</p>
 <p>This could be thought of as implied confirmation!</p>
 <p>“Mother, let’s go, I will accompany you!” Duanmu Lingshuang dragged Yu Ruyan by the hand and they walked out together.</p>
 <p>If the two of them walked side by side, no one would think they were mother and daughter. Moreover, they would not be able to tell who was older. Yu Ruyan was a bit more refined and graceful. Her face had an additional trace of a voiceless resonance and wondrous appearance. This was an element of the Divine Body.</p>
