  <p><strong>AST 326 Beauty Pellet, After Today, I Won't Owe Her Anymore</strong></p>
  <p><span>As he walked, Qing Shui kept on thinking about the Basic Sword Techniques he saw, and at the same time, wondered what books there were from the 4th to 6th levels in the library. Qing Shui had only gone through a small corner of the 1st to 3rd levels, and, with a stroke of luck, came across the Basic Sword Techniques. </span></p>
  <p><span>Time passed by very quickly, and in the blink of an eye, the new year was almost coming. This made Qing Shui think about the new year he had spent in the Skysword Sect, and that three years had already passed ever since he promised his mother that he would head to Yan Clan in five years’ time.</span></p>
  <p><span>Thinking about this made Qing Shui feel a fire spreading in his body. It was an expectation and desire, but at the same time, full of torture having to hold it in. Two years to others would mean that he had about sixty years, and it should be sufficient for him to reach the 5th Heavenly Layer.</span></p>
  <p><span>A celebratory spirit filled the Heavenly Palace Mountain, and it was three days to the New Year. Now, other than the disciples who were on rotary duties, the others were all on leave. Those who wished to head home could do so, and most of those who did tended to stay not very far from the Heavenly Palace Mountain or would have flying beasts. Of course, even most of those with flying beasts did live not far away from the Heavenly Palace Mountain as well, unless they had top notch flying beasts with monstrous abilities.</span></p>
  <p><span>It was three days to the New Year and every palace was decorated with some festive decorations, everyone was bustling with excitement. It was the same for the Starmoon Hall. Now, Qing Shui was well-known throughout the Starmoon Hall and would receive attention no matter where he went.</span></p>
  <p><span>Many things would happen when someone became famous. For example, in Qing Shui's case, he was born with good features, and now, even more ladies would go up to him and pester him. However, Qing Shui detested such behavior. While he had been through two lives, he was very practical, and though he understood human practical mindset, he still detested it. He did not like such women, and did not like his relations to be mixed with impurities. </span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui would never abandon his training for special occasions. However, before he had even stepped out of the house today, he was already stopped by Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li, who had came to ask him along to take a walk.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Qing Shui, it's bustling with activities outside! Come along with us to take a look around!" Huoyun Liu-Li grabbed onto one of Qing Shui's arms, and asked coquettishly.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui saw that Huoyun Liu-Li had covered her face with silk. He knew that she did not wear this in the past and sensing her level of cultivation, thinking of the Shi Qingzhuang from the past, how he had fed her with all the remaining Small Revitalizing Pellets he had without considering why he had saved her, he wondered if there was a need for Huoyun Liu-Li to be so harsh on herself.</span></p>
  <p><span>Ladies dress up for those who like them. It seemed that she was still concerned about her looks. If not, she would not be covering up her face. Why was there a need to make her feel so upset for the sake of the 20% raise in her level of cultivation? It might be better for her to regain her confidence.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Wait a minute. The New Year is coming up, let me give you two a gift. After all, it's the end of the year." Qing Shui thought of how it was the first time he said that he was giving a gift.</span></p>
  <p><span>The two ladies were also stunned, and then Huoyun Liu-Li said happily, "Alright! Quickly take it out! It must be something we like!"</span></p>
  <p><span>"Haha, don't worry, you two will definitely like it!" Saying this, Qing Shui took out two small porcelain bottles from his "chests", handing them over to the ladies.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Happy New Year!"</span></p>
  <p><span>Receiving the presents, the two ladies smiled and replied, "Happy New Year!"</span></p>
  <p><span>"It's a pity that we did not prepare a present for you!"</span></p>
  <p><span>However, Huoyun Liu-Li had planted a kiss on Qing Shui's cheek through the face veil, and then let out a crisp laugh!</span></p>
  <p><span>Canghai Mingyue did not do the same, but just slowly opened the bottle and saw that it was a medicinal pill with an azure color, exuding an intoxicating fragrance and a ting of cooling aura!</span></p>
  <p><span>"This is?" Canghai Mingyue asked Qing Shui, looking puzzled.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Beauty Pellet!" Qing Shui replied softly.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Oh!"</span></p>
  <p><span>It was then when the two ladies looked at Qing Shui in disbelief, "Beauty Pellet?"</span></p>
  <p><span>"Mmm. Liu-Li, to be honest, I had completed this two months ago. Do you know why I did not give it to you?" Qing Shui looked at Huoyun Liu-Li’'s beautiful eyes which were brimming with tears.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui saw Huoyun Liu-Li's agitated eyes, and knew that she was well aware what this Beauty Pellet represented. It was a medicinal pill which could completely recover her beauty, and was also a medicinal pill which could could halt ageing and maintain one's beauty for thirty years.</span></p>
  <p><span>"I don't," Huoyun Liu-Li said straightforwardly.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui rubbed his nose, smiled bitterly and then said, "Other than it' known use, it can also increase all aspects of one's abilities by 20%. Each person can only take one in their entire life."</span></p>
  <p><span>Everyone was clear about this effect. After all, it had a nature of a 2nd level of King Grade, and was one with the best effects.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Initially, I wanted to wait until Mingyue had reached the level of a Martial King, and after Liu-Li's level of cultivation had risen a little before passing it to the two of you. But after thinking about it, I want to give them to you now. It can allow Liu-Li to recover immediately; and as for Mingyue, you're already at the peak of Xiantian, and have unparalleled beauty, so you can decide for yourself when you want to take it."</span></p>
  <p><span>Hearing Qing Shui's words, a tinge of redness appeared on Canghai Mingyue's face as she looked at him with an indescribable charm, making his heart pound. The supernatural charm of this lady who had the beauty which could cause the downfall of countries and cities but yet seemed to be able to see through everything was something which Qing Shui liked a lot.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Liu-Li, I should have given it to you earlier." Qing Shui looked at Huoyun Liu-Li.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Qing Shui, I'll save it, and take it when you're headed for Yan Clan. When that happens, I'll go together with you. Is that ok?" Huoyun Liu-Li held onto the Beauty Pellet, gave it some thought, before she slowly looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui let out a sigh, took a long look at Huoyun Liu-Li, did not say anything but just nodded slightly, "Let's go. Today, we'll take it easy."</span></p>
  <p><span>The three of them walked around the Starmoon Hall casually. Canghai Mingyue's and Huoyun Liu-Li's beauty managed to attract many people's attention.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Look, Qing Shui's girlfriends are so beautiful. Only he is worthy of them," someone lamented.</span></p>
  <p><span>"That's right, what regrets would one have if he was like Qing Shui? He must be very, very happy, unlike me, still at the early stage of Xiantian, not able to even get myself a Xiantian lady,” a person beside the first one sighed and said.</span></p>
  <p><span>Birds of a feather really do flock together, with two people who loved to lament being put together!</span></p>
  <p><span>When the two ladies heard the first person's lament, they still felt a little embarrassed. However, when the second person spoke up, it made them feel that the gap between men could be so big.</span></p>
  <p><span>The reason the two onlookers had not yet made great achievements was because other than being envious of others and lamenting daily, they did not know what hard work was.</span></p>
  <p><span>And the man beside them had carried a lot of burdens on his shoulders under that magnificent appearance, but he never complained nor sighed, and would not feel envious of others either. He knew only to put in hard work, and his hard work and toleration for loneliness was something that not many people could compare with. Experts tend to be lonely...</span></p>
  <p><span>Just then, a group of people stopped them, with a young man leading in front. He seem to be very mature and earnest, but his hawk nose made him appear a little gloomy. When he saw Qing Shui, his gaze had turned a little bit strange, and then after he looked at Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li, his gaze was even filled with a bit of jealousy and hatred. It was very contradicting.</span></p>
  <p><span>"I'm Starday Hall's Feng Wuji. I'm here to challenge you," The young man said lazily.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui had spent the last two months in peace, and had thought that this Feng Wuji would never appear. He never thought that this guy would appear today, when the year was almost up.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui detested the young man when he saw the young man's expression when looking at the two ladies. That unconcealed gaze did not care about other's opinions.</span></p>
  <p><span>This was an arrogant man, and Qing Shui could feel the disdain in the other party's gaze.</span></p>
  <p><span>"I already know about it, but I still don't need you to go easy on me. I already know that Elder Yun had approached you, and you must have gotten quite a lot of benefits from her." When the man spoke, he was gritting his teeth, and was filled with extreme hatred and jealousy.</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui guessed that this person had already found out about what he did with the lady. At the start, Qing Shui did not know who Elder Yun was, but it seemed like that lady was it. The reason this lady hated him must be because, he had, to her...</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui thought of how that lady had used her body as a price in exchange for him to fulfill this condition. At first, he wanted to listen to her and not cripple him directly, but that lady's voice and appearance, as well as the scene of their time together were still clear in his mind.</span></p>
  <p><span>The two of them started the battle, and Qing Shui did his best to controll his attacks so that others would not be able to tell that he was holding back. In the middle, he had even pushed Feng Wuji back a few times, but similarly received a few heavy blows from him, so much so that blood was trickling from the corner of his lips.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Woman, after today, I'll forget about you completely. In the future, our paths will no longer cross." Qing Shui thought to himself silently.</span></p>
  <p><span>"It must be that Qing Shui's injuries are acting up! It must be!" Someone from Starmoon Hall exclaimed.</span></p>
  <p><span>"It must be so. Qing Shui had suffered from such heavy injuries the other time. If it was any other people, they would have already fallen."</span></p>
  <p><span>...</span></p>
  <p><span>Even so, both Qing Shui and Feng Wuji suffered from very serious internal injuries. However, Qing Shui knew that his condition was not very serious, but he had given Feng Wuji a few hidden ailments. Three years, he would be crippled after a maximum of three years.</span></p>
  <p><span>It seemed as if Qing Shui had lost this battle, but at the same time, the other party was not able to move an inch either. When Qing Shui fell, he told himself, "I can now forget about her and no longer owe her anything anymore. This is already the best return I can give her."</span></p>
  <p><span>Regardless if it was Feng Wuji winning by a little bit, or if he had taken advantage of Qing Shui's existing injuries, that battle scene was still engraved in everyone's mind. It was &nbsp;both beautiful but yet filled with the taste of destruction.</span></p>
  <p><span>No matter what, Feng Wuji had gotten his goal, and this was also what Qing Shui wanted!</span></p>
  <p><span>Feng Wuji left, and so did Qing Shui and the two ladies. Qing Shui smiled bitterly as he looked at the two ladies. He had initially wanted to spend time with them today to drive away their worries.</span></p>
  <p><span>"I'm sorry, I had wanted to spend time with the two of you!" Qing Shui said, his face very pale. After all, he was truly injured.</span></p>
  <p><span>"Don't talk anymore. I'm feeling very upset. When would you be able to take better care of yourself?" Huoyun Liu-Li asked, her eyes turning red.</span></p>
  <p><span>But Canghai Mingyue did not say anything, only occasionally looking at Qing Shui in a daze!</span></p>
  <p><span>A bit of a complicated expression appeared in that pair of pitch-black and profound eyes.</span></p>
  <p><span>At that moment, Qing Shui finally knew why most people would prefer women who are a bit foolish. Foolish women tended to appear very cute easily...</span></p>

 <p><span>"Wait a minute. The New Year is coming up, let me give you two a gift. After all, it's the end of the year." Qing Shui thought of how it was the first time he said that he was giving a gift.</span></p>
 <p><span>The two ladies were also stunned, and then Huoyun Liu-Li said happily, "Alright! Quickly take it out! It must be something we like!"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Haha, don't worry, you two will definitely like it!" Saying this, Qing Shui took out two small porcelain bottles from his "chests", handing them over to the ladies.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Happy New Year!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Receiving the presents, the two ladies smiled and replied, "Happy New Year!"</span></p>
 <p><span>"It's a pity that we did not prepare a present for you!"</span></p>
 <p><span>However, Huoyun Liu-Li had planted a kiss on Qing Shui's cheek through the face veil, and then let out a crisp laugh!</span></p>
 <p><span>Canghai Mingyue did not do the same, but just slowly opened the bottle and saw that it was a medicinal pill with an azure color, exuding an intoxicating fragrance and a ting of cooling aura!</span></p>
 <p><span>"This is?" Canghai Mingyue asked Qing Shui, looking puzzled.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Beauty Pellet!" Qing Shui replied softly.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Oh!"</span></p>
 <p><span>It was then when the two ladies looked at Qing Shui in disbelief, "Beauty Pellet?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Mmm. Liu-Li, to be honest, I had completed this two months ago. Do you know why I did not give it to you?" Qing Shui looked at Huoyun Liu-Li’'s beautiful eyes which were brimming with tears.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui saw Huoyun Liu-Li's agitated eyes, and knew that she was well aware what this Beauty Pellet represented. It was a medicinal pill which could completely recover her beauty, and was also a medicinal pill which could could halt ageing and maintain one's beauty for thirty years.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I don't," Huoyun Liu-Li said straightforwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui rubbed his nose, smiled bitterly and then said, "Other than it' known use, it can also increase all aspects of one's abilities by 20%. Each person can only take one in their entire life."</span></p>
 <p><span>Everyone was clear about this effect. After all, it had a nature of a 2nd level of King Grade, and was one with the best effects.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Initially, I wanted to wait until Mingyue had reached the level of a Martial King, and after Liu-Li's level of cultivation had risen a little before passing it to the two of you. But after thinking about it, I want to give them to you now. It can allow Liu-Li to recover immediately; and as for Mingyue, you're already at the peak of Xiantian, and have unparalleled beauty, so you can decide for yourself when you want to take it."</span></p>
 <p><span>Hearing Qing Shui's words, a tinge of redness appeared on Canghai Mingyue's face as she looked at him with an indescribable charm, making his heart pound. The supernatural charm of this lady who had the beauty which could cause the downfall of countries and cities but yet seemed to be able to see through everything was something which Qing Shui liked a lot.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Liu-Li, I should have given it to you earlier." Qing Shui looked at Huoyun Liu-Li.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Qing Shui, I'll save it, and take it when you're headed for Yan Clan. When that happens, I'll go together with you. Is that ok?" Huoyun Liu-Li held onto the Beauty Pellet, gave it some thought, before she slowly looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui let out a sigh, took a long look at Huoyun Liu-Li, did not say anything but just nodded slightly, "Let's go. Today, we'll take it easy."</span></p>
 <p><span>The three of them walked around the Starmoon Hall casually. Canghai Mingyue's and Huoyun Liu-Li's beauty managed to attract many people's attention.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Look, Qing Shui's girlfriends are so beautiful. Only he is worthy of them," someone lamented.</span></p>
 <p><span>"That's right, what regrets would one have if he was like Qing Shui? He must be very, very happy, unlike me, still at the early stage of Xiantian, not able to even get myself a Xiantian lady,” a person beside the first one sighed and said.</span></p>
 <p><span>Birds of a feather really do flock together, with two people who loved to lament being put together!</span></p>
 <p><span>When the two ladies heard the first person's lament, they still felt a little embarrassed. However, when the second person spoke up, it made them feel that the gap between men could be so big.</span></p>
 <p><span>The reason the two onlookers had not yet made great achievements was because other than being envious of others and lamenting daily, they did not know what hard work was.</span></p>
 <p><span>And the man beside them had carried a lot of burdens on his shoulders under that magnificent appearance, but he never complained nor sighed, and would not feel envious of others either. He knew only to put in hard work, and his hard work and toleration for loneliness was something that not many people could compare with. Experts tend to be lonely...</span></p>
 <p><span>Just then, a group of people stopped them, with a young man leading in front. He seem to be very mature and earnest, but his hawk nose made him appear a little gloomy. When he saw Qing Shui, his gaze had turned a little bit strange, and then after he looked at Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li, his gaze was even filled with a bit of jealousy and hatred. It was very contradicting.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I'm Starday Hall's Feng Wuji. I'm here to challenge you," The young man said lazily.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui had spent the last two months in peace, and had thought that this Feng Wuji would never appear. He never thought that this guy would appear today, when the year was almost up.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui detested the young man when he saw the young man's expression when looking at the two ladies. That unconcealed gaze did not care about other's opinions.</span></p>
 <p><span>This was an arrogant man, and Qing Shui could feel the disdain in the other party's gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I already know about it, but I still don't need you to go easy on me. I already know that Elder Yun had approached you, and you must have gotten quite a lot of benefits from her." When the man spoke, he was gritting his teeth, and was filled with extreme hatred and jealousy.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui guessed that this person had already found out about what he did with the lady. At the start, Qing Shui did not know who Elder Yun was, but it seemed like that lady was it. The reason this lady hated him must be because, he had, to her...</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui thought of how that lady had used her body as a price in exchange for him to fulfill this condition. At first, he wanted to listen to her and not cripple him directly, but that lady's voice and appearance, as well as the scene of their time together were still clear in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span>The two of them started the battle, and Qing Shui did his best to controll his attacks so that others would not be able to tell that he was holding back. In the middle, he had even pushed Feng Wuji back a few times, but similarly received a few heavy blows from him, so much so that blood was trickling from the corner of his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Woman, after today, I'll forget about you completely. In the future, our paths will no longer cross." Qing Shui thought to himself silently.</span></p>
 <p><span>"It must be that Qing Shui's injuries are acting up! It must be!" Someone from Starmoon Hall exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span>"It must be so. Qing Shui had suffered from such heavy injuries the other time. If it was any other people, they would have already fallen."</span></p>
 <p><span>...</span></p>
 <p><span>Even so, both Qing Shui and Feng Wuji suffered from very serious internal injuries. However, Qing Shui knew that his condition was not very serious, but he had given Feng Wuji a few hidden ailments. Three years, he would be crippled after a maximum of three years.</span></p>
 <p><span>It seemed as if Qing Shui had lost this battle, but at the same time, the other party was not able to move an inch either. When Qing Shui fell, he told himself, "I can now forget about her and no longer owe her anything anymore. This is already the best return I can give her."</span></p>
 <p><span>Regardless if it was Feng Wuji winning by a little bit, or if he had taken advantage of Qing Shui's existing injuries, that battle scene was still engraved in everyone's mind. It was &nbsp;both beautiful but yet filled with the taste of destruction.</span></p>
 <p><span>No matter what, Feng Wuji had gotten his goal, and this was also what Qing Shui wanted!</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Wuji left, and so did Qing Shui and the two ladies. Qing Shui smiled bitterly as he looked at the two ladies. He had initially wanted to spend time with them today to drive away their worries.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I'm sorry, I had wanted to spend time with the two of you!" Qing Shui said, his face very pale. After all, he was truly injured.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Don't talk anymore. I'm feeling very upset. When would you be able to take better care of yourself?" Huoyun Liu-Li asked, her eyes turning red.</span></p>
 <p><span>But Canghai Mingyue did not say anything, only occasionally looking at Qing Shui in a daze!</span></p>
 <p><span>A bit of a complicated expression appeared in that pair of pitch-black and profound eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>At that moment, Qing Shui finally knew why most people would prefer women who are a bit foolish. Foolish women tended to appear very cute easily...</span></p>
