 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing knew this as well, but she hadn't noticed it as early as Qing Shui had. Right now, seeing Tantai Lingyan standing amidst the ice and snow, she seemed to be dancing together with the snowflakes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had stopped everything in the surroundings. At this time, there wouldn't be anyone coming to disturb her. An epiphany like this was hard to encounter even in several decades. He was well aware of the benefits and could almost describe this as a rebirth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a person's great fortune to encounter an epiphany once in a lifetime. If it was in Qing Shui's previous life, there was the saying ‘a single comprehension allowed one to gain enlightenment to become a Buddha.’ This went to show how powerful an epiphany was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, the saying from Qing Shui's previous life could have been exaggerated but after a great comprehension, one would go through a tremendous change and get ahead of many people in life. It was like a saint from Qing Shui's previous life, who knew a lot more compared to the ordinary people. Another saying was one would experience a tremendous change inside one’s own body, for example, at a genetic level. There was also the statement that there were many other ‘universes’ in everyone's bodies. Furthermore, in the bodies of saints, their inner worlds had been truly awakened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After coming to this world, Qing Shui had also experienced epiphanies before and it had been more than once. With each experience, not only was his mind clearer, but his brain had experienced great development; his body's toughness and other aspects also improved qualitatively. Even his talent or aptitude would be increased by a notch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Epiphany was the greatest miracle medicine!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time ticked by and 15 minutes had passed. Qing Shui felt very agitated. 15 minutes wasn't considered bad. In usual cases, 15 minutes would pass by in a flash, but at this moment, 15 minutes seemed to be very long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this world, time was split into 12 sections in a day, with each section representing two hours. Qing Shui was more accustomed to calculating the time by hours.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During this time, Qin Qing didn't say a word. She also would like to see Tantai Lingyan becoming even stronger. They were very close sisters, always together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another 15 minutes passed by. Qing Shui was happy to see that Tantai Lingyan was still in a trance. However, before he could feel happy about it, something happened. A snow-white longsword suddenly appeared in Tantai Lingyan's hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Goddess' Sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan had once obtained the Goddess Divine Set together with Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sword dance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the amazing feeling that Tantai Lingyan was giving off and knew that she hadn't yet come out from the epiphany. He felt especially happy. This was enough. Even if she were to wake up immediately, the benefits that she received from this session would be sufficient. However, from the looks of it, it hadn’t ended yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her sword moved together with her, bringing around streams of ice pulses. Those translucent things that looked like ice silk seemed gentle and soft, but Qing Shui knew that their prowess was definitely terrifying. They had powerful characteristics of the five elements on them but it wasn't really the combination of the five elements. Ice was under the water element but it had the sharpness of the metal element, the strong vitality of the wood element, the violent power of the fire element and the great strength of the earth element...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan's sword dance grew increasingly faster, yet still remained very clear and the rhythm was very good. She had gotten many times stronger but that powerful sword dance didn't affect any of the snowflakes in the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Qing Shui was amazed by her great mastery over the Origin Qi and Qi Force. It was like a person who could kill a cow with a single punch, yet having the mastery to not kill a baby despite launching the same punch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a realm in which one could circulate their forces and strength to the extreme. Of course, Tantai Lingyam's realm had improved by many levels compared to how it was before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This continued for less than 30 minutes before Tantai Lingyan came to a stop. The aura she exuded was very mysterious, with an indescribable charm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mmmm!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To Qing Shui's surprise, he sensed that Tantai Lingyan’s aura was similar to the one’s he had sensed from Shen Huang and Sheng Jun. Although it wasn't as powerful as theirs, it was very close.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time around, Tantai Lingyan's improvement was tremendous. It was a terrifying leap. On the path of martial arts, most people were usually stuck before reaching the Heavenly Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, at the initial phase, it would depend on one's aptitude, while at the later phase, it would be restricted by one's realm. It was like frogs at the bottom of the well. They knew nothing of the outside world and felt that the world at the bottom of the well was the entire world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a difference in one's realm. The reason many people were stuck at a bottleneck, unable to progress further, was due to the realm that they were at. Frogs in the outside world would be able to jump further with just a casual jump, compared to the frogs at the bottom of the well. They only need a casual glance to be able to see many times further than those at the bottom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything in the surroundings calmed down and the moment Tantai Lingyan turned her head to look back, she saw Qin Qing and Qin Qing in the distance. There was a mysterious glow in her eyes and when matched with her cold and beautiful aura, she gave off an amazing feeling of beauty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Extremely cold, yet driving the world crazy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After seeing Qing Shui and Qin Qing, she broke into a happy smile. Qing Shui and Qin Qing went up next to her. Qing Shui smiled very happily as he looked at her, "Our Little Yanyan has benefited tremendously from this."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan's face turned red as she threw Qing Shui an annoyed glance, "You're being so disgusting."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing also smiled and said, "This name is good. Our Little Yanyan might be secretly elated over it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled awkwardly, "Little Qing Qing is jealous."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Who's jealous?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan smiled happily and said, "Alright, let's head to the Imperial Cuisine Hall. It'll be dark soon."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them arrived at the Imperial Cuisine Hall very quickly. Nothing had changed and everything was as normal as they had left. Three months' time was considered very short. Previously, despite that several years had passed, there hadn't been many changes either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Tantai Lingyan's strength should be about the same as Qing Shui’s, or maybe just a little bit weaker. However, it was definitely over 250,000 Dao force. As for how much her actual battle strength could reach, Qing Shui wasn't sure. In his case, his physical strength was only 350,000 Dao force but in an actual battle, he could unleash a power that was many times greater.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Tong and the others were especially happy to see Qing Shui and the others back. Ling Fei was pregnant. She was already pregnant for a couple of months when they had left. With three months passing by, the child would due in another two months.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Tong was very happy. It was important for them to have a few kids now. Otherwise, as they got stronger, they might end up not being able to have any. There were many such cases in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When one was strong, it was hard for them to have descendants. However, if they were to have a child, the child's talent and aptitude would be very good. Therefore, many people would be especially happy to get a child in their late years. It wasn't just because they managed to have a child, but also there would be someone who could inherit their legacies.</span></p>
