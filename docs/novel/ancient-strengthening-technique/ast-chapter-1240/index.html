 <p><strong>AST 1240 - The people who supported Qing Shui. The tyrannical weakening abilities. Speed</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t really feel anything towards the people from Saint Child Gang who were spraying out their saliva at him. He hoped that he could make Saint Child lose his calm with his sharp words. Even though the hope was a bit unrealistic, he still wanted to give it a try.</p>
 <p>This was also why Qing Shui got Eldest Princess involved. Of course, he could already tell that Eldest Princess wasn’t fond of Saint Child. Basically, it was impossible that she would like him, that’s why he did it. After all, Eldest Princess wasn’t his, Qing Shui’s woman. If she was his woman, he would have long since fought against Saint Child as if his life depended on it instead of waiting until now.</p>
 <p>Thinking up to this point, Qing Shui couldn’t help but think that this might really be effective. There was no perfect person in this world. Everyone would have their own flaws. It was said, “One who knows his own strength and that of the enemy, will be invincible in battle”. Only by grasping the opponent’s weakness would one be able to deal a killing blow to the enemy.</p>
 <p>“Father, I support you, beat him!”</p>
 <p>The voice which suddenly came through caused the people all around to be tremendously shocked. A lot of people looked towards Qing Sha in surprise. Qing Sha on the other hand, pretended nothing had happened and let out yet another scream. Previously, people really still didn’t have any idea who Qing Sha was supporting. But as she screamed out yet again, a lot of people witnessed that she was screaming in the direction of Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, we support you, the Breezing Wind Veranda supports you!” Yan Jinyu shouted at this moment.</p>
 <p>“Little brother, I also support you! Beat him!” Tian Jiange’s voice came through.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>After that, more and more voices which stated they supported Qing Shui came through. Originally, the fact that the Breezing Wind Veranda supported Qing Shui had already caused the crowd to feel incomparably shocked. This also meant that the Breezing Wind Veranda was very close to Qing Shui. The crowds all thought that the battle on the arena was a battle between two rivals in love.</p>
 <p>After that, even Tian Jiange’s voice was heard. This made even more people drop their glasses. A lot of people knew that Tian Jiange was from Lord Sect. Originally, Lord Sect was neutral in the battle today.</p>
 <p>However, Tian Jiange promised Qing Shui that he wanted to be on his side and face it together with him. This scream took a lot of courage.</p>
 <p>“Since when is Lord Sect on the same side as Breezing Wind Veranda?”</p>
 <p>“Exactly. Even though Lord Sect and Saint Child Gang have always been competing against each other, they have never once taken part in things like this. Could it be that the leader in Lord Sect is also attracted to that woman?”</p>
 <p>“I am from Lord Sect. I have never heard of us taking any sides before.”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, what’s going on?”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui observed Saint Child whom still looked calm. He knew that actually, deep down, the Saint Child’s heart had already started to waver. The reason being that not only Breezing Wind Veranda supported him, even Lord Sect was behaving similarly.</p>
 <p>Lord Sect might be powerful but it wasn’t enough to put pressure on Saint Child. The main pressure which he got was from Breezing Wind Veranda voicing out that they supported Qing Shui. Even though he hasn’t fought but even if he was to emerge victorious eventually, he would still feel that he lost.</p>
 <p>This kind of thought made him feel really tired. He had never been like this before or rather, he hadn’t felt this way in many years. For the first time, he felt like a clown standing there.</p>
 <p>“Let’s begin!” Qing Shui said gently while looking at Saint Child.</p>
 <p>“Yeah. Let’s get on with it. You can start first. I am afraid you might only have few chances for that.” Saint Child looked at Qing Shui with bright eyes. At this moment, he was once again burning with confidence. It’s just like a burning sun.</p>
 <p>“Alright then, my pleasure.”</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui finished speaking, he took out the Big Dipper Sword and immediately used the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation.</p>
 <p>Following up, Qing Shui summoned the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant!</p>
 <p>The appearance of the formidable Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant in the sky shocked lot of people. Anyone could tell that the dragon elephant was extraordinary. The pressure and aura it emitted already made a lot of people fearful.</p>
 <p>The expression of Saint Child changed slightly. Qing Shui knew that now, at least he had begun paying attention to Qing Shui. The fact that he began taking him seriously meant that he himself was a lot stronger than the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant but he still didn’t dare to let down his guard.</p>
 <p>Dragon Roaming Step, Nine Palace Orientation!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s body was like a roaming dragon in water as he charged towards Saint Child.</p>
 <p>Piercing Sword!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui swiftly thrust out his sword towards Saint Child without any flashy moves. It was as if he suddenly appeared beside Saint Child. That spot was an extremely tricky spot. It was a blind spot.</p>
 <p>Saint Child moved his body. With graceful steps, he easily avoided Qing Shui’s attacks.</p>
 <p>His footwork was very fast. Fast to the extent that it had ascended to an artistic state.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui on the other hand, was relying on the mysterious features of his Dragon Roaming Step and Nine Palace Orientation. He was testing the limits of Saint Child with this.</p>
 <p>But to his surprise, his opponent managed to dodge it fairly easily.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also stopped hiding anything. He immediately raised his speed to its maximum and thrust out the sword in his hand with technique from Taichi fists.</p>
 <p>Saint Child’s eyes were shining brightly. He once again avoided his attacks a number of times and proceeded to open his mouth and say, “You have to be careful now!”</p>
 <p>His calm voice came through. After that, instead of retreating, he charged in and thrust out his right hand. This hand seemed really long and soft but it looked incomparably bizarre. It even seemed like it contained a tough and unyielding energy as it instantly extended up to Qing Shui’s sword edge as he executed his Single Finger Flick.</p>
 <p>Violet Gold Slash!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui abruptly raised his power to its maximum. This was Qing Shui’s temporary explosive force. For a short while, he exploded with terrifying strength.</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>A clear noise rang out.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s body got blown backwards really quickly. The formidable attack from before went straight into Qing Shui’s meridians through the sword’s body. If Qing Shui’s meridians weren’t powerful enough, this kind of force would have immediately caused a serious injury to Qing Shui. It might even destroy his meridians as a result.</p>
 <p>To think that he could actually pull off attacks like these once he was strong enough.</p>
 <p>Today, Qing Shui was considered to have broadened his horizons. From this attack alone, Qing Shui wasn’t sure about Saint Child’s true strength. But he knew that he was a lot more powerful than him. Maybe Saint Child was testing him as he didn’t release his full strength.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui controlled the Nine Continents Mountain and charged it towards Saint Child. He crushed it against him with full force.</p>
 <p>“If this is all you have got, you are not qualified to challenge me.” Saint Child shook his head. He turned his hand from a palm into a fist and immediately punched the Nine Continents Mountain.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The Nine Continents Mountain immediately got blown backwards. Qing Shui was controlling it with his consciousness. He he extended his hands and clapped a few times to set the Nine Continents Mountain in place.</p>
 <p>Difference, this was the difference. Qing Shui had expected things to be like this. After all, his current attack contained prowess of less than three million nimbus. The Nine Continents Mountain may be worth five million nimbus, it was still not enough when up against an opponent like Saint Child.</p>
 <p>“Of course not. Later on, you will know what else I have,” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“That demonic beast? Even though it’s not bad, it’s still not a match against me. If you are going to rely on it, you will still lose.” Saint Child extended his hand and took out a javelin. It was silver-white in color. On top of it, there was a powerful killing intention being emitted from it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know if this battle technique was a legendary grade weapon. But it should be really close to it.</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui was really nervous. Saint Child was really powerful. But it wasn’t to the point of Qing Shui being powerless in fighting against him. He summoned the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant with his mind.</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demon!</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>Without any hesitation, Qing Shui jumped onto the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. He immediately called upon it, as he could no longer let down his guard.</p>
 <p>Kong!</p>
 <p>Diamond Sword Qi!</p>
 <p>As this went on, even Qing Shui was stunned. He had actually weakened about 6 million nimbus of his strength. That meant that Saint Child originally began with strength of more than 20 million but now, he was left with no more than 15 million nimbus of strength.</p>
 <p>Powerful, the water in Heaven Secrets Academy was indeed deep. He wondered what level Saint Child’s strength belonged to within the Heaven Secrets Academy. Was he considered to be at one of the highest levels within the pyramid? How many more people were there who were more powerful than him?</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qing Shui was already standing on top of the dragon elephant. Using the State of One with Elephant now could help make his strength achieve more than 11 million nimbus. But even with this being the case, there was still a difference of about four million nimbus in strength.</p>
 <p>“You actually have this kind of tyrannical weakening martial technique?” Saint Child said in shock after looking at Qing Shui for quite a while.</p>
 <p>Considering that his strength dropped from the original 21 million down to barely 15 million, this had still caused quite an enormous impact on him. This was the most depressing thing one could experience. It was not that he wasn’t strong enough, it was just that his strength has been weakened by someone else out of nowhere. This kind of feeling was enough to make someone spurt blood.</p>
 <p>“Take this!” Qing Shui shouted. He called upon the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and immediately charged towards him.</p>
 <p>State of One with Elephant!</p>
 <p>Mighty Dragon Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>Bang…...</p>
 <p>It was an enormous explosive power. The entire sky had been burst open. Everywhere, greyish dark mushroom clouds could be seen. It spread a wide range around the sky. The weather in the four continents had abundant Origin Qi. As compared to the five continents, it was even harder to pierce through the sky.</p>
 <p>There were explosions all around in the air. Even heaven and earth were shaking and tearing apart.</p>
 <p>Saint Child’s face finally changed a little. A layer of silver white colored armor appeared on his body. The five meter long War Halberd in his hand suddenly shot out a strong and violent “Gasosaurus” and charged towards the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Mountain.</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui didn’t want to make the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant interact with Saint Child too early.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had long since avoided it with the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. He temporarily gave up his control over the Nine Continents Mountain. No matter how powerful it was, the Nine Continents Mountain would come to a stop after it exceeded Qing Shui’s maximum distance at which he could control the mountain.</p>
 <p>Primordial Flame Dragon Whip!</p>
 <p>Eight-eight Divine Nebula Formation!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui only whipped his opponent’s head. His Spirit Energy Attack was a lot more powerful than his physical attacks.</p>
 <p>Spirit Energy Attacks were often weird and tricky. However, it wasn’t able to threaten his opponents. Even if occasionally, it happened to burst out with critical attacks, the gap in strength between him and his opponent was still really big.</p>
 <p>Tire him! He should first tire him out!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was controlling the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. From time to time, he would use the Instantaneous Diamond Evasion and the Ferocious Dragon Elephant Attack.</p>
 <p>Under the State of One with Elephant, even though he still got blown back by the opponent, the powerful physical body of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was surprisingly able to take it. This was what shocked Qing Shui. As long as it could take his attack, Qing Shui would have ways to tire him to death.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out a Heavenly Talisman. He quickly slammed a few of them which helped boosted strength, against the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and tossed a few which reduced strength, towards Saint Child.</p>
 <p>And also Buddha’s True Eyes!</p>
 <p>Maybe because the gap between their strengths was too large, the Buddha’s True Eyes was uneffective. It might also have been because his opponent had a lot of things with him. In any case, the Buddha’s True Eyes didn’t manage to succeed.</p>
 <p>Seal of Xuantian!</p>
 <p>Za!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui remained calm and unhurried. He immediately raised up his hand and an enormous silver platform appeared in the sky. It smashed Saint Child who was below and for a moment, made him freeze in shock. But this was also only for a moment. That time interval was so short that it was almost unnoticeable.</p>
 <p>When he had weakened the strength of Saint Child previously, he had also weakened part of his speed. The Diamond Sword Qi reduced speed. The Seal of Xuantian also did the same. With these, the effects could already be seen clearly.</p>
 <p>Originally, Qing Shui specialized in both speed and footwork. The Instantaneous Diamond Evasion of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was something that didn’t even need to be talked about. Both him and the dragon elephant shared thoughts with each other. Even under the State of One with Elephant, the Nine Palace Orientation could still be used.</p>
 <p>Do not look down on the speed and appearance of a demonic beast. A lot of the martial techniques of humans were learned from demonic beasts. For example, Qing Shui’s Dragon Roaming Step and Nine Animals Mimicry Technique.</p>
 <p>The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant had its Dragon Elephant Step. It was just as abstruse. Hence, now, with both Qing Shui and the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant being in the state of One with Elephant, they had finally managed to gain some advantage in speed.</p>
 <p>Speed meant power. Speed was the only factor that could never be destroyed among all the martial arts in the world. In front of absolute speed, everything was a paper tiger. But as if it would be easy to get absolute speed. Now that Qing Shui could gain some advantage with his speed, he felt like he finally managed to see brightness from the dark sky.</p>
