Is being pretty useful?</strong></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as Qing Shui entered Tantai Lingyan’s courtyard, he could already see Tantai Lingyan standing inher pavilion. Coincidentally, when Qing Shui was looking at her, she happened to be looking back in this direction. She revealed a pleasant expression at the moment when she saw Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In return, Qing Shui showed her a delightful smile. He felt more at ease now. Prior to this, he was really worried that the woman would turn cold after two years of secluding herself from the world. But now, he realized that not only has she not turned back to how cold she used to be, she seemed to have even thought through a lot of things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui walked towards the pavilion and began examining her entire body in an exaggerated manner. Indeed, she was a heavenly beauty whose beauty was to the extent that it could cause a person to skip one heartbeat. Her skin looked pale like that of a jade and smooth like snow, making her looked unusually attractive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Congratulations for finishing your seclusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s there to congratulate about. To think that two years passed. How have you been?”Tantai Lingyan looked at Qing Shui and gently asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like usual, her voice still sounded really cold. But Qing Shui could clearly hear the gentle tone in it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How did it go? How strong are you now?” Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s good. I have managed to increase about one third of my strength.”Tantai Lingyan said in a relaxed tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, Qing Shui was able to sense Tantai Lingyan’s strength. It was currently worth around one hundred and fifty million sun. She was benefited greatly from her seclusion this time. The reason for the seclusion was due to her significant power increase while she was in the Ancient Ruins. Added on that she has reached a bottleneck, she needed the time to seclude herself to stabilize her strength. Speaking of stabilization, not only did she manage to build an even sturdier foundation, she has also managed to greatly improve her strength. This could already be considered a significant improvement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I saw an entire area of Camphorwood forest nearby. Not only does the place have a nice scenery, there is a unusually large amount of flowers and trees there as well. You just came out of your seclusion, why not we go take a look at the scenery there?” Qing Shui asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan stunned. Even though she was a girl, not knowing since when, she has started to lose this kind of emotion, nor did she ever get to experience it again. At the moment when Qing Shui talked to her about it, she stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stared at her stunned expression. He who was very experienced at this kind of field was sure that she would agree to it. It’s just that she would need time to reminisce about it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, I also haven’t relaxed myself like this in a long time, it’s not like I have had the time to do so.” Tantai Lingyan said gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lingyan, did you notice that you have changed?” Qing Shui smiled. The woman has changed a lot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Change? What change?” Tantai Lingyan was aware of what Qing Shui was saying. Despite that, she still asked him the question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You talk more often than you used to. You also sound more natural and less cold than before.” Qing Shui smiled and looked at her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that so?” Tantai Lingyan wasn’t really sure herself. The only thing she was aware of was that she has gone through slight changes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, it’s really obvious! Alright, let’s go! I will lead you the way!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment when he finished speaking, regardless of whether Tantai Lingyan has agreed to it, Qing Shui immediately grabbed on both of her hands and unleashed the Nine Continents Steps Effects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In just an instant, they appeared at the valley where the Camphorwood Forest was located at. The forest itself was only ten meters away from the valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before this, when Qing Shui grabbed her hand, it made the woman felt a bit powerless. Qing Shui could be really naughty at times. And at other times, he would also play the serious role. Sometimes, he could be really warm, whereas, sometimes, he would show his manliness. Sometimes, he was a bit of a scoundrel, yet sometimes, he was really pure in thought. She couldn’t bring herself to deny him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like now, when she saw his pure and excited eyes. The excitement didn’t actually come out from himself, in fact, he actually hoped to see her most earnest heart. She was aware of that, which was why she was reluctant to push his hands away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There wasn’t even the slightest wind on the valley. The air was filled with fragrance. Below their feet was lush and luxuriant vendure. The thick grassland was a lot more superior to the fields which he saw from his previous incarnation. Though this might be natural grass, it looked even better than those man-made ones.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Camphorwood forest here was covered entirely in fiery red color. When looked from far away, it looked like an entire burning cloud. Sweet and abundant fragrance was emitted from it. This kind of trees wasn’t actually that tall. It’s standard size was approximately ten meters tall. Each of the trees was very far away from each other, leaving a huge gap in between. Despite this, it still gave people the feeling that they were in a forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s unknown whether Qing Shui was purposely doing it or he has truly forgotten about it. He grabbed on Tantai Lingyan’s hand and walked towards the Camphorwood forest together with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan looked at Qing Shui and seemed like she wanted to say something. But in the end, she chose to keep it to herself. She let the man held her hand as he pleased. Suddenly, she realized that it wasn’t really uncomfortable to be held by a man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But if it had been another men, she would definitely have rejected them without even the slightest hesitation. As of now, if someone other than Qing Shui dared to walk up to her and grabbed her hand, she would most likely kill that person.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lingyan, this is a really nice place, isn’t it?” Qing Shui walked into the Camphorwood Forest and asked happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, it is a really nice place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui moved his eyes to the corner and grabbed the woman’s hand. As he did so, a faint smile was revealed at the corner of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan happened to see Qing Shui’s smile. One thing which confused her was why she would feel happy seeing this kind of smile from Qing Shui? To have this man holding her hand and feeling good about it, it’s a feeling she found unable to depict in words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For her to allow Qing Shui to hold her hand, adding on the things which happened between them, she already knew what happened to her deep down. If she was to entrust herself to a man, it would definitely be the man beside her right now. If one day, this man was to disappear, no matter through what method, she would never have looked for another men.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, for now, she wouldn’t really resist certain close interactions with this man. The only problem was that he was too good of taking advantage of the situation. Given her personality, it’s already an exception that he was able to do this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you really think that I wouldn’t know? This is your reward, don’t get too happy about it.” Tantai Lingyan slightly swayed her hand that was being grabbed on by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stunned. He turned around to look at the ice-cold beauty who was having a faint smile across her face and said in an upset tone, “Why must you tell me about it? I would have felt happier if you hadn’t done so.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The main reason why Qing Shui was stunned before was mainly due to the things which she has said, not that she has managed to see through his thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can tell you are trying to be really careful. Won’t you feel awkward?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, Lingyan, you are actually feeling sorry for me. Alright then, let’s go stroll around the area.” Qing Shui said shamelessly. After that, he proceeded to hold her hand even tighter. It’s as if he was really scared that she would disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan wasn’t angry when she heard Qing Shui’s words. She immediately turned silent. She felt a bit strange at the moment when she heard what Qing Shui said. In fact, she has even begun to notice that her heart was beating faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was this the feeling of being in love?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While thinking about these matters, Tantai Lingyan blushed. It might seem really shallow, her beauty was already enough to take away one’s soul. Standing on one side, Qing Shui looked at the woman who was a bit distracted only to find his heart beating faster and faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s as if Tantai Lingyan was able to sense Qing Shui’s passionate eyes. She turned around and looked at Qing Shui. Like usual, her eyes still looked ice-cold. The close-distance gaze they shared with each other made Qing Shui felt as if he just got splashed by a pail of cold-water. Deep down, he felt really pleased. For women like her, he mustn’t go hard with her. No matter how things turned out last time, it has left her with a haunting experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You look really beautiful!” Qing Shui smiled and said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman turned to the side and ignored him. But her ears could be seen turning pink. Both of them looked really bright and attractive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman held Qing Shui’s hand and walked towards a spot with flowers on a higher ground. This was a plain filled with cluster of flowers. The flowers, together in different colors, had a kind of beauty which words couldn’t describe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the middle of the clusters of flowers, Tantai Lingyan looked warmer than ever before. She has got a slender figure. Both of her upright breasts have got the most beautiful shape one can ever have. The round and upraised butt of hers was capable of even taking away one’s soul. Her slightly loose-fitting cloth was unable to hide her attractive body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Am I that good to look at?” The woman asked Qing Shui when she saw him distracted,</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!” Qing Shui responded in a decisive tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tell me, is being pretty useful?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A lot!” Qing Shui answered after a few thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do you mean a lot?” Tantai Lingyan continued to question Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are way too many benefits with looking good. For instance, looking beautiful has the ability to warm others hearts and eyes when being looked at. Just like a beautiful scenery, a beautiful person is also capable of doing that. Once that happens, it will help make that person in a good mood. With a good state of mind will mean faster cultivation speed and lower risk of going crazy as a result. Not only will minor ailments not appear, it can also keep a person young. As the saying says, a smile prolongs life. Once a person heart is warmed, he will naturally feel happy. The way he is going to express his happiness will be to smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan stared at Qing Shui. She never expected for him to say so much. To think that he would relate looking good to cultivating. Furthermore, the things which he also mentioned about keeping a person who cultivated from going crazy and preventing ailments also completely made her helpless on how she should respond to him. What Qing Shui said might have been true. However, in no way would it be as dramatic as how he said it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you not believe me?”Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I do……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled when he heard her response. He held her hand and stopped discussing about the previous topic. Instead, they begun to talk about something more relaxing. The majority of the conversations was mainly done by Qing Shui. Tantai Lingyan sat at the side and listened to what he has to say.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without noticing, almost half a day passed. The sun has already set now. The remaining light from the sunset shone on the land, causing the entire place to be covered in red. After roaming around the area together for a while, the two of them immediately unleashed the Nine Continents Steps Effect to return to Demon Lord Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui was about to bid his farewell, he got stopped by Tantai Lingyan. After hesitating for a long time, she opened her mouth and said, “Let’s have dinner together. I will prepare the meal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">。</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before this, Qing shui was really agitated. Her look when she was hesitating just now has made Qing Shui thought a lot. He thought she was going to say something serious. But then, as he thought seriously about it, it was quite normal for the woman to say something like this. In fact, if it was the other way around, it would have been really strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This word has caused Qing Shui to reach his limit. This was the first time the woman ever invited him for a dinner, naturally, he would agree to it. When the woman said that she wanted to prepare the meals on her own, Qing Shui didn’t intend to stop her. Instead, he decided to go with her to act as a supportive role for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The size of the kitchen was considered average. Qing Shui saw different types of vegetables and meat while he was in the kitchen. To his surprise, not only did the woman not seem incompatible with the kitchen, it only gave him even stronger urges to look at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman looked really skillful when she was preparing the meal. According to her, she practiced it when she secluded herself. She didn’t add the flavorings which Qing Shui gave her this time. Despite this, it still tasted unusually good. Qing Shui wondered if it was just an illusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is today a special day?” Qing Shui asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan shook. After that, she gently replied, “ No, it’s just a usual day.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They really enjoyed their meal today. This somehow had to do with their mood today. Qing Shui was in an unusually good mood today. This could be considered as another kind of breakthrough and improvement. Naturally, considering that he received such a huge surprise just on the first time they met after her seclusion, it’s not surprising that he would feel so happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To Qing Shui, it’s as if Tantai Lingyan has gone through a complete change in personality. However, that was only to Qing Shui. From other’s perspective, she was still the usual cold and beautiful Demon Lord.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They spent almost an hour to finish their meal. By now, the entire sky was already dark.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, the sky is turning dark.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can I please stay behind to help you keep watch of the living room?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No.” Tantai Lingyan didn’t get angry over the things which Qing Shui said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well then, am I allowed to occasionally come here to get some rice in the future?” Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
