 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui regained some confidence and worried less about the matter. He kept himself occupied by refining medicine and carrying out bizarre experiments. He also instructed in others’ training, improved their constitutions and strengthened their foundations with his Art of Healing and other abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One day, as the sun was well up, a big group of people came. They were dressed uniquely, apparently from the same place. Their shirt was silver-colored with a hand-sized checkerboard on its lower left corner. It was finely decorated with some chess pieces on top. Some of them had similar checkerboards, with a different number of black and white chessmen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heavenly Chess Immortal Palace!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Needless to say, the Heavenly Chess Immortal Palace was here. The leading one was a middle-aged guy who was lean and appeared tall. His hair was messy. He appeared seemingly experienced in life but neat-looking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His deep and sorrowful eyes were strongly pressuring just by being there. His exact age was unknown, but he shouldn't be too old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui figured out that cultivation was essential from a very young age. One must be absolutely talented during their youth to go places as they grew up. Time was crucial, but the natural quality was even more vital. Hence, one would be deemed to be worthless if they had no achievements before the age of 100. Late bloomers weren’t a frequent thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After 100 years, one could still improve rapidly, but they would often reach their peak at 200 years old. After that, their advancement depended on accumulation and great fortune. Thus, some powerful warriors were very young, around 200 years old. Yet, a 1000-year-old senior monster would have his own dreadful abilities under years of intensive study. His experiences would lead to specialized and might have a miraculous effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At around 200 years old, a warrior was usually tenacious. At that time, they would have a matured mind, a developed strength, and probably at their peak stage of life. Later on, they would reach a peaceful stage with or without breakthroughs due to a different state of the realm. That was common when they had owned whatever they desired and gained all the satisfaction. They would finally settle down gradually and that would be after 300 or 400 years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this stage, it was very critical to cultivate one’s moral character. To be open-hearted towards conflicts, and to understand things in life thoroughly was necessary. Some would start feeling pessimistic in this phase when they could no longer find their life pursuits. With powerful strengths, loads of properties, plenty of wives, and many attendants, they had the absolute power and full control of life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Qing Shui’s view, the man before him was slightly older than 100 years. He looked unspirited yet slick. It was hard to define his stand between good and evil. His messy, long hair gave him an unspoken charm of a matured man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui discovered that this man looked alike with Dongfang Zhiqiu and reckoned they were somehow related. The man led more than a hundred men and was accompanied by roughly ten elderlies behind him. Those old men were not inferior to the Taizhai Brothers in any aspects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly Chess Immortal Palace was indeed generous. They seemed to send many capable men this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eldest brother!” At that moment, Dongfang Zhiqiu stepped out and shouted out happily. Soon after, she walked over in a hurry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xiao Qiu!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dongfang Zhiqiu hugged the man joyfully while he patted her head affectionately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui observed by the side. Dongfang Zhiqiu was a matured and domineering beauty, but she acted like a little girl in front of this man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After some time, she separated herself from the man and looked at Qing Shui bashfully, noticing that she had forgotten herself earlier on. Pulling on the man’s hands, she said, “Eldest brother, let me introduce. This is Qing Shui. He has saved my life several times.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hello, Mr.Qing. I thank you for saving my little sister. I shall greatly reward you later.” Said the man out of courtesy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and shook his head, “Hello, Mr. Dongfang. I didn’t save your sister for the rewards. We were just on the same team at that time. It was my duty to help. You’re welcome.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xiao Qiu, Father had asked you to go home. Don’t join in any other affairs here.” The man told Dongfang Zhiqiu after nodding to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother, I won’t leave. The Great Confucian Empire has their sights on this place. The Five Poison Immortal Palace will probably come too. I owed my life to them. I have to face it with them.” Dongfang Zhiqiu’s expression became serious after listening to the man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Great Confucian Empire and the Five Poison Immortal Palace are no weaker than our Heavenly Chess Immortal Palace. You can’t help with anything here. Go home. I will stay here in your stead. Come and be nice.” The man said in a gentle tone with his deep stare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll stay along with you to fight them.” Dongfang Zhiqiu looked uneasy and continued appealing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled calmingly, “Listen to your brother and return to your home. It will be fine here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man was surprised after hearing Qing Shui’s words. He wondered how this young man could be so confident. The main reason he came today was only to bring Dongfang Zhiqiu home. Others’ fate was really none of his business.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was not a cold-hearted person but it was the survival of the fittest. Under certain circumstances, one should be more resolute and relentless. Or else, he might not be able to sustain the resultant loss. The man admitted being a loyal person. However, it was too knotty in this case. Both the Great Confucian Empire and the Five Poison Immortal Palace were not to be trifled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Brother Shui, you had offered to rescue me many times. I would rather die than to leave now. I will not return.” Dongfang Zhiqiu firmly asserted. By now, anyone knew that it would be impossible to convince her to go home, except by using special measures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xiao Qiu, listen to me!” The man said, while tapping on the side of Dongfang Zhiqiu’s neck. This action made her faint immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui simply looked at the man. Neither did he stop him nor say anything. He could see that this man had no bad intentions to Dongfang Zhiqiu. Instead, he treasured her very much. Qing Shui knew that they were blood siblings, based on their powerful strengths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mr. Qing, I might be selfish, but I have no other choice. I can’t make the decision in a big Sect. You’ve saved my sister. I will try my best to satisfy your requests. What would you want?” The man asked Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Surprisingly, he was straightforward and seemed to be leaving. Qing Shui had nothing to say to a man like this. Though knowing that he had come here to take Dongfang Zhiqiu back, Qing Shui thought that it was rather inappropriate for him to simply leave after he had completed his objective. However, the current situation and the people behind him essentially forced him to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was not moved, so he nodded calmly, “I don't need anything and you owe me nothing. Wake her up and I will make her go back with you willingly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man hesitated a while before tapping Dongfang Zhiqiu’s body. Not before long, Dongfang Zhiqiu came back to consciousness. She was agitated the moment she woke up. She struggled away from the man when she noticed Qing Shui’s presence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go back with your brother. You can't help me with anything even if you stay. After going through these days, you should know that I am capable of protecting myself. It's meaningless to insist. You'll only leave without awareness. Listen to me and go back. We will meet again in the future.” Qing Shui said, leaving no room for an argument.</span></p>
