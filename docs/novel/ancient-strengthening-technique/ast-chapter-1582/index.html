 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had already discovered Muyun Qingge’s arrival and turned his head over to greet her. He actually felt a bit awkward as he’d seen her body when he’d healed her before and had even touched her. There wasn’t any other alternative at that time, but some affairs were already done and nothing could change that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange also stopped after seeing Muyun Qingge. She happily went over to her and grasped her hand, “How come elder sis is here? Are you bothered about anything?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did you forget your elder sis after getting a husband?” Muyun Qingge teased her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange smiled at her and seeing her unnatural appearance, she asked, “What? Are you envious?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge shook her head in disdain, “Men are no good. I’ll never try to find a man.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her words were true to her, but when she said them, a silhouette appeared in her mind. This silhouette kept becoming clearer and finally changed into Qing Shui, which caused chaos in her heart. That feeling was quite terrible, an indescribable pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bis sis, I’ve never offended you.” Qing Shui came over laughing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge looked at Qing Shui. The longer she associated with him, the more this man gave her that inexplicable feeling. It was like the spring wind. It didn’t seem dazzling but still had an inexplicable feeling that would submerge one in it little by little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great Guardian, can you tell me how many women you have? If you only have Jiange, then this rank won’t be yours. How about it?” Muyun Qingge was set on the fact that Qing Shui had several women.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui almost choked and gave an embarrassed laugh, “Women are indeed too narrow minded. You can’t be so careless in evaluating a man. A man with several women proves his excellence. It’s for sure that such a man is a good man.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t you realize that your words are letting our Jiange down? You speak about equality of the sexes, but can you allow your woman to do the same as you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge’s calm words let Qing Shui speechless. Yiye Jiange laughed at this time, saying, “What are you even debating? Is there a need to do this? You’re both too extreme.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, let’s change the topic. Elder sis, is something bothering you?” Yiye Jiange asked to shift the subject.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge nodded with a smile. She wasn’t targeting Qing Shui and really, she didn’t personally feel bothered. Actually, her heart was conflicted. She felt that Qing Shui was a good man, and that it’d be perfect if he only had a single woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui originally still wanted to reason with her but he knew that it was impossible to get her approval no matter what was said in regards to this matter. It was already quite good that she wasn’t disgusted by this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt that without the use of any irregular means, it was possible for a woman to like a man. And if there were many who liked the man, it meant that the man ought to have a lot of positive aspects. If not, even if one case could be considered a fluke, all of the rest couldn’t be the same, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them sat down in the living room. Muyun Qingge looked at Qing Shui and he also looked at her. Seeing that she was looking at him, Qing Shui grinned, revealing his pearly teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge blushed and unnaturally turned her head away. She remembered the scene of Qing Shui healing her. Yiye Jiange had already prepared the tea and picked up a cup to sip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve already obtained some news. The patron behind the Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace is the Ice Ocean Domain’s Sunset Palace. They also should have obtained the news by now. It’s still unclear whether they’ll take action for the Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace.” Muyun Qingge looked at Qing Shui as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui expected a large power to be behind the Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace, but he didn’t think they’d come so soon. Based on the Beastmen’s nature, they absolutely wouldn’t leave this matter be, so they could only prepare well to guard against them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you have information regarding the Sunset Palace?” Qing Shui asked. Being underwater was different from being on land. It was more dangerous and there were many organisms here, some with giant bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We only know that Mermen exist in Sunset Palace as well as some Ancient Battle Crabs.” Muyun Qingge looked at Qing Shui strangely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From her expression, Qing Shui could feel that she knew he was aware of her identity. It’s not like her identity was a secret, it was just that everyone only knew that she was the descendant of a Drakaina.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We can only resist if they come to attack. We should first raise our strength.” Qing Shui was somewhat worried, but there was no point in worrying too much. He had confidence in himself. If a Divine grade expert didn’t appear, Qing Shui felt that he could repel them back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Here are a few formations. You can tell your trusted aides to begin training their troops. Perhaps these will come into use.” Qing Shui gave the formations he had prepared earlier to Yiye Jiange and Muyun Qingge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange didn’t show any shock, but Muyun Qingge was dazed. She accepted them and nodded towards Qing Shui, “These are quite important for the Sea King’s Palace, but none of us know how they work.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s simple. Jiange knows how. You can try researching. Just come ask me if you don’t understand anything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui roamed the surroundings of the Sea King’s Palace aimlessly. Originally, under regular circumstances, he should’ve left the Sea King’s Palace earlier, but the appearance of the Sunset Palace gave him no choice but to stay behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A long time had already passed since he had arrived in the Haohan Continent. He wanted to go back. All of his family members were in the Dancing Phoenix Continent. Yehuang Guwu was also there. It was only a thought for him to consider returning, but the journey back was long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought of Canghai Mingyue, Huoyun Liu-Li, Zhu Qing, Yun Duan, Di Qing, Di Chen…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He also thought about Tantai Xuan and Tantai Lingyan. He felt strange when he thought about that crystal, ice cold woman, Tantai Lingyan. He wondered whether the little bit of familiarity he had developed with her with much difficulty would reset after parting from her for so long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Xuan also left Qing Shui helpless. This woman kept her distance. He shook his head. Anyways, life was long for cultivators and he could only make preparations in advance, as Tantai Lingyan had hatred towards the Five Tiger Immortal Sect. Else, he’d be stuck in a dilemma.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Paragon Water Shield!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had already used the Paragon Water Shield three times. Each time, he travelled 50,000 kilometres. This distance was nothing within the sea domains. They were filled with powers. The disappearance of the Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace had increased the area under the rule of the Sea King’s Palace exponentially. Quite a lot of the members of the Sea King’s Palace were currently searching for treasures or immortal herbs in the Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace’s areas.</span></p>

Qing Shui wasn’t interested in its golden light as there were a lot of different coloured beautiful fishes underwater, but the speed of this foot-long fish was quite irregular. It also released an especially intense spiritual aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was interested in it and followed it. With his speed, it was easy for him to catch up to this fish, but he had nothing to do and also didn’t desire to catch it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui travelled within the water following after it. Speed really seemed to be its elemental forte. Qing Shui was curious about how such a little thing could possess so much energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were quite a lot of mountain ranges underwater. Qing Shui followed after the golden fish and passed through a valley and then a ‘tunnel’. After going through it, a wriggling giant mountain range appeared before his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Half an hour after entering the mountain range, the little fish in front of Qing Shui suddenly disappeared. Qing Shui was dazed and quickly sped up. He discovered that there was a barrier in place that was concealed quite well. It was also quite small, around 2 meters in radius and was sheltered by the surrounding mountain rocks, water plants, vines and so on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was excited and immediately went inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spiritual Qi hit him right in the face as soon as he entered inside…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui discovered the golden fish here. Although there wasn’t any water, it was still swimming…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed as if it was flying. Though it was a strange matter, Qing Shui wasn’t shocked by this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t follow it and rather sized up the place. There were four pillars here that he couldn’t tell were natural or artificial. They seemed natural but again gave a feeling as if they were a masterpiece.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A huge suppression force manifested when Qing Shui entered the inner palace hall. Qing Shui was astonished and took a look inside. There was a God’s Statue inside, but this one was different from the one he saw before. This God’s Statue had a human’s torso, a dragon’s tail, and a jade lion’s head which rather resembled a qilin’s head. The qilin’s head in Qing Shui’s previous life looked just like this and there was even a saying that the qilin’s head was actually a lion’s head…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That terrible suppression was coming from here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, a large aura locked onto Qing Shui. He merely protected himself from it and didn’t resist it. He knew it the statue’s Divine Sense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a powerful Divine Sense. It lasted for a quarter of a minute and then a thought suddenly transmitted itself, “Human brought here by fate, since you’ve arrived here, it means that there’s karma between us. Take this gift!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A bit of information directly reached Qing Shui’s mind. The amount of information wasn’t that much. After absorbing it, Qing Shui looked at this God’s Statue with amazement. He hadn’t expected that there would be a remnant Divine Sense left behind by a Divine grade expert here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the Jade Kirin Dragon Vessel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The information passed to him revealed that it was a passive Paragon Heavenly Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jade Kirin Dragon Vessel Overlord: Increases the might of passive blows and all battle skills by one-fold. Raises endurance by three times. Raises resistance towards evil skills by three times, effective against spirit and illusion type skills, poison type skills. A passive Paragon Heavenly Technique. Zero consumption. Cannot be upgraded. Living is pointless if one is not like an Overlord.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the God’s Statue and didn’t come back to his senses for a long time. He always felt that he possessed very few heavenly techniques and now he had suddenly obtained such a good Paragon Heavenly Technique. This Jade Kirin Dragon Vessel Heavenly Technique was really tyrannical and although it couldn’t be upgraded, it made him much more powerful. All the other Heavenly Technique battle skills Qing Shui possessed combined could barely catch up with this Jade Kirin Dragon Vessel Heavenly Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt an explosive increment in his strength after obtaining the Jade Kirin Dragon Vessel Heavenly Technique. His strength and defence had both increased one-fold. This was a Heavenly Technique which targeted battle skills and although it didn’t increase his strength, it raised his endurance. For example, the Nine Stances of the Ancient Divine Battle Technique’s might had increased one-fold from before, his covert strength had also increased one-fold, the Paragon Battle Armor’s might by one-fold and so on...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt now that he was absolutely the number one existence under the Divine Grade.</span></p>
