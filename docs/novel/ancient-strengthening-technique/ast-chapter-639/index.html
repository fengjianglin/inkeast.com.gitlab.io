 <p><strong>AST 639 - The Fiery Golden Eyes</strong></p>
 <p>How should we fight?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt really conflicted. Seeing Old Madam Mo being equally frustrated, he gritted his teeth, rode the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and dashed behind Di Xuan in an instant.</p>
 <p>“Little brat, I am definitely going to shred you to pieces today and torture you till you rather die!” Old Demon Ba seethed it word by word to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>He could no longer tolerate this youth and now hated him to the core. Killing him directly would no longer resolve the hatred in his heart. He must let Qing Shui feel despair first, then torture him slowly until he was filled with hopelessness as he died...</p>
 <p>“Little brat Di Xuan! Die!”</p>
 <p>Old Demon Ba’s abilities had increased significantly along with his speed. His imposing blade left a black trail as it slashed towards Di Xuan.</p>
 <p>Di Xuan’s face instantly turned pale.</p>
 <p>With such a disparity in abilities, when that moment of death drew near, those who can talk about it with an unfazed face were lying about it, only those who truly experience it would know of the horror of that instant.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shot out his hands again in a strange manner!</p>
 <p>Hidden Weapons —Twin Dragon Pearls!</p>
 <p>Only this time, they were infused with his Primordial Flames!</p>
 <p>To deal with the huge Red Jiao, Only by piercing through its flesh, could Qing Shui deal any significant damage to it. Furthermore, the Frosted Iron Balls contained cold poison and were slightly faster than his Primordial Flames. That's why Qing Shui chose to use them without hesitation.</p>
 <p>The enormous Red Jiao was still struggling within the bindings of the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb, its cries starting to weaken. Qing Shui knew that the truly fatal injuries were a result of the Frosted Iron Balls and the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb’s poison entering its wounds, spreading through its body to the brain. With the additional damage caused by Old Madam Mo’s Diamond Scepter, the Red Jiao was on its last breaths..</p>
 <p>As for Old Demon Ba, Qing Shui was not expecting to be successful when attacking directly with Hidden Weapons. After all, there was a huge difference in strength. He only wanted to obstruct Old Demon Ba’s attack on Di Xuan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shot two balls of Primordial Flames at Old Demon Ba, with one aimed at his face while the other one aimed at his abdomen.</p>
 <p>Just as Old Demon Ba was about to evade the fireballs and charge towards Di Xuan, Qing Shui shouted. “Burst!”</p>
 <p>Hidden Weapon Technique — Twin Dragon Explosion!</p>
 <p>The two separate Primordial Flames suddenly collided, immediately shooting out Primordial Flame Balls in all directions.</p>
 <p>Despite his strength, Old Demon Ba did not dare come in contact with these fireballs. He could clearly sense the uniqueness of these firewalls, and did not dare to take the risk.</p>
 <p>Old Demon Ba was repelled by Qing Shui to his original position.</p>
 <p>Using two Hidden Weapon Killing Techniques in a row, Qing Shui felt a renewed sense of confidence. Three months ago, he noticed new killing techniques within the Hidden Weapon Technique, although he did not know when they had appeared. The familiarity in the two techniques he displayed was the result of his harsh training over the past three months.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was quite satisfied with its strength.</p>
 <p>Three months in the outside world equated to four years in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Having practised the two techniques for four years, it was expected that he would reach this degree of expertise.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Old Madam Mo had also regrouped with them. However, even with their combined strength, they still had difficulty resisting Old Demon Ba. The only thing left that could threaten Old Demon Ba was Qing Shui’s Primordial Flames.</p>
 <p>Old Demon Ba could no longer contain his rage, the most insignificant person to him ended up being the one who obstructed him the most, restricting him repeatedly. And yet, he was helpless to do anything about it.</p>
 <p>This little brat did not confront him face to face, yet was able to influence the entire battle. Without him, Old Demon Ba was confident in swiftly ending the fight within one breath of time.</p>
 <p>“Little brat, I would love to see how long you can sustain your Xiantian Qi!”</p>
 <p>Old Demon Ba charged towards him again!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui naturally used the same method to repel Old Demon Ba!</p>
 <p>The Hidden Weapon technique did consume a lot of his Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. Very quickly, Qing Shui had already used one-third of his Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. However, he had no choice but to continue using it.</p>
 <p>Now, it was Qing Shui’s turn to feel helpless. He had no choice but to find another solution!</p>
 <p>When he had less than half of his Qi remaining, Qing Shui quickly took out a Vital Essence Pill and swallowed it. He immediately felt a surge in strength, with all his diminished Qi replenished.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, there was a restriction to the pill, he could only consume it once in 24 hours…...</p>
 <p>Kreeee!</p>
 <p>At this moment, a loud crane cry rang in the distance.</p>
 <p>Taking a look, Qing Shui was delighted to see that Lady Duanmu had arrived. Although he was unsure of the strength Lady Duanmu possessed, he hoped it would be of great assistance.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan stopped the Ice Crane a distance away, approaching them on her own. Very soon, she had already arrived by their side.</p>
 <p>“Lady Duanmu, why are you here?” Qing Shui asked, feeling pleasantly surprised.</p>
 <p>“My daughter found out about your problems and insisted on coming.” Lady Duanmu said with a grin.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. He glanced at the cold icy woman on the Ice Crane and unable to comprehend what Lady Duanmu meant. However, he felt that there was a hidden meaning within her words. Nevertheless, he still smiled and thanked her.</p>
 <p>The rest just casually greeted each other. After all, they were in a critical moment. Lady Duanmu was a prominent person within Seven Stars City. Her arrival gave everyone a moment of ease. In spite of that, everyone was still aware of the difficulty in defeating Old Demon Ba.</p>
 <p>“Oh, even the little brat from a long time ago has become a mother. Being a widow for so long, did you come here today after finally deciding to reunite with your husband?” When Old Demon Ba saw Yu Ruyan, he wasn't too concerned as her strength most likely didn't pose much of a threat to him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly activated the Godly Force and Divine Shield Talismans on Lady Duanmu to boost her strength. Although the increase wasn’t significant, it was still a boost.</p>
 <p>Swish!</p>
 <p>Lady Duanmu was actually holding a ribbon, the Flowing Cloud, in her hand. It shimmered in the sunlight, flickering like an illusion of the sky and the clouds. Qing Shui didn’t know how the ribbon compared to Di Chen’s Nine Heaven Immortal Silk.</p>
 <p>Lady Duanmu stayed silent. Taking a step forward, she immediately swung the Flowing Cloud towards Old Demon Ba, planning to bind Old Demon Ba with the Flowing Cloud.</p>
 <p>“Useless tricks! All your attacks are ineffective against me.”</p>
 <p>Old Demon Ba snorted. The blade in his hand rotated and tangled the Flowing Cloud. With a shout, the blade in his hand shone with a black light.</p>
 <p>“Break!”</p>
 <p>Lady Duanmu was thrown back three steps, her face paled. She never expected that a section of the Flowing Cloud would actually be cut off. When Qing Shui saw Old Demon Ba charging towards them, he helplessly let out another Twin Dragon Explosion.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, who was the weakest among the four, could instead barely block Old Demon Ba’s attacks. However, this was only temporary. If Qing Shui made the slightest mistake, the consequences would be dire.</p>
 <p>The problem was that Qing Shui didn’t know what else he could do to kill Old Demon Ba. He had expended everything he had, including the crafty Hidden Weapon Technique.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't know what else he could do.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood still, brainstorming while executing his Hidden Weapon Technique to hinder Old Demon Ba.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a thought came to Qing Shui’s mind. He thought of the supplementary technique that was his reward for breaking through to the Sixth Heavenly Layer.</p>
 <p>Fiery Golden Eyes!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was roused. How could he have forgotten about it? Nevertheless, he still felt a bit uneasy. As he has never used it before, he was unclear about how strong the Fiery Golden Eyes were. He wasn’t convinced by the effects of decreasing the opponent’s current abilities by 10%.</p>
 <p>However, at this point of time, he had to try no matter what. Even if it was only capable of reducing one hundred countries worth of strength from Old Demon Ba, it was still better than nothing. Qing Shui immediately focused the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique on his eyes.</p>
 <p>As he used another Twin Dragon Explosion, he also activated the Fiery Golden Eyes. The Fiery Golden Eyes were the same as Emperor’s Qi, unavoidable within a certain range.</p>
 <p>A faint light entered Old Demon Ba’s body. In an instant, Old Demon Ba’s expression changed drastically, filled with disbelief, hatred and despair.</p>
 <p>A pleasant thought appeared in Qing Shui’s mind. He had successfully reduced Old Demon Ba’s strength by an additional thousand countries.</p>
 <p>Following that, another thought appeared in his mind. At small success stage, the Fiery Golden Eyes was able to reduce the target’s current abilities by 10%. It would reduce a minimum of a thousand countries, reducing more if 10% of the opponent’s overall abilities exceeded a thousand countries. The condition for usage was that the opponent had to have at least five thousand countries worth of strength.</p>
 <p>At the moment, Qing Shui really felt like laughing out loud. Old Demon Ba’s strength was fortunately slightly above five thousand countries. If it had been four thousand and nine hundred countries, things would have ended badly today. However, even with his abilities reduced, Old Demon Ba still possessed four thousand four hundred countries worth of strength.</p>
 <p>Under the effects of the Godly Force Talisman and the Divine Shield Talisman, both Lady Duanmu as well as Old Madam Mo possessed the strength of roughly four thousand and two hundred countries. Di Xuan on the other hand, had just shy of four thousand countries.</p>
 <p>“Let’s attack together! Be careful, his current strength should not exceed four thousand five hundred countries.”Qing Shui mockingly said as he looked at Old Demon Ba.</p>
 <p>Actually, the other three has also discovered the change in Old Freak Ba’s expression and the aura which he was exuding from his body.</p>
 <p>The three of them approached Old Demon Ba in a triangle formation while Qing Shui continued to contemplate. The Fiery Golden Eyes only affected the temporary strength, but was already insanely powerful. Especially to a warrior with the strength of five thousand countries, that would mean 20% of their overall strength being reduced, having the same effects as Emperor’s Qi.</p>
 <p>The Fiery Golden Eyes specifically weakened temporary strength. What surprised Qing Shui was that the effects were significantly damaging to warriors at or above Grade Ten Martial Saint.</p>
 <p>The Fiery Golden Eyes had no effect on warriors with abilities of less than five thousand countries. For those with an overall ability above five thousand countries, they would be weakened by a minimum a thousand countries, regardless of their current abilities. However, at small success stage, even if the opponent had the strength of ten thousand countries, the Fiery Golden Eyes would still only decrease a thousand countries worth of strength.</p>
 <p>The abilities of a Grade Ten Martial Saint was five thousand countries. When Qing Shui found out about it, he felt like shouting out loud. At present, he was about to murder a Grade Ten Martial Saint!</p>
 <p>No wonder the Fiery Golden Eyes was the reward for achieving the Sixth Heavenly Layer. Only now did Qing Shui feel he received a huge fortune by obtaining this supplementary technique. It synchronised well with the Emperor’s Qi. By adding on the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s Vajra Subdues Demons, Qing Shui felt that he would soon be able to directly confront Peak Martial Saint warriors.</p>
 <p>Seeing the three gain the upper hand, a warm smiled appeared on Qing Shui’s face. Grasping two Frosted Iron Balls in his hands, he continuously monitored Old Demon Ba.</p>
 <p>Diamond Scepter Shadow Kill!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Old Madam Mo’s Diamond Scepter became illusory, as if she was holding a shadow. She sliced towards Old Demon Ba with a force sufficient to split a mountain.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui on the other hand threw out his Frosted Iron Balls towards the direction where Old Demon Ba would retreat, completely blocking off Old Demon Ba’s escape route.</p>
