  <p><strong>AST 231 – Ancient Forging Technique is a Godly technique!</strong></p>
  <p>Agility +1!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was in a daze. Additional attributes?</p>
  <p>At that moment, Qing Shui was really overjoyed. He had initially felt that the 999 hammer blows earlier were a pity since not being able to reach 1000 hammer blows was a “failure”.</p>
  <p>However, after seeing just this one increment alone of agility, it made Qing Shui’s expression of pity suddenly change into one of glowing radiance.</p>
  <p>With the Heavenly Vision Technique, Qing Shui could only see this additional attribute and nothing else. He was long used to such stuff, since the world of the nine continents was far more complicated than what he had ever imagined.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was sure that this additional attribute was the unique effect of his Ancient Forging Technique, since he did not find any additional attributes on the Big Dipper Sword. The Big Dipper Sword was already considered a good quality precious sword as it was.</p>
  <p>After a very long time, Qing Shui raised his head and then saw Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li staring at him blankly. At one glance, they could tell that the coarse weapon in Qing Shui’s hands was better than any weapons in this blacksmith store. The gleam that the sword exuded was one that everyone had yearned for. It was a gleam that only weapons of extremely top quality would have.</p>
  <p>“You’re really a weird person.” Huoyun Liu-Li gave Qing Shui a weird look before she took over 3 foot Jagged Sword and said in amazement.</p>
  <p>When she grasped the Jagged Sword, she stared blankly at Qing Shui, took a look at the Jagged Sword, and then turned to pass it to Canghai Mingyue. “Sister Mingyue, take a look at this sword. It feels very special.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui knew that the feeling she mentioned was the additional increment in the agility attribute. Qing Shui knew that that peculiar one point in the attribute was added onto the user through the unique gleam exuded by the Jagged Sword, like how the mysterious treasured stones worked.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue stared blankly at Qing Shui in the same way Huoyun Liu-Li had. This guy would always bring surprises to others. Holding the amazing Jagged Sword in her hands and being at the pinnacle of Xiantian, she could already feel the uniqueness of this sword. Even though it was a very minute feeling, she could clearly sense that this could only come from those extremely precious weapons. Those divine weapons were all able to cut through metal as if they were mud, allowing one’s powers to be displayed at an extraordinary level.</p>
  <p>It increases one’s attack in a different way, and of course included some “sword wind” as well. They could increase speed up to a certain limit. The defective good she was holding…she could obviously sense that the amazing feeling would only come from divine weapons. </p>
  <p>“Can I have this sword? I can use it when I perform a sword dance. It feels especially good when I grip it.” Huoyun Liu-Li smiled gently and said.</p>
  <p>“Mmm, I’ll give you an even better one in the future.” Qing Shui said happily. He felt extremely satisfied. Humans enjoyed receiving compliments, even if the person was extremely outstanding in a particularly perverse area.</p>
  <p>“Perverse” may be the best compliment in a certain area at times. For example, being perverse in terms of one’s martial prowess was a type of compliment.</p>
  <p>Telling a lady that she had the beauty which could cause the falls of countries and cities or that her beauty could bring sufferings to countries and their people, were also compliments for extreme beauty!</p>
  <p>It was only then when Hu You mumbled in a daze, “Godly technique…”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui saw that Hu You was behaving as if he had just seen something unbelievable, mumbling about Godly Technique. His heart suddenly leaped. Could it be that this guy Hu You was referring to his Ancient Forging Technique?</p>
  <p>“What Godly Technique?” Qing Shui asked Hu You curiously.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s question made Hu You regained his senses as he looked yearningly towards Qing Shui. It was just that expression was suppressing a certain idea he was harboring. He then gradually said.</p>
  <p>“My clan comes from generations of blacksmiths. It was just that since my grandfather’s time, we had declined to be left with only this small blacksmith store. However, my grandfather’s blacksmithing standards were still very good and he was very knowledgeable towards Blacksmith forging techniques. He had once told me about the existence of Godly Techniques. It was when I was very young, but I could remember it very clearly.” Hu You’s gaze were still burning as he looked at Qing Shui, but that gaze was one of recollection and yearning…</p>
  <p>“Grandfather had told me that in the world of the nine continents, there is a type of Forging Techniques called Godly Techniques. It was a Forging Techniques that all blacksmiths dreamed to attain all their lives. Grandfather also said that in the world of the nine continents, all those top notch weapons which contains “magical effects” in their attacks all came from Godly Techniques.” </p>
  <p>“Godly Techniques? Could it be that only the Godly Techniques is able to create those seemingly powerful weapons?” Qing Shui smiled and asked happily. Qing Shui knew that his Ancient Forging Technique would absolutely have an amazing point, but he never expected that it would be similar to the Godly Techniques in the world of the nine continents.</p>
  <p>This was good as well as he would no longer need to be all secretive. However, other people do not have the Heavenly Vision Technique, unless they experienced it for themselves or if their spiritual senses were strong enough to sense the “aura” from the weapons!</p>
  <p>“The gleam that appeared after you completed the process is known as Divine Colored Lights. That gleam is something that many blacksmiths yearn for. The gleam that appeared when the weapon was completed is the gleam that represents the Godly Techniques, but you should be at the lowest level.” Hu You appeared very confident when talking about things regarding blacksmith.</p>
  <p>After hearing Hu You’s words, Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Shui even more suspiciously. It was especially so for Canghai Mingyue, as it was the first time she had felt that this young guy was elegant. While his looks could not compare to those handsome and sharp-looking guys, he had a pair of good looking eyes with a warm gaze. There was a purplish jade mark the size of a soybean between his brows which made him appear even more attractive. He was a guy which people would find hard to hate.</p>
  <p>She had initially thought that Qing Shui managed to get close to Huoyun Liu-Li with his looks. However, following on, she saw the few items he took out which he had prepared for Liu-Li and they made her extremely surprised. They were actually extremely rare fruits which matured once every one hundred years in the world of the nine continents. Most importantly, he was also an extremely young Xiantian cultivator, Xiantian alchemist, and had even brewed the Tigerbone Yang Amplification Beauty Purification Wine when they were at her home that even her father had found surprising…</p>
  <p>He had spices which would make all the chefs in the world go crazy. Now, the coarse weapon he had successfully made on his first attempt was made by Godly Techniques which all blacksmiths would go crazy for. At this moment, Canghai Mingyue felt that the glow from this guy was brighter and brighter. Each of the things he owned could make others go crazy, and he achieved realms which others may not even be able to dream of achieving even if they were to put in hard work and effort all their lives.</p>
  <p>He was even a young man who could bring his martial art to the Obscure Realm. Even though she had put in hard work in her training, she had only managed to attain the peak of the Truth Realm. Just thinking about it made it hard for her to swallow this.</p>
  <p>The realms of martial proficiency could be segregated as, beginner, well versed, proficient, expert, ancestor, truth, obscure, heaven, divine. And each realms could be further seperated into low grade, middle grade, high grade, perfect grade!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui then found another piece of forging materials to smelt and starting making the Jagged Sword again. Everything was more familiar on his second try. This time, his control and strength was much better than his first attempt. However, it still appeared to be a bit coarse.</p>
  <p>Ding Ding!</p>
  <p>A crisp sound rang out, and Qing Shui once again entered that dreamy state. He kept hammering one after another, and was at an extremely high level of concentration. Qing Shui realized that he was very excited, especially towards the moment when he was looking at the completed product made by his very own hands. He was even enjoying the moment he was hammering now.</p>
  <p>The two ladies exchanged glances and smiled bitterly. A guy like Qing Shui would be hard to compare with those men who appear burly and strong since the other blacksmiths were all strong men with bulging muscles.</p>
  <p>They looked at Qing Shui who was engrossed in smithing the metal sword. That upright figure, that strength of his hammering, and that simple and unsophisticated feeling was very attractive.</p>
  <p>Ding!</p>
  <p>A flash of a slightly golden and silvery light gleamed, signifying the successful creation. However, Qing Shui only felt a little pitiful as it was still 999 hammer blows!</p>
  <p>Was this a barrier? Qing Shui was feeling slightly lost, but then, it was only his second attempt and he would need to accumulate experience for his Ancient Forging Technique.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui did not wish to use the Tempered Metallic Essence which was in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal as it would be a waste. Neither did he dare to smelt treasured stones as it would be a waste as well.</p>
  <p>Using his Heavenly Vision technique, he could see that this Jagged Sword was obviously better than the earlier one with +2 in attack…</p>
  <p>Qing Shui reached out his hand to pick up the newly completed Jagged Sword and could immediately feel a small amount of strength spreading from his palms to his body. Qing Shui smiled bitterly as he sensed that this two point increment in attack would be about the equivalent of 20 jin of strength and could be considered quite good for ordinary people. If this attribute was on an axe, when ordinary people would use it to chop firewood, an additional 20 jin of strength would be good as it would allow the person to chop more firewood.</p>
  <p>Qing shui casually waved the sword a couple of times, and touched the blade of the sword which lightly knocked it to create a crisp and sharp sound. Qing Shui then picked up the one Hu You made earlier.</p>
  <p>Comparing the two, Qing Shui knew that his could barely, but still could be considered as thoroughly tempered. That sturdy and flexibility was much better than Hu You’s by a few tiers.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui held the two swords in each of his hands, then he suddenly crossed his hands, clashing the two swords against each other!</p>
  <p>Ding! Clank!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui saw that while the two swords were made of the same material, his got away without a scratch while Hu You’s broke in the middle.</p>
  <p>Only after doing this did Qing Shui think that it might make Hu You look bad, but he saw that Hu You did not appear frustrated, awkward, or unsatisfied, but instead was looking at Qing Shui with a happy and passionate gaze.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled awkwardly as he handed this sword with two increment in strength to Hu You, not saying a word.</p>
  <p>Hu You received it happily then took a good look at it seriously. Qing Shui washed his hands and noticed that it was already noon. He rubbed his nose and nodded towards the two ladies, signalling that they should be heading back.</p>
  <p>As they walked out of the blacksmith store, Qing Shui saw that both Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li were looking at him with unblinking eyes. Qing Shui blinked his pair of beautiful eyes once, before blinking it two more times quickly. When the two ladies were feeling puzzled, he stuck out his tongue and licked a round around his lips.</p>
  <p>“Rascal!”</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li laughed softly as she reprimanded Qing Shui while taking two quick steps forward with the blushing Canghai Mingyue with a goddess look, leaving Qing Shui behind!</p>
  <p>“Rascals are good!!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui mumbled as he looked at the two beauties’ back view. Both Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-LIl were tall and slender ladies, and even their curves were alarmingly similar, and their beauty was extremely attractive. </p>
  <p>They proceeded with very light steps, their slender and long legs and that nice curves at their waists made Qing Shui’s mouth start to feel parched. It was especially so when he recalled that Huoyun Liu-Li’s wonderful back had almost been completely touched all over.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui heard that under the men’s burning gazes, women would also get a strong feeling, even if they were targeted at their back. They could especially feel it if they were being stared at more sensitive spots. After staring for a while, Qing Shui only felt that he was extremely parched and had a reaction.</p>
  <p>Holding the first sword that Qing Shui had created, Huoyun Liu-Li toyed with it happily as she chatted with Canghai Mingyue. That bright expression was just like the one of a lady who had fallen into the river of love. However, it was a pity that she did not understand it well herself. Canghai Mingyue saw this and suddenly thought that the reason she could clearly sense the feelings Liu-Li had for Qing Shui was because she was looking at it from an outside perspective.</p>
  <p>“Would I be a participant?”</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue suddenly turned her thoughts to herself before shaking her head firmly. She felt that the door in her heart was yet to open, and she had not let the feelings of love enter. There was no one in her heart whom she held dear feelings for.</p>
  <p>Suddenly, there was a disturbance in front, and noisy quarrels came to Qing Shui’s ears!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui saw that amongst them, there were many men and women wearing pure white clothes and each of them had a longsword with them. Doubt rose in his heart. Were they not from Immortal Sword Sect? Who would dare to go against them?</p>
  <p>“There’s something going on over there, let’s go take a look!” Qing Shui walked up to the two ladies as he grinned and said.</p>
  <p>The two ladies nodded and joined Qing Shui as he headed towards the crowd.</p>
  <p>“This Immortal Sword Sect is really unreasonable. They frequently do these acts of bullying.” An old man sighed and said.</p>
  <p>“They would use such underhand methods each time in an attempt to buy stuff from others at prices that were so low that it was unreasonable. If the other party was not willing to sell, they would resort to threats or even snatch it by force.” A lean young man said furiously.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui could heard the discussions around before he had even reached. They were all reprimanding Immortal Sword Sect for their barbarous acts of bullying.</p>
  <p>“Old man, how can you find it cheap to be paid 10 silver taels for this lousy thing? You’re selling it for 100,000 silver taels. Aren’t you trying to fool others?” Qing Shui heard an arrogant voice speaking out.</p>
  <p>Before he heard the voice, Qing Shui already had the urge to beat him up, but he still held back the urge and turned towards the source of the voice. On the first look, Qing Shui almost could not hold in his urge to step forth and give him a beating.</p>
  <p>It was a young man who was about 25-26 years of age, and the suit of white on him gave Qing Shui the urge to puke. That was because he was a big fatty who was big enough to fit two burly men. Each of his legs were as thick as a muscular adult man’s waist.</p>
  <p>This fatty had a height of two meters, and his waistline was also two meters. These were not the reasons Qing Shui had the urge to give him a beating as he saw that his face was like a big meatball. After looking for very long, he finally made out two small eyes each with the size of a green bean and a small nose.</p>
  <p>The actual reason was that this fatty was hugging a lady with quite a good figure. The tall lady with a curvy figure was like a young kid standing beside the big fatty. Her pretty appearance appeared to be like a fairy’s beside the fatty’s face which was like a lump of meat.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at this big fatty and that curvy lady, and naturally started to wonder how they would be in bed? That big fatty would squash that petite lady into a patty. These were not important, since it could be such that the lady was on top of the guy. However, when Qing Shui saw those two legs which were full of disgusting bulging fats and that saggy stomach which was lower than his lower region, Qing Shui wondered how big that sausage of his must become to be able to squeeze its way out of that pile of flesh.</p>

 <p>Qing Shui was sure that this additional attribute was the unique effect of his Ancient Forging Technique, since he did not find any additional attributes on the Big Dipper Sword. The Big Dipper Sword was already considered a good quality precious sword as it was.</p>
 <p>After a very long time, Qing Shui raised his head and then saw Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li staring at him blankly. At one glance, they could tell that the coarse weapon in Qing Shui’s hands was better than any weapons in this blacksmith store. The gleam that the sword exuded was one that everyone had yearned for. It was a gleam that only weapons of extremely top quality would have.</p>
 <p>“You’re really a weird person.” Huoyun Liu-Li gave Qing Shui a weird look before she took over 3 foot Jagged Sword and said in amazement.</p>
 <p>When she grasped the Jagged Sword, she stared blankly at Qing Shui, took a look at the Jagged Sword, and then turned to pass it to Canghai Mingyue. “Sister Mingyue, take a look at this sword. It feels very special.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that the feeling she mentioned was the additional increment in the agility attribute. Qing Shui knew that that peculiar one point in the attribute was added onto the user through the unique gleam exuded by the Jagged Sword, like how the mysterious treasured stones worked.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue stared blankly at Qing Shui in the same way Huoyun Liu-Li had. This guy would always bring surprises to others. Holding the amazing Jagged Sword in her hands and being at the pinnacle of Xiantian, she could already feel the uniqueness of this sword. Even though it was a very minute feeling, she could clearly sense that this could only come from those extremely precious weapons. Those divine weapons were all able to cut through metal as if they were mud, allowing one’s powers to be displayed at an extraordinary level.</p>
 <p>It increases one’s attack in a different way, and of course included some “sword wind” as well. They could increase speed up to a certain limit. The defective good she was holding…she could obviously sense that the amazing feeling would only come from divine weapons. </p>
 <p>“Can I have this sword? I can use it when I perform a sword dance. It feels especially good when I grip it.” Huoyun Liu-Li smiled gently and said.</p>
 <p>“Mmm, I’ll give you an even better one in the future.” Qing Shui said happily. He felt extremely satisfied. Humans enjoyed receiving compliments, even if the person was extremely outstanding in a particularly perverse area.</p>
 <p>“Perverse” may be the best compliment in a certain area at times. For example, being perverse in terms of one’s martial prowess was a type of compliment.</p>
 <p>Telling a lady that she had the beauty which could cause the falls of countries and cities or that her beauty could bring sufferings to countries and their people, were also compliments for extreme beauty!</p>
 <p>It was only then when Hu You mumbled in a daze, “Godly technique…”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw that Hu You was behaving as if he had just seen something unbelievable, mumbling about Godly Technique. His heart suddenly leaped. Could it be that this guy Hu You was referring to his Ancient Forging Technique?</p>
 <p>“What Godly Technique?” Qing Shui asked Hu You curiously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s question made Hu You regained his senses as he looked yearningly towards Qing Shui. It was just that expression was suppressing a certain idea he was harboring. He then gradually said.</p>
 <p>“My clan comes from generations of blacksmiths. It was just that since my grandfather’s time, we had declined to be left with only this small blacksmith store. However, my grandfather’s blacksmithing standards were still very good and he was very knowledgeable towards Blacksmith forging techniques. He had once told me about the existence of Godly Techniques. It was when I was very young, but I could remember it very clearly.” Hu You’s gaze were still burning as he looked at Qing Shui, but that gaze was one of recollection and yearning…</p>
 <p>“Grandfather had told me that in the world of the nine continents, there is a type of Forging Techniques called Godly Techniques. It was a Forging Techniques that all blacksmiths dreamed to attain all their lives. Grandfather also said that in the world of the nine continents, all those top notch weapons which contains “magical effects” in their attacks all came from Godly Techniques.” </p>
 <p>“Godly Techniques? Could it be that only the Godly Techniques is able to create those seemingly powerful weapons?” Qing Shui smiled and asked happily. Qing Shui knew that his Ancient Forging Technique would absolutely have an amazing point, but he never expected that it would be similar to the Godly Techniques in the world of the nine continents.</p>
 <p>This was good as well as he would no longer need to be all secretive. However, other people do not have the Heavenly Vision Technique, unless they experienced it for themselves or if their spiritual senses were strong enough to sense the “aura” from the weapons!</p>
 <p>“The gleam that appeared after you completed the process is known as Divine Colored Lights. That gleam is something that many blacksmiths yearn for. The gleam that appeared when the weapon was completed is the gleam that represents the Godly Techniques, but you should be at the lowest level.” Hu You appeared very confident when talking about things regarding blacksmith.</p>
 <p>After hearing Hu You’s words, Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Shui even more suspiciously. It was especially so for Canghai Mingyue, as it was the first time she had felt that this young guy was elegant. While his looks could not compare to those handsome and sharp-looking guys, he had a pair of good looking eyes with a warm gaze. There was a purplish jade mark the size of a soybean between his brows which made him appear even more attractive. He was a guy which people would find hard to hate.</p>
 <p>She had initially thought that Qing Shui managed to get close to Huoyun Liu-Li with his looks. However, following on, she saw the few items he took out which he had prepared for Liu-Li and they made her extremely surprised. They were actually extremely rare fruits which matured once every one hundred years in the world of the nine continents. Most importantly, he was also an extremely young Xiantian cultivator, Xiantian alchemist, and had even brewed the Tigerbone Yang Amplification Beauty Purification Wine when they were at her home that even her father had found surprising…</p>
 <p>He had spices which would make all the chefs in the world go crazy. Now, the coarse weapon he had successfully made on his first attempt was made by Godly Techniques which all blacksmiths would go crazy for. At this moment, Canghai Mingyue felt that the glow from this guy was brighter and brighter. Each of the things he owned could make others go crazy, and he achieved realms which others may not even be able to dream of achieving even if they were to put in hard work and effort all their lives.</p>
 <p>He was even a young man who could bring his martial art to the Obscure Realm. Even though she had put in hard work in her training, she had only managed to attain the peak of the Truth Realm. Just thinking about it made it hard for her to swallow this.</p>
 <p>The realms of martial proficiency could be segregated as, beginner, well versed, proficient, expert, ancestor, truth, obscure, heaven, divine. And each realms could be further seperated into low grade, middle grade, high grade, perfect grade!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then found another piece of forging materials to smelt and starting making the Jagged Sword again. Everything was more familiar on his second try. This time, his control and strength was much better than his first attempt. However, it still appeared to be a bit coarse.</p>
 <p>Ding Ding!</p>
 <p>A crisp sound rang out, and Qing Shui once again entered that dreamy state. He kept hammering one after another, and was at an extremely high level of concentration. Qing Shui realized that he was very excited, especially towards the moment when he was looking at the completed product made by his very own hands. He was even enjoying the moment he was hammering now.</p>
 <p>The two ladies exchanged glances and smiled bitterly. A guy like Qing Shui would be hard to compare with those men who appear burly and strong since the other blacksmiths were all strong men with bulging muscles.</p>
 <p>They looked at Qing Shui who was engrossed in smithing the metal sword. That upright figure, that strength of his hammering, and that simple and unsophisticated feeling was very attractive.</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>A flash of a slightly golden and silvery light gleamed, signifying the successful creation. However, Qing Shui only felt a little pitiful as it was still 999 hammer blows!</p>
 <p>Was this a barrier? Qing Shui was feeling slightly lost, but then, it was only his second attempt and he would need to accumulate experience for his Ancient Forging Technique.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not wish to use the Tempered Metallic Essence which was in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal as it would be a waste. Neither did he dare to smelt treasured stones as it would be a waste as well.</p>
 <p>Using his Heavenly Vision technique, he could see that this Jagged Sword was obviously better than the earlier one with +2 in attack…</p>
 <p>Qing Shui reached out his hand to pick up the newly completed Jagged Sword and could immediately feel a small amount of strength spreading from his palms to his body. Qing Shui smiled bitterly as he sensed that this two point increment in attack would be about the equivalent of 20 jin of strength and could be considered quite good for ordinary people. If this attribute was on an axe, when ordinary people would use it to chop firewood, an additional 20 jin of strength would be good as it would allow the person to chop more firewood.</p>
 <p>Qing shui casually waved the sword a couple of times, and touched the blade of the sword which lightly knocked it to create a crisp and sharp sound. Qing Shui then picked up the one Hu You made earlier.</p>
 <p>Comparing the two, Qing Shui knew that his could barely, but still could be considered as thoroughly tempered. That sturdy and flexibility was much better than Hu You’s by a few tiers.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui held the two swords in each of his hands, then he suddenly crossed his hands, clashing the two swords against each other!</p>
 <p>Ding! Clank!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw that while the two swords were made of the same material, his got away without a scratch while Hu You’s broke in the middle.</p>
 <p>Only after doing this did Qing Shui think that it might make Hu You look bad, but he saw that Hu You did not appear frustrated, awkward, or unsatisfied, but instead was looking at Qing Shui with a happy and passionate gaze.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled awkwardly as he handed this sword with two increment in strength to Hu You, not saying a word.</p>
 <p>Hu You received it happily then took a good look at it seriously. Qing Shui washed his hands and noticed that it was already noon. He rubbed his nose and nodded towards the two ladies, signalling that they should be heading back.</p>
 <p>As they walked out of the blacksmith store, Qing Shui saw that both Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li were looking at him with unblinking eyes. Qing Shui blinked his pair of beautiful eyes once, before blinking it two more times quickly. When the two ladies were feeling puzzled, he stuck out his tongue and licked a round around his lips.</p>
 <p>“Rascal!”</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li laughed softly as she reprimanded Qing Shui while taking two quick steps forward with the blushing Canghai Mingyue with a goddess look, leaving Qing Shui behind!</p>
 <p>“Rascals are good!!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui mumbled as he looked at the two beauties’ back view. Both Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-LIl were tall and slender ladies, and even their curves were alarmingly similar, and their beauty was extremely attractive. </p>
 <p>They proceeded with very light steps, their slender and long legs and that nice curves at their waists made Qing Shui’s mouth start to feel parched. It was especially so when he recalled that Huoyun Liu-Li’s wonderful back had almost been completely touched all over.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui heard that under the men’s burning gazes, women would also get a strong feeling, even if they were targeted at their back. They could especially feel it if they were being stared at more sensitive spots. After staring for a while, Qing Shui only felt that he was extremely parched and had a reaction.</p>
 <p>Holding the first sword that Qing Shui had created, Huoyun Liu-Li toyed with it happily as she chatted with Canghai Mingyue. That bright expression was just like the one of a lady who had fallen into the river of love. However, it was a pity that she did not understand it well herself. Canghai Mingyue saw this and suddenly thought that the reason she could clearly sense the feelings Liu-Li had for Qing Shui was because she was looking at it from an outside perspective.</p>
 <p>“Would I be a participant?”</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue suddenly turned her thoughts to herself before shaking her head firmly. She felt that the door in her heart was yet to open, and she had not let the feelings of love enter. There was no one in her heart whom she held dear feelings for.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, there was a disturbance in front, and noisy quarrels came to Qing Shui’s ears!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw that amongst them, there were many men and women wearing pure white clothes and each of them had a longsword with them. Doubt rose in his heart. Were they not from Immortal Sword Sect? Who would dare to go against them?</p>
 <p>“There’s something going on over there, let’s go take a look!” Qing Shui walked up to the two ladies as he grinned and said.</p>
 <p>The two ladies nodded and joined Qing Shui as he headed towards the crowd.</p>
 <p>“This Immortal Sword Sect is really unreasonable. They frequently do these acts of bullying.” An old man sighed and said.</p>
 <p>“They would use such underhand methods each time in an attempt to buy stuff from others at prices that were so low that it was unreasonable. If the other party was not willing to sell, they would resort to threats or even snatch it by force.” A lean young man said furiously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could heard the discussions around before he had even reached. They were all reprimanding Immortal Sword Sect for their barbarous acts of bullying.</p>
 <p>“Old man, how can you find it cheap to be paid 10 silver taels for this lousy thing? You’re selling it for 100,000 silver taels. Aren’t you trying to fool others?” Qing Shui heard an arrogant voice speaking out.</p>
 <p>Before he heard the voice, Qing Shui already had the urge to beat him up, but he still held back the urge and turned towards the source of the voice. On the first look, Qing Shui almost could not hold in his urge to step forth and give him a beating.</p>
 <p>It was a young man who was about 25-26 years of age, and the suit of white on him gave Qing Shui the urge to puke. That was because he was a big fatty who was big enough to fit two burly men. Each of his legs were as thick as a muscular adult man’s waist.</p>
 <p>This fatty had a height of two meters, and his waistline was also two meters. These were not the reasons Qing Shui had the urge to give him a beating as he saw that his face was like a big meatball. After looking for very long, he finally made out two small eyes each with the size of a green bean and a small nose.</p>
 <p>The actual reason was that this fatty was hugging a lady with quite a good figure. The tall lady with a curvy figure was like a young kid standing beside the big fatty. Her pretty appearance appeared to be like a fairy’s beside the fatty’s face which was like a lump of meat.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at this big fatty and that curvy lady, and naturally started to wonder how they would be in bed? That big fatty would squash that petite lady into a patty. These were not important, since it could be such that the lady was on top of the guy. However, when Qing Shui saw those two legs which were full of disgusting bulging fats and that saggy stomach which was lower than his lower region, Qing Shui wondered how big that sausage of his must become to be able to squeeze its way out of that pile of flesh.</p>
