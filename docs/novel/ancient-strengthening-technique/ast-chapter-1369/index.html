 <p><strong>AST 1369 - The formidable Five Elements Spring of Life</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui still felt quite satisfied after seeing its effect. The Five Elements Spring of Life not only helped to build a good foundation, it even helped to strengthen one’s body cells as well as their organs. It helped to refine one’s physical body, remove impurities from them and also thicken the Vital Essence within.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was quite satisfied with this. He had already succeeded. “One should strike while the iron’s hot”. Qing Shui started refining the Five Elements Spring of Life. He did it continuously and only stopped when he went out of the realm. Halfway through the process, he only failed twice,succeeding with the rest.</p>
 <p>There were a total of twenty bottles of powder of Five Elements Spring of Life. Each bottle could be used once. Qing Shui was quite satisfied with the result.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui exited the realm, he immediately asked Yehuang Guwu to get some water ready. Yuan Su was also present. But because Qing Shui and Yehuang Guwu were husband and wife, a fact that Yuan Su herself was aware of, when she saw Qing Shui had no intention to leave, she had no choice but to leave them temporarily.</p>
 <p>The reason why Qing Shui stayed here was because he was scared that accidents might happen. In any case, he was already someone who was quite independent, let alone both him and Yehuang Guwu having long been considered to be husband and wife. In Qing Shui’s heart, they already shared this kind of relationship since a long time ago.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu also didn’t have much opinion about it. This was her room. After she locked the door, she went in front of Qing Shui, “I want you to take off your coat.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and immediately embraced her. He quickly blocked those sexy lips of hers with lips of his own. In the first moment, his tongue was already inside her mouth. It was entangling itself on that pink tongue of hers as he greedily sucked on it.</p>
 <p>Both of his hands were also slowly moving up and down as they made their way below her clothes. Yehuang Guwu didn’t struggle while he was doing it. In fact, she was passionately returning his kisses while she was hugging him tightly.</p>
 <p>Her soft breasts were curvy and shaped like half melons. They seemed very squeezable, yet at the same time, they were also very firm. It somehow felt like they were just about the right size, making them particularly attractive. They weren’t overly large.</p>
 <p>They were smooth and really spongy. Qing Shui had his other hand stroking the well-rounded buttocks of hers. Her skin felt extremely exquisite, as soft as water.</p>
 <p>“Alright Qing Shui, the water is going to get cold in a while,” Yehuang Guwu gasped, while avoiding Qing Shui’s mouth. On that fair face of hers, there was traces of both shyness and happiness.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took back his hands and helped her to slowly take off her clothes. With the Nine Yang Golden Body at Grand Perfection Stage, it could be said that there wouldn’t be any problems with him staying with Yehuang Guwu. But he had already promised her that they wouldn’t do anything more until he reached False God Realm.</p>
 <p>Even if he wanted to do anything more now, it was likely that Yehuang Guwu wouldn’t agree to it. It had been so many years, she wouldn’t mind waiting for a couple more. She didn’t want to harm Qing Shui in any way. As long as she could stay together with Qing Shui, she would be willing to accept it even if they didn’t manage to be husband and wife. Of course, to her, this would also be considered her biggest regret in life.</p>
 <p>The water in the bathtub was really hot. The Five Elements Spring of Life was already blended into it. At this moment, the water had already turned dark green. It looked really nice. It was giving off abundant vital aura, as well as an alluring fragrance.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Yehuang Guwu was already standing in front of Qing Shui completely naked. Her flawless body was really attractive, causing Qing Shui’s tool to immediately react. He then instantly lifted his robes.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu let out a soft gasp. After that, she slowly dipped her body into the bathtub. The water within the bathtub started giving off small bubbles at a very fast rate. There were a lot of them and they were also very concentrated. This was evidence that the pores across a human’s body were absorbing the water.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu closed her eyes slightly. She looked to be really calm and seemed like she was really enjoying it. Qing Shui stood by the side of the tub. This was a medicinal dosage enough only for one person. Furthermore, it was also his first time using it, hence, Qing Shui decided to stay with Yehuang Guwu so that if anything was to happen, he would be able to save her easily.</p>
 <p>Time flowed on little by little. It seemed like Qing Shui’s worries were a bit redundant. The bubbles within the tub seemed to be infinite but as time passed, the dark green color of the water began to fade away. Furthermore, the water no longer looked as clear as before.</p>
 <p>It had only been two hours but the bubbles were getting fewer and fewer. Meanwhile, more and more impurities could be seen appearing in the water. Yehuang Guwu on the other hand, had begun to look more and more fair and smooth. Her skin, which was already really fair and smooth to begin with, now seemed to even contain a kind of spiritual nature.</p>
 <p>Upon opening her eyes, before she managed to sense the change to her body, she jumped out of the water immediately after seeing the impurities in the water. She said in shock, “Why is the water so dirty?”</p>
 <p>“It’s not dirty. These are the impurities that were hidden deep within your body. If it had been someone else, theirs would most likely be jet-black in color. This means that it is effective.” Qing Shui was telling the truth.</p>
 <p>Guwu straight away went to another tub. She only felt better after doing this. Despite this, she was still really happy because its effect was really great.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was also able to sense some of the changes taking place within her body with his Spiritual Sense. In comparison to before, it was similar to when the foundation of a building had gotten many times stronger. Prior to this, it was just a building with ordinary foundation but now, it was as if it was further supported by many pillars and reinforced with steel. This was how a change was supposed to be, a dramatic change.</p>
 <p>After the impurities within her body went through such a thorough cleansing, even her lifespan had increased. Similarly, both her vital force as well as the abilities of her organs also skyrocketed.</p>
 <p>Despite this, her cultivation didn’t increase much. Her strength had become more condensed, similarly, her battle prowess also increased by a lot. Her strength was directly connected to the white tigers. Four times her strength, they were capable of everything. Hence, when her strength increased, it would be as if the strength of the white tigers had also been focused. Both their attack prowess as well as ability to survive had increased significantly.</p>
 <p>“This medical powder is really magical. This way, it has helped me save up at least ten years of my time to refine my own body.” Yehuang Guwu was really excited. Of course she would be, other people would have felt the same if the same thing were to happen to them.</p>
 <p>“This is a medical prescription Yuan Su made herself. Despite it being a bit difficult to refine, it carries a great effect. It isn’t considered to be a Divine Grade medical powder, but it can still be considered to be a Legendary Grade medicine.” Qing Shui was really happy. Simultaneously, he really admired Yuan Su’s talent in making medicines.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, what do you think of Younger Sister Su?” Yehuang Guwu was submerged within the water with her body leaning forward against the side of the tub. Her body was slightly bent. That posture of hers could make Qing Shui spurt blood.</p>
 <p>In just a moment, Qing Shui tore off his clothing as he instantly appeared behind her and stroked his hand over her waist.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, slow down, be more gentle!” Yehuang Guwu blushed and whispered in an annoyed tone.</p>
 <p>They were both now soaked in water. Their skin looked really smooth. As soon as Qing Shui straightened up, he could control no longer. He immediately found himself entering a warm and moist spot as he let out a moan of enjoyment.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu felt a painful sensation within her body. She was not concerned about it however because this time, unlike before, Qing Shui entered straight into her most private spot. She quickly reacted and said, “No……”</p>
 <p>But it was already too late. An ice-flame like energy went into Qing Shui’s body. Qing Shui was embracing her and he didn’t dare to move even an inch. The nameless technique was revolving rapidly. The bones inside his body shone really brightly. Of course, it was not visible from the outside.</p>
 <p>Wherever the ice-flame like gas passed, a tiny rift would appear in his meridians causing him extreme agony. The Golden Pellet within his Dantian was also revolving very swiftly while giving off faint light.</p>
 <p>The Nine Continents Mountain was also giving off waves after waves of energy of Shield Attack. It was constantly clashing against the invading force to prevent it from attacking his Dantian.</p>
 <p>It was the first time the Emperor’s Qi gave off such an enormous imposing energy. It was as if it was facing off against a servant who was trying to rebel against itself.</p>
 <p>But it seemed like the ice-flame like aura was unusually strong. It was just like a White Tiger God of War. The current situation had long since been out of the control of these two. Qing Shui was unable to even withdraw from it.</p>
 <p>Similarly, Yehuang Guwu was also feeling really nervous. The worries she had in her heart had already gone all the way up to her throat. If any accidents were to really happen to Qing Shui, she would definitely accompany him even in death.</p>
 <p>An ice-flame like aura came through from Yehuang Guwu’s body. It was constantly wreaking havoc within Qing Shui’s body. Qing Shui never expected himself to be able to only barely withstand it even after he achieved the Grand Perfection Realm. If things were to continue on like this, even he didn’t know how long he could withstand it.</p>
 <p>Could it be because she had broken through to the False God Realm?</p>
 <p>It should be, even now Qing Shui was also really worried. If he really died like this, it would be just like the saying “one night romance with a gorgeous girl, a happy death thus deserve”.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was adjusting all of the energies within his body. Certainly, he didn’t want to die just yet. There were still a lot of things he needed to do. He was just one step away from False God and achieving Eighth Heavenly Layer. Very soon, he would be able to do the things he wanted to without any restrictions.</p>
 <p>His meridians wouldn’t really snap in just such a short while but the spider-web like wounds on top of them were increasing gradually. Luckily, Qing Shui’s body was powerful enough. If it had been someone else, their meridians would have snapped a long time ago.</p>
 <p>The only pain in the neck for Qing Shui was his Dantian. The unguardable qi had already penetrated its way through his Dantian. It was constantly attacking the Golden Pellet within his Dantian. The Golden Pellet was the base of operations, the foundation. If anything was to go wrong with it, it would certainly put an end to his journey as a warrior.</p>
 <p>Time went on little by little. The expression on Qing Shui’s face turned more and more bitter. Yehuang Guwu’s face on the other hand, had long been filled with her own tears. She was well aware of what was happening. In fact, she understood just as much as Qing Shui. The reason being that now, the two were now connected with each other. Certainly, she wouldn’t know about Qing Shui’s secret. It was just that she was well aware of what kind of situation she and Qing Shui were in.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, if I die, will it mean that you will be ok? With my Vital Qi gone, will you finally be able to free yourself?” Yehuang Guwu asked softly.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu was already completely on the passive side. She had lost control over her body but her consciousness still belonged to her, she was still able to converse normally.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui on the other hand, was also able to control his own body as well as his consciousness. However, he was unable to withdraw his tool. He was able to control the his martial techniques and now the two of them was ‘connected’, that strange surge of qi energy between them seemed to have become a single entity. If any one of them wanted to separate the energy away from each other, it would either mean one of them had to die or...he would have to take it out by extreme force. In other words, Qing Shui would have to cut off his family jewels.</p>
 <p>It’s certain that Qing Shui wouldn’t do that. Even though some of the miraculous medicinal pills could help that thingy grow back, there was still an uncertainty to it happening. Without that, he would be better off dead and it hadn’t really gotten to the point where he needed to castrate himself.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head, “Stop with the nonsense. If things are really going to turn out that way, I think I will be better off dying.”</p>
 <p>“I don’t want to live after you die either.”</p>
 <p>“Neither of us is going to die. You haven’t become my woman yet,” Qing Shui said, pretending to be relaxed.</p>
 <p>“I am, now, even if I am to die, I won’t have any regrets. The only thing I will be upset about is that I have yet to give birth to any of your children. I am sure our child will be really good-looking,” Yehuang Guwu said with a forceful smile.</p>
 <p>“He will, don’t worry about it. Then, let’s give birth to two of our babies, one of them will be a boy, whereas the other one will be a girl.” Qing Shui responded while trying to come up with a plan. Meanwhile, he still had to block the surging ice-flame like aura with great effort.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui felt the vital force within Yehuang Guwu’s body draining away.</p>
 <p>“If you are really trying to do that, I will make my Dantian explode immediately. We are better off dead together.” Qing Shui was really frightened. He quickly reacted to it. His tone has managed to put a stop to Yehuang Guwu’s suicide act. She felt a slight warmth in her heart but, was she really only able to enjoy such a short period of happiness?</p>
