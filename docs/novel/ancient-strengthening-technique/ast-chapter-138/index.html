  <p><strong>AST 0138 – Healing an Incurable Condition</strong> </p>
  <p>Should I do it, or not?</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s inner state of mind right now was extremely chaotic. Especially when Mingyue said the words that she would never again remarry. Since such a proper and demure woman like her could say that, if Qing Shui continued to reject her, she would definitely think that Qingshui was looking down on her.</p>
  <p>Although Qing Shui wasn’t a gentleman, he wasn’t a hypocrite either. He was just a man who was true to his baser instincts. As Qing Shui hurriedly hugged Mingyue, he silently decided in that instant that he would never forsake her.</p>
  <p>The blanket and clothes slid down, as they did, so did the remaining undergarments as well as the clothes on Qing Shui!</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, don’t look!” Mingyue shyly lowered her head. She could clearly feel the hot gaze of Qing Shui roaming her body.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui carried Mingyue as he placed her gently on the bed.</p>
  <p>Her beauty under moonlight beauty seemed boundless, as Qing Shui laid on top of Mingyue, pressing her down onto the bed.</p>
  <p>Sounds of moaning and breathless gasps echoed out in the stillness of the night as the holy looking countenance of Mingyue was now masked with frenzied lust. This type of charm and beauty was something impossible to describe.</p>
  <p>……</p>
  <p>“Mingyue, do you regret it?” Qing Shui embraced her on the bed as he asked lightly.</p>
  <p>“I don’t… as long as it’s you, then I don’t regret anything!” Mingyue gently replied.</p>
  <p>“In the future, you will be my woman. Now, I also have a beautiful wife as well as an adorable daughter.” Qing Shui gazed at the, ‘after-the-deed’, the passion-filled face of Mingyue as he seriously remarked.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, this doesn’t seem to be too fair to you.” Mingyue Gelou spoke, sounding slightly bitter and dejected. After all she was clear that in her heart, she was a widow, and her daughter also had no blood relations with Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“There shouldn’t be any talk of fairness and whatnot. As long as I’m willing, Yuchang is my daughter, my blood daughter! Otherwise, do you want her to ask you where her father is when she grows up in the future, and only to tell her she that has no father? I love her, as well as you. I can’t do without the both of you. This should be sufficient.” Qing Shui stared into the beautiful eyes of Mingyue as he said with determination.</p>
  <p>After listening to what was somewhat akin to a ‘love confession’ from Qing Shui, warmth blossomed in Mingyue’s heart, as tears of happiness fell from her eyes.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, why are you so nice to me, why? Why are you so nice?” Mingyue placed her head into the embrace of Qing Shui as she mumbled.</p>
  <p>“Daddy!”</p>
  <p>Little Yuchang had awakened. Qing Shui carried the little lass over, placing her between him and Mingyue. The happy family of three gazed at the moonlight outside. Seeing this scene, Mingyue felt joy, as well as sadness in her heart.</p>
  <p>Ever since he had first obtained the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, this was the first night that Qing Shui didn’t enter. Beautiful women have always been the downfall of great heroes. Qing Shui silently gazed at far off horizon, lost in his thoughts.</p>
  <p>There was already a distant light gradually brightening the sky over in the eastern horizon. Maybe it was because of over exhaustion, but Mingyue had fallen asleep. Qing Shui gently kissed her forehead as well as tucking the little lass into bed before he got up from the bed.</p>
  <p>During his daily morning practice, Qing Shui wasn’t able to calm his heart. In his mind, the images of the holy countenance of Mingyue floated about, before transforming into the icy cold countenance of Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
  <p>During breakfast, everyone was curiously eyeing Mingyue Gelou! Very quickly, an expression of shyness appeared on her face.</p>
  <p>“Sister Mingyue looks so beautiful today!” Qing bei happily exclaimed.</p>
  <p>The words of Qing bei caused several members of the Qing Clan to involuntarily look at Qing Shui. However, Qing Shui’s expression remained unchanged as he happily played with little Yuchang.</p>
  <p>The newlywed couple, Qing Zi and Feng Yanfei, also curiously gazed at Qing Shui. Especially Yanfei, a light shone brightly in her eyes as she regarded him.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui didn’t bother to react as he calmly ate his breakfast. After breakfast, under the looks of curiosity on the faces of his Clan members, Qing Shui decided to bring little Yuchang to stroll the streets of the city.</p>
  <p>“Brother Shui, I wanna go with you!”</p>
  <p>“Brother Shui, wait for me.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui, “…”</p>
  <p>Initially he had just wanted to bring little Yuchang out alone, but who would think that it would have turned into something like a family outing.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked as Qing You rushed forward, pushing and jostling the wealthy people in his way. But, upon coming across to people in poverty, he would become extremely polite and kind, and even helped an old granny cross the road!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was speechless. He didn’t know that Qing You hated wealthy people so much.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui decided to accompany little Yuchang today, and return to the Martial clinic tomorrow. He decided that during spring next year, he would go to the Sky Sword Sect together with Wenren Wu-Shuang.</p>
  <p>“Doctor, wait!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui turned his head back after hearing a familiar voice. Wasn’t this the rich young master that lacked the Yang element in his body? The one that had interrupted his chat with Wu-shuang?</p>
  <p>“Has he fulfilled all my conditions? The 1,000 Year Ginseng, and 1,000 Year Snow Lotus?” Qing Shui’s heart trembled, but his countenance remained calm as he looked at that young master.</p>
  <p>“Doctor, as per your instructions, I’ve waited half a month, and brought all the things you requested. Look…”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at the expression of absolute belief in the eyes of the young master as he shook his head. Was his confidence in him this high because of the astronomical price he had demanded?</p>
  <p>“Wait for me at the Martial clinic.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui left little Yuchang with Qing bei and the rest as he set off to the martial clinic. When he arrived, the youth was already waiting there. Upon seeing the arrival of Qing Shui, a smile appeared on his face.</p>
  <p>“These are the herbs you requested, and every stalk of it is at least 1,500 years old. Please take a look!” The youth placed two intricately designed boxes on the table.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled and as he opened the boxes, a rich spiritual qi permeated the air. The 1,000 Year Ginseng was purple in color, and was as thick as an arm, while the 1,000 Year Snow Lotus seemingly had a glow surrounding it. Pleased with the quality of the herbs, Qing Shui smiled as he kept the boxes.</p>
  <p>“Go to the 2nd floor!”</p>
  <p>“Do you think that I can cure this illness of yours when many others have said that it is incurable?” Given the speed in which he had gathered the required herbs, Qing Shui knew that the background of this young master probably wouldn’t lose out much even when compared to the Skysword Sect.</p>
  <p>“No idea, but I’ve already spent countless treasures and money, visiting countless doctors. For some reason, I felt as though you could see right through me the moment we first met. Even if it fails again this time, I have nothing to lose.” The young master replied somewhat bitterly.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt a trace of admiration for the frankness of the youth!</p>
  <p>“Lie down and disrobe.” Qing Shui retrieved his 9 golden needles which sparkled with a blinding, brilliant light.</p>
  <p>“You really know what illness I suffer from?” That young master asked in surprise.</p>
  <p>“Your body is innately lacking the Yang element, and thus you are unable to do the deed with women.” Qing Shui replied as the young master could be seen gradually getting embarrassed.</p>
  <p>“There’s no need to be embarrassed. As long as you are cured, wouldn’t it all go away? Believe in me!” Qing Shui, after studying the personality of this young master, realized that he had taken a liking to him. Decisive, mature, and not the least bit arrogant. Qing shui had hopes to make friends with those that possessed such admirable qualities.</p>
  <p>An intense light flashed in the eyes of the young master upon hearing Qing Shui’s words. That was a gaze filled with hope! Qing Shui knew that the young master truly believed that he had a method to treat him.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui had already seen the naked bodies of three top tier women. He had totally zero interest in men. Looking at the now naked body of the young master, as a doctor, he still had to take this seriously. Glancing at the flaccid tool of the young master, Qing Shui inserted needle after needle rapidly into the Xinyu, Shenyu, Mingmen, Zhishi, Qihai, and Weigong acupoints of the young master’s lower body!</p>
  <p>All these acupoints connected the 5 organs and 6 viscera, and had the potential to seriously damage the human body upon the slightest insertion. However, under the combination of the Golden needles and primordial flame technique, it was able to strengthen the constitution and spirit, as well as regulate the amount of ‘moisture’ and ‘heat’ in the human body.</p>
  <p>Lack of the Yang element caused a shrivelled kidney. Luckily, only one of his kidneys was damaged. The greatest benefits of the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, was to increase vitality, recovering the internal organs, clearing the energy channels, strengthening the bones and flesh, as well as nurturing the Dantian.</p>
  <p>The young master started to feel pain so intense that it was almost unbearable. Gradually his body became hot as he perspired rapidly, his body lying in a puddle of sweat.</p>
  <p>Abruptly, his previously permanently flaccid tool began to feel warm. The young master was so agitated that traces of blood could be seen in his excitement-filled eyes.</p>
  <p>The young master could feel that his tool gradually began to erect, as tears of happiness streaked down his face. These tears, were tears of happiness!</p>
  <p>The young master, every time he saw the look of despair in the eyes of his parents, he would always blame himself. Subconsciously, he had always felt that he was not the equal of other men, and again and again, he had always let down the girls that loved him.</p>
  <p>Letting them down, causing them sadness, and yet he was the one that was hurt the most of all.</p>
  <p>As his tool hardened to something akin to steel, Qing Shui slowly retrieved the Golden needles that he had inserted!</p>

 <p>“These are the herbs you requested, and every stalk of it is at least 1,500 years old. Please take a look!” The youth placed two intricately designed boxes on the table.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and as he opened the boxes, a rich spiritual qi permeated the air. The 1,000 Year Ginseng was purple in color, and was as thick as an arm, while the 1,000 Year Snow Lotus seemingly had a glow surrounding it. Pleased with the quality of the herbs, Qing Shui smiled as he kept the boxes.</p>
 <p>“Go to the 2nd floor!”</p>
 <p>“Do you think that I can cure this illness of yours when many others have said that it is incurable?” Given the speed in which he had gathered the required herbs, Qing Shui knew that the background of this young master probably wouldn’t lose out much even when compared to the Skysword Sect.</p>
 <p>“No idea, but I’ve already spent countless treasures and money, visiting countless doctors. For some reason, I felt as though you could see right through me the moment we first met. Even if it fails again this time, I have nothing to lose.” The young master replied somewhat bitterly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt a trace of admiration for the frankness of the youth!</p>
 <p>“Lie down and disrobe.” Qing Shui retrieved his 9 golden needles which sparkled with a blinding, brilliant light.</p>
 <p>“You really know what illness I suffer from?” That young master asked in surprise.</p>
 <p>“Your body is innately lacking the Yang element, and thus you are unable to do the deed with women.” Qing Shui replied as the young master could be seen gradually getting embarrassed.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need to be embarrassed. As long as you are cured, wouldn’t it all go away? Believe in me!” Qing Shui, after studying the personality of this young master, realized that he had taken a liking to him. Decisive, mature, and not the least bit arrogant. Qing shui had hopes to make friends with those that possessed such admirable qualities.</p>
 <p>An intense light flashed in the eyes of the young master upon hearing Qing Shui’s words. That was a gaze filled with hope! Qing Shui knew that the young master truly believed that he had a method to treat him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had already seen the naked bodies of three top tier women. He had totally zero interest in men. Looking at the now naked body of the young master, as a doctor, he still had to take this seriously. Glancing at the flaccid tool of the young master, Qing Shui inserted needle after needle rapidly into the Xinyu, Shenyu, Mingmen, Zhishi, Qihai, and Weigong acupoints of the young master’s lower body!</p>
 <p>All these acupoints connected the 5 organs and 6 viscera, and had the potential to seriously damage the human body upon the slightest insertion. However, under the combination of the Golden needles and primordial flame technique, it was able to strengthen the constitution and spirit, as well as regulate the amount of ‘moisture’ and ‘heat’ in the human body.</p>
 <p>Lack of the Yang element caused a shrivelled kidney. Luckily, only one of his kidneys was damaged. The greatest benefits of the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, was to increase vitality, recovering the internal organs, clearing the energy channels, strengthening the bones and flesh, as well as nurturing the Dantian.</p>
 <p>The young master started to feel pain so intense that it was almost unbearable. Gradually his body became hot as he perspired rapidly, his body lying in a puddle of sweat.</p>
 <p>Abruptly, his previously permanently flaccid tool began to feel warm. The young master was so agitated that traces of blood could be seen in his excitement-filled eyes.</p>
 <p>The young master could feel that his tool gradually began to erect, as tears of happiness streaked down his face. These tears, were tears of happiness!</p>
 <p>The young master, every time he saw the look of despair in the eyes of his parents, he would always blame himself. Subconsciously, he had always felt that he was not the equal of other men, and again and again, he had always let down the girls that loved him.</p>
 <p>Letting them down, causing them sadness, and yet he was the one that was hurt the most of all.</p>
 <p>As his tool hardened to something akin to steel, Qing Shui slowly retrieved the Golden needles that he had inserted!</p>
