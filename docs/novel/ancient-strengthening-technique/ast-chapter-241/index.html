 <p><strong>Chapter 241 Southern Guest Inn.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 241 Southern Guest Inn</strong></p>
  <p>Within a flash, the “dream” disappeared, and Qing Shui and Qinghan Ye came back to reality. Qing Shui managed to catch a glimpse of the disappearing view of Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
  <p>One day and night in the “dream” was actually just a few breaths’ time. Qing Shui was holding onto Qinghan Ye’s hand tightly. That nameless Duo Cultivation Technique was still circulating between themselves and it felt very comfortable. Qinghan Ye’s head was almost buried into that soft peaks of hers.</p>
  <p>Recovering his gaze, Qing Shui saw that Qinghan Ye was extremely embarrassed. He recalled the live pornographic scene he had watched together with her, and it was especially thrilling…</p>
  <p>Moreover, she had been so proactive, and that wonderful scene was directly imprinted in her mind. It was a feeling that she would never forget.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui had never expected this lady in the “dream” had taken off his clothes for him and had also taken off all her own clothes as well. Recalling her innate seductive charms, Qing Shui’s heart thumped. Everything that appeared earlier was no different from experiencing it in real life. It was the blending of the souls, and would not lose out to having sex in real life. It was an exchange of the mind and soul. It was one of the topmost quality, and an experience that was hard to come by.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui recalled that they had fully enjoyed themselves in various postures before. It was a blending of the soul and body to one’s content. Qing Shui had not expected to have such an “affinity” with her.</p>
  <p>It was as if he had controlled the “dream” himself. All the postures he thought of appeared. When he recalled the feeling of ecstasy, he could not find any words to describe his feeling. He will keep that wonderful feeling in his heart forever!</p>
  <p>While in real life he had only held hands with Qinghan Ye, but it was as if the two of them already had a physical relationship. It was one which was an even closer relationship than if they were to have a physical relationship in real life.</p>
  <p>“You’re still recollecting?” Qing Shui said teasingly as he looked at Qinghan Ye who still did not dare to raise her head.</p>
  <p>“Ah!” She lifted her head in a panic. That familiar face from the “dream” which was full of seductive charms appeared before Qing Shui again. Her most beautiful charming eyes showed panic, not knowing where to look towards.</p>
  <p>“Are we still going for lunch?” Qing Shui saw how uneasy Qinghan Ye was appearing, and knew that she was feeling embarrassed over how proactive she had been in the dream.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, I’m not like that.” Qinghan Ye’s big beautiful eyes were full of sparkles as she looked at Qing Shui. It was as if she would break out in tears any moment.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was stunned as he looked at Qinghan Ye, not bearing to tease her any further. Qing Shui did not know how he felt about her now. He no longer felt the same towards her from before. What if he were to get entangled with her just because of a dream that felt very real…</p>
  <p>“Alright, let’s go for food!” Qing Shui tugged on the dazed Qinghan Ye.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt the changes to his body as he walked, realizing that his level of cultivation had a lot of progress from just practicing a Duo Cultivation Technique of the soul. The drop in his Dan Tian had grown from the size of a grape to the size of a walnut. The powers emitting from the swirl made his heart throb.</p>
  <p>Qinghan Ye would throw an occasional glance towards Qing Shui, but once he turned to look at her, she would quickly turn away. Even her exquisite earlobes had turned into a cute pink color.</p>
  <p>“Southern Guest Inn” appeared before Qing Shui and Qinghan Ye. A wonderful “dream” experience turned Qinghan Ye into an ostrich, and was led in by Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>This was Qing Shui’s first visit to this restaurant. He did not have the habit of visiting restaurants. He felt that it was not comparable to Earthly Paradise, but there was still a lot of traffic. There were five storeys, each level was bustling with activity.</p>
  <p>When a person gained power, there would generally be two possible situations. The first one would be to make a ruckus in the streets, and to get everything he wanted through brute force. The second one would be to stay in seclusion, and these people would tend to bring their cultivation to a peak. For the latter, the most important was a heart which no longer craved after fame and reputation.</p>
  <p>“Sir, miss, this way please!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui and Qinghan Ye were led upstairs by a young waitress. Qing Shui had requested for a seat on the highest level, preferably one which would allow them to have a view of the streets and be next to the windows.</p>
  <p>They casually ordered a few dishes, one of which was Steamed Bear’s Palm, an absolute delicacy in Qing Shui’s previous life. However, bear’s palm was no different from the pig’s trotters from his previous life. Normal bears were even reduced to being a home pet.</p>
  <p>It may be because a seat on the fifth storey was more expensive. There were not as many people as compared to the lower storeys. Therefore, there were still quite a number of window seats that would allow them to look at the human traffic and other buildings in the street.</p>
  <p>Qinghan Ye kept her sexy lips tightly closed, occasionally sizing up Qing Shui. There were even times when she would fall into a daze as she looked at him. When she was caught red-handed by Qing Shui, she would turn her gaze in panic. Her charming face would turn into the color of a sunset from embarrassment.</p>
  <p>“You like to look at me secretly?” When the two of them were left, Qing Shui chuckled and asked when he saw Qinghan Ye secretly glancing at him again.</p>
  <p>To Qing Shui, Qinghan Ye was a charming lady with a mature disposition. He had never thought that she would have such a weak side to her, making her appear a bit cute and shy.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui knew she was embarrassed. It may be because she had gone through a mental change after their “physical relationship”. It was not just a sexual experience, but a collision of the body and soul, an exchange of the soul. There may not be a pair amongst thousands or ten thousand people.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, are you a Extreme Yang Body?” Qinghan Ye did not reply to Qing Shui’s words but looked at him and asked.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui did not expect Qinghan Ye to ask such a question. He did not know if he was a Extreme Yang Body, but one thing for sure was that his Yang Qi was especially strong. It would be able to take Qinghan Ye’s Extreme Yin Body</p>
  <p>“I don’t know, since there’s no clear concept for a Extreme Yang Body.” Qing Shui looked at the embarrassed Qinghan Ye who was trying to put up a front as he replied.</p>
  <p>“Then in real life, would you… be able to do that?” Qinghan Ye turned her gaze out of the windows, but the side of her face was already covered in a layer of red blush.</p>
  <p>“Do what?” Qing Shui asked, puzzled. He was actually secretly smiling in his heart. How could he answer to himself if he did not make good use of the chance to tease her properly?</p>
  <p>“Didn’t you say that if a guy is a Extreme Yang Body, one should see if he could… do it for a very long time with women? Just like… just like how it was in our “dream”… If you are able to do it for so long in real life… would you be considered to have a Extreme Yang Body?”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at Qinghan Ye mumbling as she said these words. Towards the back, he would not be able to catch it if it was not for his good hearing. Hearing a beautiful lady saying such words really made his blood boil, especially when he was looking at her delicious, charming expression. Qing Shui knew that if he had a Extreme Yang Body, it was very likely that she would ask him to remove her Nine Yin Qi, even if it was just to let the old man feel relieved.</p>
  <p>“You foolish girl, even one with a Extreme Yang Body would not go through all that. Although I have not tried it before, I do know that I’ll have no problem going through it for three days and nights.” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
  <p>Hearing Qing Shui’s intimate and undisguised words, Qinghan Ye felt a bit panicky, turning her gaze all around. Her expression was so cute as if she was a lady who had just set foot in the area of love. It added onto that charming and intoxicating appearance. Qing Shui felt that she seemed even more delicious than the delicacies laid out on the table. Qing Shui did not know that she was in fact a lady who had never fell in love before.</p>
  <p>“Alright, let’s eat. We have plenty of time in the future.” Qing Shui passed Qinghan Ye a pair of silver chopsticks and chuckled.</p>
  <p>Receiving the chopsticks Qing Shui handed over, her watery eyes glanced towards at Qing Shui before starting to eat small bites slowly. However, her thoughts had long wandered off.</p>
  <p>Actually, Qing Shui did not know if he had a Extreme Yang Body, but now that he had brought his Ancient Strengthening Technique to the 4th heavenly layer, it would probably go beyond the effects of the Extreme Yang Body.</p>
  <p>The meal was very gloomy. Qinghan Ye did not really lift her head all the time, but Qing Shui felt torn. It was a blessing from heavens to meet a person who could go through a spiritual Duo Cultivation with you amongst thousands or ten thousands of people. Qing Shui soon discovered that he had already came across a few ladies around him.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui thought of having beauties surrounding him, but it was merely a thought. Other than Shi Qingzhuang who had already become his fiancee, Mingyue Gelou who was definitely his, and Zhu Qing who was an accident, there was still Wenren Wushuang. Qing Shui realized that his relationships were in a mess.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui knew that he did not have the ability to go around a few ladies, just like how he had met Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li. Even relationship with such friends who had no confirmed relationships with him were already like this. He did not know if he was feeling guilty or if they had entered his heart…</p>
  <p>Thinking of this, Qing Shui rubbed his nose. He was not in that kind of relationship with them. It was his own freedom to be with whichever lady he wished to be with. Having thought of this, Qing Shui felt a little less burdened.</p>
  <p>“Let’s go!”</p>
  <p>More than half the food on the table was finished. Qing Shui’s appetite was especially good. Not only was his powers brought to greater heights, that ecstasy from the “dream” earlier left in a very good mood.</p>
  <p>“I’m heading back to the blacksmith store. Are you heading back to the Thousand Year Medicinal Store?” After leaving Southern Guest Inn, Qing Shui looked towards Qinghan Ye and asked.</p>
  <p>“Mmm!”</p>
  <p>“Do you have any other things?” Qing Shui asked Qinghan Ye softly, seeing that she was looking at him in a daze.</p>
  <p>A warmth filled up Qinghan Ye’s heart. It was the first time Qing Shui had used such an expression and tone with her. She felt very happy, and her mind was filled with images of Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Can I go to look for you in the future?” Qinghan Yue bit her lower lips sexily and asked.</p>
  <p>“Of course you can. Feel free to come look for me anytime. I will not leave the blacksmith store for most of the time.” Qing Shui chuckled and said.</p>
  <p>“I’m heading off. You be careful of the Immortal Sword Sect.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at Qinghan Ye’s back view. That charm when she was taking a slow walk was beautiful as ever. Only after that beautiful figure had disappeared in the crowd did he turn to leave.</p>
  <p>The Bluebronze Sword was initially prepared for Huoyun Liu-Li, but before it had gotten to her, he had given it away to Qinghan Ye. Heading towards the blacksmith store, Qing Shui was prepared to smith a few more weapons. He hoped to achieve the additional attributes he was looking for as soon as possible..</p>
  <p>When he got back to the blacksmith store, he noticed that Hu You was around. Qing Shui knew that there was a small courtyard behind that door. Hu You smiled when he saw that Qing Shui was back.</p>
  <p>“Have you eaten?”</p>
  <p>“I just had food. How’s the practice?” Qing Shui chuckled as he looked at Hu You putting away the dishes. Men would tend to make their own food when dining alone. He tended to do the same most of the time.</p>
  <p>Mmmm, it’s still okay. There’s just a few areas I can’t get right.” Hu You gave it some thought before he answered seriously.</p>
  <p>“Mmm, I’ll take a look for you later. So long as you your cultivated Qi, you’ll be able to master forging techniques along side with circulating your Qi. By then, it would not be so boring.” Qing Shui smiled as he picked up the hammer.</p>
  <p>“I don’t mind it being boring, so long as I get to practice it!”</p>
  <p>Picking up a piece of forging material, he started hammering. However, he had to control his strength, as if it was an actual forging where the technique was very important!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui hammered one after another. He kept a seemingly slow yet firm, simple and unsophisticated speed. At the same time, it felt very profound.</p>
  <p>“Go, let’s head to the backyard. I’ll help you take a look at the areas to look out for.” After a while, Qing Shui said as he looked towards Hu You who had finished cleaning up.</p>
  <p>The two of them came to the backyard. It was the first time Qing Shui had came here. The small courtyard had a length and breadth of about seven to eight meters. It was really small and had almost nothing in it. It was very bright, but was a pity that it was really too small.</p>
  <p>Hu You slowly displayed the Tiger Form stances, which could trigger the Tiger’s Qi Movement. (Tiger Qi’s movement was actually the Tiger’s Roar). Beginner learners, especially for those who has no prior cultivation, they would usually use the Tiger Form stances to ignite the Tiger Qi’s movement.</p>

 <p>Qing Shui felt the changes to his body as he walked, realizing that his level of cultivation had a lot of progress from just practicing a Duo Cultivation Technique of the soul. The drop in his Dan Tian had grown from the size of a grape to the size of a walnut. The powers emitting from the swirl made his heart throb.</p>
 <p>Qinghan Ye would throw an occasional glance towards Qing Shui, but once he turned to look at her, she would quickly turn away. Even her exquisite earlobes had turned into a cute pink color.</p>
 <p>“Southern Guest Inn” appeared before Qing Shui and Qinghan Ye. A wonderful “dream” experience turned Qinghan Ye into an ostrich, and was led in by Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>This was Qing Shui’s first visit to this restaurant. He did not have the habit of visiting restaurants. He felt that it was not comparable to Earthly Paradise, but there was still a lot of traffic. There were five storeys, each level was bustling with activity.</p>
 <p>When a person gained power, there would generally be two possible situations. The first one would be to make a ruckus in the streets, and to get everything he wanted through brute force. The second one would be to stay in seclusion, and these people would tend to bring their cultivation to a peak. For the latter, the most important was a heart which no longer craved after fame and reputation.</p>
 <p>“Sir, miss, this way please!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Qinghan Ye were led upstairs by a young waitress. Qing Shui had requested for a seat on the highest level, preferably one which would allow them to have a view of the streets and be next to the windows.</p>
 <p>They casually ordered a few dishes, one of which was Steamed Bear’s Palm, an absolute delicacy in Qing Shui’s previous life. However, bear’s palm was no different from the pig’s trotters from his previous life. Normal bears were even reduced to being a home pet.</p>
 <p>It may be because a seat on the fifth storey was more expensive. There were not as many people as compared to the lower storeys. Therefore, there were still quite a number of window seats that would allow them to look at the human traffic and other buildings in the street.</p>
 <p>Qinghan Ye kept her sexy lips tightly closed, occasionally sizing up Qing Shui. There were even times when she would fall into a daze as she looked at him. When she was caught red-handed by Qing Shui, she would turn her gaze in panic. Her charming face would turn into the color of a sunset from embarrassment.</p>
 <p>“You like to look at me secretly?” When the two of them were left, Qing Shui chuckled and asked when he saw Qinghan Ye secretly glancing at him again.</p>
 <p>To Qing Shui, Qinghan Ye was a charming lady with a mature disposition. He had never thought that she would have such a weak side to her, making her appear a bit cute and shy.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew she was embarrassed. It may be because she had gone through a mental change after their “physical relationship”. It was not just a sexual experience, but a collision of the body and soul, an exchange of the soul. There may not be a pair amongst thousands or ten thousand people.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, are you a Extreme Yang Body?” Qinghan Ye did not reply to Qing Shui’s words but looked at him and asked.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not expect Qinghan Ye to ask such a question. He did not know if he was a Extreme Yang Body, but one thing for sure was that his Yang Qi was especially strong. It would be able to take Qinghan Ye’s Extreme Yin Body</p>
 <p>“I don’t know, since there’s no clear concept for a Extreme Yang Body.” Qing Shui looked at the embarrassed Qinghan Ye who was trying to put up a front as he replied.</p>
 <p>“Then in real life, would you… be able to do that?” Qinghan Ye turned her gaze out of the windows, but the side of her face was already covered in a layer of red blush.</p>
 <p>“Do what?” Qing Shui asked, puzzled. He was actually secretly smiling in his heart. How could he answer to himself if he did not make good use of the chance to tease her properly?</p>
 <p>“Didn’t you say that if a guy is a Extreme Yang Body, one should see if he could… do it for a very long time with women? Just like… just like how it was in our “dream”… If you are able to do it for so long in real life… would you be considered to have a Extreme Yang Body?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Qinghan Ye mumbling as she said these words. Towards the back, he would not be able to catch it if it was not for his good hearing. Hearing a beautiful lady saying such words really made his blood boil, especially when he was looking at her delicious, charming expression. Qing Shui knew that if he had a Extreme Yang Body, it was very likely that she would ask him to remove her Nine Yin Qi, even if it was just to let the old man feel relieved.</p>
 <p>“You foolish girl, even one with a Extreme Yang Body would not go through all that. Although I have not tried it before, I do know that I’ll have no problem going through it for three days and nights.” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p>Hearing Qing Shui’s intimate and undisguised words, Qinghan Ye felt a bit panicky, turning her gaze all around. Her expression was so cute as if she was a lady who had just set foot in the area of love. It added onto that charming and intoxicating appearance. Qing Shui felt that she seemed even more delicious than the delicacies laid out on the table. Qing Shui did not know that she was in fact a lady who had never fell in love before.</p>
 <p>“Alright, let’s eat. We have plenty of time in the future.” Qing Shui passed Qinghan Ye a pair of silver chopsticks and chuckled.</p>
 <p>Receiving the chopsticks Qing Shui handed over, her watery eyes glanced towards at Qing Shui before starting to eat small bites slowly. However, her thoughts had long wandered off.</p>
 <p>Actually, Qing Shui did not know if he had a Extreme Yang Body, but now that he had brought his Ancient Strengthening Technique to the 4th heavenly layer, it would probably go beyond the effects of the Extreme Yang Body.</p>
 <p>The meal was very gloomy. Qinghan Ye did not really lift her head all the time, but Qing Shui felt torn. It was a blessing from heavens to meet a person who could go through a spiritual Duo Cultivation with you amongst thousands or ten thousands of people. Qing Shui soon discovered that he had already came across a few ladies around him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought of having beauties surrounding him, but it was merely a thought. Other than Shi Qingzhuang who had already become his fiancee, Mingyue Gelou who was definitely his, and Zhu Qing who was an accident, there was still Wenren Wushuang. Qing Shui realized that his relationships were in a mess.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that he did not have the ability to go around a few ladies, just like how he had met Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li. Even relationship with such friends who had no confirmed relationships with him were already like this. He did not know if he was feeling guilty or if they had entered his heart…</p>
 <p>Thinking of this, Qing Shui rubbed his nose. He was not in that kind of relationship with them. It was his own freedom to be with whichever lady he wished to be with. Having thought of this, Qing Shui felt a little less burdened.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go!”</p>
 <p>More than half the food on the table was finished. Qing Shui’s appetite was especially good. Not only was his powers brought to greater heights, that ecstasy from the “dream” earlier left in a very good mood.</p>
 <p>“I’m heading back to the blacksmith store. Are you heading back to the Thousand Year Medicinal Store?” After leaving Southern Guest Inn, Qing Shui looked towards Qinghan Ye and asked.</p>
 <p>“Mmm!”</p>
 <p>“Do you have any other things?” Qing Shui asked Qinghan Ye softly, seeing that she was looking at him in a daze.</p>
 <p>A warmth filled up Qinghan Ye’s heart. It was the first time Qing Shui had used such an expression and tone with her. She felt very happy, and her mind was filled with images of Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Can I go to look for you in the future?” Qinghan Yue bit her lower lips sexily and asked.</p>
 <p>“Of course you can. Feel free to come look for me anytime. I will not leave the blacksmith store for most of the time.” Qing Shui chuckled and said.</p>
 <p>“I’m heading off. You be careful of the Immortal Sword Sect.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Qinghan Ye’s back view. That charm when she was taking a slow walk was beautiful as ever. Only after that beautiful figure had disappeared in the crowd did he turn to leave.</p>
 <p>The Bluebronze Sword was initially prepared for Huoyun Liu-Li, but before it had gotten to her, he had given it away to Qinghan Ye. Heading towards the blacksmith store, Qing Shui was prepared to smith a few more weapons. He hoped to achieve the additional attributes he was looking for as soon as possible..</p>
 <p>When he got back to the blacksmith store, he noticed that Hu You was around. Qing Shui knew that there was a small courtyard behind that door. Hu You smiled when he saw that Qing Shui was back.</p>
 <p>“Have you eaten?”</p>
 <p>“I just had food. How’s the practice?” Qing Shui chuckled as he looked at Hu You putting away the dishes. Men would tend to make their own food when dining alone. He tended to do the same most of the time.</p>
 <p>Mmmm, it’s still okay. There’s just a few areas I can’t get right.” Hu You gave it some thought before he answered seriously.</p>
 <p>“Mmm, I’ll take a look for you later. So long as you your cultivated Qi, you’ll be able to master forging techniques along side with circulating your Qi. By then, it would not be so boring.” Qing Shui smiled as he picked up the hammer.</p>
 <p>“I don’t mind it being boring, so long as I get to practice it!”</p>
 <p>Picking up a piece of forging material, he started hammering. However, he had to control his strength, as if it was an actual forging where the technique was very important!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hammered one after another. He kept a seemingly slow yet firm, simple and unsophisticated speed. At the same time, it felt very profound.</p>
 <p>“Go, let’s head to the backyard. I’ll help you take a look at the areas to look out for.” After a while, Qing Shui said as he looked towards Hu You who had finished cleaning up.</p>
 <p>The two of them came to the backyard. It was the first time Qing Shui had came here. The small courtyard had a length and breadth of about seven to eight meters. It was really small and had almost nothing in it. It was very bright, but was a pity that it was really too small.</p>
 <p>Hu You slowly displayed the Tiger Form stances, which could trigger the Tiger’s Qi Movement. (Tiger Qi’s movement was actually the Tiger’s Roar). Beginner learners, especially for those who has no prior cultivation, they would usually use the Tiger Form stances to ignite the Tiger Qi’s movement.</p>
