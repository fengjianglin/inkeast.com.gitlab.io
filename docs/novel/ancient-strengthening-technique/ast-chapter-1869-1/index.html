 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s figure appeared in front of Jin Dao as he grabbed both of his golden swords. At this moment, both of his slender arms were as if they were choking Jin Dao’s neck, causing him to be very shocked and not knowing what to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have said before that I won’t kill you.” Qing Shui showed a light smile as he let go of Jin Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Dao blankly stared at Qing Shui. He found it hard to accept the events that had just happened. To think that a man much younger than him could actually manage to catch his golden sword without much effort. If he had wanted to, he could have very easily killed him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are very powerful. I really have no idea who exactly is capable of nurturing someone like you. Could it be someone from Immortal Palace?” By now, Jin Dao had already changed his tone of speaking. It no longer sounded as arrogant as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was afraid of putting his sects and clans at risk of being annihilated. Hence, he was being very alert and cautious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Immortal Palace? What’s that?” Qing Shui asked confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Dao was surprised by Qing Shui’s question. Nevertheless, he still spoke carefully, “I am not sure myself. But according to what my family members had said, they are a powerful Immortal Sect. Or rather, it is because they are existences which surpassed even the Immortal Sects that they are called the Immortal Palace. I have only heard about Taiyi Immortal Palace and the Great Sun Immortal Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stopped asking any further. It was easy to figure out. The Immortal Palace was basically an existence which surpassed that of Immortal Sects. However, Qing Shui had yet to get any chances to interact with them. He didn’t know whether it was due to him not being strong enough, or it was just simply because he hadn’t gotten to meet them. &nbsp;For example, it might be because of the area that he was in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Leave now. I will only allow it just this once. The next time we point our weapons toward each other again, I will no longer let you off that easily.” Qing Shui firmly said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you for holding back.” Jin Dao seemed like he wanted to say more when he finished speaking but after muttering, he turned back and left. He didn’t even try to look at at the woman even once. He knew that he mustn’t do so and must immediately give up any intentions he had on obtaining her. If he hadn’t done so and ended up enraging the expert warriors, he would suffer a very terrible fate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui watched as Jin Dao’s figure disappeared. Though this man was a bit unlikeable, he was perspective enough to know what he should do.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he turned around and saw the girls still standing near him, Qing Shui looked at Qing Hanye and questioned, “I really don’t understand. Why didn’t you just beat him when he came here before?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I like seeing you fight.” Qing Hanye revealed a smirk as she looked at Qing Shui. She looked very charming and attractive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Qing Shui was no longer a virgin, he still found it a bit hard to understand women. Actually, who would dare to actually say that they knew women well? At times, even women themselves might not know exactly what they were thinking. How could men possibly understand the creatures known as women?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“By the way, I wasn’t worried about you at all before this.” Deep within Qing Shui’s eyes hid a very faint flirtatious smiling intention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye naturally knew what Qing Shui meant. She possessed the Nine Yin Body. In this world, only Qing Shui was suited to be with her. Maybe their destiny was long arranged by gods. As soon as they met, they had already felt a strong attraction toward each other. Back then, Qing Shui had tried to avoid her but it felt as if everything was destined to happen. They still managed to run into each other in the Northern Ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gang quickly left the scene. Qing Shui had never expected that he would be engaged in battles as soon as he came back. There might be people who intended to snatch away his women from him, though their levels were still not enough to do that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Throughout the time when he left, many things had happened. The most major one was the one concerning the Great Confucian Empire, the Golden Sacred Palace currently in front of him, and also the news about Taiyi Immortal Palace and Great Sun Immortal Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything had already begun to show itself on the surface of the water. This was the Northern Ocean, the center region of Haohan Continent. Located within the deepest part of the Northern Ocean, the Nine Continents Star Ocean Domain and deep within Haohan Continents, exactly what kind of existences were there in these respective areas?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though with that said, Qing Shui wasn’t really curious to find out more about them. The sole reason he was worried was Tantai Lingyan’s affiliation with Five Tigers Immortal Sect. All along, the Five Tigers Immortal Sect had never shown itself. What level of strength did it possess exactly? Would he stand a chance against them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if the Five Tigers Immortal Sect was truly powerful, the vast Haohan Continent was simply too big. Looking for an immortal sect might prove even harder than looking for a needle within the vast ocean. If they were an existence which Qing Shui still couldn’t reach even at his current level, this might just prove that they were even more mysterious than assumed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Dao’s appearance didn’t really cause an effect on everyone’s mood. Time passed very quickly when they were together. After having dinner, Qing Shui returned to his courtyard along with Yiye Jiange and Qing Xiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Strictly speaking, the other women had yet to be his women. Even Tantai Lingyan was not considered to be one. Though they might have accidentally engaged in intimate interactions with each other a long time ago, Qing Shui still felt that she was the most difficult one to deal with.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The little brat was already sound asleep in Qing Shui’s arm while Yiye Jiange was by his side. Today was a day without moonlight. The surroundings were illuminated by only night bright pearls. It felt very unreal as faint silvery light could be seen spreading across the entire area.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sacred woman looked even more untainted, not even by a speck of dust under this bright light. She looked illusory. Qing Shui, for a moment, got a bit distracted just by looking at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange was a bit panicked from being stared at by him which caused her to blush. In any case, Qing Shui was still at least six months younger than herself. She couldn’t help but shouted out, “You have seen me for so many years! Haven’t you had enough by now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You look too charming. I can never get enough just from looking at you.” Qing Shui answered with a light chuckle. He then lowered his head and kissed her forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tell me. One day, when I am older, will you still like me like how you do now? By then, my skin would have gone saggy and I would have grown a few wrinkles.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t know what was going on with Yiye Jiange today. It was unusual for her to get so emotional all of a sudden. He then regained his composure and replied, “By then, I would have also been an old man. Besides, you will still look just as charming even when you are old. The time, as well as your base, would make you no longer care about your appearance. By then, you might even end up more beautiful than now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t know what else to say. He didn’t know if Yiye Jiange could understand what he meant. He was telling the truth. At the very least, he really did think that Yiye Jiange would never look bad, even when she became older. Also, Qing Shui knew that they wouldn’t reach the same point as the elderlies from his previous incarnation as they grew older. This world was filled with Spiritual Qi. Added on their cultivations and body physiques, though they were unable to achieve the feat of looking young for eternity, it could already be considered as something quite close to that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they entered the bedroom, Yiye Jiange gently put down Qing Xiu onto his bed while Qing Shui hugged her from behind. Yiye Jiange slightly leaned backward and settled herself inside Qing Shui’s arm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have missed you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was what Yiye Jiange said. Upon hearing her words, Qing Shui immediately carried her up and walked toward the sofa bed in the living room. It was his first time ever hearing Yiye Jiange said that.&nbsp;</span></p>

He softly opened up her mouth and gradually started sucking her saliva in her mouth. Yiye Jiange slowly responded back to Qing Shui. She had both her arms around Qing Shui’s neck.</span></p>
