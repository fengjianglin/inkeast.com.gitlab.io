 <p><strong>AST 906 - Eve, Jade Spirit Fruit ripened</strong></p>
 <p>By the time Qing Shui and Mu Qing had left the great hall, it was late in the morning. Dong Yan and Sun Yan had already disappeared somewhere long ago as they didn’t wish to interrupt Qing Shui and Mu Qing.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, they didn’t know that Qing Shui’s relationship with Mu Qing hadn’t reached that point yet. They could only be considered good friends.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I suddenly feel that you are growing more and more unfamiliar,” as Mu Qing walked, she looked at Qing Shui and smiled. Her bright eyes gave off a bewitching air.</p>
 <p>“How could that be? I am still the same person and forever will be,” Qing Shui replied with a smile and looked at Mu Qing.</p>
 <p>When she saw Qing Shui’s smile, Mu Qing felt a little flustered, especially when she thought of what happened on that day. At that moment, she felt extremely flustered. She wasn’t sure about her feelings towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Originally, she was already very curious about Qing Shui. However, he now seemed like an unsolvable puzzle. This made her urge to try and understand him grow stronger.</p>
 <p>“Let me teach you about formations,” Qing Shui said after thinking for awhile. He felt that it was time to tell her a little about for formations and for her to come into contact with them. This was because she was capable of learning formations now.</p>
 <p>Mu Qing stared blankly for a while before she smiled, “Fine, I am actually getting more and more curious about formations.”</p>
 <p>Mu Qing actually had her own reasons for saying this. After she saw the might of formations, she actually stopped asking Qing Shui to teach her. In the past, she wanted to learn formations from Qing Shui to deal with the Sky Prison Sect. She had assumed that Qing Shui’s formation skills were very superficial and weren’t important to him.</p>
 <p>She didn’t expect that Qing Shui’s formation skills would be much more formidable than the Sky Prison Sect’s. Thus, she felt that she was too rude in the past. However, since he now took the initiative to teach her formations she actually felt very happy. It wasn’t because she could learn more about formations, but it was because Qing Shui was willing to teach her.</p>
 <p>Even an intelligent woman would have a simple side to them. Qing Shui had never expected this. Seeing that Mu Qing was happy, they headed towards her manor.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, do you think that the people of the Sky Prison Sect will come soon?” Mu Qing asked as she walked. She was very calm when she asked this. Her calmness should be due to a change in her mentality</p>
 <p>“They should be coming soon. If it was someone else, they would definitely try to rush over as soon as possible,” Qing Shui said after he thought for awhile.</p>
 <p>Mu Qing felt a little worried. When the two of them walked into the manor, Qing Shui stopped and called out to Mu Qing, “It is still early, we will do it here.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui first got Mu Qing to draw a simple Nine Palace Eight Trigrams. Then he got her to draw the Duality Minutest Formation’s position and its supporting position in sequence.</p>
 <p>Mu Qing had built up a solid foundation during these days. She was quite fast and persistent. She would continually correct her own mistakes and identify the key points.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that Mu Qing had a treasure but he didn’t know what it was. However, he estimated that it was even more precious than the Spirit Concentrating Pill. He felt that her treasure could even be used together with the Spirit Concentrating Pill.</p>
 <p>Almost everyone who could reach such a level at such an age had treasures on them. Even if they didn’t own treasures, their items wouldn’t be too bad either.</p>
 <p>Although formations looked simple on the surface, its internal workings were full of variables.This kind of thing required a long time to research. Qing Shui had only grasped a single path in the art of formations. It would require a shocking amount of time to completely research formations. This was similar to the principle that it was possible to understand and apply some principles but not know where it came from.</p>
 <p>Without realizing it, it was already noon. A lot of people from the Dong Clan came. This time, they planned to stand together with the Mu Clan and resist the Sky Prison Sect.</p>
 <p>The one leading the Dong Clan was Dong Yan’s grandfather. Qing Shui knew about the abilities of this old man. He was at the level of 80 stars. It seems that the Dong Clan was somewhat inferior to the Mu Clan. Despite this, Qing Shui felt happy.</p>
 <p>With such level of abilities, it would be difficult for them make such a decision. It wasn’t important if they took action because Dong Yan rallied them or they volunteered. The most important person was Dong Yan. It was enough just having him.</p>
 <p>Even though the Dong Clan came, they wouldn’t be of much help in this case. However, there was strength in numbers. At the very least, having more people would strengthen their courage and the atmosphere wouldn’t be as worrying as it was before.</p>
 <p>In the afternoon, Qing Shui still continued to practice formations with Mu Qing. When he had spare time, Qing Shui started to use those small formation flags to lay down formations in the Mu Clan’s yard. He had basically surrounded the entire Mu Clan with formations. Additionally, he accumulated many flags in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used the Duality Minutest Formation to intersect the interior and the exterior of the Mu Clan. He had also taken out the Five Elements Minor Formation for the few old men to research. During this period of time, Dong Yan and Sun Yan had learned a lot. They were able to assemble and coordinate the formation.</p>
 <p>The individuals who accompanied Mu Qing when she headed into the Sky Penetrating Mountains were now at a crucial moment with their practice of the Five Elements Minor Formation. The formation master of the Five Elements Minor Formation had cooperated with the 20 old men that had been together for many years and had a tacit understanding of each other. Thus, they were able to easily reach their current achievements. At the same time, they practiced walking around in the Duality Minutest Formation. Qing Shui had them practice this as a precaution.</p>
 <p>Time slowly went by. Qing Shui noticed that the Duality Minutest Formation had already been laid everywhere. He also saw the key figures of the Mu Clan learning how to cooperate while using the Duality Steps and the Five Elements Minor Formation.</p>
 <p>If everyone was able to cooperate together when the time came, their might would be increased very significantly.</p>
 <p>To connect these people together, every group of them would have two to three experts in charge. Furthermore, when everyone was together, they would be able to look after each other. Since they found out about Qing Shui’s strength, the people who were learning the formation put in their best efforts.</p>
 <p>Even those people who had tried to bully Qing Shui forgot about their motives. Back then, they thought that Qing Shui was an idiot. Thus, they had hoped that Young Master Yin would kill him.</p>
 <p>However, now they knew that Qing Shui was a heaven defying genius. Within the whole World of the Nine Continents, there were only a few of these demon-level characters. If they knew about his talent earlier, they wouldn’t have to blindly mull over this. In retrospect, it was silly of them to plot against Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>When humans were desperate, their potential would become limitless. The Mu Clan’s current situation could be considered extremely dangerous. If they weren’t careful, their roots might get torn out.</p>
 <p>No one would want their clan to fall. At this time, the Mu Clan was very easily unified. Thus, their speed of improvement was much faster than before by many folds.</p>
 <p>Mu Qing was no exception. Originally, her talent was pretty great. Now, with a good foundation and her efforts, she was the one who learned the fastest.</p>
 <p>The sky slowly turned dark but the people from the Sky Prison Sect hadn’t appeared yet. This was normal. Old Wu and his group probably hadn’t even reached the Sky Prison Sect yet.</p>
 <p>Thus, it was more likely that they would arrive two days later. They could still enjoy two more days of peace.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>In a splendorous and majestic mansion within the country’s capital, there was a youth whose hand was wrapped in bandages. There was also a really sturdy man in his prime, he was about two meters tall.</p>
 <p>“Stop thinking of revenge, regardless of whether the Mu Clan can survive this ordeal, stop thinking about revenge,” the man sighed and said to the youth on the bed.</p>
 <p>“I hope that the Sky Prison Sect will obliterate them all, especially that fellow……”</p>
 <p>The man sighed and left the room. Originally, he had wanted to go to the Mu Clan and argue with them because of his son’s injuries. After all, his son was crippled, how could he take it lying down as his father? He had even planned on making a big scene at the Mu Clan.</p>
 <p>However, his influence was no longer needed. If the Mu Clan was destroyed by the Sky Prison Sect, they naturally didn’t have to do anything. At best, they would just cause some trouble while they were down. On the other hand, if the Mu Clan succeeded, then there would be no need to send themselves to die.</p>
 <p>However, seeing his son in this state, he felt very upset as his father. The Yin Clan was a privileged clan around these parts but they were now forced to just tolerate this.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>It was night when Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and headed towards the Jade Spirit Fruit Tree. It was about time for it to ripen.</p>
 <p>It was ripe!</p>
 <p>The fragrance of the snow white Jade Spirit fruit was filled with spirituality that could be smelt from afar. There was a total of 100 fruits. Qing Shui still wasn’t very sure about the effects of the Jade Spirit Fruit.</p>
 <p>He then picked all of the Jade Spirit Fruit. After hesitating for a while, Qing Shui chose one and ate it. It was very fragrant and slightly sweet. The most important part was that it had a refreshing taste.</p>
 <p>After he ate it, his whole body felt cleansed and it felt very good. However, after awhile, Qing Shui realized that there were no effects. His abilities hadn’t changed. However, he could sense that his marrows had transformed slightly.</p>
 <p>Transformation of marrows?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t give up and ate another one. This time, Qing Shui was stunned. He gained half a star of abilities. The transformation of one’s marrows could actually increase one’s abilities?</p>
 <p>Thinking of the Snow Lion King that protected the Jade Spirit Fruit, Qing Shui summoned his demonic beasts. He wanted to see what effects this Jade Spirit Fruit had on them.</p>
 <p>Every demonic beast ate two of the fruits.</p>
 <p>After that, he quietly waited and watched the surrounding demonic beasts. At this point of time, he only knew that the Jade Spirit Fruit could improve the marrows.</p>
 <p>After they ate it, Qing Shui was taken aback. There were some changes but they were all minute. The Gold-Silver Colored Butterfly and the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable’s abilities seemed to increase significantly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui still hadn’t given up and fed each of his demonic beast five Jade Spirit Fruit. If there still weren’t any obvious effects, then Qing Shui was prepared to eat all of the fruits himself. At least, his abilities would have some increase.</p>
 <p>This time, there were some obvious effects. There was an obvious change in their marrows. The level of abilities gained was also very visible and their abilities were increased by nearly 10%.</p>
 <p>The Five-Headed Demonic Spider had the abilities of 400 stars. This time, its abilities actually increased by 40 stars...</p>
 <p>This Jade Spirit Fruit was actually able to increase the abilities of a Martial Emperor by this much? There didn’t seem to be any cultivation limit. It was a pity that it only increased the consumer’s abilities by 10%. However, why was the Snow Lion King defending it to the bitter end if it was just so simple?</p>
 <p>It definitely shouldn’t be just for this 10% increase in abilities. This 10% increase was definitely just a supplementary effect.</p>
 <p>After the Five-Headed Demonic Spider quietened down, it didn’t experience any more changes. The Gold-Silver Colored Butterfly and the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable also gained a 10% increase in abilities before stopping. Finally, Qing Shui cast his gaze on the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and the Fire Bird.</p>
