  <p><strong>AST 0159 – The Sinister Move, Tiger Tailwhip Kick</strong></p>
  <p>Wenren Wu-Shuang felt uncomfortable, or even fearful, as she looked into his devilishly lewd stare.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui held onto Wu-Shuang’s hand lightly and said, “Wu-Shuang, go wait on the carriage. I’ll chase off this perverted guy in a moment.”</p>
  <p>“Young lad, I don’t wish to kill you. I only wish to eat the delicious food you made. As long as you promise to make me the delicious food I smelled earlier and let this woman be with me for a few days, I’ll let the two of you off.” The intrepid man said this as if he was being charitable. He was making a natural expression.</p>
  <p>“Damn! To heck with you! Who do you think you are?” Qing Shui was infuriated, and even more so than when he had heard the hidden motives of the two coachmen.</p>
  <p>It was mainly due to the man’s tone, arrogance, and egoistic nature. He acted as if he was the most formidable and impressive person. He also acted as if he was a righteous man when in reality he was just a mere lewd lecher. There was a saying that goes “a pretentious prick was even more shameful that a courtesan”. His behavior was worse than a courtesan’s who were at least open with what they do.</p>
  <p>After hearing Qing Shui’s words, the man was in a daze. It wasn’t that there was no one who had cursed him before, but that they were all dead. This young lad in front of him didn’t know any better and was scolding him. Did he think that he would not kill him?</p>
  <p>“Lad, there’s still time for you to regret your decision. If not, I’ll put you through so much misery that you’d wish you were dead! I will also let you see with your own eyes how I play with your woman by using all sorts of techniques that would guarantee to be an eye opener.” The man’s large face that displayed his lewd and vicious intentions caused others to feel deterred.</p>
  <p>Wu-Shuang blushed in anger as she looked at the man. Other than fighting, there’s no other way to deal with such uncouths!</p>
  <p>“There’s still time for you to scram.” Qing Shui said in a soft voice, feeling disdain. How could a boorish man like you compare to the techniques that I know? In my previous life, I had gone through all the films from that island country. (Japanese AV)</p>
  <p>The man stared with furious eyes that looked like a pair of copper bells. His fist cracked and soon, a layer of golden light encompassed his hands.</p>
  <p>As expected, his strength was in his two hands. Qing Shui had guessed as much when he first saw his hands. The Qi of Xiantian was concealed within the golden light.</p>
  <p>“Lad, I will not let you die immediately. Instead, I will make you pay that price for your arrogance today. Like I said, I will take your woman in front of you. This is the first time I’ve come across such a beautiful woman. Look at that skin, it’ll definitely feel good to the touch…”</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, kill him for me.” Wu-Shuang blushed in anger as she looked towards the man.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was already walking towards the man. When Wu-Shuang said her piece, Qing Shui immediately increased his speed to the maximum level while concurrently crossing his hands in a tearing motion as he pounced towards the man’s chest.</p>
  <p>The man was obviously stunned by seeing Qing Shui’s speed. A ray of light bursted out from his huge, copper-bell eyes. Qing Shui’s laceration technique seemed sharp and was accompanied by a low Tiger’s Roar, causing him to feel restless and uneasy.</p>
  <p>Only in that moment did the man view Qing Shui as his opponent. He had only thought of Qing Shui as a young master from a wealthy family with his concubine when he first saw his delicate appearance. Now, he knew he was wrong.</p>
  <p>His two hands, shrouded in a golden light, came into contact with Qing Shui’s at great speed!</p>
  <p>Bang bang!!!</p>
  <p>A few deep sounds echoed, as if two big mountains had collided. Dust flew about. From the Tiger Roars of Qing Shui’s attack, the situation seemed to be in a state of chaos and darkness.</p>
  <p>Who would have thought that Qing Shui would be sent flying with a trail of blood flowing from the corner of his lips. However, he managed to land on his feet.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, the man was forced three steps back before he stabilized himself and looked at Qing Shui in shock.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was feeling even more astonished as it was the first time he had been injured since he had broke through the 4th layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, how do you feel?” Wu-Shuang frantically ran towards Qing Shui when she saw the blood at the corner of his mouth. She knew that Qing Shui was very strong and did not expect him to lose in one move.</p>
  <p>“I’m fine. This person’s technique is really weird. He is able to exert two strong forces almost at the same time. Moreover, he has huge strength and I wasn’t being careful. Thank goodness that I noticed it earlier.” Qing Shui smiled at the frantic and worried Wu-Shuang.</p>
  <p>The intrepid man was even more shocked. He had relied on this “Second Wave” to defeat countless experts. To think that he was not able to kill his opponent today must mean that the boy had a tough physique. If the man had cultivated to the “Third Wave”, his opponent would probably suffer from heavy injuries even if he did not die.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at the pair of hands radiating with golden light. He felt that this man should be on the same level as his goddess-like master. It seemed like it was going to be a tough fight.</p>
  <p>Utilizing the Free Spirit Steps, Qing Shui displayed the speed he was so proud of. He only needed to be faster than his opponent. Qing Shui was also very excited to be able to use the Tiger Form against an opponent for the first time.</p>
  <p>The Tiger Form integrated with the Rapid Solitary Fist displayed its prowess quickly. Qing Shui exerted 80% of the prowess in each blow, being careful to not face the opponent’s blow head on. One time, their attacks were forced to clash, and Qing Shui was prepared to withstand the opponent’s Double Impact. After all, the opponent’s strength was much weaker than Qing Shui’s. Qing Shui felt that the opponent’s strength was about 200,000 jin while he had an immense strength of about 300,000 jin.</p>
  <p>In a battle between experts and especially in a fight to the death, one can gain plenty of experience quickly. QIng Shui could feel the obvious fluidity from utilizing the Tiger Form compared to when he practiced alone.</p>
  <p>Gradually, Qing Shui realised that every time his opponent used the Double Impact Technique, his hands would be covered in a strong golden light! With this, Qing Shui was able to prepare to fend off the attack.</p>
  <p>When he saw the golden light in his opponent’s palms once again, he knew that it was the only time when his opponent’s attack would clash with his!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui, who had long since raised his aura to its pinnacle, used the Tiger Descend to exert an overwhelming aura. With this aura, Qing Shui exerted his strength from his whole body, causing an explosion that was accompanied by a loud trembling tiger roar cutting across the sky.</p>
  <p>This time around, Qing Shui was sent flying backwards again, but the intrepid man was also puking large amounts of blood. That was because at the moment when they collided, Qing Shui had used the most sinister and vicious move of the Tiger Form.</p>
  <p>Tiger Tailwhip Kick!</p>
  <p>It was a kick as fast as lightning. With an overwhelming strength, he directly landed on the man’s chest before he could defend against it!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui struggled to stand up with his tough body. “Damn it, this strength is too dubious. Each time before the impact of the first blow is gone, another one just as strong is dealt after. One cannot even defend against it and the only way is to avoid direct collision.”</p>
  <p>Thank goodness he had cultivated the Tiger Tailwhip Kick. While it was sneaky, it was practical.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, Qing Shui…” Wenren Wu-Shuang looked at Qing Shui who was puking blood and cried out. She was trembling as tears uncontrollably flowed down her cheeks.</p>
  <p>“Don’t cry, lass. It’s the second time you’re crying. Be good, give me a smile!” Qing Shui wiped off the tears off Wu-Shuang.</p>
  <p>The Ancient Strengthening Technique automatically circulated in his body. The image of Yin-Yang in his consciousness gradually repaired Qing Shui’s damaged organs, muscles, and bones.</p>
  <p>Hearing Qing Shui’s words, Wu-Shuang looked worriedly at Qing Shui’s concerned and pale face as he looked at her. She felt very warm, and also very blessed to have such an outstanding guy who liked her.</p>
  <p>She reached out her tender white hands and wiped off the blood traces at the corners of Qing Shui’s lips. Qing Shui fidgeted and wanted to move away, but was held around the neck by Wu-Shuang’s other hand.</p>
  <p><span style>“There’s still time for you to scram.” Qing Shui said in a soft voice, feeling disdain.</span></p>

 <p>Qing Shui, who had long since raised his aura to its pinnacle, used the Tiger Descend to exert an overwhelming aura. With this aura, Qing Shui exerted his strength from his whole body, causing an explosion that was accompanied by a loud trembling tiger roar cutting across the sky.</p>
 <p>This time around, Qing Shui was sent flying backwards again, but the intrepid man was also puking large amounts of blood. That was because at the moment when they collided, Qing Shui had used the most sinister and vicious move of the Tiger Form.</p>
 <p>Tiger Tailwhip Kick!</p>
 <p>It was a kick as fast as lightning. With an overwhelming strength, he directly landed on the man’s chest before he could defend against it!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui struggled to stand up with his tough body. “Damn it, this strength is too dubious. Each time before the impact of the first blow is gone, another one just as strong is dealt after. One cannot even defend against it and the only way is to avoid direct collision.”</p>
 <p>Thank goodness he had cultivated the Tiger Tailwhip Kick. While it was sneaky, it was practical.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, Qing Shui…” Wenren Wu-Shuang looked at Qing Shui who was puking blood and cried out. She was trembling as tears uncontrollably flowed down her cheeks.</p>
 <p>“Don’t cry, lass. It’s the second time you’re crying. Be good, give me a smile!” Qing Shui wiped off the tears off Wu-Shuang.</p>
 <p>The Ancient Strengthening Technique automatically circulated in his body. The image of Yin-Yang in his consciousness gradually repaired Qing Shui’s damaged organs, muscles, and bones.</p>
 <p>Hearing Qing Shui’s words, Wu-Shuang looked worriedly at Qing Shui’s concerned and pale face as he looked at her. She felt very warm, and also very blessed to have such an outstanding guy who liked her.</p>
 <p>She reached out her tender white hands and wiped off the blood traces at the corners of Qing Shui’s lips. Qing Shui fidgeted and wanted to move away, but was held around the neck by Wu-Shuang’s other hand.</p>
 <p><span style>“There’s still time for you to scram.” Qing Shui said in a soft voice, feeling disdain.</span></p>
