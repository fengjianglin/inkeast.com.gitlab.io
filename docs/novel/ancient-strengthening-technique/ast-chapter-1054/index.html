 <p><strong>AST 1054 - Wen Jing’s Death，Annihilation，Qing Shui’s terrifying strength</strong></p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The ball of condensed grey cloud, that the python head spat out, hit the glowing aura of Qing Shui’s Divinity Protection. At the same time, Qing Shui hastily used his Nine Palace Steps to dodge the attack.</p>
 <p>As the saying goes, it is always good to have more skills. Qing Shui felt that if he didn’t have his Divinity Protection, he would have lost a layer of his skin. He only chose to use this tactic because he knew that he could deal with it in that way. Otherwise, he would have used his full power. He did not want to show the full extent of his power because he knew that there was yet another even more powerful expert in the Wen Clan; thus it would be to his disadvantage if his opponent knew how terrifying his true strength really was.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation increased all of his stats by one fold, so even if he was dealing with this Netherworld Formation, he knew that he should still be able to defeat it.</p>
 <p>Hisssss….</p>
 <p>The gigantic python head rushed toward Qing Shui once again. The sound of its hiss was so chilling that it could even make one’s scalp feel numb.</p>
 <p>Great Golden Buddha Palm!</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s Earth Diamond Bear Beast Soul let out an indistinct roar. This roar wasn’t loud but it was very deep; it was as if it could create a pressure on one’s heart. It shook the opponent’s spirits.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>His Great Golden Buddha Palm disintegrated one after the other, but the python head was also destroyed, even though it quickly regrew.</p>
 <p>Roar roar!</p>
 <p>The head of the Python Tailed Lion could also produce a deep-resonating roar. Each time it roared, its strength rose a bit, and the python head’s attacks became more and more powerful.</p>
 <p>It turned out that the formation was activated by the Beast Soul of their Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation. The strength of 5000 stars was used as a defence whereas the main attack was generated by spiritual energy.</p>
 <p>Primordial Dragon Dance!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui swung his Big Dipper Sword and the two Primordial Fire Snakes doubled in size. Their heads gradually changed into the shape of a Jiao. They intertwined and sped towards the gigantic python head in mid air.</p>
 <p>Primordial Flames: Double Dragon Drill!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui swung his Big Dipper Sword once again. Two Primordial Flame Dragons intertwined and spun toward the python head.</p>
 <p>Pu Pu! Roar! Hisss….</p>
 <p>Even though the noise was ear-piercing, the actually scene was not that violent. The clash between spirit energies was dangerous but it did not create much physical impact, instead it continuously created loud, thunderous noise. This was a sort of collision where the stronger party would swallow up the weaker party.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange tried to release her Seven-Headed Crystal Beast multiple times but Qing Shui stopped her. Even though the Seven-Headed Crystal Beast was strong, its poison resistance wasn’t as strong as Qing Shui. Anyway, it wasn’t the right time to release the Seven-Headed Crystal Beast.</p>
 <p>Buddha's True Eyes!</p>
 <p>Destroy that formation!</p>
 <p>The Golden Buddha appeared and Qing Shui’s strength shot up by another fold. Qing Shui’s two attack, Buddha's True Eyes and Primordial Flames: Double Dragon Drill landed directly on the Python Tailed Lion.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>The entire formation fell apart and the formation split as if there was a huge explosion in the middle. Wen Jing, the weakest among them, as well as other weaker members were killed immediately by the aftershocks of the spirit energy collision.</p>
 <p>Wen Jing probably never expected that he would die like this. He did not want to die yet, he was still thinking of those women. They were the most beautiful women he had ever seen, their charms would simply destroy multiple cities. Unfortunately, his life was too short to enjoy them.</p>
 <p>Roar roar!</p>
 <p>The Old Ancestors and some of the other Elders were not badly injured. The Python Tailed Lion took on most of the damage so the weaker members in the formation died, while the other were injured slightly. The five Elder that headed the formation had no visible injuries, they were now summoning their own demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>People who have reached their level would have at least one demonic beast. Furthermore, if their spirit energy is high, it would be easy for them to tame a demonic beast. Unfortunately, unlike a Beast Tamer, they will never have a demonic beast with a higher spirit energy than them.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, multiple demon beasts appeared. At the same time, Yiye Jiange called out her Seven-Headed Crystal Beast while Luan Luan called out her Six-Headed Windfire Wolf.</p>
 <p>Wuuuu…..</p>
 <p>The Golden Buddha image behind Qing Shui was starting to close its eyes. The Golden Buddha image that occasionally appear every now and then can now be summoned at will, this was the effect of Buddha's True Eyes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was not very clear but he knew that he could summon the Buddha image whenever he wanted. Once the Buddha image appeared, his spirit energy will increase by one fold. This was as useful as Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation and the pair of eyes on the Buddha image was indeed the Buddha's True Eyes.</p>
 <p>Due to the presence of the Buddha image, Qing Shui’s spirit energy attacks were now scarily powerful. With Qing Shui’s Arhat Rosary Beads and Big Dipper Sword, his spirit energy was now almost 30,000 stars, with the buffs from the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation and Buddha Form Reveal, his spirit energy already reached 100,000 stars.</p>
 <p>This was because Qing Shui’s spirit energy was no longer bound by the laws of this Earth, otherwise Qing Shui would only be able to use a miserable amount of spirit energy. Arhat Rosary Beads was indeed a heaven defying item!</p>
 <p>This was Qing Shui’s hidden ace. He would also rely on this to attack Lion King's Ridge.</p>
 <p>This time, he will let Wen Clan feel his wrath and others know his strength!</p>
 <p>Chi Chi!</p>
 <p>His Primordial Flame Whip appeared from the tip of Qing Shui’s sword. It was 100 meters and as thick as one’s calf. It was a simple gray but the aura that it emitted made the Old Ancestor’s face turn ashen gray. It exuded an all encompassing pressure, a pressure which nothing can withstand.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui swung the whip at one of the Elders. The Elder disintegrated on the spot. Qing Shui was now like a Shinigami looking disdainfully at the opponents before him.</p>
 <p>“Wait… Let me, an old man, say something.” The Old Ancestor spoke with cold sweat pouring down his head like rain. The old man himself mentioned that there were not many people who could destroy the Wen Clan and that there would be a terrible price to pay.</p>
 <p>However, the young man in front of him, was about to kill all of them in a mere few minutes. What sort of terrible price was there? The young man wasn’t even harm a little. How powerful was this demon-like young man anyway?</p>
 <p>“Don’t beg for your lives. If I hear that, I will kill you immediately.” The Primordial Flame Whip in Qing Shui’s hand flickered menacingly.</p>
 <p>The Old Ancestor had an agonizing look. The Elders around him had the same expression. Not only did they feel bitter, they were afraid. Facing death, it was unavoidable that they would be afraid even though they have already lived for such a long time.</p>
 <p>Not many people could disregard the importance of life and death.</p>
 <p>“Please let the other members of the Wen Clan live. I will give you something of great value.” the Old Ancestor knew that he and his group would not survive this. However, he did not want the entire Wen Clan to be annihilated because of him. Unfortunately, this was just a last ditch effort.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui just wanted to give the old man a chance to speak. There was no way he would let these people go, he also did not plan to spare anyone from Wen Clan, this was because it made him uneasy to let any of them live.</p>
 <p>Thinking about that, this was the reason why he finally revealed his strength. He wanted to shocked everyone, even if that hidden expert was around, he wanted to intimidate that man.</p>
 <p>“I can get whatever you offer with my own hands. Why should I negotiated with you.” Qing Shui looked at them coldly.</p>
 <p>“No, no. I will tell you about a place which holds treasures. But it is not that easy to access. There is a powerful demonic beast guarding that place. If you let the other members of the Wen Clan live, I will tell you that place.” the Old Ancestors quickly explained.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not believe the man. He felt that the old man was trying to delay him. Qing Shui thought that the man was trying to wait for other members from the Four Continents to come over.</p>
 <p>Besides, if that dangerous place really existed, it may not have any treasures. It could be a trap to get rid of Qing Shui. These old men certainly knew that Qing Shui will not let them live.</p>
 <p>Lastly, even if there were treasures, that place must be extremely dangerous.</p>
 <p>“I will give you a chance. Don’t try to negotiate with me. You know you must all die.” Qing Shui replied; it was clear from his firm tone that the situation had already been decided.</p>
 <p>“Peng Meng Immortal Mountain lies north of Northern Sacred Lu Continent. There is a place there called Peng Meng Paradiso. It is said that there are treasures to be found there but it is guard by a powerful Demonic Beast Guardian. As it is a dangerous place, it can only be challenged by people with incredible power.”the Old Ancestor said as he recalled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that the old man was trying to delay him, but Qing Shui played along. It was so easy for him to kill them that no one would be able to save them.</p>
 <p>“Are you done?” Qing Shui asked plainly.</p>
 <p>“Peng Meng Immortal Mountain is very large. I can tell you where exactly Peng Meng Paradiso lies. You can then call for more people to accompany you. It’ll be safer that way.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not utter a word, he extended his Primordial Flame Whip.</p>
 <p>The Old Ancestor started trembling. He couldn’t believe that this was happening. He actually thought that the group of people were just lambs waiting to be slaughter. Who would have known that the tables would be turned on them. He turned back to see Wen Jing who was already dead. He could feel his heart bleeding but he had no other choice. The Old Ancestor quickly added, “Peng Meng Immortal Mountain is a mountain range that spans from east to west. Peng Meng Paradiso is right in the middle. There is a gorge there, a very deep gorge. Once you enter, you will find yourself surrounded by mountains. Inside, you will see a large emerald green lake. That lake is the entrance of Peng Meng Paradiso, but it is very dangerous, as the demonic beast lives there.”</p>
 <p>The Old Ancestor said this very slowly, as if he was deep in thought. From the way he spoke, Qing Shui felt that the old man was telling him the truth. There was definitely such a place, there was such a lake, and it was definitely dangerous. But who knows if there was any treasure there at all.</p>
 <p>“Look, sir.” the Old Ancestor looked at Qing Shui anxiously. The strength of the people in the room were significant in the Wen Clan, even though there were only a few people here, it was enough to prove that Wen Clan was quite powerful overall.</p>
 <p>Before Qing Shui could reply, he sense movement from afar. He could feel the aura of a number of people heading his way.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his whip!</p>
 <p>“Run! Save yourselves!” the Old Ancestor yelled as he retreated backward. He was getting close to the others who were heading their way. He knew that the other members from the Wen Clan were coming. Perhaps, he might have a chance...</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps，Great Reversal!</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, Qing Shui swapped positions with the Old Ancestor. The Old Ancestor was not aware of this or rather he did not care as his life was in danger. The Old Ancestor was now heading towards Qing Shui at an alarming speed.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Even after he died, the Old Ancestor could not figure out why he was heading in Qing Shui’s direction. Wasn’t Qing Shui behind him...</p>
 <p>The Old Ancestor’s brain exploded as the whip touched him, even his body disappeared into thin air. As Qing Shui saw the Elders running away and the additional Wen Clan members before him, he chased them with lightning speed. The Seven-Headed Crystal Beast also chased after one of the Elders. It thrusted its claw covered with icefire directly into the Elder’s heart…</p>
