 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 267 – Fall of experts, 10,000s of preparations only for a single moment</strong></p>
  <p>Old Blindee&nbsp;swept his gaze over to the surroundings as he broke out into laughter.</p>
  <p>“Enough with this nonsense. Today, I shall kill your wife and daughter, and let you taste the agony of losing your loved ones.”</p>
  <p>After speaking, the old blindee transformed into a blurred shadow as he flew towards the wife of Canghai!</p>
  <p>“You’ll have to get over my dead body first!” Canghai snorted. The air trembled as he took two steps forwards, dashing forwards to bar the path of the old blindee. Only at this moment did Qing Shui discover Canghai’s weapon was a short spear with the thickness of a thumb, manufactured from pure jade.</p>
  <p>“Ai, your battle armor is not bad, to think that it actually enhanced your strength to this level!” Old blindee exclaimed in astonishment, as he took in the battle armor and boots equipped by Canghai before turning his gaze onto Qing Shui and the rest.</p>
  <p>It was as though the old blindee was playing Canghai for a fool, all his strikes were aimed at Canghai’s wife, forcing Canghai into a direct clash with him.</p>
  <p>Peng, peng. The continuous sounds of their weapons clashing against each other continuously rang out. The surface of the ground Canghai stood on was covered with fissures, while the surface of the ground the old blindee was standing on, was still untouched even after the clash</p>
  <p>“This old blindee is truly sinister, using such a method to force Canghai to clash head on with him. In this case, Canghai who originally could exchange over a hundred moves with him effortlessly, would even have trouble exchanging 80+ moves now.” Qing Shui could easily tell the flow and condition of both the parties.”</p>
  <p>Canghai naturally knew what his opponent’s plan was, but he had no choice other than to go along with him. He executed his strongest attack – Heavenly Thunder Slash every single time, as only with the power of his strongest attack, would he be able to barely block the old blindee.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui kept staring at the moves being exchanged between the two parties. He didn’t know what was the strength exhaustion rate of Canghai’s Heavenly Thunder Slash, and he didn’t know if there would be other side effects.</p>
  <p>The Old blindee’s staff struck out in a way akin to a poisonous dragon, it’s attack emitted a low drone similar to that of thunder. Canghai’s ‘Broken Jade Spear’ shrouded his body, as the manifestation of the twin green dragons flashed about like lightning, blocking the attacks of the old blindee.</p>
  <p>The atmosphere was extremely stifling, and breathing was almost impossible for ordinary cultivators under the combined pressure of both the old blindee and Canghai. Qing Shui stood at the side of Huoyun Liu-Li, using his aura to help alleviate some of the pressure for her.</p>
  <p>Canghai’s wife, with a cultivation base at the first level of the Martial King realm could only watch as her husband bitterly struggled. If she joined in, she would only be a burden.</p>
  <p>“Canghai, taste my Trinity Shadow!”</p>
  <p>The old blindee just as before, kept on directing his attacks at Canghai’s wife. The seemingly ordinary looking attack of his dragon staff contained a domineering energy within it so savage that it struck fear in the hearts of those who saw it.</p>
  <p>This strike of his was like a thunderbolt, its aura akin to a dragon ascending through the skies.</p>
  <p>Dragon from the clouds, Tiger from the wind!</p>
  <p>The old blindee seemed as though he returned to his natural state as his staff strikes from one became two, from two became three!</p>
  <p>Although Qing Shui’s strength was not at his level yet, he could tell just from observing how formidable this attack of the old blindee was. The three staff shadow attacks were not mere illusions.</p>
  <p>This speed was at a level where it couldn’t be followed by the naked eye, and shared similar miraculous properties as the 3rd Wave of Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>Canghai naturally could discern the crucial point of this attack, but if he wanted to break it, he could only go head on with it. He had to use his pure strength to overpower it before he could break this attack.</p>
  <p>Seeing this attack, Canghai’s wife could only be a sitting duck, awaiting death. Her eyes was filled with hopelessness as she bitterly shook her head glancing at Canghai.</p>
  <p>Seeing the woman he loved about to get killed by this guy, Canghai was seized with madness. How could he allow such a thing to happen. Who can endure this, allowing their own woman to be killed in front of their eyes.</p>
  <p>“Mother, MOTHER…”</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue cried and screamed, if it were not for Qing Shui holding her back, she would definitely have dashed over.</p>
  <p>Although she knew that certain death awaited if she went over, how could she still be as indifferent as to what’s going to happen? Even if she were to die, she also had to dash over.</p>
  <p>Canghai’s wife stared blankly at the approaching staff, that domineering pressure binded her, causing her unable to be unable to move.</p>
  <p>Canghai was filled with extreme bitterness, luckily his distance to his wife was not large, and in addition to his cloudmist steps, his speed didn’t lose out to the old blindee. In the blink of an eye, he appeared in front of the staff, while his body shone with a golden radiance.</p>
  <p>“Divinity Protection!”</p>
  <p>One of the shadow staffs struck the air, the second staff shadow was knocked aside by Canghai, while the third staff shadow smashed onto Canghai’s shoulder but was blocked by the golden radiance.</p>
  <p>“Canghai, this move of yours was the only thing i’m afraid off. But since you already used it, i want to see how long can this skill of yours last, and how many strikes it can defend.” The attacks of the old blindee abruptly became razor sharp, as he smashed his staff forward, each blow filled with incredible strength.</p>
  <p>Divinity Protection, Qing Shui was filled with shock as he heard the familiar name. And from the words of the old blindee, Qing Shui already understood the crux of this skill.</p>
  <p>The Divinity Protection once executed, could render the user complete immune to a single attack. The most important fact was that Canghai could only execute this move a single time per day..</p>
  <p>There was a high possibility that the old blindee was afraid that Canghai would use this move to exchange death blows with him, but now his attacks were completely unrestrained, his earlier fears were all gone.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui struggled fiercely, locking Canghai Mingyue in his embrace. He knew that he had to kept her here, regardless of how much she struggled.</p>
  <p>Almost 50 moves had been exchanged. When experts crossed paths, a single strike was sufficient to determine victory or defeat, if there was still no clear victor after over 10 moves,</p>
  <p>“Mingyue, you must stay calm!” During Qing Shui’s consolation of Canghai Mingyue, he quickly ate a agility enhancing fruit.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, can you please save my father and mother please…” Canghai Mingyue broke down, and wanted to go over to where her mother was.</p>
  <p>And at this exact moment, the attack of the old blindee that was originally intended for Canghai and his wife, suddenly erupted towards Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p>“YUEYUE…” Mingyue’s mum screamed, her eyes filled with impotent rage.</p>
  <p>Canghai’s silouhette flickered as his speed increased again. However, his actions were akin to locking the stable after the horses had bolted, it was too late. He was unwilling, and he would definitely not allow such a thing to happen.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s spiritual sense was raised to it’s peak at this moment. The moment he discovered this, his heart pounded in a frenzy. The pressure was so stifling that he almost couldn’t breath. This feeling of his powerful spiritual sense was incredible, exhilarating even, although he may die in the next moment. In that instant, many thoughts appeared in his mind, especially moments spent with his mother as well as the girl selling tea leaves in the Yan City. He knew that he couldn’t allow himself to die like this.</p>
  <p>Several Coldsteel needles appeared clutched in Qing Shui’s right hand. Qing Shui didn’t turn his head back, his ‘sight’ was exceptionally clear.</p>
  <p>Although all these took time to described, in reality everything happened in an instant, Qing Shui could feel that towering pressure as if mountains were gushing over. Gazing at Canghai Mingyue who was in his arms, he could see that her countenance had already turned bloodlessly white, as she stared straight ahead in terror.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s back was facing the pressure while Canghai Mingyue was looking straight at the old blindee.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui remained motionless, Canghai Mingyue wanted to scream, asking Qing Shui to evade the strike, and even wanted to push him away. However, she discovered that she couldn’t even move under the immense pressure.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui finally moved. Violently pushing Canghai Mingyue aside with his left hand, he sent her towards Huoyun Liu-Li. The two ladies were flung by Qing Shui to a space about 10+ metres away.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui still hadn’t turned back, and at the instant he pushed the two girls away, he executed the Soaring Crane Steps!</p>
  <p>The Soaring Crane Steps were executed with all his power as he speed soar to its utmost limits. In addition to the 10% increment in movespeed from his battle boots, the 10% enhancement in speed from the 3rd level black gemstone, and the temporarily 50% speed augmentation from the agility enhancing fruits, his speed reached an unprecedented level.</p>
  <p>When he sensed the dragon-headed staff about to smash into his back, he abruptly twisted to the side, avoiding critical injur., Turning to face the old blindee, the coldsteel needles in his left hands had the properties of cold poison as they accurately penetrated the other good eye of the old blindee. This hidden weapon technique was something he had practiced millions of millions of times. The speed of his attacks were as fast as lightning fire, so beautiful that it seemed comparable to a masterpiece of art.</p>
  <p>Enhanced further by his primordial flames, it was a pity the flames didn’t have the time to erupt before the staff smashed forth though. This was because Qing Shui calculated his movements, and twisted aside at the last possible moment to avoid a fatal strike to his heart. He was confident in the defense of his armor as well as the qi from the Ancient Strengthening Technique circulating in his body. But even so, the back section of his armor was smashed into a bloody pulp. As it fell to the ground, his injuries appeared even more serious compared to Huoyun Liu-Li back then, as his whole body was flung through the air. Blood sprayed about like rain from the heavens, and Qing Shui was dyed red from his blood upon smashing into the ground.</p>
  <p>“Dragon Capturing Hand!” Just when the old blindee was screaming about in agony, plucking out half of the coldsteel needles currently embedded in his eyes, at that moment, Canghai moved. This was the move that he had prepared in order to let the younger ones escape.</p>
  <p>Canghai grabbed hold of the old blindee’s neck, unhesitantly smashing it with his hands.</p>
  <p>The old blindee was too confident in himself. He thought that there was no way Qing Shui would still be able to move after getting blasted by the aura and the pressure he was releasing. Even if Qing Shui could move, how could he be afraid? But he never thought that Qing Shui’s speed would actually be that fast…</p>
  <p>30 years ago, Canghai blinded one of his eyes, and 30 years later, his remaining eye was blinded by the son-in-law of Canghai. Currently, his head felt as though it was going to explode, and in a moment of carelessness, he was grabbed by his neck by Canghai.</p>
  <p>Although he was more than a tier stronger than Canghai, he knew exactly how powerful the Dragon Capturing Hands were. If it were not for the blinding headache, causing his footwork to be in a mess, Canghai wouldn’t have the opportunity to catch hold of him.</p>
  <p>Canghai was afraid that the old blindee would target his daughter and thus executed the Dragon Capturing Hands to hold him in place.</p>
  <p>The old blindee had already gone mad with fury, feeling the chaotic qi of his opponent gathering in his dantian, as well as the hideous smile on the old blindee’s face, Canghai knew that he was already finished.</p>
  <p>Canghai already knew that he wouldn’t be able to dodge at such a close distance and thus, he used all his strength to crush the throat of his opponent. At that instant the old blindee executed the most powerful move a Xiantian-level and above cultivator could execute.</p>
  <p>Self-destruction of the Dantian!</p>
  <p>A thunderous sound echoed as the old blindee and Canghai turned into a bloody mist, with a deep crater in the spot where the two of them once stood at. The crater was several meters deep and fissures could be seen in an over 100m radius at the place of the explosion.</p>
  <p>Everyone was stunned but Qing Shui. Enduring the hellish pain, Qing Shui stood up as he called out to Canghai Mingyue’s mother.</p>
  <p>“Senior, quickly bring Mingyue and Liu-Li away!”</p>
  <p>“The old ancestor is dead…………..” The sect leader of the Immortal Sword Sect, murmured in belief.</p>
  <p>“Father…”</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue instantly broke down.</p>
  <p>The fire bird was already at his side and Qing Shui didn’t have the strength to get the two girls up. Beside them, the sect leader and elders of the Immortal Sword Sect were eyeing them as though they were their prey.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue’s mother stared at the spot where Canghai disappeared, before quickly flying towards Qing Shui and the two girls. At the same moment, the sect leader of the immortal sword sect moved as well, his speed was even faster compared to Canghai Mingyue’s mother by a tier!</p>

 <p>This strike of his was like a thunderbolt, its aura akin to a dragon ascending through the skies.</p>
 <p>Dragon from the clouds, Tiger from the wind!</p>
 <p>The old blindee seemed as though he returned to his natural state as his staff strikes from one became two, from two became three!</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui’s strength was not at his level yet, he could tell just from observing how formidable this attack of the old blindee was. The three staff shadow attacks were not mere illusions.</p>
 <p>This speed was at a level where it couldn’t be followed by the naked eye, and shared similar miraculous properties as the 3rd Wave of Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Canghai naturally could discern the crucial point of this attack, but if he wanted to break it, he could only go head on with it. He had to use his pure strength to overpower it before he could break this attack.</p>
 <p>Seeing this attack, Canghai’s wife could only be a sitting duck, awaiting death. Her eyes was filled with hopelessness as she bitterly shook her head glancing at Canghai.</p>
 <p>Seeing the woman he loved about to get killed by this guy, Canghai was seized with madness. How could he allow such a thing to happen. Who can endure this, allowing their own woman to be killed in front of their eyes.</p>
 <p>“Mother, MOTHER…”</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue cried and screamed, if it were not for Qing Shui holding her back, she would definitely have dashed over.</p>
 <p>Although she knew that certain death awaited if she went over, how could she still be as indifferent as to what’s going to happen? Even if she were to die, she also had to dash over.</p>
 <p>Canghai’s wife stared blankly at the approaching staff, that domineering pressure binded her, causing her unable to be unable to move.</p>
 <p>Canghai was filled with extreme bitterness, luckily his distance to his wife was not large, and in addition to his cloudmist steps, his speed didn’t lose out to the old blindee. In the blink of an eye, he appeared in front of the staff, while his body shone with a golden radiance.</p>
 <p>“Divinity Protection!”</p>
 <p>One of the shadow staffs struck the air, the second staff shadow was knocked aside by Canghai, while the third staff shadow smashed onto Canghai’s shoulder but was blocked by the golden radiance.</p>
 <p>“Canghai, this move of yours was the only thing i’m afraid off. But since you already used it, i want to see how long can this skill of yours last, and how many strikes it can defend.” The attacks of the old blindee abruptly became razor sharp, as he smashed his staff forward, each blow filled with incredible strength.</p>
 <p>Divinity Protection, Qing Shui was filled with shock as he heard the familiar name. And from the words of the old blindee, Qing Shui already understood the crux of this skill.</p>
 <p>The Divinity Protection once executed, could render the user complete immune to a single attack. The most important fact was that Canghai could only execute this move a single time per day..</p>
 <p>There was a high possibility that the old blindee was afraid that Canghai would use this move to exchange death blows with him, but now his attacks were completely unrestrained, his earlier fears were all gone.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui struggled fiercely, locking Canghai Mingyue in his embrace. He knew that he had to kept her here, regardless of how much she struggled.</p>
 <p>Almost 50 moves had been exchanged. When experts crossed paths, a single strike was sufficient to determine victory or defeat, if there was still no clear victor after over 10 moves,</p>
 <p>“Mingyue, you must stay calm!” During Qing Shui’s consolation of Canghai Mingyue, he quickly ate a agility enhancing fruit.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, can you please save my father and mother please…” Canghai Mingyue broke down, and wanted to go over to where her mother was.</p>
 <p>And at this exact moment, the attack of the old blindee that was originally intended for Canghai and his wife, suddenly erupted towards Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p>“YUEYUE…” Mingyue’s mum screamed, her eyes filled with impotent rage.</p>
 <p>Canghai’s silouhette flickered as his speed increased again. However, his actions were akin to locking the stable after the horses had bolted, it was too late. He was unwilling, and he would definitely not allow such a thing to happen.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s spiritual sense was raised to it’s peak at this moment. The moment he discovered this, his heart pounded in a frenzy. The pressure was so stifling that he almost couldn’t breath. This feeling of his powerful spiritual sense was incredible, exhilarating even, although he may die in the next moment. In that instant, many thoughts appeared in his mind, especially moments spent with his mother as well as the girl selling tea leaves in the Yan City. He knew that he couldn’t allow himself to die like this.</p>
 <p>Several Coldsteel needles appeared clutched in Qing Shui’s right hand. Qing Shui didn’t turn his head back, his ‘sight’ was exceptionally clear.</p>
 <p>Although all these took time to described, in reality everything happened in an instant, Qing Shui could feel that towering pressure as if mountains were gushing over. Gazing at Canghai Mingyue who was in his arms, he could see that her countenance had already turned bloodlessly white, as she stared straight ahead in terror.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s back was facing the pressure while Canghai Mingyue was looking straight at the old blindee.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui remained motionless, Canghai Mingyue wanted to scream, asking Qing Shui to evade the strike, and even wanted to push him away. However, she discovered that she couldn’t even move under the immense pressure.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui finally moved. Violently pushing Canghai Mingyue aside with his left hand, he sent her towards Huoyun Liu-Li. The two ladies were flung by Qing Shui to a space about 10+ metres away.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui still hadn’t turned back, and at the instant he pushed the two girls away, he executed the Soaring Crane Steps!</p>
 <p>The Soaring Crane Steps were executed with all his power as he speed soar to its utmost limits. In addition to the 10% increment in movespeed from his battle boots, the 10% enhancement in speed from the 3rd level black gemstone, and the temporarily 50% speed augmentation from the agility enhancing fruits, his speed reached an unprecedented level.</p>
 <p>When he sensed the dragon-headed staff about to smash into his back, he abruptly twisted to the side, avoiding critical injur., Turning to face the old blindee, the coldsteel needles in his left hands had the properties of cold poison as they accurately penetrated the other good eye of the old blindee. This hidden weapon technique was something he had practiced millions of millions of times. The speed of his attacks were as fast as lightning fire, so beautiful that it seemed comparable to a masterpiece of art.</p>
 <p>Enhanced further by his primordial flames, it was a pity the flames didn’t have the time to erupt before the staff smashed forth though. This was because Qing Shui calculated his movements, and twisted aside at the last possible moment to avoid a fatal strike to his heart. He was confident in the defense of his armor as well as the qi from the Ancient Strengthening Technique circulating in his body. But even so, the back section of his armor was smashed into a bloody pulp. As it fell to the ground, his injuries appeared even more serious compared to Huoyun Liu-Li back then, as his whole body was flung through the air. Blood sprayed about like rain from the heavens, and Qing Shui was dyed red from his blood upon smashing into the ground.</p>
 <p>“Dragon Capturing Hand!” Just when the old blindee was screaming about in agony, plucking out half of the coldsteel needles currently embedded in his eyes, at that moment, Canghai moved. This was the move that he had prepared in order to let the younger ones escape.</p>
 <p>Canghai grabbed hold of the old blindee’s neck, unhesitantly smashing it with his hands.</p>
 <p>The old blindee was too confident in himself. He thought that there was no way Qing Shui would still be able to move after getting blasted by the aura and the pressure he was releasing. Even if Qing Shui could move, how could he be afraid? But he never thought that Qing Shui’s speed would actually be that fast…</p>
 <p>30 years ago, Canghai blinded one of his eyes, and 30 years later, his remaining eye was blinded by the son-in-law of Canghai. Currently, his head felt as though it was going to explode, and in a moment of carelessness, he was grabbed by his neck by Canghai.</p>
 <p>Although he was more than a tier stronger than Canghai, he knew exactly how powerful the Dragon Capturing Hands were. If it were not for the blinding headache, causing his footwork to be in a mess, Canghai wouldn’t have the opportunity to catch hold of him.</p>
 <p>Canghai was afraid that the old blindee would target his daughter and thus executed the Dragon Capturing Hands to hold him in place.</p>
 <p>The old blindee had already gone mad with fury, feeling the chaotic qi of his opponent gathering in his dantian, as well as the hideous smile on the old blindee’s face, Canghai knew that he was already finished.</p>
 <p>Canghai already knew that he wouldn’t be able to dodge at such a close distance and thus, he used all his strength to crush the throat of his opponent. At that instant the old blindee executed the most powerful move a Xiantian-level and above cultivator could execute.</p>
 <p>Self-destruction of the Dantian!</p>
 <p>A thunderous sound echoed as the old blindee and Canghai turned into a bloody mist, with a deep crater in the spot where the two of them once stood at. The crater was several meters deep and fissures could be seen in an over 100m radius at the place of the explosion.</p>
 <p>Everyone was stunned but Qing Shui. Enduring the hellish pain, Qing Shui stood up as he called out to Canghai Mingyue’s mother.</p>
 <p>“Senior, quickly bring Mingyue and Liu-Li away!”</p>
 <p>“The old ancestor is dead…………..” The sect leader of the Immortal Sword Sect, murmured in belief.</p>
 <p>“Father…”</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue instantly broke down.</p>
 <p>The fire bird was already at his side and Qing Shui didn’t have the strength to get the two girls up. Beside them, the sect leader and elders of the Immortal Sword Sect were eyeing them as though they were their prey.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue’s mother stared at the spot where Canghai disappeared, before quickly flying towards Qing Shui and the two girls. At the same moment, the sect leader of the immortal sword sect moved as well, his speed was even faster compared to Canghai Mingyue’s mother by a tier!</p>
