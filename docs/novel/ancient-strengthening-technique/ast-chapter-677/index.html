 <p><strong>AST 677 - Grand Perfection Stage, Diamond Crossing Rivers</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know if he was considered a Beast Tamer himself, but from other people’s perspective, not only was he more than enough to be called a Beast Tamer, he was even a powerful one.</p>
 <p>The Diamond Gigantic Elephant was currently Qing Shui’s strongest demonic beast. Furthermore, there was still a lot of room for it to grow. In the future, it would definitely turn out to be really strong. The most important thing was that every time it grew stronger, Qing Shui would gain 20% of its increase in abilities, this was a heaven-defying benefit. It was a great help to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>It has been a long time since Fire Bird last experienced an increase in strength. For flying type demonic beasts, even if it was only at Peak Martial King Grade, it was still something that warriors at Martial Saint Grade would crave, especially the ones like Qing Shui’s Fire Bird.. It was known as the mutated beast Red Luan across the continent.</p>
 <p>The Fire Bird was one of the rewards as a result of the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal being upgraded. Qing Shui still had faith in the Fire Bird. He believed that it would take an enormous leap the next time it broke through. Based on his experience with its last two breakthrough, it should not be inferior to the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>At present, the Thunder Beast had yet to reach its adult stage. Despite this, not only was it already a Grade One Martial Saint, it was still improving at an incredible rate. This was a process which it would go through before reaching maturity.</p>
 <p>After that were the Jade Emperor Queen Bee, its minions as well as the Gold-Silver Colored Butterflies. For a moment, Qing Shui felt a few times more confident in himself.</p>
 <p>Only two days had passed within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Qing Shui started to do his usual things. Drawing talismans, cultivating and refining medicines. Recently, he had added in a few new things to his daily routine as well, they were refining poisons and reading the “Poison Scriptures” and “Heavenly Talismans”.</p>
 <p>The Descending Heavens Talisman was still the same as before. Qing Shui knew that he would have to practice a lot harder if he wanted to upgrade it. The Descending Heavens Talisman was capable of reducing an opponent’s overall strength. Even though the effect seemed really small for now, Qing Shui believed that it would turn out to be quite useful after a period of time. Hence, he planned to spend more time on the talisman itself.</p>
 <p>By reducing the opponent’s overall strength, it meant that the opponent’s offense and defense as well as his speed would be reduced. Hence, the Descending Heavens Talisman would still prove to be really formidable once it reached a certain level. In addition to that, one of the unique features of the Heavenly Talisman was that the effect of different kinds of talismans, for example, Body Securing Talisman and Armor Break Talisman could be used together at the same time.</p>
 <p>Additionally, the more significant effect a talisman had, the harder it would be to draw it. Furthermore, it also became increasingly tougher as one ascended up the grades of drawing talismans. One would need a lot of time, energy, money and most importantly, talent to accomplish it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t lack any of this. He had the heaven-defying Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal for time and he did not come up short in terms of having talent. Even though he wasn’t considered to be wealthy, he already had more than enough money for it. Additionally, because of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he was able to store a lot more things than to normal people.</p>
 <p>He was short of neither medicinal herbs nor poison ingredients. It’s just that Qing Shui felt that now wasn’t the time. If he waited for a little while longer, a lot of things would change.</p>
 <p>Elephant Form!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was currently cultivating the Diamond Crossing Rivers of the Elephant Form. The Diamond Crossing River which was at the Large Success Stage had started showing evidence of breaking through. This made Qing Shui feel really happy. He intended to give it his all to try to make it break through before leaving the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Just like that, Qing Shui began his long cultivation of Diamond Crossing Rivers. Occasionally, he would also take some time out to practice the Thousand Hammer Technique. Qing Shui’s plan was to rely on himself to forge Seven-Colored Weapons and Armors in the future, to see what kind of a formidable technique it was.</p>
 <p>The Thousand Hammer Technique was just a basic. He also had the Synthesize Gems. Unfortunately, he wasn’t able to synthesize anything with high levels, nor had he tried to embed them. He planned to do it in the near future.</p>
 <p>He was close to levelling up in terms of his skill in refining medicines. Not long after, the recipe for Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellet would show up. Ever since he got a few recipes from Yuan Su, Qing Shui realized that he no longer held as many expectations as before in getting medicinal recipes through this method.</p>
 <p>However, the medicinal recipes that were obtained in this way for alchemy, seemed like they were all unusually powerful, not to mention a huge amount of experience was needed for the recipe of Everlasting Pellet. Qing Shui was a bit concerned that he might not be able to refine them within such a short period of time, or worse, not refine them at all.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, yet another half a month passed. Qing Shui spent most of his time cultivating the Diamond Crossing Rivers. He hoped to achieve the Great Perfection Stage with Diamond Crossing Rivers as soon as possible. By doing so, it would enable the technique to have the same effect as Diamond Protection and Diamond Qi, it could help him double his raw speed any time he liked.</p>
 <p>In the middle of his cultivation, he brewed a wine. He would also refine Spirit Concentrating Pills on a daily basis. Since he ran out of the ingredients to refine Meridians Clearing Pellet, he had no choice but to give up on refining it for the time being.</p>
 <p>The things which he refined the most were the Spirit Concentrating Pill and the Aroma Concentration Pill. These were the two pills that he needed the most of. In any case, he could store them if he wasn’t able to finish them in one go. Unfortunately, he never got to find the recipe for Six-Fold Spirit Concentrating Pill. Qing Shui had once wondered if the difference between Two-Fold, Three-Fold and Six-Fold Spirit Concentrating Pill lay in the age of the ingredients.</p>
 <p>At one point, Qing Shui tried to refine it. Unfortunately, he didn’t have any ingredients with high medicinal age. Hence, the Spirit Concentrating Pills that he refined were still Three-Fold Spirit Concentrating Pills. Ever since then, he rejected the ideas that he once had.</p>
 <p>When he was free, he looked at the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus once. The Golden Buddha Aura Lotus had nine petals, since Qing Shui ate one of them, there were only eight left. No one knew how long it would take for that petal to recover. This kind of sacred object was something that could only be discovered but not sought. It was a priceless treasure. Other than himself, who ran into it, this kind of thing was something that could neither be bought nor traded.</p>
 <p>If a warrior from the World of the Nine Continents was to suffer injuries or even be at the brink of death, it would mean nothing if they had the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus. Having it would almost mean gaining nine extra lives for oneself.</p>
 <p>Yet another month had passed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui continuously travelled back and forth on the empty ground in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The actions of both of his feet were heavy yet fast, looking kind of awkward.</p>
 <p>The Diamond Crossing River was also known as Gigantic Elephant Crossing Rivers. Despite elephants being heavy, they were still able to stomp through water. This was the kind of feeling he had while using the Diamond Crossing Rivers. It was heavy yet steady, quick and agile.</p>
 <p>The movement of his feet became faster and faster. It felt like they were getting lighter and lighter. However, the movements still made people feel really heavy. It was a feeling that couldn’t be described. It’s basically just mind-blowing.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui seemingly entered the State of No Conscious. He closed both of his eyes as he travelled back and forth across the field with a circumference of three meters. He seemed like he was running around unusual directions.</p>
 <p>Time passed on little by little. However, Qing Shui didn’t feel tired at all. Suddenly, a golden light started shining on his calves. The part that shone happened to be the part that’s known as “Yang Jiao”.</p>
 <p>After about half an hour, a golden light also started shining on his “Yang Gu”. Qing Shui had not the slightest idea that this was happening as he tried his best to travel back and forth on his own pace.</p>
 <p>For the next three hours, both of Qing Shui’s legs continuously shone with seven light spots. These light spots were scattered across his feet and together formed a curved line shape.</p>
 <p>Da!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui stomped the ground ferociously. At that instant, a faint light halo emerged from both of his feet. Simultaneously, he also opened up both of his eyes. They were filled with surprise.</p>
 <p>It’s done!</p>
 <p>The Diamond Crossing Rivers had finally achieved the Great Perfection Stage. It was just like the Diamond Qi and Protection, Qing Shui would be able to permanently increase his raw speed at anytime he wanted. Furthermore, following the increase in speed, the strength of Diamond Crossing River would also be raised. Most importantly, just like the Diamond Qi and Protection, it didn’t consume anything!</p>
 <p>It was an insanely powerful passive skill and a permanent boost to his speed which would only stop operating when he was at the brink of death. The one fold increase in speed made Qing Shui feel a lot lighter and more energetic than before.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn’t help but let out a huge roar into the air to express his extreme joy. An increase in speed was much more precious than an increase in power. Furthermore, it was a permanent boost which didn’t consume anything. Anyone would be madly jealous of it. Qing Shui had a felt as though it was the spring festival.</p>
 <p>[TL notes: The Spring Festival is also known as the Chinese New Year, it is a time where families gather and celebrate together. It is normally a time full of happiness and joy. And if you are young, you receive red packets with money in them from your elders]</p>
 <p>The Elephant Form bestowed upon Qing Shui, with three of the most insanely heaven defying passive skills, as well as the Mighty Elephant Stomp which had terrifying destructive power. Unfortunately, the Mighty Elephant Stomp, that had yet to achieve Great Perfection Stage, couldn’t be used in the air.</p>
 <p>This was also a conclusion which Qing Shui drew out from his recent battles. Qing Shui assumed that only by achieving Great Perfection Stage would he be able to use the tenfold strength increasing stomp in mid-air and also battle the way that was shown in the images of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant in his sea of consciousness.</p>
 <p>Unlike on the ground where the shockwave was passed to the opponent through the ground, the Mighty Elephant Stomp transferred the shockwave directly to the opponent when it was used in the air. It’s just that the condition to use it in air was even higher. The Mighty Elephant Stomp at Large Success Stage wasn’t usable in air but it was in water.</p>
 <p>Hence, Qing Shui made an assumption. The Mighty Elephant Stomp at Small Success Stage could only be used on the ground. Once it reached Large Success Stage, it would be applicable on both the ground and in water. The Mighty Elephant Stomp that he envisioned was something that could be used in the air. Hence, Qing Shui guessed that he would most likely have to cultivate it all the way up to Great Perfection Stage.</p>
 <p>Most of the time, the battle between Martial Saints would take place in the sky. Hence, it has been a long time since Qing Shui last used his Mighty Elephant Stomp. Luckily, the Mighty Elephant Stomp was at the Peak Large Success Stage, which was only a bit away from Great Perfection Stage.</p>
 <p>Basically, the Elephant Form was considered to be almost done cultivating. Qing Shui would only have to cultivate the Mighty Elephant Stomp up to the Great Perfection Stage to learn the next form. The benefits brought upon by the Elephant Form to Qing Shui was something that could never be compared. Hence, Qing Shui really looked forward to the next form. Theoretically it should be something even more powerful.</p>
 <p>Dragons and phoenixes were only in legends. Even across the World of the Nine Continents, they were legendary existences. Phoenixes were a combination of the names given to both genders of the bird. The male gender was called Feng, whereas the female one was known as Huang. Roc on the other hand, was something that could be seen quite commonly across the World of the Nine Continents. Canghai Mingyue’s Golden Winged Thunder Condor was an example of them.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that the Roc in the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique was no ordinary Roc. This Roc would most likely be the legendary Roc Ancestor. It was equivalent to a divine bird.</p>
 <p>Considering that the Elephant Form alone was already so strong, how formidable would the next few forms be? Not only that, it would also take him even longer to cultivate those forms. It’s unlikely that he would be able to cultivate the Dragon and Phoenix Forms within his lifetime. Nevertheless, he would try his best to achieve them.</p>
 <p>The next thing he wanted to do was to cultivate the Mighty Elephant Stomp up to Great Perfection Stage. Only by doing that would he be able to go up the next step and cultivate the Roc Form. Beyond that should be a really long-lasting stage which would most likely take him many years or possibly even forever, to cultivate.</p>
 <p>Seeing as time was almost up, Qing Shui washed himself up and exited the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The sky was filled with stars and a bright moon hanging high in it. It looked really bright during the night.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, it was already midnight. There were crying noises of insects in the surroundings. It sounded particularly distinct on a peaceful night like this. Qing Shui slowly walked towards his house.</p>
 <p>When he was in front of the room, he gently pushed open the door. The corridor, the room as well as the bedrooms were all decorated with light stones. If it was too bright, they could also use the lamp shade to cover up the light stones.</p>
 <p>The living room was really bright. Di Chen’s room was locked tightly. But Qing Shui was currently able to sense Di Chen’s breathing. Furthermore, she had also already woken up. He assumed that it might be because she heard the sounds of him pushing the door open.</p>
