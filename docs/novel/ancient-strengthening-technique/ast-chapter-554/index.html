  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 554 - Body Securing Talisman, Qing Shui’s Diamond Protection! Ready to leave!</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hahaha……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A loud and bright voice rang. It sounded really insane. There was a joyful and emotional tinge that could not be expressed with words alone.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Elder Ge, congratulations!” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Elder Ge stopped. After that, he looked towards Qing Shui and said seriously: “Qing Shui, you were the one who returned my everything. From now onwards, I am going to dedicate my life to you.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Elder Ge, you are being too courteous. The Heavenly Palace is blessed to have you around.” Qing Shui responded hurriedly. Elder Ge’s words still made Qing Shui feel really happy because this way, he would be able to entrust Heavenly Palace and the Qing Clan to him while he was away.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I am already an old man. Whatever I say are facts and truths.” Elder Ge said in a serious manner. He sounded really firm and steady when he said it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Elder Ge, since that’s the case, then I’ll just be frank with you.” Qing Shui said with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, tell me, I have mentioned it before, even if it would cost me my life, I wouldn’t frown.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Actually, Qing Shui really enjoyed being associated with this kind of hot-blooded man. He looked at Elder Ge and smiled: “I hope that you can take over the Heavenly Palace.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What’s wrong? Could it be that you want to leave?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The experienced old man was immediately able to figure out Qing Shui’s intention.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I might be away for quite a while, but there has to be someone to look after Heavenly Palace in the meantime.” Qing Shui really wanted to give the position of the Heavenly Palace’s Old Ancestor to Elder Ge. At present, with Elder Ge’s strength, taking charge of Heavenly Palace was a piece of cake. In fact, he would be the most suitable to do it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After pondering for a while, Elder Ge said slowly: “I can help you look after the Heavenly Palace, but the Patriarch of the Heavenly Palace still has to be you.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This turn of events didn’t really surprise Qing Shui. Qing Shui also stopped forcing him: “Elder Ge, alright, then in regards to the Qing Clan, I really hope that you can look after them for me.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Don’t worry, even if you didn’t tell me, I will still do that. As long as I’m here, you don’t need to worry.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He gave Elder Ge some of the things from his Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, for example, the Great Revitalizing Pill. They were just the usual medicinal pills. This way, Elder Ge would be able to increase his strength quite significantly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, have you decided on when to leave yet?” Elder Ge asked Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I will definitely leave but I am not sure when yet. When I leave, it would be for at least half a month and up to about half a year.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Are you leaving alone or with other people?” Elder Ge responded after thinking for a while.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“For now, I’m still not sure. But I plan to go alone.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Are you going to Central Continent?” Elder Ge asked after he saw Qing Shui knit his brows.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I do plan on going to Central Continent!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Central Continent may be the most advanced continent in the World of the Nine Continent, but it’s also one of the most chaotic ones. It had lots of aristocratic clans and sects jumbled up together. Not to mention that most of them are formidable clans and sects. In short, there were a lot of formidable experts. If one were to go to Central Continent, they will have to be really cautious.” As Elder Ge said these words, his brows that were knitted previously slowly spread out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Elder Ge, would the Di Clan and the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord be considered strong in Central Continent?” Qing Shui remembered the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. He was thinking if he would get attacked by the Di Clan if he were to go against the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hehe, Di Clan and Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord were only barely considered as aristocratic clans in Central Continent. There were a lot of clans stronger than them. The water in Central Continent really runs deep. The number of Martial Saint Grade warriors were almost equal to the amount of Peak Martial King Grade Warriors in the Green Cloud Continent. The difference between each grade in the Martial Saint Realm is also really significant.” Elder Ge looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Thank you Elder Ge, I understand now.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui left the rear of the mountain with complicated feelings. The Central Continent was a place that he had always wanted to go. But for now, what could he do even if he went there? Expanding his horizon….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Going to the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord with his current strength was suicide. For a moment, Qing Shui felt really upset. After two years, he still hadn’t managed to break through to the Sixth Heavenly Layer. This made Qing Shui feel really helpless. Even though this result was within expectations, he still felt incomparably depressed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">By the time he returned to Qing Clan which was located in the Continent’s Capital, the sky was already getting dark. At present, Qing Clan could finally be considered to be on track. In terms of the financing their business, Qing Shui could supply them with the money. Additionally, they were also under the protections of a few aristocratic clans, thus things were going smoother than expected.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At present, other than the helpers which Qing Clan got, there weren’t many people left in Qing Clan. Since they didn’t really go out much, they’re slowly getting adapted to this new lifestyle and business.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The family had their meal together happily. After that, Qing Shui left.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui cultivated madly. His current bottleneck made him feel irritated and troubled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The more impatient one felt, the harder it would be for them to achieve their goals. Since Qing Shui felt that he had no other options, he stopped cultivating. He planned to go to the Central Continent right after he broke through to the Sixth Heavenly Layer. At least it would be safer this way. After that, he planned to build up some reputation there and look for an opportunity to destroy the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“They are so arrogant just because they are powerful? There are consequences for being arrogant.” Everytime Qing Shui thought about the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, he would feel his blood burning with anger.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He took up the Golden Calligraphy Brush and randomly drew across the Beast Parchment. Compared to the previous Heavenly Talismans, it looked a bit simple and unadorned, yet it was natural and smooth. The drawing on the talisman was like a gigantic beast being captured by a net. No matter how much it struggled or howled, it was unable to leave the spot.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A bright halo rose up!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Body Securing Talisman!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was Qing Shui’s biggest achievement during these past two years. He finally succeeded in drawing the Body Securing Talisman. Previously, he thought that he would be able to do it within three months, but then things got tougher and tougher as he went on. Simultaneously, he was also finally able to understand the difficulty about Talisman Drawing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The time and energy that he consumed were really terrifying. He finally understood the reason why Lin Zhanhan only managed to reach the level he was currently at and why he was unable to draw the Body Securing Talismans.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Simultaneously, he had also found out about the Five Elements Talisman. Even with the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui could still feel his scalp go numb. How long would it take to draw a talisman, ten years? How long would that be without the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Basically, the people who were able to draw Five Elements Talisman could already be considered geniuses. At least they were geniuses at Talisman Drawings. Without the talent, they would then need a lot of treasures like the Spirit Concentrating Pill, high level Spirit Concentrating Split, the high leveled Spirit Concentrating Pill and even the legendary Holy Bracelet for the Talisman Drawings, making it really tough to actually advance further.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that he still had a bit of talent in Talisman Drawings. In addition , he had the most heaven defying treasure, the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. It was a treasure even more insane than the Holy bracelet.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tiger Form!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Tiger Form which had surpassed the Great Perfection stage made Qing Shui feel a lot more confident. Two years ago, he accidentally broke past the curse of the rotten and withered Tiger Form and opened an even wider world across the heavens and the earth.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was not like he didn’t gain anything throughout these two years. The biggest prize he received was the Elephant Form, There was no change in the Diamond Qi, but Qing Shui managed to learn the Elephant Form’s Diamond Protection.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At present, it was similarly in the Great Perfection Stage. After revolving it, Qing Shui could strengthen his physical defense by five folds. This made Qing Shui wonder if the Elephant Form Battle Skills were exactly the same as those that the Diamond Gigantic Elephant had.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There weren’t many changes to the Mighty Elephant Stomp either. Nor were there any changes to the Fire Bird and the Diamond Gigantic Elephant themselves. However, their future increases in strength was still something to look forward to.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though Qing Shui didn’t advance into the Sixth Heavenly Layers in these two years, he still managed to cultivate the Elephant Form Diamond Protection. Furthermore, he also cultivated it all the way to the Great Perfection Stage. Just through this, Qing Shui’s actual combat strength had already increased significantly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was panicked about whether he should go alone to Central Continent or bring someone along to accompany him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was to the point that even Qing Shui didn’t know what to do. How could he bring anyone along? His current strength absolutely wouldn’t allow him to bring anyone along, If he were to run into members from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord in the Green Cloud Continent, they would definitely end up fighting.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange and Luan Luan stayed over at either the Heavenly Palace or the Qing Clan. In any case, it didn’t really matter whether they cultivated in the Heavenly Palace or not. Hence, Qing Shui never thought of taking them along before.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li’s strength was still a bit low. Naturally, Canghai Mingyue would stay behind because of Huoyun Liu-Li. He predicted that Wenren Wushuang wouldn’t follow him even if he were to ask her to.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Additionally, at the moment, Qing Shui really wasn’t powerful enough to take her along. Fifth Martial King Grade might be considered good in Green Cloud Continent, but he still lacked the strength to even protect himself if he was up against the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Chen and Di Qing might not have problems if they went to Central Continent. They were already members from Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord and Di Clan. But everything was different now. Hence, Qing Shui didn’t want to let them follow him to the Central Continent. At the very least, he didn’t hope for Di Chen to follow him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everything will turn out for the best. Qing Shui too didn’t want to keep mulling over it. Strength was the best insurance to everything. If he was strong enough, let alone taking one of them, it wouldn’t be a problem even if he were to bring along the entire Qing Clan and all of the girls.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the morning, Qing Shui had his morning practice at the Qing Clan’s backyard. He could see Wenren Wushuang standing alone under a willow tree by a pond, not so far away from him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the moment, Qing Shui was in Qing Clan’s residence. Other than Di Chen and Di Qing, the other girls had all been staying at Qing Clan. Therefore, Qing Shui could also help guide them in their cultivation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As Qing Shui looked at the faint figure not so far away from him. He felt his heart moved all of a sudden. It felt a bit painful. After walking two steps, Qing Shui noticed that the present Wushuang was a bit different compared to before.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He kept feeling a sense of familiarity…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In fact, they were supposed to be quite close to each other to begin with….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Wushuang!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui called out softly to Wenren Wushuang who was staring blankly into space.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was such a familiar feeling. Qing Shui’s eyes turned bright as he looked at her familiar expression. Suddenly, he pulled her towards him: “Wushuang, you have recovered your memories!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui agitatedly looked at Wenren Wushuang.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I can only remember you. But I am unable to remember any other stuffs. I remembered that you are Qing Shui, I remembered that you were really good to me. And also, for some unknown reasons, I have been feeling a kind of pain…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Wenren Wushuang continued to let Qing Shui pull her as he wished. Tears began dropping down her face. Her delicate face made people feel really sympathetic.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though she wasn’t able to remember anything else, she still managed to remember him. It might be because Qing Shui reminded her a bit of Wenren Wugou that she felt sad. Qing Shui embraced her and lightly patted her back.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Don’t be sad, this is your home. The people here are all your family. In the future, you will recall everything.” Qing Shui still felt really happy deep in his heart. After all, she could remember him and a bit of stuffs regarding their past. This was a good start. Perhaps, it wouldn’t be long until she restored all her memories.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, thank you!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui heard Wenren Wushuang’s words, he was stunned: “Why do you want to thank me?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I may be in this kind of condition, but you are still so good to me. Yet… I am still unable to figure out our relationship with each other……” Wenren Wushuang looked at Qing Shui seriously.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If I were to tell you that we are married couples, will you believe me?” After thinking for a while, Qing Shui asked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After looking at Qing Shui, Wenren Wushuang shook her head.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Actually, we have already made a deal with each other before. In the future, you are going to marry me.” Qing Shui smiled and explained. He looked at the extremely beautiful woman in front of him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She was the kind of woman who was in between otherworldly, graceful and luxurious. She also exuded an aura which resembled that of an older sister in the household. She was an intractable beauty who was unmatched in her generation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Can you wait for me for a while……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sure, it didn’t matter how long, as long as you remember me. Even if you were to forget about me, I will still make you say that you want to marry me on your own.” Qing Shui softly knocked Wenren Wushuang’s forehead with his.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qingzhuang!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes, are you leaving again?” Shi Qingzhuang looked at Qing Shui and asked with a faint smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“How did you know?” Qing Shui looked a bit surprised as he asked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Every time when you’re about to leave, you will have this expression on your face. Alright, just tell me what you feel like saying, everyone will support you.” Shi Qingzhuang looked at Qing Shui with an expression which looked like she was reluctant to part with him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qingzhuang, tell me, when will we be able to finish our marriage?” Qing Shui looked at Shi Qingzhuang and asked gently.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You wish! Who said that I’m going to marry you.” Shi Qingzhuang lowered her head slightly and said in a seemingly angry way.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You are already my woman. Furthermore, you are still my fiance. Who else will you marry other than me?” Qing Shui continued to embrace her waist as he smiled beside her ear.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“In any case, I won’t marry you……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, can you really not bring me along to Central Continent?” Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Shui and asked begrudgingly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li, wait for me for a while. Wait until I have settled down there, then I will come back to get you guys, ok? It will be very fast. For now, I really don’t have the ability to bring you along. You too know that things won’t be as peaceful when I go to Central Continent.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Then when you go there, how do you expect us to not be worried? Do you want to make all of us worried for you?” Huoyun Liu-Li pulled Qing Shui’s hand and asked with concern.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I still have a few ways of protecting myself! Don’t worry!” Qing Shui explained with a smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright, I understand now!”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two fell into a short moment of silence. It might be because they were aware that they would have to separate from each other soon.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes!” Qing Shui looked at the depressed Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hug me! I want you to hug me!” Huoyun Liu-Li lowered her head and said softly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly embraced her. He did it tightly like he was trying to envelop her completely. They hugged each other really closely.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes!” Huoyun Liu-Li closed her eyes. It looked like she had grown really attached to this moment.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Can you let me accompany you tonight?” Qing Shui was biting her sparkling and translucent earlobe.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li trembled slightly and buried her face into Qing Shui’s neck.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Is that ok? Liu-Li?” Qing Shui asked again gently. Huoyun Liu-Li blushed and felt really hot.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If you want to come… Who, who would be able to get in your way……” Huoyun Liu-Li said softly. She didn’t dare to raise her head.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled as he looked at the usually charming and attractive girl who now turned really shy. The aura she exuded in the past which resembled that of a demoness had also disappeared.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He extended his hand and raised Huoyun Liu-Li’s chin. Qing Shui looked at the Huoyun Liu-Li, who was at the moment, feeling incomparably abashed. Her long eyelashes were thick and long. When they gently swayed, it looked unusually attractive.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“So even a little demoness like you will feel shy!” Qing Shui smiled. He was really enjoying this moment of silence.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You are a naughty bastard……” Huoyun Liu-Li pushed away Qing Shui. After saying this in annoyance, she ran away.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sister, let me accompany him to go there. This way, at least I will be able to give him a hand while he is in Central Continent.” Di Qing explained to Di Chen.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Chen looked at Qing Shui who was in front of him. For a moment, she had a complicated feeling. It had been quite a few years since she knew him. Perhaps, the unique feeling they got when they met each other for the first time was still lingering. Slowly, she began to realize that it wasn’t such a bad thing to have a man around.</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 554 - Body Securing Talisman, Qing Shui’s Diamond Protection! Ready to leave!</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hahaha……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A loud and bright voice rang. It sounded really insane. There was a joyful and emotional tinge that could not be expressed with words alone.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Elder Ge, congratulations!” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Elder Ge stopped. After that, he looked towards Qing Shui and said seriously: “Qing Shui, you were the one who returned my everything. From now onwards, I am going to dedicate my life to you.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Elder Ge, you are being too courteous. The Heavenly Palace is blessed to have you around.” Qing Shui responded hurriedly. Elder Ge’s words still made Qing Shui feel really happy because this way, he would be able to entrust Heavenly Palace and the Qing Clan to him while he was away.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I am already an old man. Whatever I say are facts and truths.” Elder Ge said in a serious manner. He sounded really firm and steady when he said it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Elder Ge, since that’s the case, then I’ll just be frank with you.” Qing Shui said with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, tell me, I have mentioned it before, even if it would cost me my life, I wouldn’t frown.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Actually, Qing Shui really enjoyed being associated with this kind of hot-blooded man. He looked at Elder Ge and smiled: “I hope that you can take over the Heavenly Palace.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What’s wrong? Could it be that you want to leave?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The experienced old man was immediately able to figure out Qing Shui’s intention.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I might be away for quite a while, but there has to be someone to look after Heavenly Palace in the meantime.” Qing Shui really wanted to give the position of the Heavenly Palace’s Old Ancestor to Elder Ge. At present, with Elder Ge’s strength, taking charge of Heavenly Palace was a piece of cake. In fact, he would be the most suitable to do it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After pondering for a while, Elder Ge said slowly: “I can help you look after the Heavenly Palace, but the Patriarch of the Heavenly Palace still has to be you.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This turn of events didn’t really surprise Qing Shui. Qing Shui also stopped forcing him: “Elder Ge, alright, then in regards to the Qing Clan, I really hope that you can look after them for me.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Don’t worry, even if you didn’t tell me, I will still do that. As long as I’m here, you don’t need to worry.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He gave Elder Ge some of the things from his Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, for example, the Great Revitalizing Pill. They were just the usual medicinal pills. This way, Elder Ge would be able to increase his strength quite significantly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, have you decided on when to leave yet?” Elder Ge asked Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I will definitely leave but I am not sure when yet. When I leave, it would be for at least half a month and up to about half a year.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Are you leaving alone or with other people?” Elder Ge responded after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“For now, I’m still not sure. But I plan to go alone.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Are you going to Central Continent?” Elder Ge asked after he saw Qing Shui knit his brows.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I do plan on going to Central Continent!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Central Continent may be the most advanced continent in the World of the Nine Continent, but it’s also one of the most chaotic ones. It had lots of aristocratic clans and sects jumbled up together. Not to mention that most of them are formidable clans and sects. In short, there were a lot of formidable experts. If one were to go to Central Continent, they will have to be really cautious.” As Elder Ge said these words, his brows that were knitted previously slowly spread out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Elder Ge, would the Di Clan and the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord be considered strong in Central Continent?” Qing Shui remembered the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. He was thinking if he would get attacked by the Di Clan if he were to go against the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hehe, Di Clan and Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord were only barely considered as aristocratic clans in Central Continent. There were a lot of clans stronger than them. The water in Central Continent really runs deep. The number of Martial Saint Grade warriors were almost equal to the amount of Peak Martial King Grade Warriors in the Green Cloud Continent. The difference between each grade in the Martial Saint Realm is also really significant.” Elder Ge looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Thank you Elder Ge, I understand now.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui left the rear of the mountain with complicated feelings. The Central Continent was a place that he had always wanted to go. But for now, what could he do even if he went there? Expanding his horizon….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Going to the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord with his current strength was suicide. For a moment, Qing Shui felt really upset. After two years, he still hadn’t managed to break through to the Sixth Heavenly Layer. This made Qing Shui feel really helpless. Even though this result was within expectations, he still felt incomparably depressed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">By the time he returned to Qing Clan which was located in the Continent’s Capital, the sky was already getting dark. At present, Qing Clan could finally be considered to be on track. In terms of the financing their business, Qing Shui could supply them with the money. Additionally, they were also under the protections of a few aristocratic clans, thus things were going smoother than expected.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At present, other than the helpers which Qing Clan got, there weren’t many people left in Qing Clan. Since they didn’t really go out much, they’re slowly getting adapted to this new lifestyle and business.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The family had their meal together happily. After that, Qing Shui left.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui cultivated madly. His current bottleneck made him feel irritated and troubled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The more impatient one felt, the harder it would be for them to achieve their goals. Since Qing Shui felt that he had no other options, he stopped cultivating. He planned to go to the Central Continent right after he broke through to the Sixth Heavenly Layer. At least it would be safer this way. After that, he planned to build up some reputation there and look for an opportunity to destroy the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“They are so arrogant just because they are powerful? There are consequences for being arrogant.” Everytime Qing Shui thought about the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, he would feel his blood burning with anger.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He took up the Golden Calligraphy Brush and randomly drew across the Beast Parchment. Compared to the previous Heavenly Talismans, it looked a bit simple and unadorned, yet it was natural and smooth. The drawing on the talisman was like a gigantic beast being captured by a net. No matter how much it struggled or howled, it was unable to leave the spot.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A bright halo rose up!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Body Securing Talisman!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was Qing Shui’s biggest achievement during these past two years. He finally succeeded in drawing the Body Securing Talisman. Previously, he thought that he would be able to do it within three months, but then things got tougher and tougher as he went on. Simultaneously, he was also finally able to understand the difficulty about Talisman Drawing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The time and energy that he consumed were really terrifying. He finally understood the reason why Lin Zhanhan only managed to reach the level he was currently at and why he was unable to draw the Body Securing Talismans.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Simultaneously, he had also found out about the Five Elements Talisman. Even with the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui could still feel his scalp go numb. How long would it take to draw a talisman, ten years? How long would that be without the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Basically, the people who were able to draw Five Elements Talisman could already be considered geniuses. At least they were geniuses at Talisman Drawings. Without the talent, they would then need a lot of treasures like the Spirit Concentrating Pill, high level Spirit Concentrating Split, the high leveled Spirit Concentrating Pill and even the legendary Holy Bracelet for the Talisman Drawings, making it really tough to actually advance further.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that he still had a bit of talent in Talisman Drawings. In addition , he had the most heaven defying treasure, the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. It was a treasure even more insane than the Holy bracelet.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tiger Form!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Tiger Form which had surpassed the Great Perfection stage made Qing Shui feel a lot more confident. Two years ago, he accidentally broke past the curse of the rotten and withered Tiger Form and opened an even wider world across the heavens and the earth.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was not like he didn’t gain anything throughout these two years. The biggest prize he received was the Elephant Form, There was no change in the Diamond Qi, but Qing Shui managed to learn the Elephant Form’s Diamond Protection.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At present, it was similarly in the Great Perfection Stage. After revolving it, Qing Shui could strengthen his physical defense by five folds. This made Qing Shui wonder if the Elephant Form Battle Skills were exactly the same as those that the Diamond Gigantic Elephant had.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There weren’t many changes to the Mighty Elephant Stomp either. Nor were there any changes to the Fire Bird and the Diamond Gigantic Elephant themselves. However, their future increases in strength was still something to look forward to.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though Qing Shui didn’t advance into the Sixth Heavenly Layers in these two years, he still managed to cultivate the Elephant Form Diamond Protection. Furthermore, he also cultivated it all the way to the Great Perfection Stage. Just through this, Qing Shui’s actual combat strength had already increased significantly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was panicked about whether he should go alone to Central Continent or bring someone along to accompany him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was to the point that even Qing Shui didn’t know what to do. How could he bring anyone along? His current strength absolutely wouldn’t allow him to bring anyone along, If he were to run into members from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord in the Green Cloud Continent, they would definitely end up fighting.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange and Luan Luan stayed over at either the Heavenly Palace or the Qing Clan. In any case, it didn’t really matter whether they cultivated in the Heavenly Palace or not. Hence, Qing Shui never thought of taking them along before.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li’s strength was still a bit low. Naturally, Canghai Mingyue would stay behind because of Huoyun Liu-Li. He predicted that Wenren Wushuang wouldn’t follow him even if he were to ask her to.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Additionally, at the moment, Qing Shui really wasn’t powerful enough to take her along. Fifth Martial King Grade might be considered good in Green Cloud Continent, but he still lacked the strength to even protect himself if he was up against the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Di Chen and Di Qing might not have problems if they went to Central Continent. They were already members from Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord and Di Clan. But everything was different now. Hence, Qing Shui didn’t want to let them follow him to the Central Continent. At the very least, he didn’t hope for Di Chen to follow him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everything will turn out for the best. Qing Shui too didn’t want to keep mulling over it. Strength was the best insurance to everything. If he was strong enough, let alone taking one of them, it wouldn’t be a problem even if he were to bring along the entire Qing Clan and all of the girls.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the morning, Qing Shui had his morning practice at the Qing Clan’s backyard. He could see Wenren Wushuang standing alone under a willow tree by a pond, not so far away from him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the moment, Qing Shui was in Qing Clan’s residence. Other than Di Chen and Di Qing, the other girls had all been staying at Qing Clan. Therefore, Qing Shui could also help guide them in their cultivation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As Qing Shui looked at the faint figure not so far away from him. He felt his heart moved all of a sudden. It felt a bit painful. After walking two steps, Qing Shui noticed that the present Wushuang was a bit different compared to before.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He kept feeling a sense of familiarity…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In fact, they were supposed to be quite close to each other to begin with….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Wushuang!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui called out softly to Wenren Wushuang who was staring blankly into space.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was such a familiar feeling. Qing Shui’s eyes turned bright as he looked at her familiar expression. Suddenly, he pulled her towards him: “Wushuang, you have recovered your memories!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui agitatedly looked at Wenren Wushuang.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I can only remember you. But I am unable to remember any other stuffs. I remembered that you are Qing Shui, I remembered that you were really good to me. And also, for some unknown reasons, I have been feeling a kind of pain…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Wenren Wushuang continued to let Qing Shui pull her as he wished. Tears began dropping down her face. Her delicate face made people feel really sympathetic.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though she wasn’t able to remember anything else, she still managed to remember him. It might be because Qing Shui reminded her a bit of Wenren Wugou that she felt sad. Qing Shui embraced her and lightly patted her back.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Don’t be sad, this is your home. The people here are all your family. In the future, you will recall everything.” Qing Shui still felt really happy deep in his heart. After all, she could remember him and a bit of stuffs regarding their past. This was a good start. Perhaps, it wouldn’t be long until she restored all her memories.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, thank you!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui heard Wenren Wushuang’s words, he was stunned: “Why do you want to thank me?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I may be in this kind of condition, but you are still so good to me. Yet… I am still unable to figure out our relationship with each other……” Wenren Wushuang looked at Qing Shui seriously.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If I were to tell you that we are married couples, will you believe me?” After thinking for a while, Qing Shui asked.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After looking at Qing Shui, Wenren Wushuang shook her head.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Actually, we have already made a deal with each other before. In the future, you are going to marry me.” Qing Shui smiled and explained. He looked at the extremely beautiful woman in front of him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She was the kind of woman who was in between otherworldly, graceful and luxurious. She also exuded an aura which resembled that of an older sister in the household. She was an intractable beauty who was unmatched in her generation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Can you wait for me for a while……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sure, it didn’t matter how long, as long as you remember me. Even if you were to forget about me, I will still make you say that you want to marry me on your own.” Qing Shui softly knocked Wenren Wushuang’s forehead with his.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qingzhuang!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes, are you leaving again?” Shi Qingzhuang looked at Qing Shui and asked with a faint smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“How did you know?” Qing Shui looked a bit surprised as he asked.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Every time when you’re about to leave, you will have this expression on your face. Alright, just tell me what you feel like saying, everyone will support you.” Shi Qingzhuang looked at Qing Shui with an expression which looked like she was reluctant to part with him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qingzhuang, tell me, when will we be able to finish our marriage?” Qing Shui looked at Shi Qingzhuang and asked gently.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You wish! Who said that I’m going to marry you.” Shi Qingzhuang lowered her head slightly and said in a seemingly angry way.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You are already my woman. Furthermore, you are still my fiance. Who else will you marry other than me?” Qing Shui continued to embrace her waist as he smiled beside her ear.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“In any case, I won’t marry you……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, can you really not bring me along to Central Continent?” Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Shui and asked begrudgingly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li, wait for me for a while. Wait until I have settled down there, then I will come back to get you guys, ok? It will be very fast. For now, I really don’t have the ability to bring you along. You too know that things won’t be as peaceful when I go to Central Continent.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Then when you go there, how do you expect us to not be worried? Do you want to make all of us worried for you?” Huoyun Liu-Li pulled Qing Shui’s hand and asked with concern.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I still have a few ways of protecting myself! Don’t worry!” Qing Shui explained with a smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright, I understand now!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The two fell into a short moment of silence. It might be because they were aware that they would have to separate from each other soon.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes!” Qing Shui looked at the depressed Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hug me! I want you to hug me!” Huoyun Liu-Li lowered her head and said softly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly embraced her. He did it tightly like he was trying to envelop her completely. They hugged each other really closely.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Liu-Li!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes!” Huoyun Liu-Li closed her eyes. It looked like she had grown really attached to this moment.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Can you let me accompany you tonight?” Qing Shui was biting her sparkling and translucent earlobe.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li trembled slightly and buried her face into Qing Shui’s neck.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Is that ok? Liu-Li?” Qing Shui asked again gently. Huoyun Liu-Li blushed and felt really hot.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If you want to come… Who, who would be able to get in your way……” Huoyun Liu-Li said softly. She didn’t dare to raise her head.</p>
