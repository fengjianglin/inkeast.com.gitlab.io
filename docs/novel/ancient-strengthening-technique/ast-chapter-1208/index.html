 <p><strong>AST 1208 - The Eldest Princess’ letter, heading off to Heaven Secrets Academy after new year</strong></p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan was looking at Qing Shui who was looking back at her. Her face immediately blushed from shyness. She lowered her head slightly. Despite this, she felt really happy deep down.</p>
 <p>She had actually been feeling really conflicted, especially when they were in the five continents. Other than her, this man didn’t bring along anyone else to this place. At the time when he mentioned bringing her along, she was already aware of his motives. That touching moment remained fresh in her memories. Until now, she still remembered it clearly in her heart. All along, this man had always had her in his heart. It was because he was concerned for her that he had been working so hard all along.</p>
 <p>She noticed that she had started to change unwittingly, so much so that she had even begun to feel unfamiliar with herself. Back when she was in the five continents, regardless of what had happened, she never thought that she would progress till this step with Qing Shui. She kept on telling herself to forget about everything, so much so that she even had planned on disappearing from Qing Shui’s life.</p>
 <p>Perhaps this was destiny. Or it could also be considered an ill-fated relationship. Back then, he saved her life. Soon after, he then saved her entire clan. She no longer had to worry about her daughter nowadays and this was all because of him.</p>
 <p>Humans weren’t plants and could never be heartless. No matter what, if a man was willing to do so many things for her, it was impossible for her to not feel moved. Let alone comparing herself to the other women around him, she didn’t really hold any advantage.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, she noticed that she loved this man a lot. Unknowingly, she had been changed by this man. It was just like the awkward incident that happened previously, she realized that she could accept it. Furthermore, when she was with this man, they did a lot of embarrassing things. In the past, she never once thought she would be able to do all of those things. It was when they were together alone...</p>
 <p>As she thought about all of the embarrassing scenes, she would feel as if her blood within her body was boiling. Lifting her head to look at Qing Shui, Qing Shui smiled and dragged her into his room. It had been many days since he last felt the feeling of flesh. Furthermore, when he shared gazes with Yu Ruyan, her eyes looked really fiery and seemed like she was ruminating on something.</p>
 <p>“Ah!”</p>
 <p>After being pulled up by Qing Shui, She felt both shocked and shy and couldn’t help but let out a soft cry.</p>
 <p>“Absence makes the heart grow fonder, my wife has become shy.” Qing Shui quickly kissed Yu Ruyan’s mouth and smiled. He directly picked her up and rushed into their room rapidly.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan bashfully burrowed her head into Qing Shui’s chest.</p>
 <p>As soon as they entered the room, Qing Shui impatiently closed the door with his leg and immediately rushed towards the bedroom. Qing Shui pressed himself onto Yu Ruyan. That smooth sensation made him comfortable to the point that he let out a long breath.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, don’t rush…”</p>
 <p>Before Qing Shui managed to kiss her, Yu Ruyan raised her hand and pushed it against his chest.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Qing Shui asked Yu Ruyan while looking at her red face.</p>
 <p>“Do you think the same thing which happened last time would happen again?” Yu Ruyan asked softly.</p>
 <p>“I don’t think so. She went out,” Qing Shui looked at Yu Ruyan and said.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, why do you think such things happened?” Yu Ruyan looked at Qing Shui curiously. In fact, she had been feeling baffled regarding that incident. How did things turn out like that?</p>
 <p>“I’m not sure as well. Can we stop talking about it? Let’s have some fun first.” Qing Shui smiled and was about to lower his head.</p>
 <p>“But what happens if Sister Xuan sees it again?” Yu Ruyan was a bit worried.</p>
 <p>“She has already seen it twice. We have already been completely exposed. I’m not scared anymore. Worst comes to worst, I’ll just let her see all she wants.” Qing Shui once again lowered his head. When Yu Ruyan wanted to say something again, Qing Shui immediately blocked her mouth.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, their clothes were scattered around the room. Her perfect body was completely presented in front of Qing Shui. The sensations when their skin touched, the warmth of the body that could be felt through to the bones… It felt as if even the temperature in the room was increasing.</p>
 <p>This time, Yu Ruyan was unable to let herself loose completely. She was worried that history would repeat itself. She even demanded Qing Shui use the blanket to cover both of them up.</p>
 <p>As time went on, the blanket covering their bodies slowly fell off. Unknowingly, the two had already changed a few different positions. Yu Ruyan also seemed like she had forgotten about her previous concerns. It has always been said that when one was thirty, they were like wolves whereas when one was forty, they were like tigers. He should already be at the age where he was like a wolf in comparison to his previous incarnation.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan was laying by her side while Qing Shui laid behind her, his stomach stuck tightly against her pale butt. That well-rounded butt of hers wiggled slightly every time Qing Shui bumped against it. The splendid feeling and visual impact made Qing Shui feel as if his spirit was floating.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had never been able to comprehend how Yu Ruyan’s breasts could still look so perfect even when she had such an old daughter. The two spots on top of them were still pink. They even managed to maintain the same look even after they became erect. Even with Qing Shui’s knowledge from his previous incarnation, he was unable to understand it.</p>
 <p>Could it have something to do with the Divine Bodies of the women from the Portraits of Beauty?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t think much about this. The fact that he could marry Mingyue Gelou already meant that he didn’t mind whether they were virgins. Even though men said that they didn’t care about it, it was just empty talk. However, he could only blame himself for meeting her late. The fact that they were able to meet was already good fortune the heavens had blessed him with.</p>
 <p>They moved unhurriedly. Yu Ruyan had already lost count of the number of times she had soared up high into the clouds. Qing Shui himself had soared up once midway. But he couldn’t resist his even stronger craving for her body. Only by doing it slowly for many hours would they feel incomparably satisfied.</p>
 <p>Both Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan laid down by their side, facing each other while their bodies still joined. Looking at her firm breasts and the two bulging pink spots on top of them that were soft and firm, plumped and upright, Qing Shui bent down slightly and sucked on them while using his hand to massage and play with the other.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan’s beautiful pupils squinted as she made slight gasping noises, wrapping her hands Qing Shui’s head.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>It was only until the sky was almost dark that the two put their clothes back on and came out. Not long after, Tantai Xuan came back. She was shocked when she saw Yu Ruyan’s beautiful face and proceeded to say, “Sister Ruyan, you look so beautiful now. Indeed, it’s great to have a guy pamper you.”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, Qing Shui happened to walk out of the kitchen. He heard what Tantai Xuan said and was immediately stunned. Upon seeing Qing Shui, Tantai Xuan felt so embarrassed she couldn’t even show her face. Normally when she was alone with Yu Ruyan, she would joke with her and tease her. She had never expected Qing Shui to hear her. This caused her, a virgin who had no prior experience, to feel so ashamed she wanted to look for a hole and hide in it.</p>
 <p>“Miss Tantai, it’s very easy for you to find a man to pamper you. What do you think about me? I have a nice body and I am good at warming the bed.” Qing Shui said while holding the food.</p>
 <p>Even he himself didn’t know why he said that. Perhaps it was because he heard what she said previously.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan remained silent. Yu Ruyan on the other hand got annoyed with Qing Shui. Qing Shui left quickly and conveniently asked the little girl to come down to eat.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui left.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan looked depressingly at Yu Ruyan, “He heard me, this is so upsetting.”</p>
 <p>“Alright, let’s stop talking about him,” Yu Ruyan said, somewhat embarrassed.</p>
 <p>“Sister Ruyan, you look really beautiful…”</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan was a bit speechless.</p>
 <p>Soon after, the little girl and Qing Shui came down. Qing Shui also wanted to let the girl interact with others. The atmosphere throughout the entire dinner didn’t really go so well. The girl almost didn’t say anything, neither did Tantai Xuan. Yu Ruyan and Qing Shui on the other hand, talked casually.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I am going back to my room with Sister Xuan.” Yu Ruyan said after cleaning up the things on the table with Tantai Xuan.</p>
 <p>“You are my wife. It’s very rare that we get to be together.” Qing Shui said bluntly.</p>
 <p>“Ah, haven’t you guys already…” Tantai Xuan got worried. Luckily, she didn’t finish her sentence.</p>
 <p>“You are a rascal! A bad person!” Tantai Xuan ran away.</p>
 <p>“I am going to sleep too.” The little girl said before leaving.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan looked at Qing Shui speechless. Soon after, she said, “I am going to look for Sister Xuan. She seemed mad.”</p>
 <p>“That’s good too, remember to come back. If you don’t, I will assume that you had come specifically to look for me for that. Hehe. I will only hug you to sleep at night and guarantee we won’t do anything else.”</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan scoffed lightly and immediately went after Tantai Xuan.</p>
 <p>“Sister Xuan, don’t be angry. He is like that.” Yu Ruyan grabbed Tantai Xuan and walked to their room together.</p>
 <p>“Why would I be mad? He really loves you. Sister Ruyan, you have to cherish him.” Tantai Xuan smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“Sister Xuan, do you like him?” Yu Ruyan asked all of a sudden.</p>
 <p>“Ah? No! How is that possible? He likes so many women, why would I like him? I am not as kind as Sister Ruyan.” Tantai Xuan responded in shock.</p>
 <p>Both Yu Ruyan and Tantai Xuan had been together for a long time. Normally, Tantai Xuan wouldn’t even talk to men. It was also because of this that Yu Ruyan felt that Tantai Xuan was closer to Qing Shui than she was with other men.</p>
 <p>That was why she asked that question.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan smiled and stopped talking.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The next day, Qing Shui brought the two women and the little girl out to stroll around nearby and buy some stuff in passing. Luckily, the world was large enough. They had sufficient places to visit. Besides, there weren’t much entertainment around.</p>
 <p>Since the two girls visited, Qing Shui was able to save his time to go and look for them. After all, if he was heading to Heaven Secrets Academy, he should at least meet them before that.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>In a flash, another two months passed. It was near the end of the year. Even after these two months, Qing Shui’s Seal of Roc was still at its small success stage. However, his raw strength has gone up to forty nimbus.</p>
 <p>The Seven-seven Divine Nebula Formation was still stuck at the Seven-seven Divine Nebula stage. But now, the amount of stars that could be rearranged had increased to sixty stars.</p>
 <p>It was on this day that Qing Shui received a letter.</p>
 <p>It was sent by the Eldest Princess. It was a letter for him to head to Heaven Secrets Academy. With the letter, he would be permitted to enter the Heaven Secrets Academy.</p>
 <p>It was almost new year. After that, he would finally be able to head there. Deep down, Qing Shui felt happy. He was finally able to go to Heaven Secrets Academy. This would be one of the most important platforms in his life. Through it, he would be able to see an even broader world.</p>
 <p>This was his first new year since arriving in the four continents. However, Yu Ruyan and Tantai Xuan didn’t come over. It might have been because they knew that Qing Shui would be leaving after new year.</p>
 <p>During the new year, Yan Yangchi and the others accompanied Qing Shui at the Firecloud Blacksmith Store. Both the Seventh Princess and Yan Jinyu were also there. They would be heading to the Heaven Secrets Academy together with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>He was going to have to temporarily put aside the things here. His blacksmith store would also be closed for a while. Qing Shui was preparing all of the things necessary for living in Heaven Secrets Academy in the future. Actually, he found out that the regulations within Heaven Secrets Academy were very lax through the girls. They could even leave for half a year. It was fine as long as they went back once a year to report.</p>
 <p>It was also because of this that Qing Shui joined Heaven Secrets Academy solely for the title. He could soon say that he was from the Heaven Secrets Academy. With this halo, he would be able to go to the Divine Might Dynasty to inquire about Di Chen.</p>
 <p>“Chen`Er, wait for me. I will be able to see you very soon.” Qing Shui held the letter and said to himself.</p>
