Back then, her life was saved by this man, and until now, he was the person keeping her alive. If, in the end, he really ended up using that kind of method to save her as a last resort, what should she do?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whenever she started thinking about this, she would blush and her heart would start racing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was confused when he saw the fluctuation in Shen Huang’s emotions. He opened his eyes and questioned Shen Huang, “What’s wrong? Are you feeling uncomfortable?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he was speaking, he quickly embraced her, but then he noticed that her body wasn’t cold and thus, he moved on to feel her pulse instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Qing Shui’s concerned look, Shen Huang felt a sense of warmth in her heart. It felt good to have a man who cared for her and was willing to protect her. She smiled gently to reply, “I am fine. Do you really like using that kind of method to save me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s hands shook. He looked at the beautiful and alluring woman, and immediately let his hand go and put it on her beautiful forehead, “No, you are perfectly fine!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!” Shen Huang instinctively pushed Qing Shui’s chest away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From this push, Qing Shui could already tell that she was fine. He was just joking and thus, he went with the flow and dropped down. Shen Huang also never expected him to do so and fell along with him. With that happening, Shen Huang was now on top of Qing Shui. Most importantly, her mouth happened to have landed right on Qing Shui’s lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Quiet, the entire place became dead silent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could a man possibly endure this kind of stimulation? Qing Shui immediately embraced Shen Huang’s slender waist, but he stopped moving after that. It was due to the myriad of thoughts that crossed his mind in that instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Initially, Shen Huang had wanted to stand up and leave, but, as if the demons and gods were at work, she suddenly remembered that she had not much longer to live and she didn't leave anything behind in her lifetime. She had never liked a man, given birth to any children; she hadn’t even held a man’s hand before, let alone kiss one…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, she didn’t move. Maybe he was the man whom gods had bestowed her before dying. At least this way, she would be able to experience the love a woman could have. Thinking about this, she blushed once again and slowly shut her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was dumbfounded. He knew what it meant for this woman to shut her eyes at a time like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was gently sucking on the lips that looked like flower petals. The refreshing and mild sensation helped Qing Shui’s mind to become clear like never before. While in his arms, the woman continuously twisted her body, her heart racing along with it. This was her first time having such close interactions with a man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui gently moved his hands on her back, letting her heart to rest down a little. The technique, which he was using to do that, was precisely the Soul Charming Soft-Tendon Hand Technique. What Qing Shui never expected was for this woman to be so sensitive. It had only been a moment since Qing Shui sucked on her pastel pink lips and immediately, he could already feel her unsettling breaths from her nose. Her body was also trembling faster and faster and eventually, her body twisted slightly and she moved on to hug Qing Shui tightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment, Shen Huang was laying down in Qing Shui’s arms like water. Even though the unsettling breath and beautiful moans from before sounded soft, they were made just right beside Qing Shui’s ear. Qing Shui had a feeling that he was in a dream, whereas Shen Huang felt as if she were stuck in the mists of clouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang didn’t dare lift up her head. She stayed in Qing Shui’s arms and refused to stand up. She had never felt this kind of things before. Could it be something which she would only feel by staying together with a man?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, Qing Shui didn’t know how he should express himself. This woman was already satisfied merely with Qing Shui touching her well-rounded buttocks and unleashing his Soul Charming Hands twice. It seemed that she might be too sensitive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eldest Mistress!” Qing Shui patted her back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hm!” Shen Huang made a soft noise with her nose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seems that you may be feeling shy. Here, let me take a look at how our Eldest Mistress is right now,” said Qing Shui, having a gentle smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No!” Shen Huang grunted with a soft cold voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had a way. For the time being, the woman was on top of him. Thus, he immediately rotated around and became the one pressing on her instead. Shen Huang was shocked. Looking at the beautiful face which might potentially lead to a country’s destruction, Qing Shui noticed that she had had her eyes closed. Despite that, Qing Shui still felt like he had difficulties in trying to control his desires.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pure and clean, but yet alluring. Qing Shui was unable to resist her beautiful face and gracefulness. Even when she was laying down on the ground, her well-rounded breasts still looked firm and upright as usual. When Qing Shui was pressing on her body, he could feel the shockingly spongy sensations from them very clearly. He was unable to describe how stirred up his heart was at that moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang slightly opened her eyes. She had never thought that there would come a day when someone would press on her like that, nor had she ever thought that a man would touch her body up to this extent. Nevertheless, it was a beautiful phenomenon. Her only problem now was that she was feeling uncomfortable in her clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, let me go and change into a new set of clothes.” Shen Huang said in a shy tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui grinned like a perverted old man as he thought about it, “Can you please tell me how you felt before? If not, I won’t get up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, don’t be like this, it’s too soon…” Shen Huang’s voice became even softer now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui came down from atop of her body and supported her up so she could sit up straight, “Go, leave this place under my supervision.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time Shen Huang came back out again, she was already recovered, so much so that Qing Shui began suspecting if the woman with a sweet and delicate voice, the woman, who was continuously contorting her body in his arms, was her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was smiling sweetly at Qing Shui and said, “What’s wrong?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled. He knew that Shen Huang wasn't able to accept these sudden yet intimate actions. Before this, he even nodded his head. But with things taking such a turn, Qing Shui, too, didn’t know how he should continue this relationship. His mindset remained the same, he wouldn’t be persistent with it, nor would he avoid it. So long as a person lived in this world, they mustn’t do things which they would regret about later on in life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go to the front and eat something before we continue through our journey.” Qing Shui extended his hand to Shen Huang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang calmly reached out to him. They held hands as they made their way forward. Walking in a world of flowers was also an enjoyable thing to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, knowing about my stuff now won’t do you any good. When the time comes, I will tell you naturally. If in the worst case scenario, I am really unable to escape from this calamity, it will be better off if you never find out about it. By then, there would have been no point in you knowing about it either.” Shen Huang whispered to Qing Shui in her soft voice.</span></p>

You can believe me when I say that you won’t die.” Qing Shui also responded in a soft voice.</span></p>

There was a point when he used to think that he could treat all diseases and neutralize all kinds of poisons. But as if something so bizarre could possibly happen in this world, the viruses in Shen Huang’s body were already a good example of a disease which he couldn’t heal even with his current strength and Divine Force. If he had been a bit stronger, it may have been possible that he wouldn’t have needed the Blaze Moth.</span></p>

Would you like to discuss them with me?” Shen Huang asked in a curious tone, looking at Qing Shui gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was surprised to hear that. The Shen Huang whom he knew would never try to get information about someone like this. It seemed that now, he had earned himself quite a decent position in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, I don’t really have a specific goal. I never thought about conquering the entire World of the Nine Continents, nor have I desired to establish a huge sect strong enough to control billions of people. My only wish is to stay by my family’s side. However, some of my wives still have things which they need to settle; thus, I need to help them. Also, those things aren’t things which can be done so easily. Even if I am the Golden Battle God Inheritor, many things are beyond my control. In fact, I am even starting to feel that I am no longer in command of myself.” Qing Shui looked emotional while explaining about some of his dilemmas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Isn’t that how humans are supposed to be? Some people live on for the mission they are given, while some live just for the purpose of vengeance. It’s precisely because of this that people start losing sight when they have completed their tasks successfully, avenging the people whom they cared about. They would soon begin to lose direction, not knowing how to live the rest of their lives.” Shen Huang looked like she was deep in thoughts as she was saying it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Between those two options, Qing Shui wasn’t sure what Shen Huang's current purpose for living was. Could it be that she had completed her mission or her desire for vengeance had disappeared?</span></p>
