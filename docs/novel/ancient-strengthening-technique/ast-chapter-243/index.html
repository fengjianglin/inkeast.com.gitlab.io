  <p><strong>AST 243 – Miraculous flowers under Heavens, absolute treasure – the Flower of Life!</strong></p>
  <p>Flower of Life!</p>
  <p>When Qing Shui saw the three words, he was stunned for a moment. This was not the first time he heard of this ingredient. The material on the top of the recipe to concoct the Large Revitalizing Pellet was none other than the Flower of Life!</p>
  <p>Indescribable emotions ran through his heart. Initially, the ingredients needed to concoct the Large Revitalizing Pellet gave him a headache. Both the Flowers of Life and the Phoenix Tail caused him to be helpless. Who would have thought that it was so simple for him to get ahold of the Flower of Life.</p>
  <p>Recipe of the Large Revitalizing Pellet: Flower of Life, 1000 year Deer Antler, blooded tea leaves, blood from the 1,000 year clam, blood from a 5,000 year old turtle, 1000 year Tiger Bone Powder, Phoenix Tail, Energy Enhancing Fruits, Agility Enhancing Fruits, Endurance Enhancing Fruits, Physique Enhancing Fruits, Datura, and 1,000 year blood coral!</p>
  <p>Currently, he already had the Flowers of Life. He already had some of the 1,000 year Deer Antlers thanks to Baili Jingwei. There was no need to say anything else regarding blood from the 1,000 year old clam and 5,000 year old turtle as well as the various fruits. 1,000 year Tiger Bone Powder could be found in auctions and the blooded tea leaves could be found in several places in this world of the nine continents. Although one must expend effort to search, it was still possible to obtain some. </p>
  <p>For Datura, it was somewhat troublesome. He had never heard of its existence within the Greencloud Continent. Not only that, Qing Shui also had never heard of any 1,000 year blood coral before.</p>
  <p>Despite so, the most troublesome thing was still the tail of a phoenix!</p>
  <p>Many thoughts flashed through his brain the moment he saw the Flowers of Life. Qing Shui hurriedly turned his attention back to the stone steele, as he wanted to know what the other effects of the Flower of Life were.</p>
  <p>Flowers of Life had overbrimming vitality, and was a miraculous flower underneath the Heavens. Just a single flower would be able to ‘boost’ the vitality of plant life in a radius of 100 metres and could also raise the grade of the plants’ qualities by 10%.<br></p>
  <p>10% increment in quality roughly converted to a year’s worth of maturation. For a 1,000 year old plant, a 10% increment meant a conversion of 100 years of maturation!</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The 2nd blossoming of the Flower of Life would enable plant life within 200m to gain an increment of 10% vitality and quality…</p>
  <p>The 5th blossoming of the Flower of Life would enable plant life within 500m to gain an increment of 10% vitality and quality…</p>
  <p>The 6th blossoming of the Flower of Life would enable plant life within 600m to gain an increment of 20% vitality and quality. 7th blossoming ? 30% vitality and quality.</p>
  <p>The 8th blossoming of the Flower of Life would enable plant life within 800m to gain an increment of 40% vitality and quality. 9th blossoming ? 50% vitality and 50% quality.</p>
  <p>The 10th blossoming of the Flower of Life would enable plant life within 2,000m to gain an increment of 100% vitality and quality!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was thunderstruck when he read the description on the stone steele. If the Flowers of Life blossomed for the 10th time, all his herbs’ maturation rates would be halved! 500 years was enough to grow herbs of 1,000 years. Qing Shui continued reading, wanting to find out the time it took for the flowers to blossom.</p>
  <p>“Flowers of Life are also known as the Flowers of Eternity. The petals shall never wither away. The 1st blossoming requires 100 years, 2nd blossoming requires 200 years……..”</p>
  <p>The 9th blossoming requires 900 years!</p>
  <p>The 10th blossoming requires 2,000 years!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui stood there dumbly. “Damn it,” he cursed. A total of 6,500 years was needed for the 10th blossoming.</p>
  <p>6,500 years! Upon seeing this figure, Qing Shui felt his scalp turn numb. This meant that he required 65 years in the outside world before the 10th blossoming would occur. But to him who had a lifespan of 500 years, 65 years could still be accepted.</p>
  <p>The Flowers of Life was could be used as an alchemy component. For flowers of the 1st blossoming, it could replace almost any other ingredient aged 1,000 years and below. If directly consumed, the flower would increase the lifespan of humans by 10 years. Flowers of the 2nd blossoming ? same replacement effect, increment of lifespan by 20 years. Flowers of 3rd blossoming ? replacement for ingredients aged 2,000 years and below, increment of lifespan by 30 years. Flowers of the 4th blossoming?replacement for ingredients aged 3,000 years and below, increment of lifespan by 40 years…….</p>
  <p>Flowers of the 8th blossoming ? replacement for ingredients aged 8,000 years and below, increment of lifespan by 90 years!</p>
  <p>Flowers of the 10th blossoming ? replacement for ingredients aged 10,000 years and below, and increment of lifespan by 200 years!</p>
  <p>Regardless of the number of blossomings, there was a consumption limit of one flower per person.</p>
  <p>Only after the 1st blossoming would the 2nd blossoming happen. One could pick the flowers anytime, but the time it took to regrow them corresponded with the age of the flowers. For example, if one plucked three flowers, one would need to wait for all three flowers to be regrown before the 4th flower would blossom. Thus, if one chose to pluck off flowers of the earlier blossomings, it was almost impossible for the Flowers of Life to mature to the 10th blossoming.</p>
  <p>“What a miraculous flower, how perverse. If it’s not for the time-dilation effects of the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, all of this would be totally impossible.”</p>
  <p>Thinking of Qing Yi, Qing Shui decided that in the future, he would leave the flowers of the 10th blossoming behind. By that time, Qing Yi would already be over 100 years old, and could consume the Flower of Life (10th blossoming) to increase her lifespan. What a pity that there was a consumption limit of one flower per person!</p>
  <p>Abruptly, Qing Shui thought of that night when he had the dream with Qinghan Ye. </p>
  <p>After contemplating for awhile, Qing Shui still couldn’t understand. Was there any relation between that and the leveling up of the Violet Jade Immortal Realm? With the Yinyang pendant, as well as the purple speck of sand within his brows, Qing Shui felt strongly that both of them were connected somehow. Solitary Yang did not lead to birth while Lone Yin did not allow growth. Could this be a result of Yin-Yang fusion?</p>
  <p>Unexpected surprises were always the most joyful. Currently, he was a step closer to concocting the Large Revitalizing Pill and could already see the light at the end of the tunnel. Making the best use of his time, he decided that he should spend some time on accumulating experience for his alchemy as well.</p>
  <p>He had already practiced the Ancient Strengthening Technique to the 89th cycle of circulated Qi. Qing Shui knew that it was going to be tremendously difficult to break through to the 90th cycle. The final cycle prior to a breakthrough would always be the greatest barrier. After which, he practiced his sword techniques and forging methods, seeking to increase his personal strength with the shortest amount of time possible. Qing Shui knew that the time to go to the Yan Clan was approaching. Since he had promised Qing Yi, he would definitely have to keep the promise. It would be excellent if he managed to forge a piece of a godly weapon. It would surely aid him when he goes to the Yan Clan.</p>
  <p>———————</p>
  <p>During the 2nd day, Qing Shui went to his blacksmith store and placed two more of the jagged swords onto the shelf. Next to the price tag of five million taels of silver, there were additional words saying that items of equivalent value could be used for exchange.</p>
  <p>Huyou was still practicing his Tiger Form’s Qi circulation method at the back of the small courtyard. Qing Shui was very happy that Huyou was a determined man, filled with perseverance. He wasn’t afraid of how tough the road ahead was, and would relentlessly forge ahead even if it meant being able to achieve his goals.</p>
  <p>Nowadays, the moment the blacksmith store opened its door for business, customers would flood in. There were shouts of excitement, as well as sounds of derision, sighs, and contempt.</p>

 <p>During the 2nd day, Qing Shui went to his blacksmith store and placed two more of the jagged swords onto the shelf. Next to the price tag of five million taels of silver, there were additional words saying that items of equivalent value could be used for exchange.</p>
 <p>Huyou was still practicing his Tiger Form’s Qi circulation method at the back of the small courtyard. Qing Shui was very happy that Huyou was a determined man, filled with perseverance. He wasn’t afraid of how tough the road ahead was, and would relentlessly forge ahead even if it meant being able to achieve his goals.</p>
 <p>Nowadays, the moment the blacksmith store opened its door for business, customers would flood in. There were shouts of excitement, as well as sounds of derision, sighs, and contempt.</p>
