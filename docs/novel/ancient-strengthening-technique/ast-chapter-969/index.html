 <p><strong>AST 969 - It’s Good To Be Home, Daughter Qing Yu</strong></p>
 <p>“Haha. Actually, I know of an especially safe route. It’s further away but very safe.” Di Qing smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui still frowned slightly. “You’re too daring. Aren’t you afraid that some powerful demonic beast might appear?”</p>
 <p>“I still have a few tricks up my sleeves and will be able to save myself even if I were to encounter danger.” Di Qing smiled and took out a porcelain bottle then shook it.</p>
 <p>“This is?” Qing Shui didn’t understand what this porcelain bottle could do if she were to encounter some powerful demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>“This is Beast Terrorizing Powder. When one comes across a powerful demonic beast, one would just need to apply a little of this on one’s ride. It releases a powerful aura and most ferocious beasts with limited strength would choose to run away. However, there’s a time restriction to this effect.” Di Qing smiled and passed the porcelain bottle to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took it and opened the cap. He could smell an agitating and strong scent. It wasn’t smelly but it was definitely not a pleasant smell.Qing Shui suddenly smiled.</p>
 <p>“Do you know what’s in this thing?” Qing Shui looked at Di Qing teasingly.</p>
 <p>“I don’t. I bought this item at an auctioned and it wasn’t cheap. I’m only left with this little bit now.” Di Qing looked at Qing Shui and said, not understanding the reason behind that smile.</p>
 <p>“Do you want to know? I’m able to refine it as long as I have the ingredients.” Qing Shui handed the bottle back to Di Qing.</p>
 <p>"Tell me!” Di Qing appeared to be very interested.</p>
 <p>“It’s actually very simple. This kind of medicine is separated into different grades. For example, the one that you have is made from the bone powder, blood, feces, muscles, and the life essence of Peak Martial Saint level demonic beasts.” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p>“Ew! That’s disgusting!” Di Qing let out a cry and tossed the porcelain bottle towards Qing Shui as if it was some venomous bug.</p>
 <p>“You don’t need to have such a big reaction. Actually, these things aren’t dirty. All of them are actually treasures.” Qing Shui caught the bottle.</p>
 <p>“You shouldn’t have told me anything about it then. I feel uncomfortable with just the thought that the stuff I’m carrying is made from those things.” Di Qing pouted.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was amused by her reaction. It was usually hard to come across such a cute action from a lady like Di Qing. This was also the first time that he had seen her behaving like this since they were lovers now.</p>
 <p>This was her way of acting spoilt. Qing Shuo thought of Hai Dongqing and what she had said before. Although girls would usually act spoilt, she didn’t have a person to act spoilt to. However, now she did. At least for that few days, she had behaved like a docile lady before him…</p>
 <p>He couldn't help but think of Lady Duanmu at this moment. When he first went to Duanmu City there was still Jin Clan but he wasn't sure how it was right now. Qing Shui thought that Lady Duanmu must be really tired. Although he was tired, he still had his mother and children. Whenever he thought of home, he would feel very warm inside and all the hard work he had put in felt worth it. For Lady Duanmu, Duanmu Lingshuang must have been her support.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, you must be happy to be reaching home soon!" Di Qing looked at Qing Shui’s happy expression and said with a grin.</p>
 <p>"Yes I am!"</p>
 <p>After half a day, the Fire Bird entered Greencloud Continent.</p>
 <p>The Heavenly Palace was on the east of Greencloud Continent and thus it didn't take too long to arrive there. After two hours, Qing Shui's Fire Bird stopped at the foot of Heavenly Palace Mountain. Although he was very anxious, he didn't directly fly to the peak. It wasn't because he couldn't but because he chose not to do so.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Di Qing walked up the stone steps and when the disciples of Heavenly Palace saw Qing Shui, they all greeted him respectfully.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and nodded while Di Qing smiled besides him. Each time they came across such a scene, she would always find it funny for such a young man to be called a Patriarch.</p>
 <p>Very soon, they arrived at the location of Qing Clan. Thankfully, on their way here, they didn't come across anyone who would stop Qing Shui in his tracks.</p>
 <p>He just got to the entrance when an exquisite looking young lass came out. She was just like a beautifully carved piece of jade, wearing pink colored clothes and she had a high braid. She was only slightly over two years old and when her big eyes landed on Qing Shui, she was also stunned.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was even more stunned. When did this little kid come to his family? It's been three years and his children should be about five or seven years old respectively. However, he felt that this lass was related to him because she looked a little like him and there was a hint of familiarity.</p>
 <p>The lass' bright eyes had a hint of playfulness to them. At that moment, another person walked out, her voice arriving before herself.</p>
 <p>"Lass, slow down a little..." However, she suddenly saw Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui now understood. During the period he was gone, he had another child, and she was already at the age at which she could run...</p>
 <p>"Mother!"</p>
 <p>Seeing Huoyun Liu-Li, the lass immediately ran over and pounced into her arms.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li carried the lass and walked over with great surprise. Di Qing looked at the lass, then looked back at Qing Shui and smiled. She then walked over and said, "Liu-Li, your daughter is already so old now. Seems like this father doesn't even know."</p>
 <p>"Liu-Li!" Qing Shui was also very happy. He walked over and took up one of Huoyun Liu-Li's hand while reaching over with his other hand in an attempt to carry the lass.</p>
 <p>"Wah!"</p>
 <p>The lass hugged Huoyun Liu-Li and broke into tears. Qing Shui rubbed his nose and took one step back awkwardly. However, he continued to hold onto Huoyun Liu-Li's hand.</p>
 <p>"Lass, don't cry. He's your father! Greet him!" Huoyun Liu-Li said to her daughter.</p>
 <p>The lass was slightly over two years old and could say some simple words. Children tended to be bad with strangers and would cry easily. However, because Qing Shui had his Nature Energy, such situations were rare. Most children wouldn't cry when Qing Shui hugged them. He hadn't expected that his daughter wouldn't allow him to carry her.</p>
 <p>After she heard Huoyun Liu-Li's words, the lass lifted her head and looked at Qing Shui. Qing Shui also smiled and looked at her. After knowing that this his daughter with Huoyun Liu-Li, he was very happy. He knew that Huoyun Liu-Li had always wanted a kid.</p>
 <p>"Who are you?" Her childish voice was very pleasant to the ears. Usually, children would greet people when they were told to, or not speak at all. However, this lass questioned him.</p>
 <p>Regardless, Qing Shui was still very happy.</p>
 <p>"I'm Qing Shui. You can call me Qing Shui. Who are you?" Qing Shui smiled and said to the lass.</p>
 <p>Pffftt....</p>
 <p>Not only did Di Qing and Huoyun Liu-Li laugh, more voices also came from the entrances. Qing Shui lifted his head to see that it was Canghai Mingyue, Yiye Jiange and Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
 <p>There was also his mother and the other members of Qing Clan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose and greeted them happily!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui first walked over to Qing Yi. From his memories, Qing Shui felt that she had not changed. She was still the same intelligent woman who affected Qing Shui the most. She was the resting spot for Qing Shui's soul.</p>
 <p>"Mother!" Qing Shui hugged Qing Yi as if he was a kid. Qing Yi smiled happily.</p>
 <p>"Elder sister!" Qing Shui then hugged Qingqing and called her too.</p>
 <p>"Father!"</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui bent down and picked up both Qing Yan and Qing Ming. The two of them were over five years old. After giving them each a kiss, he took out a few things like the Multi-fragrant Fruits and gave it to them.</p>
 <p>He then carried Qing Zun and Qin Yin. The two of them were over seven years old and Qing Shui felt that they seemed a little unfamiliar. After all, kids grow up very fast. Due to their good body structure and genes it was clear that they would become extraordinary in terms of both appearance and cultivation.</p>
 <p>He gave them some fruits as well. After all, they were still kids. However, other than giving them some fruits, he also gave each of them a one foot long Violet Jade Sword.</p>
 <p>"Father!"</p>
 <p>Both Luan Luan and Yuchang also hugged Qing Shui. They had grown up, but to Qing Shui, they were still kids. Back then, Mingyue Gelou had appeared and was carrying Yuchang who was on the verge of her deathbed... When he met Luan Luan, she was only about four to five years old. However, Luan Luan already had three Xiantian demonic beasts back then. It had been over eighteen years since that time.</p>
 <p>When he left, Yuchang had gone through the coming of age ceremony. Over three years had passed and she was about to turn 20. Back when he first met her in Hundred Miles City, she had been so small.</p>
 <p>"Brother Shui, now that you have wives and kids, you've forgotten about me!" Qing Bei pouted.</p>
 <p>"Come, our Little Bei's the most important one."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>After seeing Yiye Jiange, Qing Shui hugged her as well. After all, she was his earliest ‘wife’ and Luan Luan was his eldest child...</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui hugged her, he felt more relaxed. It was because very soon, he would be able to bring her to Lion King's Ridge.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange smiled and hugged Qing Shui too. The two of them were like teacher and disciple, they were also like friends, yet they were also like soulmates...</p>
 <p>Wenren Wu-shuang had left and she hadn't mentioned when she would come back. However, she would definitely come back. Qing Shui shook his head and dismissed this thought. He felt that it was a pity that she was nowhere to be found.</p>
 <p>Di Chen didn't come back either. Qing Shui felt that he would have to go and look for her slightly later.</p>
 <p>Just then, Qing Shui felt someone tugging his clothes. He turned and didn't see anyone and only saw that it was the lass after he lowered his gaze. She was pouting as she looked at Qing Shui, as if she had suffered from great injustice.</p>
 <p>"Liu-Li, what is our daughter called?" Qing Shui squatted down and asked Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
 <p>"Liu-Li said that she wanted to wait for you to give her a name when you come back!" Canghai Mingyue smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"She is as beautiful as a finely carved piece of jade, and Liu-Li is like a translucent piece of crystal jade. Then, let's call her Qing Yu!" Qing Shui chuckled, feeling extremely happy.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li turned red but said happily, "Lass, you have a name now!"</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue also smiled and said, "Yu`er, quickly greet your father. You have a name now."</p>
 <p>The lass tugged Qing Shui's clothes and pouted for a very long before she finally spoke. Just as everyone was waiting for her to call Qing Shui father, she said, "I want that fruit!"</p>
 <p>The lass pointed to Qing Zun and the others who were eating fruits. They had wanted to give some to Qing Yu but they were stopped by Huoyun Liu-Li. She wanted the lass to ask Qing Shui herself.</p>
 <p>"I've completely forgotten about this little ancestor [1] of mine. Since you're so young, we'll give you something good. Call me father and I'll give this to you?" Qing Shui took out a Wondrous Fruit and gave it to Qing Yu.</p>
 <p>"Father!" The lass called out clearly.</p>
 <p>She then took the fruit and started to munch on it before running back to Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, get her to call you father again!" Canghai Mingyue smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Lass, can you call me that one more time?" Qing Shui didn't understand but did as Canghai Mingyue said.</p>
 <p>The lass took a look at Qing Shui before turning her head away towards Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
 <p>The ladies laughed. Shi Qingzhuang then smiled and said, "Qing Shui, you can try and bribe her with more good food."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out a fragrant fruit, "Lass, if you call me father, I'll give this to you."</p>
 <p>"Father!" She then took the fruit and ran off.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui: "..."</p>
 <p>"This lass totally has the potential to be like Liu-Li!" Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p>"Stupid Qing Shui, I'm not like that! This lass is totally like you." Huoyun Liu-Li complained.</p>
