  <p><strong>AST 239 Entrancing As Water, The Limitations of the Live Saving Technique</strong></p>
  <p>Joyous Sect’s Qinghan Ye!</p>
  <p>Upon seeing her, Qing Shui was stunned. He had almost forgotten about this great beauty from the Joyous Sect. However, he had not expected that she would be here.</p>
  <p>Seeing Qing Shui’s furrowed brows and face looking slightly puzzled, Qinghan Ye’s seductive small mouth opened slightly. It revealed two neat rows of pearl white teeth, carrying a light smile. Her charming face appeared even more coquettish and soul-drawing. However, the expression revealed was one of top-notch seduction, comparable to Huoyun Liu-Li’s demonish charms.</p>
  <p>“You don’t like to see me that much?” The smile on the seductive lips was gone as she looked at Qing Shui, feeling slightly disappointed. She had actually only chanced upon this place, and did not come to look for Qing Shui deliberately.</p>
  <p>She had heard that there was an arrogant blacksmith here, one who was very strong and could create amazing weapons. Therefore, she came by to take a look. However, she had not expected that the rumored blacksmith was Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>However, before Qinghan Ye could feel surprised, she felt that Qing Shui did not seem happy to see her. Her joyous feelings was like a tuft of flames, but immediately extinguished with a pail of cold water when it was just lit up.</p>
  <p>When Qing Shui heard this line, he felt that it sounded a bit familiar. Giving it some thought, he suddenly understood that this was what Canghai Mingyue had meant the other day. He did not know why he suddenly felt anxious and quickly broke into a flattering smile.</p>
  <p>“How could that be? It’s just that I was surprised to see you since I hadn’t gotten over my astonishment. I’m a lecher and tend to fall into a daze when I see beauties.” Qing Shui chuckled and said.</p>
  <p>Qinghan Ye was stunned. She had never seen this side of Qing Shui before. The cool and emotionless side he had displayed when they were on Skysword Sect’s arena had been engraved in her mind and heart. Qing Shui was far from a lecher.</p>
  <p>Treating others with kindness, justice, and passion was what deeply engraved in Qinghan Ye’s heart. She thought of the violent side Qing Shui had displayed for that lady. While she felt that the lady was heavily injured, it was very worth it, and she was even a bit envious of that lady.</p>
  <p>“You’re working as a blacksmith here?” Qinghan Ye looked at Qing Shui’s forced expression. She did not know what to think of it. She had hoped that Qing Shui could chat with her naturally, and treat her like a good friend.</p>
  <p>“That’s right, life’s tough. I’m doing some work here to earn some allowance to help the family.” Qing Shui put down his hammer, trying hard to display his most natural smile and said.</p>
  <p>Qinghan Ye filtered through Qing Shui’s words directly. However, she had never been able to understand Qing Shui. It was just that now Qing Shui had appeared even more unfamiliar. She did not know which side of him was the real him.</p>
  <p>“How did you know that I’m here?” Qing Shui asked casually.</p>
  <p>“I was just passing by when I heard that there is an arrogant blacksmith, an amazing one who is selling a weapon for five million silver taels. He had even eradicated half of the Immortal Sword Sect.” Qinghan Ye looked at Qing Shui seriously, hoping to find out something from his face. However, she only got disappointment.</p>
  <p>It was only when Qinghan Ye had pointed it out that Qing Shui recalled his hostility with the Immortal Sword Sect. It was impossible to say that he was not worried. Who would know if the Immortal Sword Sect would be enraged and come after him for revenge without a care. He was not sure if Canghai could protect him.</p>
  <p>It would be better to depend on himself rather than depending on others. Qing Shui thought of his own abilities, and knew that those who were Martial Kings or lower were no threat to him. Furthermore, it was unlikely that there were plenty of experts who were stronger than Martial Kings in the Immortal Sword Sect. Even if they were to come after him, their success would not be guaranteed. It was because Qing Shui’s greatest treasure was himself.</p>
  <p>In the most dangerous times, he could hide in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. It was his greatest life saving technique, but there were limitations to it. The maximum amount of time Qing Shui could stay in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was about four hours in the real world.</p>
  <p>Four hours could neither be considered long nor short, and if he were to come across a patient person, that person may be even willing to wait patiently for forty hours if he had to. Of course, that was also under the condition that they knew of his secret. However, no matter how much they cracked their brains, they would not be able to find out or believe this.</p>
  <p>However, the advantage was that Qing Shui could fully conceal his own presence after entering the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. No matter how high one’s level of cultivation was, he would not be able to notice Qing Shui’s presence. Therefore, so long as Qing Shui could lose his pursuers for a short distance and enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he would have a very big chance to save himself. He could even make use of the fire bird and the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to lead his enemies to dangerous areas. Then, he could get rid of them through another’s hand.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt that he really did not have much to say to Qinghan Ye. The two of them were not familiar with each other, and knew almost nothing about each other. After saying a few polite words, he did not know what else to say. As for Joyous Sect’s matters, Qing Shui did not hold any interest. While he could be considered to know the Duo Cultivation Technique, he did not hold much interest in it.</p>
  <p>“I’ve finally met you again. Thank you for the things you gave me previously. I can feel that my vitality has strengthened a lot and even my abilities have improved by a lot. It is a strange feeling.” Qinghan Ye thought of how Qing Shui had helped add decades to her lifespan and held a strange feeling towards him.</p>
  <p>“No need for thanks. The Golden Flesh LingZhi your grandfather had given me was sufficient. Moreover, I had also injured you back in the Skysword Sect.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
  <p>Thinking of how she was injured by this guy back on the Skysword Sect’s arena, and how he held no hesitation to deal her a blow, she felt a very special feeling. It was the first time a guy could bear to hurt her, so her impression of Qing Shui was very deep and clear.</p>
  <p>“This is the amazing weapon you made?” Qinghan Ye looked at the Bluebronze Sword Qing Shui was holding and asked with curiosity.</p>
  <p>“It’s not really amazing, but after learning the Art of Forging from someone for a while, I’ll forge weapons to kill time when I’m free.” Qing Shui replied casually.</p>
  <p>“Can I take a look? Everyone said that it is really amazing!” Qinghan Ye looked at Qing Shui. Her pair of seductive eyes was so charming that Qing Shui did not dare to look straight into her eyes.</p>
  <p>He could only pass the Bluebronze Sword to her!</p>
  <p>Once she grabbed it, Qinghan Ye’s pair of beautiful watery eyes became wide open as she looked at Qing Shui in astonishment. At that moment, the natural charming aura she was exuding made it hard for Qing Shui to ward off.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was only one foot away from Qinghan Ye. At that moment, he had almost gone up to hug her tightly. That impulse was especially strong, so when Qinghan Ye lifted her head to look at Qing Shui, Qing Shui performed an action.</p>
  <p>He took two steps back in panic!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was afraid that he would lose control of himself and do something he would eventually regret. That expression was one of surprise before it turned into one of panic. He was worried that he would do something wrong. However, in Qinghan Ye’s eyes, it was interpreted differently.</p>
  <p>Holding the Bluebronze Sword, she stared blankly at Qing Shui who had taken two steps back. Was she so scary? The gaze she was looking at Qing Shui with also turned slightly dejected.</p>
  <p>“Am I really that intolerable? Although I’m from the Joyous Sect, I do not have…a partner for the Duo Cultivation.” Qinghan Ye lowered her head slightly.</p>
  <p>Humans were really strange and contradicting creatures. While everyone was confident, they also felt inferior about themselves. Qing Shui had not expected that Qinghan Ye would be the same, but it seemed to him as if she was very concerned of his opinions towards her.</p>
  <p>“You’re not intolerable. It’s just that I’m afraid that I would bring you to bed and do stuff that would make you regret it.” Qing Shui said gloomily.</p>
  <p>Qinghan Ye heard Qing Shui’s vulgar words and immediately felt so embarrassed that even her pair of exquisite and delicate ears turned bright red all the way to her slender pink neck. Those limpid eyes seemed to be full of mist as she looked at Qing Shui. She embarrassedly looked as if she was welcoming him while putting on an act of reluctance.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose and smiled bitterly as he looked at Qinghan Ye. Even with his self-control, his body had reacted. It was especially so when he came across Qinghan Ye’s Nine Yin Qi that Qing Shui felt the nameless Duo Cultivation Technique start to activate automatically. He was feeling an extreme impulse towards the aura exuded from her charming body.</p>
  <p>Qinghan Ye felt a bit uneasy and awkward when she saw Qing Shui’s gaze which had a tinge of burning passion. She looked at him femininely and gave a happy smile. That intoxicating and charming seduction made Qing Shui only able to relate her with a pink colored bed of seduction. The urge he had to have his way with her was especially strong, but it was a pity that Qing Shui had a bit of resistance to this Nine Yin Qi. He did not wish to provoke this lady who would shorten one’s life.</p>
  <p>A beauty’s bed, a hero’s tomb! No matter how determined a burly man was, he would be scared of a woman’s gentleness. However, Qing Shui was afraid. He had always thought that his determination was very strong. Who did not think the same? Which burly man who had lost himself to a beauty was not one who was determined and firm? As long as the issue with Yan Clan was still unsettled, Qing Shui would forever hold a burden in his heart. Moreover, there was still his goddess Master in Skysword Sect. Should he do something for her? Would he be able to go against the head of Lion King’s Ridge.? </p>
  <p>“It’s noon, can I treat you to a meal as an appreciation?” Qinghan Ye held Qing Shui’s Bluebronze sword and said casually, giving an unconvincing excuse.</p>
  <p>She was afraid that Qing Shui would reject her, so she lowered her head slightly, not daring to look at his face. She was even more afraid that Qing Shui would say something to disappoint her.</p>
  <p>“Alright, wait for me outside. I’ll close up!” Qing Shui knew Qinghan Ye’s thoughts when he saw the way she was acting. Qing Shui was a guy who despised himself, who was softhearted, and even more so who was easily touched.</p>
  <p>“This sword of yours is really amazing and beautiful.”</p>
  <p>When Qing Shui was walking along the streets with Qinghan Ye after he had locked the door, Qinghan Ye looked at Qing Shui and said happily.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui had initially thought of bringing her to his place and cook for her, but he immediately gave up that thought. He was afraid that he would lose control and the probability of it happening was very high. Therefore, they could only visit a restaurant nearby.<br></p>
  <p>“You like it?” Qing Shui walked alongside Qinghan Ye. There was a faint fragrance like orchids in the air, and the weather was clear. There was no scorching summer in the world of the nine continents. No matter how hot it was, it would not make one feel stuffy. The rich and refreshing air was something which the world in his previous life could not match up to.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>“Haha, I don’t!”</p>
  <p>Qinghan Ye’s reply made Qing Shui very astonished! He could not help but ask, “Why?”</p>
  <p>“Because it is too expensive and I don’t have a lot of money.” Qinghan Ye blinked those eyes of hers which would make one’s body go limp all over, as she smiled and said.</p>

Therefore, so long as Qing Shui could lose his pursuers for a short distance and enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he would have a very big chance to save himself. He could even make use of the fire bird and the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to lead his enemies to dangerous areas. Then, he could get rid of them through another’s hand.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that he really did not have much to say to Qinghan Ye. The two of them were not familiar with each other, and knew almost nothing about each other. After saying a few polite words, he did not know what else to say. As for Joyous Sect’s matters, Qing Shui did not hold any interest. While he could be considered to know the Duo Cultivation Technique, he did not hold much interest in it.</p>
 <p>“I’ve finally met you again. Thank you for the things you gave me previously. I can feel that my vitality has strengthened a lot and even my abilities have improved by a lot. It is a strange feeling.” Qinghan Ye thought of how Qing Shui had helped add decades to her lifespan and held a strange feeling towards him.</p>
 <p>“No need for thanks. The Golden Flesh LingZhi your grandfather had given me was sufficient. Moreover, I had also injured you back in the Skysword Sect.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Thinking of how she was injured by this guy back on the Skysword Sect’s arena, and how he held no hesitation to deal her a blow, she felt a very special feeling. It was the first time a guy could bear to hurt her, so her impression of Qing Shui was very deep and clear.</p>
 <p>“This is the amazing weapon you made?” Qinghan Ye looked at the Bluebronze Sword Qing Shui was holding and asked with curiosity.</p>
 <p>“It’s not really amazing, but after learning the Art of Forging from someone for a while, I’ll forge weapons to kill time when I’m free.” Qing Shui replied casually.</p>
 <p>“Can I take a look? Everyone said that it is really amazing!” Qinghan Ye looked at Qing Shui. Her pair of seductive eyes was so charming that Qing Shui did not dare to look straight into her eyes.</p>
 <p>He could only pass the Bluebronze Sword to her!</p>
 <p>Once she grabbed it, Qinghan Ye’s pair of beautiful watery eyes became wide open as she looked at Qing Shui in astonishment. At that moment, the natural charming aura she was exuding made it hard for Qing Shui to ward off.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was only one foot away from Qinghan Ye. At that moment, he had almost gone up to hug her tightly. That impulse was especially strong, so when Qinghan Ye lifted her head to look at Qing Shui, Qing Shui performed an action.</p>
 <p>He took two steps back in panic!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was afraid that he would lose control of himself and do something he would eventually regret. That expression was one of surprise before it turned into one of panic. He was worried that he would do something wrong. However, in Qinghan Ye’s eyes, it was interpreted differently.</p>
 <p>Holding the Bluebronze Sword, she stared blankly at Qing Shui who had taken two steps back. Was she so scary? The gaze she was looking at Qing Shui with also turned slightly dejected.</p>
 <p>“Am I really that intolerable? Although I’m from the Joyous Sect, I do not have…a partner for the Duo Cultivation.” Qinghan Ye lowered her head slightly.</p>
 <p>Humans were really strange and contradicting creatures. While everyone was confident, they also felt inferior about themselves. Qing Shui had not expected that Qinghan Ye would be the same, but it seemed to him as if she was very concerned of his opinions towards her.</p>
 <p>“You’re not intolerable. It’s just that I’m afraid that I would bring you to bed and do stuff that would make you regret it.” Qing Shui said gloomily.</p>
 <p>Qinghan Ye heard Qing Shui’s vulgar words and immediately felt so embarrassed that even her pair of exquisite and delicate ears turned bright red all the way to her slender pink neck. Those limpid eyes seemed to be full of mist as she looked at Qing Shui. She embarrassedly looked as if she was welcoming him while putting on an act of reluctance.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose and smiled bitterly as he looked at Qinghan Ye. Even with his self-control, his body had reacted. It was especially so when he came across Qinghan Ye’s Nine Yin Qi that Qing Shui felt the nameless Duo Cultivation Technique start to activate automatically. He was feeling an extreme impulse towards the aura exuded from her charming body.</p>
 <p>Qinghan Ye felt a bit uneasy and awkward when she saw Qing Shui’s gaze which had a tinge of burning passion. She looked at him femininely and gave a happy smile. That intoxicating and charming seduction made Qing Shui only able to relate her with a pink colored bed of seduction. The urge he had to have his way with her was especially strong, but it was a pity that Qing Shui had a bit of resistance to this Nine Yin Qi. He did not wish to provoke this lady who would shorten one’s life.</p>
 <p>A beauty’s bed, a hero’s tomb! No matter how determined a burly man was, he would be scared of a woman’s gentleness. However, Qing Shui was afraid. He had always thought that his determination was very strong. Who did not think the same? Which burly man who had lost himself to a beauty was not one who was determined and firm? As long as the issue with Yan Clan was still unsettled, Qing Shui would forever hold a burden in his heart. Moreover, there was still his goddess Master in Skysword Sect. Should he do something for her? Would he be able to go against the head of Lion King’s Ridge.? </p>
 <p>“It’s noon, can I treat you to a meal as an appreciation?” Qinghan Ye held Qing Shui’s Bluebronze sword and said casually, giving an unconvincing excuse.</p>
 <p>She was afraid that Qing Shui would reject her, so she lowered her head slightly, not daring to look at his face. She was even more afraid that Qing Shui would say something to disappoint her.</p>
 <p>“Alright, wait for me outside. I’ll close up!” Qing Shui knew Qinghan Ye’s thoughts when he saw the way she was acting. Qing Shui was a guy who despised himself, who was softhearted, and even more so who was easily touched.</p>
 <p>“This sword of yours is really amazing and beautiful.”</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui was walking along the streets with Qinghan Ye after he had locked the door, Qinghan Ye looked at Qing Shui and said happily.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had initially thought of bringing her to his place and cook for her, but he immediately gave up that thought. He was afraid that he would lose control and the probability of it happening was very high. Therefore, they could only visit a restaurant nearby.<br></p>
 <p>“You like it?” Qing Shui walked alongside Qinghan Ye. There was a faint fragrance like orchids in the air, and the weather was clear. There was no scorching summer in the world of the nine continents. No matter how hot it was, it would not make one feel stuffy. The rich and refreshing air was something which the world in his previous life could not match up to.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Haha, I don’t!”</p>
 <p>Qinghan Ye’s reply made Qing Shui very astonished! He could not help but ask, “Why?”</p>
 <p>“Because it is too expensive and I don’t have a lot of money.” Qinghan Ye blinked those eyes of hers which would make one’s body go limp all over, as she smiled and said.</p>
