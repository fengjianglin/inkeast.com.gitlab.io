  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 531 - The Heaven Defying Violet Divine Crystal, Disturbance</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sister Chen, if I were to try and eliminate the Sword Tower, would you support me?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even Qing Shui didn’t quite know what he meant when he asked this question. In fact, he didn’t even know why he asked that. It was something that he did subconsciously.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Chen turned back and looked at Qing Shui. Her bright and beautiful pupils seemed more pleasant as she nodded at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Sword Tower!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Haha, that old fart won’t be living for more than three months! The day he perishes will be the day the Heavenly Palace gets destroyed!” The Sword Tower’s Old Ancestor who looked like a dried up bone chuckled and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was Sword Tower’s highest business hall. The people sitting around the Old Ancestor were all old men with snow white hair and beards. Each and every one of them have been through many experiences. They might look old and feeble, but they all contained an unique and dominating aura.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tan Yang’s grandfather was also one of them. His face was also filled with joy. Once the Old Ancestor was gone, the Tan Clan would end up being the most prominent existent in Sword Tower. He was willing to wait for a hundred years, but it might actually happen within ten years!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After a hundred years, Sword Tower would belong to Yang Er!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Congratulations Old Ancestor, your wish is finally going to come true!” A tall and sturdy old man smiled and said as he bowed his head to the Old Ancestor, who sat at the seat of honor.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hehe, it’s still too early to say something like this. Let’s just wait for that old fart to die. Once he dies, there will no longer be anyone in Heavenly Palace who could stop us,” a fierce look flashed across the eyes of the Sword Tower’s Old Ancestor who looked like a withering tree.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“How about the two women related to the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord? They are also quite formidable!” A wise and prudent old man asked the Old Ancestor of Sword Tower.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hahaha!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, the Old Ancestor of Sword Tower laughed loudly: “ I’m not really concerned about those two girls. But as far as I know, the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord doesn’t disagree with me destroying Heavenly Palace.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hai Clan!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Dongqing! Tell me, have we made a mistake this time!” A courteous man laughed as he talked to the most beautiful and powerful woman in Hai Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hai Dongqing looked at the handsome and courteous middle-aged man and said: “Brother! Is it still important whether it’s right or wrong?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, it’s no longer important. With you around, very soon, who are we to fear in the Green Cloud Continent?” The man looked at Hai Dongqing. He laughed without any restraints.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother, what I truly mean is that, everyone might have misunderstood you.” The extremely beautiful pupils of Hai Dongqing were shining with lights of wisdom. The elegant and knowledgeable aura which she exuded caused people to not dare to look straight at her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Wrong? Are you talking about that Qing Shui?” The man looked in surprise at the woman who would say shocking works, yet was always right.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’m not sure. But I feel that this incident will definitely exceed one’s expectations. By then, we should just stand by the side and watch. If any idiots were to come to our Hai Clan to look for trouble, we will just beat them to a pulp.” Hai Dongqing laughed gently. She would only show a bit of her cute side when she was in front of this man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Demon Beast Sect!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Grand Elder! Shall we interfere with the things between Sword Tower and Heavenly Palace this time?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Grand Elder looked at the competent assistant who got transferred here. At that time, he was still just an immature child. But now, he was already a grizzled old man with white hair.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Cai Yun, tell me, do you think that we should get part of the profits?” The Grand Elder smiled and asked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Cai Yun is foolish, Grand Elder, please provide Cai Yun with guidance.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Today, there is only you and I here. There aren’t any outsiders, so you don’t have to be so formal. I want to listen to your opinion.” The expression of the Grand Elder still looked the same.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The elderly man thought for a while. After that, he proceeded to say: “Pretend to comply, sit still and watch.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Good, really good! This time, it has finally reached the most crucial moment. It may benefit us a lot, but at the same time, there is a lot of risk in it. I have asked the Old Ancestor about it. The Old Ancestor told me to be more careful, he also said that he will let me decide what to do for the incident this time.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cai Yun had no idea what message the Grand Elder was trying to convey this time. Hence, he looked at him in bewilderment.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After two months, Qing Shui, Di Chen and the two other girls arrived at Heavenly Palace!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The Old Ancestor wanted us to head there as soon as we arrive.” Di Chen informed Qing Shui softly as the Fire Bird descended on a place close to Cang Wuya’s home.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Let’s go see old gramps first!” Qing Shui said softly. After that, the girls approached Cang Wuya.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya, who heard something, immediately came out. When he saw Qing Shui and the girls, the old man teared up. They haven’t seen each other for four years. One year ago, when Di Chen told him about Qing Shui recovering, he felt that the gods were still fair to him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old gramps! I am back!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">‘Grandpa……” The two girls also ran towards him. They couldn’t hold their tears.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Good to see you back, the gods have finally opened up their eyes this time!” Cang Wuya smiled delightedly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Di Chen greeted Cang Wuya, she glanced towards Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, go and finish up your duties first if you are busy. Just come back once you are done.”When Cang Wuya saw Di Chen’s expression, he already knew that something was up. As the Supreme Elder in Heavenly Palace, he already knew too much about the Old Ancestor.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui greeted Cang Wuya and the other two girls, he walked out with Di Chen.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Very quickly, the two reached the familiar stone mountain. It hadn’t been long since the two arrived, before the stone door had already opened up with a rumbling noise.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Let’s go in!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Di Chen talked to Qing Shui, she walked towards the stone stairs.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After taking a turn, Qing Shui once again saw those stone poles. After that, he could already see the Old Ancestor standing in the distance. From Qing Shui’s perspective, the Old Ancestor still looked the same like usual.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But very quickly, he could already sense the slowly dissipating vital energy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It’s just like the time with Feng Shamo. It’s just that the rate at which Feng Shamo’s vital energy dissipated was much faster.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old Ancestor!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui called out gently. The old man had always been a huge help to him. The Flame Phoenix Pellet, the Heavenly Pellet and even Bai Gui who he sent out later on to save his life.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, a boundless aura pressed towards him. The Old Ancestor of the Heavenly Palace, who wore a plain cloth across his body, turned around and smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the moment, Qing Shui was feeling a bit suspicious. This was because previously, the Old Ancestor told him that he only had the strength that was worth six and a half countries. But now, Qing Shui felt that he might be talking about the strength of his physical body. Qing Shui felt suspicious because the strength of the Old Ancestor was slightly beyond ten countries worth according to his spiritual sense.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Indeed, my judgement was correct. You really do have a persistent heart and strong willpower. You have worked really hard during these past few years.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The words of the Old Ancestor shocked Qing Shui. Could it be that he had seen it?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I have been to the Qing Clan. The Ancient Book of ‘Rebirth’ was something that I entrusted Grandpa Lin to give to you. I was scared that you would have been too burdened, that’s why I asked him to lie to you. The reason why I said all of these wasn’t to take credit for somebody’s achievements. With your current strength, I’m sure you have figured out why I’m in such a rush to call you back. The Old Ancestor looked at Qing Shui and said calmly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For an old man who didn’t have much longer to live, yet was able to face death so calmly, there weren’t many people who could reach this kind of state.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Could it be that you can’t find anyone more suitable than me?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You are the most suitable person.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I am already a useless person now. Are you not afraid that I will make the great name of Heavenly Palace go down the drain?” Qing Shui touched his nose and smiled bitterly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If they were to be defeated by a useless person, I wonder how they would feel.” The Old Ancestor chuckled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knitted his brows. Deep in his heart, he thought about the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord in the Central Continent. Every time he thought about it, he would feel like he was suffocating and a bit helpless. At the same time, Qing Shui also knew that if he were to advance into the Martial Saint Realm without the ‘Five Elements Heavenly Fruit’, he would need a strength that’s worth ten countries. If he was unable to achieve that, he wouldn’t be able to detach himself from the restrictions of the Martial King Grade.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Are you worried about the people from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord?” The Old Ancestor saw Qing Shui knitting his brows like he was thinking about something.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’m not worried about myself. I’m just worried that they would come and destroy the Heavenly Palace. If that were to happen, wouldn’t I have let Old Ancestor down?” Qing Shui explained in concern. He was worried of himself, but he was even more worried of the people around him and the people in the Qing Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You don’t have to worry about this. Come with me. Little Brat Chen, you come too.” After the Old Ancestor finished speaking, he led the two towards the direction of a hidden room.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Old Ancestor pressed a bulging spot on the wall. A stone door with two fierce beasts carved on it slowly opened.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A bright violet light flashed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This is the ‘Violet Divine Crystal’. It is also known as the ‘The Equality Of All Creatures’. As long as you trigger it, within a hundred miles, the strength of all the warriors who were beyond the Martial King Grade would drop back down to a peak Martial King. This would only be effective on warriors between First Grade Martial Saint and Third Grade Martial Saint. Hence, it’s also known as the nemesis of Martial Saints warriors.” The Old Ancestor pointed at the Violet Divine Crystal which was only one meter big and explained.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Heaven defying! Insane!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was how Qing Shui reacted at the moment. But as Qing Shui thought about it, if it only worked for Martial Saints ranging from First Grade to Third Grade, if a Martial Saint beyond the Third Grade were to appear, then does that mean he would be left with no options? But soon after, Qing Shui laughed at himself. If he was to think that way, then there was no longer any reason for the Heavenly Palace to exist..</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Do you feel that it’s a bit useless since it can only limit Martial Saints ranging from first to third grade?” The Old Ancestor laughed and asked Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt a bit ashamed after his thoughts were seen through by the Old Ancestor. Just when he was about to speak, Di Chen already opened her mouth.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, Old Ancestor, if a Fourth Grade Martial Saint was to come, doesn’t that mean that the Violet Divine Crystal would be rendered useless?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hehe, the gap between the grades of Martial Saint are so huge to the point it couldn’t be measured. The weakest Martial Saint has the power of ten countries. This is also the strength of a First Grade Martial Saint. It’s only when someone’s strength exceed a hundred countries will they be considered to possess the strength of a Second Grade Martial Saint. For the remaining details, even I have no idea. As far as I know, the strongest warrior in the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord is only a Second Grade Martial Saint.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">These words of the Old Ancestor caused Qing Shui to completely turn stiff from fright. A strength worth a hundred countries, such terrifying power. So how strong exactly was someone who reached the peak of the Second Grade Martial Saint? Without saying, it should be at least two hundred countries worth...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That was such a formidable strength! The last attack from that man from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord had already let Qing Shui sense a Martial Saint’s terrifying power. It should be around sixty countries worth…..</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old Ancestor, then, is the Violet Divine Crystal currently being used?” Di Chen carried on and asked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No, the Violet Divine Crystal has a lifespan. Every time it’s used, one year of its life will be cut down. Each time it activates, it will last for twelve hours. It can still be used twenty times,” sighed the Old Ancestor.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This restriction wasn’t unusual. Such an extraordinary treasure, if it could be used as much as one wanted, it would have been too heaven defying.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Tomorrow, I will organize an Elder Association. When that happens, I will pass on the Heavenly Palace’s token to you. After that, I think you will have to establish dominance for yourself.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled bitterly: “Alright, Old Ancestor. Do you really not have any ways to extend your lifespan? Peach of Immortality? Longevity Fruit?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I have eaten all of those before. It’s no longer of any use, hehe. All of my wishes have come true. I just hope that Qing Shui can give Wuji a hand,” smiled the Old Ancestor humbly. Towards life and death, he already felt indifferent to it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Don’t worry about the things regarding Martial Uncle Fei!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old Man Gong Sun, what do you think? This time, who will the Old Ancestor choose to take over the Heavenly Palace?” asked an energetic elderly man with a smile. This elder wore a large red gown.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“In any case, it wouldn’t be Old Man Jin!” The old man who was known as Gong Sun sipped his tea and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Not me, then could it be Old Man Gong Sun?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“There is indeed a high chance Brother Gong Sun will be chosen! Hehe.” said a few old men with white hair and beards at the side. They then laughed without restraints.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I knew it, you and Old Man Gong Sun have always been really close with each other. It seems like there will be quite a competition then. And also, you guys, let’s talk about who the Old Ancestor will pass on his position to.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old Man Feng, aren’t you close with Old Man Jin? Tell us, who do you think Old Ancestor will choose to take over his position. Actually, you should know about it. You seemed have forgotten about that young man,” chuckled Xi Fatong.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui? That useless person can still take over Old Ancestor’s position?” Old man Feng said without holding back.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“So a useless person can still beat the genius in your house to a pulp?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You… you… you…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">These were all the Supreme Leaders of the Heavenly Palace who have had a lot of life experience. Most of them were the Old Ancestors in their respective aristocratic clan that were under the Heavenly Palace. Each and every one of them were the guardians of their clans.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I heard that Qing Shui is back. It’s just that I don’t know why a trash is coming back.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Very quickly, the information about Qing Shui coming back to the Heavenly Palace spread across the entire Heavenly Palace.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Trash? Even if he is a trash, he still managed to kill a Martial King Grade warrior. Can you say that you are capable of doing the same?” The previous man with a round face and a sharp chin was accused by an armoured man</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The man looked at the person in armor and left with a gloomy expression.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The man in armor was Xi Ri!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui went back to where Cang Wuya was. Di Chen, on the other hand, went back to Misty Hall Palace. After meeting Cang Wuya and Fei Wuji, he started telling them about the incidents that happened during these past few years like usual.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Tomorrow, if anyone dares to make any moves, I don’t care who it is, be ruthless to them,” chortled Fei Wuji.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Thank you Martial Uncle Fei! I know!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Have a good rest today. A fierce battle might even unfold tomorrow.” said Cang Wuya as he looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stayed the night at Cang Wuya’s place.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He cultivated his body to the point of exhaustion!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was really keen to hear more about the strength of Martial Saints from the Old Ancestor. But what he felt more was a sense of helplessness. It would be a piece of cake for a Martial Saint Grade warrior to kill a warrior at the pinnacle of Martial King Grade. It’s not something that could be won by quantities.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was because warriors at the pinnacle of Martial King Grade was absolutely not capable of breaking a Martial Saint Warrior’s defense. If they were to battle, they would only be slaughtered.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Furthermore, Qing Shui had once again experienced the advantages of his own physical strength. As long as one’s physical body was strong, they would be able to draw out even more power from their armors, weapons and medicinal pills which could help amplify their strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Only by having a formidable physical body would one be able to rule everything. At most, a person could only add in a few techniques. For example, Demonic Beasts, were strong because they only relied on their own physical strength. Even though they didn’t have formidable armors and weapons, they were still able to defeat human warriors at the same grade as them.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At present, Qing Shui himself had a physical strength which was worth five countries and seven countries worth of physical defense. But if he was to include the armors and weapon techniques, he would be able to achieve a strength which was roughly equivalent to twenty five countries.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was also the results of the Ancient Book of ‘Rebirth’ which he hesitated before he had finally cultivated it for three years. The strength of his physical body had increased by one fold.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cultivation, cultivation, after going through a life-and-death situation, Qing Shui managed to understand more than anyone that living was not such an easy task, especially when one wanted to stand tall in life.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">On the next day, Qing Shui’s morning practice just ended.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Dong-dong-dong…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A heavy and loud clock noise resounded. The entire Heavenly Palace could hear it. That noise sounded depressing and gloomy.</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 531 - The Heaven Defying Violet Divine Crystal, Disturbance</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sister Chen, if I were to try and eliminate the Sword Tower, would you support me?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even Qing Shui didn’t quite know what he meant when he asked this question. In fact, he didn’t even know why he asked that. It was something that he did subconsciously.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Di Chen turned back and looked at Qing Shui. Her bright and beautiful pupils seemed more pleasant as she nodded at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Sword Tower!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Haha, that old fart won’t be living for more than three months! The day he perishes will be the day the Heavenly Palace gets destroyed!” The Sword Tower’s Old Ancestor who looked like a dried up bone chuckled and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was Sword Tower’s highest business hall. The people sitting around the Old Ancestor were all old men with snow white hair and beards. Each and every one of them have been through many experiences. They might look old and feeble, but they all contained an unique and dominating aura.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Tan Yang’s grandfather was also one of them. His face was also filled with joy. Once the Old Ancestor was gone, the Tan Clan would end up being the most prominent existent in Sword Tower. He was willing to wait for a hundred years, but it might actually happen within ten years!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After a hundred years, Sword Tower would belong to Yang Er!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Congratulations Old Ancestor, your wish is finally going to come true!” A tall and sturdy old man smiled and said as he bowed his head to the Old Ancestor, who sat at the seat of honor.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hehe, it’s still too early to say something like this. Let’s just wait for that old fart to die. Once he dies, there will no longer be anyone in Heavenly Palace who could stop us,” a fierce look flashed across the eyes of the Sword Tower’s Old Ancestor who looked like a withering tree.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“How about the two women related to the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord? They are also quite formidable!” A wise and prudent old man asked the Old Ancestor of Sword Tower.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hahaha!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, the Old Ancestor of Sword Tower laughed loudly: “ I’m not really concerned about those two girls. But as far as I know, the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord doesn’t disagree with me destroying Heavenly Palace.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hai Clan!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Dongqing! Tell me, have we made a mistake this time!” A courteous man laughed as he talked to the most beautiful and powerful woman in Hai Clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hai Dongqing looked at the handsome and courteous middle-aged man and said: “Brother! Is it still important whether it’s right or wrong?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, it’s no longer important. With you around, very soon, who are we to fear in the Green Cloud Continent?” The man looked at Hai Dongqing. He laughed without any restraints.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother, what I truly mean is that, everyone might have misunderstood you.” The extremely beautiful pupils of Hai Dongqing were shining with lights of wisdom. The elegant and knowledgeable aura which she exuded caused people to not dare to look straight at her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Wrong? Are you talking about that Qing Shui?” The man looked in surprise at the woman who would say shocking works, yet was always right.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’m not sure. But I feel that this incident will definitely exceed one’s expectations. By then, we should just stand by the side and watch. If any idiots were to come to our Hai Clan to look for trouble, we will just beat them to a pulp.” Hai Dongqing laughed gently. She would only show a bit of her cute side when she was in front of this man.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Demon Beast Sect!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Grand Elder! Shall we interfere with the things between Sword Tower and Heavenly Palace this time?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Grand Elder looked at the competent assistant who got transferred here. At that time, he was still just an immature child. But now, he was already a grizzled old man with white hair.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Cai Yun, tell me, do you think that we should get part of the profits?” The Grand Elder smiled and asked.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Cai Yun is foolish, Grand Elder, please provide Cai Yun with guidance.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Today, there is only you and I here. There aren’t any outsiders, so you don’t have to be so formal. I want to listen to your opinion.” The expression of the Grand Elder still looked the same.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The elderly man thought for a while. After that, he proceeded to say: “Pretend to comply, sit still and watch.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Good, really good! This time, it has finally reached the most crucial moment. It may benefit us a lot, but at the same time, there is a lot of risk in it. I have asked the Old Ancestor about it. The Old Ancestor told me to be more careful, he also said that he will let me decide what to do for the incident this time.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cai Yun had no idea what message the Grand Elder was trying to convey this time. Hence, he looked at him in bewilderment.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After two months, Qing Shui, Di Chen and the two other girls arrived at Heavenly Palace!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The Old Ancestor wanted us to head there as soon as we arrive.” Di Chen informed Qing Shui softly as the Fire Bird descended on a place close to Cang Wuya’s home.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Let’s go see old gramps first!” Qing Shui said softly. After that, the girls approached Cang Wuya.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cang Wuya, who heard something, immediately came out. When he saw Qing Shui and the girls, the old man teared up. They haven’t seen each other for four years. One year ago, when Di Chen told him about Qing Shui recovering, he felt that the gods were still fair to him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old gramps! I am back!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">‘Grandpa……” The two girls also ran towards him. They couldn’t hold their tears.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Good to see you back, the gods have finally opened up their eyes this time!” Cang Wuya smiled delightedly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After Di Chen greeted Cang Wuya, she glanced towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, go and finish up your duties first if you are busy. Just come back once you are done.”When Cang Wuya saw Di Chen’s expression, he already knew that something was up. As the Supreme Elder in Heavenly Palace, he already knew too much about the Old Ancestor.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui greeted Cang Wuya and the other two girls, he walked out with Di Chen.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Very quickly, the two reached the familiar stone mountain. It hadn’t been long since the two arrived, before the stone door had already opened up with a rumbling noise.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Let’s go in!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After Di Chen talked to Qing Shui, she walked towards the stone stairs.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After taking a turn, Qing Shui once again saw those stone poles. After that, he could already see the Old Ancestor standing in the distance. From Qing Shui’s perspective, the Old Ancestor still looked the same like usual.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But very quickly, he could already sense the slowly dissipating vital energy!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It’s just like the time with Feng Shamo. It’s just that the rate at which Feng Shamo’s vital energy dissipated was much faster.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old Ancestor!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui called out gently. The old man had always been a huge help to him. The Flame Phoenix Pellet, the Heavenly Pellet and even Bai Gui who he sent out later on to save his life.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, a boundless aura pressed towards him. The Old Ancestor of the Heavenly Palace, who wore a plain cloth across his body, turned around and smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the moment, Qing Shui was feeling a bit suspicious. This was because previously, the Old Ancestor told him that he only had the strength that was worth six and a half countries. But now, Qing Shui felt that he might be talking about the strength of his physical body. Qing Shui felt suspicious because the strength of the Old Ancestor was slightly beyond ten countries worth according to his spiritual sense.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Indeed, my judgement was correct. You really do have a persistent heart and strong willpower. You have worked really hard during these past few years.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The words of the Old Ancestor shocked Qing Shui. Could it be that he had seen it?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I have been to the Qing Clan. The Ancient Book of ‘Rebirth’ was something that I entrusted Grandpa Lin to give to you. I was scared that you would have been too burdened, that’s why I asked him to lie to you. The reason why I said all of these wasn’t to take credit for somebody’s achievements. With your current strength, I’m sure you have figured out why I’m in such a rush to call you back. The Old Ancestor looked at Qing Shui and said calmly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">For an old man who didn’t have much longer to live, yet was able to face death so calmly, there weren’t many people who could reach this kind of state.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Could it be that you can’t find anyone more suitable than me?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You are the most suitable person.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I am already a useless person now. Are you not afraid that I will make the great name of Heavenly Palace go down the drain?” Qing Shui touched his nose and smiled bitterly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If they were to be defeated by a useless person, I wonder how they would feel.” The Old Ancestor chuckled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knitted his brows. Deep in his heart, he thought about the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord in the Central Continent. Every time he thought about it, he would feel like he was suffocating and a bit helpless. At the same time, Qing Shui also knew that if he were to advance into the Martial Saint Realm without the ‘Five Elements Heavenly Fruit’, he would need a strength that’s worth ten countries. If he was unable to achieve that, he wouldn’t be able to detach himself from the restrictions of the Martial King Grade.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Are you worried about the people from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord?” The Old Ancestor saw Qing Shui knitting his brows like he was thinking about something.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’m not worried about myself. I’m just worried that they would come and destroy the Heavenly Palace. If that were to happen, wouldn’t I have let Old Ancestor down?” Qing Shui explained in concern. He was worried of himself, but he was even more worried of the people around him and the people in the Qing Clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You don’t have to worry about this. Come with me. Little Brat Chen, you come too.” After the Old Ancestor finished speaking, he led the two towards the direction of a hidden room.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Old Ancestor pressed a bulging spot on the wall. A stone door with two fierce beasts carved on it slowly opened.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A bright violet light flashed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This is the ‘Violet Divine Crystal’. It is also known as the ‘The Equality Of All Creatures’. As long as you trigger it, within a hundred miles, the strength of all the warriors who were beyond the Martial King Grade would drop back down to a peak Martial King. This would only be effective on warriors between First Grade Martial Saint and Third Grade Martial Saint. Hence, it’s also known as the nemesis of Martial Saints warriors.” The Old Ancestor pointed at the Violet Divine Crystal which was only one meter big and explained.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Heaven defying! Insane!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was how Qing Shui reacted at the moment. But as Qing Shui thought about it, if it only worked for Martial Saints ranging from First Grade to Third Grade, if a Martial Saint beyond the Third Grade were to appear, then does that mean he would be left with no options? But soon after, Qing Shui laughed at himself. If he was to think that way, then there was no longer any reason for the Heavenly Palace to exist..</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Do you feel that it’s a bit useless since it can only limit Martial Saints ranging from first to third grade?” The Old Ancestor laughed and asked Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt a bit ashamed after his thoughts were seen through by the Old Ancestor. Just when he was about to speak, Di Chen already opened her mouth.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, Old Ancestor, if a Fourth Grade Martial Saint was to come, doesn’t that mean that the Violet Divine Crystal would be rendered useless?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hehe, the gap between the grades of Martial Saint are so huge to the point it couldn’t be measured. The weakest Martial Saint has the power of ten countries. This is also the strength of a First Grade Martial Saint. It’s only when someone’s strength exceed a hundred countries will they be considered to possess the strength of a Second Grade Martial Saint. For the remaining details, even I have no idea. As far as I know, the strongest warrior in the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord is only a Second Grade Martial Saint.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">These words of the Old Ancestor caused Qing Shui to completely turn stiff from fright. A strength worth a hundred countries, such terrifying power. So how strong exactly was someone who reached the peak of the Second Grade Martial Saint? Without saying, it should be at least two hundred countries worth...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">That was such a formidable strength! The last attack from that man from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord had already let Qing Shui sense a Martial Saint’s terrifying power. It should be around sixty countries worth…..</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old Ancestor, then, is the Violet Divine Crystal currently being used?” Di Chen carried on and asked.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No, the Violet Divine Crystal has a lifespan. Every time it’s used, one year of its life will be cut down. Each time it activates, it will last for twelve hours. It can still be used twenty times,” sighed the Old Ancestor.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This restriction wasn’t unusual. Such an extraordinary treasure, if it could be used as much as one wanted, it would have been too heaven defying.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Tomorrow, I will organize an Elder Association. When that happens, I will pass on the Heavenly Palace’s token to you. After that, I think you will have to establish dominance for yourself.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled bitterly: “Alright, Old Ancestor. Do you really not have any ways to extend your lifespan? Peach of Immortality? Longevity Fruit?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I have eaten all of those before. It’s no longer of any use, hehe. All of my wishes have come true. I just hope that Qing Shui can give Wuji a hand,” smiled the Old Ancestor humbly. Towards life and death, he already felt indifferent to it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Don’t worry about the things regarding Martial Uncle Fei!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old Man Gong Sun, what do you think? This time, who will the Old Ancestor choose to take over the Heavenly Palace?” asked an energetic elderly man with a smile. This elder wore a large red gown.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“In any case, it wouldn’t be Old Man Jin!” The old man who was known as Gong Sun sipped his tea and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Not me, then could it be Old Man Gong Sun?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“There is indeed a high chance Brother Gong Sun will be chosen! Hehe.” said a few old men with white hair and beards at the side. They then laughed without restraints.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I knew it, you and Old Man Gong Sun have always been really close with each other. It seems like there will be quite a competition then. And also, you guys, let’s talk about who the Old Ancestor will pass on his position to.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old Man Feng, aren’t you close with Old Man Jin? Tell us, who do you think Old Ancestor will choose to take over his position. Actually, you should know about it. You seemed have forgotten about that young man,” chuckled Xi Fatong.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui? That useless person can still take over Old Ancestor’s position?” Old man Feng said without holding back.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“So a useless person can still beat the genius in your house to a pulp?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You… you… you…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">These were all the Supreme Leaders of the Heavenly Palace who have had a lot of life experience. Most of them were the Old Ancestors in their respective aristocratic clan that were under the Heavenly Palace. Each and every one of them were the guardians of their clans.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I heard that Qing Shui is back. It’s just that I don’t know why a trash is coming back.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Very quickly, the information about Qing Shui coming back to the Heavenly Palace spread across the entire Heavenly Palace.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Trash? Even if he is a trash, he still managed to kill a Martial King Grade warrior. Can you say that you are capable of doing the same?” The previous man with a round face and a sharp chin was accused by an armoured man</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The man looked at the person in armor and left with a gloomy expression.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The man in armor was Xi Ri!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui went back to where Cang Wuya was. Di Chen, on the other hand, went back to Misty Hall Palace. After meeting Cang Wuya and Fei Wuji, he started telling them about the incidents that happened during these past few years like usual.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Tomorrow, if anyone dares to make any moves, I don’t care who it is, be ruthless to them,” chortled Fei Wuji.</p>
