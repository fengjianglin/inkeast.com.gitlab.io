 <p><strong>AST 1430 - Dragon Tamers, Green Dragon, Dragon Slaying Beast Killed the Dragon</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s sharpness has made the people from Dragon Palace drop their spectacles. This was a one-sided battle. The opponents attack didn’t have any effect on him, yet when he faced off against the opponents, it was either they got killed instantly or they were defeated with just a few pokes of his fingers.</p>
 <p>Seeing as the situation was against their favor, an old man from behind suddenly extended his hand. Dragon Palace has suffered more than half of their casualties. Even though the majority of them were the weaker warriors, there were still a lot who were False God warriors. A few of the warriors in front were even the tower of strength supporting Dragon Palace. But among these people, there were two who died before they even managed to unleash their Heavenly Sure-kill Techniques.</p>
 <p>The old man waved his hand!</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>A Green Dragon suddenly appeared in the sky. It was a huge dragon about eight hundred metres long. That loud roaring noises of it caused numbness in people’s heart. The appearance of this Green Dragon has caused the people from Dragon Palace to stable down. They were once again flaring with will to fight.</p>
 <p>The people from Battle Pavilion panicked as they saw the enormous terrifying Green Dragon. That was a dragon, an extremely powerful existence. It was an existence that was unbeatable. Even the Demon Lord and Hua Rumei who were standing on one side knitted their brows.</p>
 <p>“Do we have to make our move?” Hua Rumei was worried.</p>
 <p>“Depends on the situation. If we make our moves now, our opponents will definitely send out everything at once. Let’s only make our move when he is no longer able to hold himself against them.” The Demon Lord thought about it for a while and responded.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui probed the Wood attributed enormous Green Dragon. It should be equal in strength as the Blue Dragon from before. He never expected for there to be a Dragon Tamer in Dragon Palace. Could it be that the Dragon Palace was named after these Dragon Tamers? It left him to wonder what kind of existences there were to tame the Green Dragons, Gold Dragons as well as White Jade Dragons.</p>
 <p>The old man slowly made his way forward. The old man who knew about formations politely bowed down at this old man and moved back to one side.</p>
 <p>The enormous dragon was circling around the sky. While it was flying, its enormous body carried along so much pressure that it made people felt as if an enormous stone was pressing against their heart, rendering them unable to breath properly.</p>
 <p>“Young man, join Dragon Palace. I will ensure that you earn yourself a high position and great wealth.” The old man looked at Qing Shui and said arrogantly.</p>
 <p>“High position? Great wealth? I don’t care about those. I can earn them myself even if I am not a part of Dragon Palace.” Qing Shui smiled and said. He didn’t sound even a tiny bit nervous. This surprised the old man. The reason was that he had not met a single enemy who would still be so calm after seeing the Green Dragon.</p>
 <p>“If beautiful women or social status are what you want, I can give it to you right away.” The old man looked at Qing Shui and continued to say.</p>
 <p>“Beautiful woman? I can chase after them myself. Social status? I can earn that myself. Why must they be given to me by other people? Do you feel that you have the qualification to give them to me?” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
 <p>“I must admit that young man, you are really capable. But for someone like you, if we are unable to be friends, the only thing left for me to do will be to annihilate you as soon as possible. Are you doing this to force me to kill you?” The old man’s eyes looked really sharp when he glared at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The plain clothes the old man wore were unable to cover up for the noble aura spreading out from his body. It was obvious that he held quite a high position in Dragon Palace, or else he would never have sounded so arrogant.</p>
 <p>“Do you think that you can kill me?” Qing Shui immediately summoned his Dragon Slaying Beast.</p>
 <p>The Dragon Slaying Beast might not look big, its pernicious aura was enough to cause one to tremble in fear. The enormous creature in mid-air had actually begun to feel unsafe and circled around the sky upon seeing the Dragon Slaying Beast. It was constantly letting out soft roaring noises.</p>
 <p>“Do you believe that I am capable of striking down that dirty reptile of yours within fifteen minutes?” Qing Shui smiled and looked at the old man.</p>
 <p>“That blood species of yours is even more dirty. Stop shamelessly boasting yourself.” The old man looked at the demonic beast by Qing Shui’s side. Even though it had the head of a dragon, its body didn’t resemble how a dragon’s body should look like.</p>
 <p>All in all, that Green Dragon of his belonged to the Dragon Race. Even if the Green Dragon was really panicked before, they still communicated. He was aware that the aura emitted by that tiny beast was really fierce, but he did not think that it would be a match against the Green Dragon.</p>
 <p>“How about this? We will let the both of them fight with each other. Will you dare to accept this challenge of mine?” Qing Shui was trying to provoke the old man when he was saying it.</p>
 <p>“What have I to fear? That tiny thing is no match against the teeth of the Green Dragon.”</p>
 <p>Hearing the old man’s word, Qing Shui patted the Dragon Slaying Beast’s head.</p>
 <p>The Dragon Slaying Beast immediately departed for the sky. It was fast like a meteor. As it closed its distance with the Green Dragon, the Green Dragon panicked, the reason being that it noticed that there had been a reduction in its strength. Its overall strength went down by 20%.</p>
 <p>Prior to this, Qing Shui has already used his Phoenix Battle Intent when he was patting the Dragon Slaying Beast.</p>
 <p>The Green Dragon let out a moan. It abruptly whipped at the Dragon Slaying Beast with its enormous body.</p>
 <p>Icefire!</p>
 <p>The Dragon Slaying Beast has inherited the Ice Flame from the Blue Dragon. Not only so, the one it unleashed was one that went through mutation. It was able to neglect the opponent’s strength and had a chance of freezing its target.</p>
 <p>Pa-pa!</p>
 <p>The Dragon Slaying Beast got whipped out, but it made it back here very quickly. The ice flame from before did not manage to freeze the Green Dragon. When the old man saw the Green Dragon easily whipping off the tiny little beast, he let out a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>“See that? That’s what you call difference. It’s totally unable to get close to the body of the Green Dragon. The Green Dragon is wood attributed. Its abilities to self-recover as well as resist unusual techniques are formidable.” The old man tried to give a “kind” reminder to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. He didn’t say anything and initiated a move with his consciousness.</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Now, the Green Dragon has gone mad. It had no idea why its strength went down by 20% all of a sudden. The Emperor’s Qi reduced 20% of the opponent’s maximum strength. Now, the Green Dragon could only unleash 60% of its original strength.</p>
 <p>Speed!</p>
 <p>To the Dragon Slaying Beast, nothing was important. No matter how strong its opponent might be, so long as it did not have speed as fast as itself, it would only suffer the fate of being killed. The Green Dragon which experienced 40% reduction in speed could do nothing but only suffer the fate of getting beaten up.</p>
 <p>Peng!</p>
 <p>The Dragon Slaying Beast immediately penetrated a hole through the enormous dragon’s body. Despite its small body size, it was like a tiny calf. With such a huge hole in its body, even the enormous Green Dragon was in panic. Blood was constantly flowing out from it.</p>
 <p>This was just the beginning. It’s way too easy to take care of a dragon if that dragon wasn’t as fast as the Dragon Slaying Beast in terms of speed. Otherwise, wouldn’t this only have led to the reputation of the Dragon Slaying Beast being weakened?</p>
 <p>“You evil creature, don’t you dare!”</p>
 <p>The old man’s eyes were filled with rage. His figure flashed as he charged towards the Dragon Slaying Beast.</p>
 <p>“Old crook, you went back on your own words! Watch out for my sword!” Qing Shui said as he grinned. Actually, he had also cheated. He was considered to have assisted the Dragon Slaying Beast from his Phoenix’s Battle Intent as well as Emperor’s Qi from before. The Dragon Slaying Beast wouldn’t have been able to take down the Green Dragon so quickly otherwise. However, the people from Dragon Palace also tried to bully them with their advantage in numbers. Qing Shui felt that there was no such thing as being righteous or not, living was what’s most important. Besides, there was no need to discuss any rules with people like these who only seemingly wore the skin of the people who walked the right path yet involved themselves in human affairs.</p>
 <p>It was likely that Qing Shui himself would have done the same if his opponents have strength just like his. Nothing in this world was absolutely fair, hence, it would have been good enough if things were made fair for each other.</p>
 <p>Golden Sword!</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui swung his hand, a ray of Golden Sword shot out. Meanwhile, an enormous Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines also appeared and blocked the path of the old man.</p>
 <p>It has just been a short span of time, and the Dragon Slaying Beast has penetrated a few holes across the Green Dragon’s body. The only thing heard was terrifying dragon moaning noises. Witnessing the situation, all of the people from Dragon Palace suddenly made their move.</p>
 <p>The Demon Lord, Hua Rumei as well as Cotton Pavilion made their move all at once. Even the Old Turtle came out. Qing Shui waved his hand and summoned out a few of his demonic beasts. At the same time, he was also constantly unleashing his Emperor’s Qi at his opponents.</p>
 <p>Hong-hong!</p>
 <p>Yet another wave of Heavenly Thunder Talisman got tossed out. The entire area turned chaotic from the loud exploding noises. The noises lasted for around one breath before it slowly disappeared.</p>
 <p>Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow Formation!</p>
 <p>“I’ll let you guys witness how the true Sky Earth Yellow Xuan Formation is supposed to be like!” Qing Shui flung out the flag in his hand. Not only that, he even made use of the Nine Continents Mountain as well as those huge demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the sky turned grey. Qing Shui was also inspired from watching the formation from before. With the knowledge he possessed in formations and the fact that he witnessed the Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow Formation, Qing Shui was able to set it up immediately. This was the inspiration given by the old man when he tried to set up his own formation. A lot of the factors of the formation relied on the arrangements left behind by the old man’s Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow Formation.</p>
 <p>This was the first time Qing Shui setting up this formation. Putting that into consideration, he might not be able to set it up better than the old man.</p>
 <p>Sky Change!</p>
 <p>A lot of grey clouds appeared across the grey sky. Qing Shui shouted loudly, “Toss out the talismans!”</p>
 <p>The others once again each threw a Heavenly Thunder Talisman.</p>
 <p>The actions of them throwing the talisman triggered the thunder cloud and in a moment, causing thunders and lightning to strike down like a myriad of thunderous snakes.</p>
 <p>Earth Change!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stomped on the floor with his foot.</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>As this stomp landed on the ground, numerous craters appeared across the earth. Red flames spurted out of it, causing it to seem like a hell-like smelting furnace had appeared around the surroundings.</p>
 <p>Heavenly Thunder Give Rise to Earth Flame!</p>
 <p>As this went on, Dragon Palace suffered even more casualties.</p>
 <p>Xuan Qi Shell!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was using some unique footsteps with his legs. A gas that was visible with the naked eyes started covering the people on his side. Suddenly, all of them felt as if they had gotten heavier. Even their offensive prowess had also seemingly been increased.</p>
 <p>“Kill! Don’t leave even one of them alive!” Qing Shui gave out the order. The Formation Master had the right to do this. Let alone now, Qing Shui was already an extraordinary guy in all of the people’s eyes. Despite there being more than ten injured initially, casualties were inevitable in wars. If it had been someone else leading the team, there might have been even more than that.</p>
 <p>Peng!</p>
 <p>The green enormous dragon dropped down onto the ground. The downfall of the enormous dragon managed to lift the people from Demon Lord Palace even higher. They were even able to assault a dragon. It was a thrilling thing to be able to take part in the massacre of a dragon. It was considered a kind of experience as well as pride, a moral as well as a cohesiveness.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and the Demon Lord, Hua Rumei and the Dragon Turtle, as well as the Dragon Slaying Beast and Thunderous Beast specially worked together in order to instantly kill the formidable warriors. As for the Fire Bird and Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, killing the more ordinary strong warriors were just like cutting cabbages for them.</p>
 <p>Their combinations altogether weren’t considered a formation, but a combined assault. The combination of the Violet Lightning Strike along with the Dragon Slaying Beast was like a nightmare to the expert warriors. Everytime Qing Shui made his moves, unexpected things would happen. Sometimes, he would toss talismans. Other times, he would toss his Golden Sword and Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines. Quite a few demonic beasts would even be distracted away by a mysterious purple colored bell.</p>
 <p>The Devil Slaying Battle Blood Formation has indeed inherited the ability of Battle Blood Formation which triggered a spurt of energy within the users. Once they managed to cause the enemies to fall back, the Devil Slaying Battle Blood would definitely emerge victorious, given that there was not much of a fluctuation in the enemy's increase of strength.</p>
 <p>The traumatic experience which Qing Shui left his opponents with were too heavy. He also had a terrifying ability to weaken his opponents. Even if there had been more people on the enemies’ side, even if they unleashed their sure-kill techniques, Qing Shui would still have his methods to make up for these undesirable situations. The Heavenly Techniques of the Demon Lord were very powerful and mystical, which made Qing Shui quite surprised.</p>
 <p>To be able to earn the title Heavenly Technique, this was the brilliance of Divine Connection. It was really magical. It enabled him to unleash powers which even he himself would never dare imagine and change the tide of the battle towards his favor. Only like this could it be considered a Heavenly Technique.</p>
 <p>The people from Dragon Palace were constantly being reduced. Even the experts at the frontline and the Dragon Tamer had been killed. In just a moment, the entire situation of the battle had changed. The remaining people from Dragon Palace had all lost their motivation to continue the battle. This has greatly affected them and caused their strength to greatly reduce once again, leading to the increased casualties at an even faster speed than before.</p>
