 <p><strong>AST 893 - Golden Snake Pellet Recipe, The Success of Du Meridian Strengthening Pellet, Swallowing the Pellets</strong></p>
 <p>“An alchemy recipe?”</p>
 <p>It had been a very long time since Qing Shui had last gotten a new alchemy recipe. Although the next alchemy recipe, ‘Violet Qi Pellet’, had also appeared once, he still thought that his alchemy recipes were scarce.</p>
 <p>He quickly took out the Beast Parchment. Three words greeted his eyes as soon as he unfolded it - Golden Snake Pellet!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly took a look at the recipe. The first medicinal plant needed was the Golden Snake Grass. As he continued to read the recipe, he discovered that all the medicinal herbs listed were already fully available in that Interspatial Silk Sachet.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was now certain that the owner of this Interspatial Silk Sachet was definitely an alchemist. Additionally, he was not just an ordinary alchemist, but a rather powerful one. It was a pity. He probably didn’t think he would die here.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the effects of the Golden Snake Pellet. The Golden Snake Pellet allowed one to successfully break through to the next grade. For example, a Grade One Martial King would become a Grade Two Martial King and a Grade One Martial Saint will become a Grade Two Martial Saint. This pill was only effective for grades below Martial Emperor. Only one pellet could be consumed per year. This pill can be consumed by both demonic beasts and humans.</p>
 <p>After reading for awhile, Qing Shui discovered that this pill was no longer useful to him even though this medicinal pill was really not bad. He didn’t know how many of these Golden Snake Pellet could be concocted in one go. If only one pellet could be concocted from one Golden Snake Grass, then he might as well forget about it. It really wasn’t worth it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui put down the Golden Snake Pellet recipe along with the Interspatial Silk Sachet once again. He had gained a few more Golden Snake Grasses now. He was initially planning to fish a little for these few days. Maybe he would be able to fish up more Golden Snake Grasses. That way, he would be able to concoct the Du Meridian Strengthening Pellet immediately.</p>
 <p>It seemed like the heavens were really helping him now. So after he took a break, Qing Shui started to concoct the Du Meridian Strengthening Pellet. There was nothing to wait for, now that he had a 100% success rate.</p>
 <p>The Du Meridian Strengthening Pellet was in no way inferior to the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellet. The only differences were the sequence and the main ingredient, so the concoction went exceptionally smooth.</p>
 <p>In addition to the Golden Snake Grass, there basically wasn’t any pressure. The concoction succeeded very soon. Looking at the violet colored medicinal pellet, people who lacked knowledge would definitely think that it was a Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellet.</p>
 <p>He took a look at the effects of the Du Meridian Strengthening Pellet. The effects were the same too.</p>
 <p>Du Meridian Strengthening Pellet: Increases spirit energy and spirit energy control by 5% to 10%, depending on each individual’s body absorption. Consuming both the Ren Meridian and Du Meridian Strengthening Pellets at the same time will yield unexpected effects.</p>
 <p>The Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellet had the additional effect of clearing the Tiantu acupoint while raising strength. However, the Du Meridian Strengthening Pellet would only increase spirit energy and spiritual offense.</p>
 <p>Even so, Qing Shui still placed all of his hope on that last bit about consuming both of them at the same time. Unexpected effects, he wondered what those could be.</p>
 <p>The Ren and Du Meridians were the two most important meridians in the human body. They were also known as the Heaven and Earth Meridians. If Heaven and Earth blended together and Yin and Yang were also harmonized in his body, Qing Shui had a hunch that it would definitely cause a tremendous change.</p>
 <p>Perhaps if he consumed these two pills at the same time, he would gain the opportunity to break through to the Seventh Heavenly Layer. Qing Shui suppressed the excitement in his heart as he placed the Du Meridian Strengthening Pellet into a porcelain bottle.</p>
 <p>Both the Ren Meridian and Du Meridian Strengthening Pellets had been successfully concocted. He would consume them when he returned to the Deity Cave of Immortal. Hopefully he would be able to successfully breakthrough this time around. That way, he would truly gain a foothold in the World of the Nine Continents.</p>
 <p>The Violet Qi Pellet came out at once too. Its experience was still stuck at one million points, he realized that accumulating experience now seemed to be way more difficult than before.</p>
 <p>He didn’t know what effect this Violet Qi Pellet would have either. It was better for him to rest his body and mind for a few days. By the time his body reached its peak condition, he would be able to consume the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellet and the Du Meridian Strengthening Pellet.</p>
 <p>The next day, Qing Shui practiced his Taichi Fist and Back Connecting Fist on the beach. The Back Connecting Fist always reminded him of that Long-armed Vicious Monkey King. Although he had only seen a single punch from that gigantic Vicious Monkey King, he knew that its punch was at a much higher realm than his Back Connecting Fist. The Howling Moon Silver Ape in that temple that he had seen a long time ago simply couldn’t be compared to this Long-armed Vicious Monkey King.</p>
 <p>That Golden Jiao never appeared again after going into the water. Qing Shui didn’t spend any more effort on it for now either. He was prepared to leave in two days.</p>
 <p>He wasn’t going to cultivate nor refine demons right now. He was just going to practice his Taichi Fist at most. He did the same too when he was in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. He’d just walk around to nourish his heart and calm his mind.</p>
 <p>During day time he would fish. Sometimes things were just this odd. It was easier to achieve something when one wasn’t adamant about it. On the contrary, one wouldn’t be able to achieve what they desired no matter how hard they tried when they were adamant about it. This kind of phenomenon was difficult to explain with words.</p>
 <p>After obtaining that Interspatial Silk Sachet, Qing Shui was no longer obsessed with getting his hands on the Golden Snake Grass. Nonetheless, he was still able to get five of them in just these two days…...</p>
 <p>This made Qing Shui feel a little incredulous. He then planted all the Golden Snake Grasses he found into the water.</p>
 <p>Two days passed by a flash, yet these two days still felt quite slow to Qing Shui. That Golden Jiao still hadn’t appeared in the past two days. Qing Shui didn’t have any intentions of taking a look at the bottom of this inner sea either.</p>
 <p>The most important thing now was to consume the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellet and the Du Meridian Strengthening Pellet.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui made his way towards the Deity Cave of Immortal along with the Five-Headed Demonic Spider. He could quickly cover 10,000 li without even using the Nine Continents Steps. After all, he had the Five-Headed Demonic Spider beside him. With nothing to worry about, he was able to return to the 100,000 li zone in just a little more than a day.</p>
 <p>The outward journey and the return journey felt entirely different. In just a short amount of time, he was able to arrive at that Deity Cave of Immortal by noon.</p>
 <p>The Deity Cave of Immortal was usually quite concealed, unless they had been discovered by someone. Just like that Deity Cave of Immortal in the Wolf Fang City, it had pretty much become a well-known place by now.</p>
 <p>The entrance to this Deity Cave of Immortal remained as concealed as usual. He had killed a few Violent Blood Bears here before. He discovered that it was very peaceful and quiet here this time. There were only a few small beasts after he entered but they would flee quickly.</p>
 <p>Even though the inner hall was underground and should have been very dark, there were still some light stones and luminous pearls so it wasn’t dark at all here. On top of that, light also seeped through the cave entrance.</p>
 <p>The Five-Headed Demonic Spider was left outside the great hall. With it around here, Qing Shui wasn’t worried about any demonic beasts coming to bother him. He sat cross-legged at the inner hall entrance and started to slowly activate the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui only stood up after about two hours. He took out the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellet and the Du Meridian Strengthening Pellet before quickly consuming them. It wasn’t like the two had to be consumed at precisely the same time. As long as they were both consumed within the same 15 minute, it could be considered as consuming at the same time.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was gambling this time. He was aware that consuming two pellets at the same time would definitely be very dangerous. This was why he had used a period of time to rest his body up and only decided to consume the pills once his body had recovered to its peak condition.</p>
 <p>Besides, this was the Deity Cave of Immortal. When strong medicinal pellets were consumed here, the body could resist the potency of the medicinal pellets with the help of the cave’s powerful suppression. This would also aid the absorption process a little.</p>
 <p>As soon as the two medicinal pellets were swallowed, a wave of heat and a refreshing sensation simultaneously rose up. Each sensation coursed along their respective meridians. Its speed was slow yet vigorous.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t dare to be slow as well. He stood there as he activated the Ancient Strengthening Technique. Rather than trying to deliberately absorb that wave of energy, he used the Ancient Strengthening Technique to further strengthen his meridians. But then again, every small cycle of the Ancient Strengthening Technique would absorb some of that energy.</p>
 <p>The two waves of energies became increasingly strong. He was being fully imbued by that violent energy to the brim. Other than that, the waves of refreshing sensations had directly flowed to the ‘Niwan Palace’ that was deep in his sea of consciousness. Even that mysterious Yin-Yang Image was glowing with a magnificent radiance. Although it was glowing magnificently, the color was still dull and simple.</p>
 <p>The energy within his body was growing stronger. Qing Shui unconsciously took a step forward, using the suppression of the Deity Cave of Immortal to resist that powerful surging energy.</p>
 <p>One would still need to ensure that their meridians were powerful and tough enough before utilizing the Deity Cave of Immortal’s suppression. Otherwise, they would still explode. Qing Shui was quite confident about the toughness of his own meridians but he still didn’t dare to be reckless.</p>
 <p>Nature Energy activated automatically, allowing Qing Shui’s body to behave as if it had an air vent. This was one of the effects that could be achieved when Grade Six Nature Energy was activated. It was now playing a very useful role. For instance, if a person was trapped in an airtight cell, he wouldn’t suffocate in there if a hole about the size of a pea was made.</p>
 <p>If a huge balloon had a tiny pinhole in it, then you wouldn’t be able to blow it until it exploded!</p>
 <p>That was like a type of diversion, yet it was different. This was because Nature Energy was the purest energy between the Heaven and Earth. With Nature Energy, some impure Qi could be condensed, refined and transformed into essence. The useless parts would then be expelled. That way, more space could be made available in the meridians and the Dantian.</p>
 <p>Grade Six Nature Energy was quite powerful after all, it was able to actually stabilize his body almost immediately. Qing Shui sensed that the violet energy in his body was still increasing. He was happy yet anxious at the same time.</p>
 <p>The increase was simply too rapid. This made Qing Shui worried. Would he really die from his body exploding? The Heavenly Dan of his Upper Dantian was also rapidly circulating right now. The golden brilliance shone at the meridians in the surroundings.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s skeleton turned into a faint golden color at this very moment. Qing Shui foot moved a step forward. His face was already crimson.</p>
 <p>……...</p>
 <p>The energy within his body was still increasing violently. Qing Shui was already all the way in the middle of the hall. His body was already at its limit.</p>
 <p>It would be a complete lie if he said he wasn’t worried. Qing Shui clenched his teeth as he once again helplessly took another step forward!</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>A wave of crimson Qi force exploded from his left shoulder. Only his clothes stopped the blood from splattering all over the place. Qing Shui had no choice but to divert his Qi force to preserve the overall situation by shifting the damage to only one part of his body.</p>
 <p>He circulated the Ancient Strengthening Technique with even more vigor. Every small cycle would let the Qi force in his body dissipate a little, yet it was increasing even more.</p>
 <p>Just when Qing Shui wanted to use the same method again, a loud and clear noise rang out from his Upper Dantian area. This shock very quickly turned into exultation.</p>
 <p>It turned out that the Grade Five Upper Dantian that never had any activity had broken through at this very moment. The violent energy within his body rushed towards his Upper Dantian like waves.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was dazed. His Grade Six Upper Dantian had experienced some qualitative changes. Although it wasn’t as powerful as the Dantian in his abdomen, it finally looked like a real Dantian now. That golden pearl had dissolved and it was the factor that allowed for the Upper Dantian to become stronger.</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, Qing Shui’s body felt extremely relaxed. Even so, he didn’t dare to slack off because the violent energy was still increasing in his body. The Nature Energy was also circulating rapidly.</p>
