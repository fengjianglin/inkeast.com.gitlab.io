 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We are really not that ambitious. We just wanted to check out the Northern Ocean. It’s quite meaningless to keep staying in the Ice Ocean Domain,” Yiye Jiange said and smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui grinned listening to her words. Those days, Yiye Jiange wouldn’t say such words. Now, she could relax, as her domestic affairs were done. Now that she was his woman, Qing Shui reckoned she was the most settled one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Initially, she was the calmest one with a mystical and otherworldly aura. Unexpectedly, she would give such a reason. Qing Shui was pleased after hearing that, because Yiye Jiange had imperceptibly changed too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the three years Qing Shui was away, Yiye Jiange only returned home three times. Each time, she hurriedly dropped by for the Chinese New Year celebration. The remaining days were spent in the Sunset Sea King Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I met an Ancient Golden Shrimp General at the martial territories. He is the guardian of one entrances to the Northern Ocean. I wonder which force he belongs to? Jiange, can you guess?” Qing Shui asked randomly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In the North Ocean Domain, there are only a few forces which have Ancient Golden Shrimp Generals. The North Sea Dragon Palace, North Sea Dragon Valley, North Sea Dragon Cave, and North Sea Dragon Lagoon are four of the strongest forces in the Northern Ocean.” Yiye Jiange smiled. They apparently had preliminary understandings about the Northern Sea now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui pondered. Being able to guard the entrance of the Northern Ocean and the extremely formidable strength based off of their tone, Qing Shui concluded that they should be from one of the four forces that she mentioned earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui would find it ridiculous if it was the North Sea Dragon Palace. Though he didn’t hold grudges against the North Sea Dragon Palace, it was definitely tough to befriend them due to the North Sea Dragon King Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Given his current status and the Sunset Sea King Palace, the opponent shouldn’t be able to handle them. It was not absolute superiority, but Qing Shui had gained more confidence now that the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had upgraded to the Ninth Layer. He didn’t need to worry even if the North Sea Dragon Palace came. He believed he could make a solid stand if a battle took place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn’t worried about anybody wanting to harm the Sunset Sea King Palace this time. There was no challenger to be fearful of. The North Sea Dragon King Palace was once a powerful force, but they were destroyed by the Sunset Sea King Palace. Whoever wanted to challenge him would have to weigh his own capability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A month later, the Sunset Sea King Palace completely finished moving. Qing Shui and a few others moved within three days. The forces of the Sunset Sea King Palace were entirely different that before, let alone the strengths of the three Mistresses. Apart from that, they had Qing Shui as their guardian, the previous men from the Sunset Palace and Sea King Palace, the followers from the North Sea Dragon King Palace, and other fighters. Their strengths had improved greatly in these three years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even now, after moving to the North Sea Dragon King Palace’s location, their existence was like a powerful overlord. Anyways, the Sunset Sea King Palace remained low profile and not overly flamboyant. They were never timid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui noticed that life was peaceful after entering the Northern Ocean. Still, there was one thing that made Qing Shui overjoyed. Yiye Jiange unexpectedly became pregnant. Both of them had strong inner spirits and could sense it within a few days of conception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had been with Yiye Jiange for more than one month this time, so it was surprising to him. He didn’t spend much time with Yiye Jiange previously, only intermittent intervals. This matter could never be rushed, and he had planned to make long-term preparations for it too. Unexpectedly, it came so soon this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui loved having a kid with Yiye Jiange from the bottom of his heart, and he wanted one with Tantai Lingyan too. However, he needed more time with Tantai Lingyan. He felt that Tantai Lingyan needed a kid the most, as she would be less lonely afterward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stared at the remarkable beauty before getting lost in his thoughts. He just told her the news of her conception. She had felt it too, but she had gained Qing Shui’s reassurance now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why aren't you happy?” Qing Shui smiled and asked, knowing that Yiye Jiange was actually delighted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, I just thought it came too suddenly,” Yiye Jiange smiled, gazing at Qing Shui. A smile of love and happiness was written all over her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How was this sudden? We've been together for so long doing things. It's supposed to have happened already,” Qing Shui giggled. It was indeed not easy to be pregnant at this level of strength. This was the warriors’ burden. The stronger a warrior was, the older he aged, and basically, it was close to impossible to have children anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, it &nbsp;wasn’t a clear-cut thing, but the probability was extremely scarce. Nevertheless, there were many powerful warriors who had their heirs at old age. It would be always celebrated by a huge-scale banquet with guests. It was a very blissful event.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s life energy was unrivaled and his strength was very formidable. Such a probability for him was thus very high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange raised her hand and knocked on Qing Shui’s head, “You're still such a rogue. You've never been serious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are my woman. How am I like a rogue? Would you like a daughter or a son?” Qing Shui said, smiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I like both! He or she will be our kid,” A benevolent and pure smile crept onto Yiye Jiange’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a pleasant thing. At that very moment, the other two Mistresses came, overhearing part of their conversation. As they learned of the great news, they were elated and decided to hold a celebration banquet on that day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In spite of the name ‘banquet’, they were the only guests. Qing Shui cooked while Muyun Qingge and the Sunset Palace Mistress talked to Yiye Jiange. Though they offered help, Qing Shui refused, as he was able to quickly complete such a simple task by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Halfway through the banquet, the Sunset Palace Mistress lost her focus shortly, twice. As her mind went absent, she looked at Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange. In fact, everyone felt her affection towards Qing Shui. Yet, it was all up to their destiny. No one could say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the hardest thing to bear or enjoy a beauty’s favor. Qing Shui was overwhelmed by this feeling. It was miserable to be without a woman, but it was also burdensome to have many women, especially when he already had more than ten remarkably beautiful women like Yiye Jiange. Deep inside his heart, he didn’t want to engage with anybody else. It made him feel avaricious and sorry for his women.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s a happy day today. It’s great for all of us in the Sunset Sea King Palace to set up in the Northern Ocean. Cheers,” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Also, Jiange is pregnant. This is a huge affair. I’m really looking forward to having this kid. No matter what, he has to address me as his godmother,” said Sunset Palace Mistress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Sis Qingcheng, you ought to have a few more kids in the future since you like children so much,” Muyun Qingge said jokingly.</span></p>
