 <p><strong>Chapter 186 Yan Clan, Yan Jiang Country, Ruler of a Country.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 186 – Yan Clan, Yan Jiang Country, Ruler of a Country</strong></p>
  <p>“Master, when is the triennial Inter-sect Exchange Competition going to start?”</p>
  <p>Yiye Jiange, who was walking alongside Qing Shui on the stairs, smiled and looked at him. “It will officially start in ten days. Some of the major sects and clans in Cang Lang Country will be here in five days.”</p>
  <p>“Master, in Greencloud Continent, what is the ranking for Cang Lang Country?” Qing Shui recalled that there were eighty-one countries just in the Greencloud Continent alone. It would be better for him to have a better understanding of Cang Lang Country so that he would be able to make comparisons in the future.</p>
  <p>Yiye Jiange laughed and said, “Cang Lang Country is located at the most western area of the Greencloud Continent, enjoying a warm climate. It is neither as harsh as the north’s Shenglu Continent nor does it permeate amongst the deities’ aura as the east’s Shengshen Continent. Therefore, amongst the nine continents, the Greencloud Continent is ranked the last. Cang Lang Country is also one of the least regarded countries. The environment gives rise to its people. The north’s Shenglu Continent is freezing cold, thus the people are all resilient. The east’s Shengshen Continent is full of cultivating geniuses, and has the most number of people who have reached the Divine realm.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui did not expect that Cang Lang Country was seen to be down in the dumps. He asked helplessly, “How is Cang Lang Country compared to Yan Jiang Country?”</p>
  <p>Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui for a while before she slowly said, “Yan Jiang Country is more southwards from the center of the Greencloud Continent and is very close to Cang Lang Country. It can be ranked among the top 20, if not higher, across the Greencloud Continent.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui once asked Baili Jingwei about the Yan Clan’s abilities, but was told that their real abilities were unknown. Now, Qing Shui guessed that Old Master Baili was probably afraid that the truth might have dealt a blow on him. With his experience, how could he not understand what Qing Shui thought?</p>
  <p>He had thought to go there in a few years time after he had reached the pinnacle of Xiantian. However, even in such a disregarded country like Cang Lang Country, anyone who had reached the pinnacle of Xiantian would not be able to get his way so easily. After all, there was an ape in the mountains who had reached the pinnacle of Xiantian.</p>
  <p>Yan Jian Country was ranked among the top 20, and Yan Clan was the most prominent clan in the country. Qing Shui recalled what his mother had told him before, which was that the Yan Clan was a big clan in Yan City. She did not say that Yan City was Yan Jiang Country, nor did she said that the Yan Clan was the strongest clan in Yan Jiang Country. She must have been worried that Qing Shui would be frightened. While she had hoped that he would be able to have the strength to head to the Yan Clan, she had tried to stop him each time. Only now could Qing Shui understand the reason behind the efforts reflected in her eyes.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui finally understood that when he had promised his mother that within five years he would head for the Yan Clan, his mother had seemed agitated. She was in no way relaxed. His mother was, in fact, worried for him since he had declared that he would let the Yan Clan suffer a worse pain they had endured. </p>
  <p>“Five years, at most five years. I still must head for the Yan Clan.” Qing Shui’s determination did not falter.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was aware that if he were to head for Yan Clan, he must raise his Ancient Strengthening Technique to the 5th layer. Only then would he have a thin strand of hope, since it was almost certain that the Yan Clan would have people who at least attained the realm of Martial King.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, I understand that you may have also experienced tough events in the past. You now know that I too carry a heavy burden of a blood feud, but I’d still like to tell you this. Don’t act on impulse, and don’t let those who are alive feel sad again. Don’t let those who are gone be unable to leave in peace. If you know that it’s impossible, it’s better to forget about it.” Yiye Jiange looked into the far distance and said softly.</p>
  <p>“Master, don’t worry. I will not do anything stupid. However, I will not forget, ever. I will just bury it aside for now until the day comes when I unearth it out myself, prying it open bit by bit.” Qing Shui said calmly, but that determined tone had no tinge of doubt.</p>
  <p>“I had thought that I had forgotten. Till now, I can still remember my father’s hoarse cries saying ‘Tian Er, Ge Er, once you leave, don’t ever come back. Remember, don’t ever come back. And don’t think about revenge. You must live on well, live on…’” Yiye Jiange said, her eyes brimming in tears.</p>
  <p>“Do you now see hope with Luan Luan?”</p>
  <p>“Yes, but only hope. I do not wish for her to carry these burdens. I only hope for her to live on with her life. But her Seven Apertures Mystical Heart…if she’s willing to train and put in effort, she would be able to reach the realm of the Martial King by the age of 30. She would be able to tame ten demonic beasts who have reached the pinnacle of the Martial King.” Yiye Jiange said bitterly, looking at Luan Luan who was very happy.</p>
  <p>“Why is it that you don’t look happy to find out that Luan Luan has a Seven Apertures Mystical Heart?” Qing Shui asked, puzzled.</p>
  <p>The two of them walked up the stairways, following behind Luan Luan as they headed for the peak of the mountain. She then said bitterly, “The entire world of the nine continents is aware that those with a Seven Apertures Mystical Heart are able to become top experts. However, who would know that these people would only have a lifespan of 30 years, a quarter of the lifespan of an ordinary person?”</p>
  <p>Her words caused Qing Shui to be stunned. He now knows why Yiye Jiange was doubtful that Luan Luan had a Seven Apertures Mystical Heart when she first heard about the other two demonic beasts. After realizing it, she was both surprised and pained.</p>
  <p>Heaven holds jealousy for those with talent. It would treat a person as a scale. When an additional trait is given on one end, the other end would also be given a quality of equivalent weight to maintain the balance. It was just that the items placed on both ends were opposites in nature.</p>
  <p>Seeing how Qing Shui stood rooted to the spot, Yiye Jiange sighed. She felt a tinge of warmth seeing how he acted, feeling happy that there was someone who would worry for the lass.</p>
  <p>“Is there any way to salvage the situation or anything that can increase her lifespan?” Qing Shui came back to his senses. His brows were tightly knitted, as if burning in fury.</p>
  <p>“The Peach of Immortality which matures every 2000 years can increase the lass’s lifespan by 50 years, but it is something that you can only come across with luck. The legendary Divine Sarira of Buddhism, and the alchemists’ divine medicine, Golden Fragrant Jade, can also do the same. There’s also the legendary Reincarnation Flower of the 6 paths, the alchemists’ supremely divine medicine, Ten Fragrant Rejuvenation Pellet and the Nine Twist Fate Extending Pellet.</p>
  <p>“This is really an unexpected turn of events. To think that there are so many items that can increase one’s lifespan. Just from the names alone, it’s obvious that these are all rare treasures.” What amazed Qing Shui was that Golden Fragrant Jade could increase a lifespan by fifty years. To think that the Ten Fragrant Rejuvenation Pellet was a divine medicine which could negate the negative impacts of the Seven Aperture Mystical Heart. As for the Nine Twist Fate Extending Pellet., Qing Shui was not sure about it. Wasn’t that just a 2nd grade medicine? Seems like the information he had before was just the tip of the iceberg. </p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s thoughts ran to his alchemy. He decided to devote more time towards his craft and his collection of rare herbs because Qing Shui knew that the ingredients required for refining the Golden Fragrant Jade and Ten Fragrant Rejuvenation Pellet would all be hard to come by.</p>
  <p>“Master, what about the other items which can increase one’s lifespan?” Qing Shui refused to give up and asked Yiye Jiange.</p>
  <p>“Other than the Longevity Fruit which can increase your lifespan by five years, the other items are mostly useless. Moreover, those stuff generally can only be taken once and increase longevity by very little.” Yiye Jiange said helplessly.</p>
  <p>“Longevity Fruit? Is it easy to find?”</p>
  <p>“The Longevity Fruit is on the same grade as the 100-Year Fiery Power Fruit and the Clear Wind Fruit, and would require the same amount of time to mature.” Yiye Jiange was slightly surprised that Qing Shui did not know about the Longevity Fruit.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui now knew and guess that it was probably one of the attribute fruits which had yet to appear. Qing Shui felt a bit happier now knowing that each person could probably take two, and increase his lifespan by ten years. Seems like he would need to raise the level of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to the 4th, or even 5th level.</p>
  <p>He slept with two ladies to raise it to the 3rd level. Even after he did it a few more times with Mingyue Gelou, there was no change to the realm. Was it because he needed to do it with different women?</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled bitterly. Could it be that the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was extremely lewd? Moreover, it was not something he was too sure of. For Luan Luan’s sake, he may need to consider this option.</p>
  <p>“Daddy, Auntie, faster! You guys are so slow!” The lass had already made it to the peak and called out to Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange.</p>
  <p>Being called Daddy in front of Yiye Jiange, Qing Shui felt especially awkward. Each time Yiye Jiange would teasingly look at Qing Shui, she revealed an intoxicating charm on her beautiful face which transcended the earth.</p>
  <p>“Master, which are the usual sects that would take part in the Sect Exchange Competition? How is the competition done?” Qing Shui ducked Yiye Jiange’s teasing gaze and said while he carried Luan Luan who had pounced over.</p>

 <p>“The Peach of Immortality which matures every 2000 years can increase the lass’s lifespan by 50 years, but it is something that you can only come across with luck. The legendary Divine Sarira of Buddhism, and the alchemists’ divine medicine, Golden Fragrant Jade, can also do the same. There’s also the legendary Reincarnation Flower of the 6 paths, the alchemists’ supremely divine medicine, Ten Fragrant Rejuvenation Pellet and the Nine Twist Fate Extending Pellet.</p>
 <p>“This is really an unexpected turn of events. To think that there are so many items that can increase one’s lifespan. Just from the names alone, it’s obvious that these are all rare treasures.” What amazed Qing Shui was that Golden Fragrant Jade could increase a lifespan by fifty years. To think that the Ten Fragrant Rejuvenation Pellet was a divine medicine which could negate the negative impacts of the Seven Aperture Mystical Heart. As for the Nine Twist Fate Extending Pellet., Qing Shui was not sure about it. Wasn’t that just a 2nd grade medicine? Seems like the information he had before was just the tip of the iceberg. </p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s thoughts ran to his alchemy. He decided to devote more time towards his craft and his collection of rare herbs because Qing Shui knew that the ingredients required for refining the Golden Fragrant Jade and Ten Fragrant Rejuvenation Pellet would all be hard to come by.</p>
 <p>“Master, what about the other items which can increase one’s lifespan?” Qing Shui refused to give up and asked Yiye Jiange.</p>
 <p>“Other than the Longevity Fruit which can increase your lifespan by five years, the other items are mostly useless. Moreover, those stuff generally can only be taken once and increase longevity by very little.” Yiye Jiange said helplessly.</p>
 <p>“Longevity Fruit? Is it easy to find?”</p>
 <p>“The Longevity Fruit is on the same grade as the 100-Year Fiery Power Fruit and the Clear Wind Fruit, and would require the same amount of time to mature.” Yiye Jiange was slightly surprised that Qing Shui did not know about the Longevity Fruit.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui now knew and guess that it was probably one of the attribute fruits which had yet to appear. Qing Shui felt a bit happier now knowing that each person could probably take two, and increase his lifespan by ten years. Seems like he would need to raise the level of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to the 4th, or even 5th level.</p>
 <p>He slept with two ladies to raise it to the 3rd level. Even after he did it a few more times with Mingyue Gelou, there was no change to the realm. Was it because he needed to do it with different women?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled bitterly. Could it be that the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was extremely lewd? Moreover, it was not something he was too sure of. For Luan Luan’s sake, he may need to consider this option.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, Auntie, faster! You guys are so slow!” The lass had already made it to the peak and called out to Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange.</p>
 <p>Being called Daddy in front of Yiye Jiange, Qing Shui felt especially awkward. Each time Yiye Jiange would teasingly look at Qing Shui, she revealed an intoxicating charm on her beautiful face which transcended the earth.</p>
 <p>“Master, which are the usual sects that would take part in the Sect Exchange Competition? How is the competition done?” Qing Shui ducked Yiye Jiange’s teasing gaze and said while he carried Luan Luan who had pounced over.</p>
