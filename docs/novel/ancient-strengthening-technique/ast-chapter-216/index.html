 <p><strong>Chapter 216 Nine Yin Body, Turning Ordinary into Extraordinary..</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 216 – Nine Yin Body, Turning Ordinary into Extraordinary.</strong></p>
  <p>“It’s you?” The woman’s magnetic and hoarse voice sounded. Her beautiful eyes were clear as water. Her slighted pouted small mouth opened in astonishment as she looked at Qing Shui unbelievably. </p>
  <p>“You all are acquainted with Ye`er?” The old man was astonished.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui awkwardly laughed. How should he put it? Should he tell the old person that he was the one who injured his granddaughter before?</p>
  <p>“We met once, but we are not very familiar with each other, and only spoke for a short while.” The girl who was named Ye`er smiled as she replied. Her gait of walking had an implicit charm in the rhythm of her steps, however, compared to back then, she appeared slightly more haggard.</p>
  <p>“Grandpa, why did you bring them here?” The girl walked towards them and embraced the old man with a hug, as she gazed at Qing Shui, Canghai Mingyue, and Huoyun Liu-Li with surprise in her eyes.</p>
  <p>A radiant smile lit up on the face of the girl as she saw Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun. “Elder sisters, both of you are celestial beauties. I’ve never seen anyone that could be comparable to both sisters in all the time I have been alive.”</p>
  <p>After which, she turned her gaze to Qing Shui while a shameless laughter could be seen in her eyes.</p>
  <p>“Younger sister, you are praising us too much. You are much more prettier when compared to us.” Canghai Mingyue smiled as she replied, causing Qing Shui to be speechless. Although she was polite and the girl was really beautiful, she had a certain smell about her that was incomparable. For example, if they were in bed, Qing Shui could be absolutely sure that her charm wouldn’t lose out to Canghai Mingyue and Yiye Jiange combined.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was slightly muddleheaded after seeing the girl. However, he didn’t really have much interest in those from the Joyous Sect, so he didn’t say anything much either.</p>
  <p>“Old man, are you from the Joyous Sect?” Qing Shui stared at the old man as he asked.</p>
  <p>“Come, come, everyone let’s take a seat first before we talk.” The old man ushered them into their seats as he started pouring tea for them. Qing Shui didn’t drink the tea, and had the tea cup held within his hands.</p>
  <p>“Old man, let’s talk about the matter of your granddaughter!” Qing Shui said as he directly cut to the chase.</p>
  <p>“Okay, okay. Ever since she was young, the body of Ye`er had an abundance of Yin energy, and was the fabled legendary body of Nine Yin. She would never be able to live past the age of 35. I’ve tried looking for many doctors and alchemists but they were all helpless to do anything. In the end, they gave a suggestion that was the most basic and practical – to find things that extend her life force. Using the Longevity Fruit to negate the Yin energy in her body, she could live longer.” The old man spoke straightforwardly despite Ye`er being here. Seems like Ye`er already knew about her own body condition.</p>
  <p>After Qing Shui heard the words of the old man, he shifted his gaze onto Ye`er and used his Heavenly Vision Technique to scan the body of Ye`er. “No wonder she would be older than 30, but to think that she actually had the same pure jade type of bone structure as that of Huoyun-Liu Li, which probably accounted for her charm. However, the Yin energy within her body was so intense that it was terrifying. Indeed, this was probably the Nine Yin body of the legends.”</p>
  <p>“Would you allow me to take your pulse?” Qing Shui gently spoke as he gazed at the girl.</p>
  <p>After a moment of hesitation, the girl extended her jade-like hand out. Qing Shui didn’t look down on her just because she was from the Joyous Sect. It was because Qing Shui knew that she was still ‘pure’. There was basically no one who would be able to Duo Cultivate with her. No one would be able to stand the coldness of her Yin energy flooding their bodies.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui also knew that although she couldn’t live past the age of 35, the Nine Yin body made her a cultivation genius. Although she was already at the Xiantian Realm, one of the restrictions of having the legendary body was that her lifespan wouldn’t increase despite breaking through to Xiantian.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui held her wrist as he squinted his eyes. Although the smoothness of her skin felt ethereal to the touch, Qing Shui didn’t have the heart to enjoy the sensation at that moment. He realised that at the point of direct contact, the cultivation art from the Spring Palace Portrait automatically started circulating on its own. It was many times more powerful and smooth when compared to the past.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt that the flowing Qi in his body was extremely stimulated by the Yin Qi of Ye`er. The stimulation was to such a great extent that even naughty notions started appearing in his head. He had a feeling that if he were to duo-cultivate and have sex with this woman, the cultivation art from the Spring Palace Portrait would definitely cause his power to increase tenfolds over.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui didn’t know that at the moment he held the wrist of Ye`er, her Duo Cultivation method also automatically circulated. It also similarly gave her an impulse to want to Duo Cultivate with Qing Shui. Only now did she know why that scenario happened during the day in the Skysword Sect. Just thinking of this caused her charming face to redden like a ripe tomato. </p>
  <p>“There are several methods that could cure you. We only need to balance the amount of Yin Energy in your body.” Qing Shui released his hold of reluctance as he slowly explained. A feeling of unwillingness blossomed in his heart.</p>
  <p>“What are the methods? Could you let me know?” The girl smiled at Qing Shui without any traces of pessimism, which caused Qing Shui to silently sigh. “What a strong girl…”</p>
  <p>“I will directly say it then. The easiest method is to find a man with a legendary Yang body and enter Duo Cultivation with him. Use his extreme Yang to balance your extreme Yin.”</p>
  <p>The words of Qing Shui caused the three ladies on the scene to blushed. So what if she was from the Joyous Sect? She hadn’t experienced a man yet.</p>
  <p>The old man didn’t have too much of a reaction. He only turned to Qing Shui, asking. “How would we know if he had a Yang body?”</p>
  <p>“Bodies of extreme Yang and Yin are relative and in opposition to each other. The Yang Qi of Xiantian is too overwhelming and would need to enter union with females to offset some of the abundant Yang energy. The best way to find a body of extreme Yang is to see if that guy… hmmmm… pleasures countless women every day.” Qing Shui awkwardly rubbed his nose. His heavy deposition from earlier was nowhere to be seen.</p>
  <p>“Ah, so that’s the method? Is there another better, more effective method?” The old man sighed as he continued asking.</p>
  <p>“Find an object of extreme Yang. For example, the legendary Dragon Yang Fruit. Only the Dragon Yang Fruit would work. For other objects of extreme Yang, they may cause the body to explode when ingested. Another alternative is the Fire Phoenix’s Blood. It would work as well.”</p>
  <p>The old man went silent, and so did the three girls. The Dragon Yang was a legendary fruit while the blood of the Fire Phoenix was something that was even more legendary than legend.</p>
  <p>“Those items cannot be sought out, and one can only obtain them through great fortune. I’m merely listing out the possibilities. Actually, I still have a method that can bring relief to her. Although this item of mine is not some heavenly treasure, it should still be able to somewhat counteract her abundance of Yin energy. At the very least, she should be able to live till the age of 50.” Qing Shui thought if the blood of his golden turtle as well as the blood from the 1,000 Year Clam could all be considered Yang-type treasures. Although their effectiveness could not be on par with the Dragon Yang Fruit or the Fire Phoenix’s Blood, they would still be effective to a certain extent.</p>
  <p>“Really? Is what you say real?” The old man agitatedly stood up, his eyes flickered with a brilliant glow as he stared at Qing Shui.<br></p>
  <p>The girl trembled as she saw the reactions of her grandpa. All these years, her grandpa had painstakingly invited renowned alchemists and doctors all over the continent, not hesitating to bring out all his treasures in exchange for their diagnosis and life-extending objects. It was all for her sake.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>He was the only kin and support she had left after her parents passed away. The tears of happiness, akin to a piece of pure, white jade, flowed down her face.</p>
  <p>“Give me a day, and I will return!” Qing Shui stood up as he spoke.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li also stood up, and so did Ye`er who mirrored their actions in a panic.</p>
  <p>“How can I still trouble you so? Would you, kind sir, please leave your address behind? This old man will go over to collect it.” The old man hurriedly added.</p>
  <p>“Don’t worry, I will bring it over. The things I’ve said, I will make sure to keep them.” Qing Shui knew that the old man was still worried and didn’t trust him fully. It was not that the old man didn’t believe Qing Shui couldn’t produce the items, but rather the effectiveness of them.</p>
  <p>The old man laughed embarrassedly. His attempts to convince Qing Shui to stay longer was rebuffed by Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Sir, you can take a look at the herbal ingredients below. Everything here is for you if you desire them.” The old man didn’t mind if his entire hoard of herbs was taken away. In exchange, his granddaughter would be able to live till the age of 50.</p>
  <p>“No, Let’s hurry, and let me cure her first!” Qing Shui happily smiled in response.</p>
  <p>However, Qing Shui didn’t expect that the old man was so passionate. He was insisting?no, demanding him that he at least take an item away today. After much hesitation, Qing Shui finally accepted the 1000 year old ginseng and left. Looking at the departing back view of Qing Shui, a warm smile broke out on the countenance of the old man.<br></p>
  <p>“Grandpa, thank you…”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The old man ruffled the hair of his granddaughter, “Silly girl, there’s no need to thank your grandpa. It’s all my fault that I couldn’t save your parents back then. So what if I sacrifice my remaining lifespan now? I must ensure that you live to 100 at the very least.”</p>
  <p>“Grandpa!”</p>
  <p>Tears continued flowing down Ye`er face, as she sobbed, “Ye`er is content as long as grandpa is here with me. Ye`er doesn’t want grandpa to sacrifice his life. Grandpa is Ye`er’s only kin now.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui and the two girls left the medicinal store, fiddling with the box that contain the 1,000 year ginseng in his hands. “If I run away now, does that make me a professional swindler?”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui snickered.</p>
  <p>Huoyun stared at Qing Shui dumbly before she too joined in the laughter.</p>
  <p>“Yeah, you would definitely be considered a professional swindler. What a pity that you are not one. If you are one, your reactions and actions just now were too perfect.” Canghai Mingyue also laughed.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, how did you get acquainted with that pretty girl?” Huoyun asked amidst her laughter.</p>
  <p>“You wouldn’t believe it even if I tell you.” Qing Shui remembered how he injured her, and couldn’t help but feel hesitant if it really happened.</p>
  <p>“Try me. Were you the hero that saved the damsel in distress or something?” Huoyun and Canghai Mingyue blinked their seductive pairs of phoenix eyes while looking at him.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui laughed bitterly as he recounted what had happened.</p>
  <p>“What? You injured her? For real?” Huoyun asked in shock.</p>
  <p>“Even you think of this, no wonder those guys said that I’m merciless. Sigh, beautiful girls have the advantage anywhere they go. Do you know what is beauty that topples kingdoms?” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
  <p>“Of course I know the idiom, I saw in some books before. Why are you asking this?” Canghai Mingyue curiously stared at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Because both of you are clearly females belonging to that standard of beauty.” Qing Shui replied as he walked forward.</p>
  <p>“Stupid Qing Shui, smelly Qing Shui. How could our beauty topple the kingdoms?” Huoyun Liu-Li stood at the back as she pouted.</p>
  <p>“… Obviously the two of you can.” Qing Shui speechlessly replied.</p>
  <p>“Cheap mouth, stop exaggerating.” Huoyun’s pink face pouted once again as she casted a glance at Qing Shui. Ignoring Qing Shui, both Huoyun and Canghai Mingyue walked away.</p>
  <p>That night, Qing Shui cultivated 12 Small Revitalizing Pellets in his spatial realm, in addition to getting the blood of the 1,000 year clam, golden turtle, and even from his fire bird.</p>
  <p>Looking at the painstakingly created pellets, Qing Shui decided to give half of it to the Canghai Clan. After all, if the members of his Qing Clan consumed it, it would be too much of a waste considering their cultivation levels.</p>
  <p>He spent his time assiduously cultivating in the spatial realm. Although there weren’t cosmos sacks or interspatial rings in this world, his spatial realm would undoubtedly serve the same purpose. Most of his time was spent practicing the Big Dipper Sword Technique. His sword attacks were like the unrelenting waves of the ocean, perfectly aligned with the Qi circulation flow in his body. </p>
  <p>He also mastered the Nine Waves Buddha Palms to the 3rd wave. Its power was beyond comparison to the 2nd wave, and not to mention the fact that he had also learnt the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint from the Buddha Grottoes.</p>
  <p>This was what Qing Shui would practice every day. Each and every one of his technique could be considered peerless arts, and thus he seriously practiced his form and stances to the point of perfection. Qing Shui had long been a believer that practice makes perfect as long as you put in enough effort. You would be able to turn the ordinary into extraordinary.</p>
  <p>It didn’t matter how profound something was. With determination, time, and effort, one would be able to inch forward day by day until one achieved their goals. That day would be the time when the swallow transformed into the phoenix, like a legendary roc spreading its wings and soaring into the skies.</p>
  <p>Thinking back then in the morning when his skin came into contact with Ye`er, the Spring Palace Cultivation Art automatically circulated with the Yin energy hidden in the body of the girl. Qing Shui wasn’t sure if his body could withstand the negative corrosion effect of the Yin Qi from the Nine Yin Body. Although his strong body was remodeled by the Ancient Strengthening Technique, he felt that he wouldn’t lose out if he compared his body with that of someone of extreme Yang.</p>

 <p>“Come, come, everyone let’s take a seat first before we talk.” The old man ushered them into their seats as he started pouring tea for them. Qing Shui didn’t drink the tea, and had the tea cup held within his hands.</p>
 <p>“Old man, let’s talk about the matter of your granddaughter!” Qing Shui said as he directly cut to the chase.</p>
 <p>“Okay, okay. Ever since she was young, the body of Ye`er had an abundance of Yin energy, and was the fabled legendary body of Nine Yin. She would never be able to live past the age of 35. I’ve tried looking for many doctors and alchemists but they were all helpless to do anything. In the end, they gave a suggestion that was the most basic and practical – to find things that extend her life force. Using the Longevity Fruit to negate the Yin energy in her body, she could live longer.” The old man spoke straightforwardly despite Ye`er being here. Seems like Ye`er already knew about her own body condition.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui heard the words of the old man, he shifted his gaze onto Ye`er and used his Heavenly Vision Technique to scan the body of Ye`er. “No wonder she would be older than 30, but to think that she actually had the same pure jade type of bone structure as that of Huoyun-Liu Li, which probably accounted for her charm. However, the Yin energy within her body was so intense that it was terrifying. Indeed, this was probably the Nine Yin body of the legends.”</p>
 <p>“Would you allow me to take your pulse?” Qing Shui gently spoke as he gazed at the girl.</p>
 <p>After a moment of hesitation, the girl extended her jade-like hand out. Qing Shui didn’t look down on her just because she was from the Joyous Sect. It was because Qing Shui knew that she was still ‘pure’. There was basically no one who would be able to Duo Cultivate with her. No one would be able to stand the coldness of her Yin energy flooding their bodies.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also knew that although she couldn’t live past the age of 35, the Nine Yin body made her a cultivation genius. Although she was already at the Xiantian Realm, one of the restrictions of having the legendary body was that her lifespan wouldn’t increase despite breaking through to Xiantian.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui held her wrist as he squinted his eyes. Although the smoothness of her skin felt ethereal to the touch, Qing Shui didn’t have the heart to enjoy the sensation at that moment. He realised that at the point of direct contact, the cultivation art from the Spring Palace Portrait automatically started circulating on its own. It was many times more powerful and smooth when compared to the past.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that the flowing Qi in his body was extremely stimulated by the Yin Qi of Ye`er. The stimulation was to such a great extent that even naughty notions started appearing in his head. He had a feeling that if he were to duo-cultivate and have sex with this woman, the cultivation art from the Spring Palace Portrait would definitely cause his power to increase tenfolds over.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know that at the moment he held the wrist of Ye`er, her Duo Cultivation method also automatically circulated. It also similarly gave her an impulse to want to Duo Cultivate with Qing Shui. Only now did she know why that scenario happened during the day in the Skysword Sect. Just thinking of this caused her charming face to redden like a ripe tomato. </p>
 <p>“There are several methods that could cure you. We only need to balance the amount of Yin Energy in your body.” Qing Shui released his hold of reluctance as he slowly explained. A feeling of unwillingness blossomed in his heart.</p>
 <p>“What are the methods? Could you let me know?” The girl smiled at Qing Shui without any traces of pessimism, which caused Qing Shui to silently sigh. “What a strong girl…”</p>
 <p>“I will directly say it then. The easiest method is to find a man with a legendary Yang body and enter Duo Cultivation with him. Use his extreme Yang to balance your extreme Yin.”</p>
 <p>The words of Qing Shui caused the three ladies on the scene to blushed. So what if she was from the Joyous Sect? She hadn’t experienced a man yet.</p>
 <p>The old man didn’t have too much of a reaction. He only turned to Qing Shui, asking. “How would we know if he had a Yang body?”</p>
 <p>“Bodies of extreme Yang and Yin are relative and in opposition to each other. The Yang Qi of Xiantian is too overwhelming and would need to enter union with females to offset some of the abundant Yang energy. The best way to find a body of extreme Yang is to see if that guy… hmmmm… pleasures countless women every day.” Qing Shui awkwardly rubbed his nose. His heavy deposition from earlier was nowhere to be seen.</p>
 <p>“Ah, so that’s the method? Is there another better, more effective method?” The old man sighed as he continued asking.</p>
 <p>“Find an object of extreme Yang. For example, the legendary Dragon Yang Fruit. Only the Dragon Yang Fruit would work. For other objects of extreme Yang, they may cause the body to explode when ingested. Another alternative is the Fire Phoenix’s Blood. It would work as well.”</p>
 <p>The old man went silent, and so did the three girls. The Dragon Yang was a legendary fruit while the blood of the Fire Phoenix was something that was even more legendary than legend.</p>
 <p>“Those items cannot be sought out, and one can only obtain them through great fortune. I’m merely listing out the possibilities. Actually, I still have a method that can bring relief to her. Although this item of mine is not some heavenly treasure, it should still be able to somewhat counteract her abundance of Yin energy. At the very least, she should be able to live till the age of 50.” Qing Shui thought if the blood of his golden turtle as well as the blood from the 1,000 Year Clam could all be considered Yang-type treasures. Although their effectiveness could not be on par with the Dragon Yang Fruit or the Fire Phoenix’s Blood, they would still be effective to a certain extent.</p>
 <p>“Really? Is what you say real?” The old man agitatedly stood up, his eyes flickered with a brilliant glow as he stared at Qing Shui.<br></p>
 <p>The girl trembled as she saw the reactions of her grandpa. All these years, her grandpa had painstakingly invited renowned alchemists and doctors all over the continent, not hesitating to bring out all his treasures in exchange for their diagnosis and life-extending objects. It was all for her sake.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>He was the only kin and support she had left after her parents passed away. The tears of happiness, akin to a piece of pure, white jade, flowed down her face.</p>
 <p>“Give me a day, and I will return!” Qing Shui stood up as he spoke.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li also stood up, and so did Ye`er who mirrored their actions in a panic.</p>
 <p>“How can I still trouble you so? Would you, kind sir, please leave your address behind? This old man will go over to collect it.” The old man hurriedly added.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, I will bring it over. The things I’ve said, I will make sure to keep them.” Qing Shui knew that the old man was still worried and didn’t trust him fully. It was not that the old man didn’t believe Qing Shui couldn’t produce the items, but rather the effectiveness of them.</p>
 <p>The old man laughed embarrassedly. His attempts to convince Qing Shui to stay longer was rebuffed by Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Sir, you can take a look at the herbal ingredients below. Everything here is for you if you desire them.” The old man didn’t mind if his entire hoard of herbs was taken away. In exchange, his granddaughter would be able to live till the age of 50.</p>
 <p>“No, Let’s hurry, and let me cure her first!” Qing Shui happily smiled in response.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui didn’t expect that the old man was so passionate. He was insisting?no, demanding him that he at least take an item away today. After much hesitation, Qing Shui finally accepted the 1000 year old ginseng and left. Looking at the departing back view of Qing Shui, a warm smile broke out on the countenance of the old man.<br></p>
 <p>“Grandpa, thank you…”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>The old man ruffled the hair of his granddaughter, “Silly girl, there’s no need to thank your grandpa. It’s all my fault that I couldn’t save your parents back then. So what if I sacrifice my remaining lifespan now? I must ensure that you live to 100 at the very least.”</p>
 <p>“Grandpa!”</p>
 <p>Tears continued flowing down Ye`er face, as she sobbed, “Ye`er is content as long as grandpa is here with me. Ye`er doesn’t want grandpa to sacrifice his life. Grandpa is Ye`er’s only kin now.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and the two girls left the medicinal store, fiddling with the box that contain the 1,000 year ginseng in his hands. “If I run away now, does that make me a professional swindler?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui snickered.</p>
 <p>Huoyun stared at Qing Shui dumbly before she too joined in the laughter.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, you would definitely be considered a professional swindler. What a pity that you are not one. If you are one, your reactions and actions just now were too perfect.” Canghai Mingyue also laughed.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, how did you get acquainted with that pretty girl?” Huoyun asked amidst her laughter.</p>
 <p>“You wouldn’t believe it even if I tell you.” Qing Shui remembered how he injured her, and couldn’t help but feel hesitant if it really happened.</p>
 <p>“Try me. Were you the hero that saved the damsel in distress or something?” Huoyun and Canghai Mingyue blinked their seductive pairs of phoenix eyes while looking at him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui laughed bitterly as he recounted what had happened.</p>
 <p>“What? You injured her? For real?” Huoyun asked in shock.</p>
 <p>“Even you think of this, no wonder those guys said that I’m merciless. Sigh, beautiful girls have the advantage anywhere they go. Do you know what is beauty that topples kingdoms?” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
 <p>“Of course I know the idiom, I saw in some books before. Why are you asking this?” Canghai Mingyue curiously stared at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Because both of you are clearly females belonging to that standard of beauty.” Qing Shui replied as he walked forward.</p>
 <p>“Stupid Qing Shui, smelly Qing Shui. How could our beauty topple the kingdoms?” Huoyun Liu-Li stood at the back as she pouted.</p>
 <p>“… Obviously the two of you can.” Qing Shui speechlessly replied.</p>
 <p>“Cheap mouth, stop exaggerating.” Huoyun’s pink face pouted once again as she casted a glance at Qing Shui. Ignoring Qing Shui, both Huoyun and Canghai Mingyue walked away.</p>
 <p>That night, Qing Shui cultivated 12 Small Revitalizing Pellets in his spatial realm, in addition to getting the blood of the 1,000 year clam, golden turtle, and even from his fire bird.</p>
 <p>Looking at the painstakingly created pellets, Qing Shui decided to give half of it to the Canghai Clan. After all, if the members of his Qing Clan consumed it, it would be too much of a waste considering their cultivation levels.</p>
 <p>He spent his time assiduously cultivating in the spatial realm. Although there weren’t cosmos sacks or interspatial rings in this world, his spatial realm would undoubtedly serve the same purpose. Most of his time was spent practicing the Big Dipper Sword Technique. His sword attacks were like the unrelenting waves of the ocean, perfectly aligned with the Qi circulation flow in his body. </p>
 <p>He also mastered the Nine Waves Buddha Palms to the 3rd wave. Its power was beyond comparison to the 2nd wave, and not to mention the fact that he had also learnt the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint from the Buddha Grottoes.</p>
 <p>This was what Qing Shui would practice every day. Each and every one of his technique could be considered peerless arts, and thus he seriously practiced his form and stances to the point of perfection. Qing Shui had long been a believer that practice makes perfect as long as you put in enough effort. You would be able to turn the ordinary into extraordinary.</p>
 <p>It didn’t matter how profound something was. With determination, time, and effort, one would be able to inch forward day by day until one achieved their goals. That day would be the time when the swallow transformed into the phoenix, like a legendary roc spreading its wings and soaring into the skies.</p>
 <p>Thinking back then in the morning when his skin came into contact with Ye`er, the Spring Palace Cultivation Art automatically circulated with the Yin energy hidden in the body of the girl. Qing Shui wasn’t sure if his body could withstand the negative corrosion effect of the Yin Qi from the Nine Yin Body. Although his strong body was remodeled by the Ancient Strengthening Technique, he felt that he wouldn’t lose out if he compared his body with that of someone of extreme Yang.</p>
