 <p><strong>AST 1448 - 200 Million Sun Strength, An Addition of Three New Siblings</strong></p>
 <p>The old man was happy. Those who could hold the Golden Battle Halberd were ones who had received the Golden Battle God’s Inheritance. Furthermore, they were people who were recognized, this was something that could not be falsified. Hearing Qing Shui’s words, the old man was emotional because he knew that his own inheritance would one day bring back the glory to the Battle God.</p>
 <p>During ancient times, the Battle God was once in the light of glory. However, it later declined but it was still an existence that could not be ignored. Each Battle God was a formidable existence, they were the power that could withstand evil.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was a member of the Demon Lord Palace, and also a member of the Evil Powers. Of course, this was just a name given by the others. During his time in the Demon Lord Palace, he could tell that the Demon Lord Palace was definitely not an Evil Power, nor was the Divine Sound Sect. It was just a rumor that had spread too far and it would be too difficult to correct.</p>
 <p>In terms of the Divine Beast Sect and Wild Ghost Valley, Qing Shui had no comments. Moreover, the Justice Alliance’s strength was superior compared to the Evil Powers and the divide was very obvious. The Evil Powers would do terrible things out in the open, whereas the Justice Alliance would do them in secrecy. Perhaps this was the difference!</p>
 <p>Bad people could do bad things, this was normal. However, good people could not be so open, so they must do it in secrecy!</p>
 <p>“Alright, let’s go. We should go sit down over there. Today is a happy day, we should enjoy a good chat.” The old man was extremely happy knowing that Qing Shui was Yan Zhongyue’s son and also the disciple of the Battle God.</p>
 <p>In this time and age, one man having several women was the norm. Even if Yan Zhongyue wanted to find another woman, the elder would not object. However, Yan Zhongyue had never sought another woman after marrying the queen for more than 20 years. Now that his memory was back, having a woman before he lost his memory was normal. Moreover, to have such a formidable son, this was surely a good thing.</p>
 <p>Yan Zhongyue once again talked about what happened. The old man looked at Qing Shui and said, “What can you see from me?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui laughed and said, “Your remaining lifespan is less than 10 years.”</p>
 <p>“Haha, your skills match your name, your medical prowess is truly formidable. With me here, that old fart won’t dare to brazenly lay a hand on the Great Yan Dynasty. However, I’m not sure if you can withstand that old fart after ten years,” the old man said with worry.</p>
 <p>“Old man, did you forget that I’m a doctor? With me here, how could I let your lifespan end with just 10 more years?” Qing Shui smiled as he exclaimed.</p>
 <p>The old man’s eyes shone brightly, it was the same for Yan Zhongyue and the woman, they knew that the old man was the fortified castle of the Great Yan Dynasty. Without the old man, it would not take long before the Great Yan Dynasty would fall under the Soaring Dragon Organization.</p>
 <p>“Haha, god bless Great Yan. Give me another 200 years and I will train a martial artist strong enough to protect the Great Yan Dynasty,” the old man said happily.</p>
 <p>“I came here today to see if there’s anything I could help with. Fortunately, I seem to have arrived in time. Old man, how about we start now?” Qing Shui also hoped the old man to get stronger.</p>
 <p>Even with Qing Shui’s current strength, he could still not feel the old man’s strength. His strength was definitely over 100 million sun, but how much over, Qing Shui was unsure. All he knew now was he was no match for the old man.</p>
 <p>The old man nodded, seemingly really happy.</p>
 <p>“Old man, how strong is the Patriarch of the Soaring Dragon Organization?” Qing Shui was talking like it was normal family chatter as he pulled out the Life and Death Needles.</p>
 <p>“That old man’s strength should be similarly nearly 200 million sun!”</p>
 <p>The old man’s words shocked Qing Shui. The peak of the Soaring Dragon Continent’s strength was such a horrifying existence. The old man in front of him had to be equal in strength, otherwise, they would have been unable counteract each other. Earlier, his words had the word ‘similarly’, this was an evidence that the old man in front of him also possessed the same strength.</p>
 <p>A strength of 200 million sun was something that Qing Shui felt he could not handle at the moment. Even with the opponent’s strength debuffed, it was still terrifying. Moreover, they also had the Sure-Kill Heavenly Techniques, Qing Shui battling that sort of strength would be a steep mountain to climb. However, with the Dragon Slaying Beast and Paragon Golden Armor, nothing was impossible.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui readied himself to perform acupuncture on the old man to remove the toxins from his body. In other words, it would recover the other half of his lifespan. Though it was said that a martial artist who reached certain realms will have certain lifespans, due to their cultivation’s damage to their body, their lifespan never reaches its full potential in reality.</p>
 <p>Not only did he remove the toxins from the old man’s body but also helped him recover quite a bit of lifespan. Qing Shui also used the Nine Yang Gold Needle for Constitution Nurturing. The benefits were huge, to the point where it could not be estimated. It even allowed the old man’s strength to increase by quite a bit.</p>
 <p>As the effect of Qing Shui’s acupuncture concentrated, the old man’s strength became more condensed and firm. This made his body and meridians stronger.</p>
 <p>About a small bowl’s worth of black materials was vomited. The woman took it away to dispose of it. The old man took a while before he regained his breath, “Your medical prowess is beyond imagination. It was almost too surreal to believe even now.”</p>
 <p>“Old man, only the Patriarch of the Soaring Dragon Organization posed a real threat. Since you have fought him countlessly, perhaps you could tell me what our chances of victory would be?” Qing Shui could not hold himself back, he wanted to know the old man’s strength.</p>
 <p>“Originally, my strength and his were about the same. Neither of us could do anything to each other. He did not dare to openly hurt the people around me, otherwise, I would take revenge on him and he would not be able to withstand it. A long time ago, he had secretly taken action against me but I did not let him live it down. I wiped out quite a few members of his family, now, he will not dare lay a hand on anyone related to me. If he dared to, I will risk it all to wipe out everyone in his large clan until he is the last man left. Now, we only think about how to kill the other person, but I didn’t think that the old fart was thinking of using the Mind Plunder.”</p>
 <p>After the old man talked a bit, he took a breath before saying, “Now that you have extended my lifespan and increased my strength, I still can’t take him down but I can hold him off.”</p>
 <p>“If one day old man has to fight him, please bring me with you. I could help you win,” Qing Shui laughed as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Oh? Do you have a sure-kill technique?” The old man asked in curiosity, and at this time the woman had already returned.</p>
 <p>“I can increase your strength by 20% and decrease the opponent’s strength by 30%.” Qing Shui laughed as he exclaimed.</p>
 <p>With his &nbsp;Drawing reaching the level of Drawing Souls, his Heavenly Talisman made another huge breakthrough. His ability to debuff others increased to the point where it was imposing. Even with the old man’s strength, to remove the Heavenly Talisman’s debuff would still require a bit of time.</p>
 <p>The old man doubted Qing Shui’s words as he looked towards him. He had mixed feelings about whether to believe Qing Shui or not. Qing Shui seemed to have picked up the old man’s hesitation and directly slapped a Heavenly Talisman on the old man’s body then used his Emperor’s Qi. Altogether, he had reduced the old man’s strength by 30%.</p>
 <p>The old man’s jaw dropped as he looked at Qing Shui. He had seen a lot during his lifetime, but this was something else.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui had no need to flaunt his strength, it was inevitable that they would found out sooner or later. The earlier he told the old man, the less likely the old man had to risk his life. With Qing Shui’s reinforcement, they could easily wipe out the enemy.</p>
 <p>“This is great. Even if I can’t kill him instantaneously, I should be able to take him out after a short time. I almost want to go and kill him now,” the old man said emotionally.</p>
 <p>“Don’t fret old man, at this time you should stabilize your strength first. Earlier, I had already assisted you to concentrate on your lower foundation. Once you stabilize it, you will gain quite a bit of benefits,” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“That is good too, so what are your plans?” The old man asked, filled with joy.</p>
 <p>“With father’s memories back, he wants to return home. We plan to visit home first,” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“That should be, those young’uns should come out now. Xin’er release the restriction, let them come in here,” The old man said to the woman.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“En, I will go immediately.”</p>
 <p>About 15 minutes later, the woman returned. Beside her were two young men and one girl. Qing Shui knew beforehand that the youngest was about 18 years old, and her elder brothers were in their early twenties.</p>
 <p>Given their good genes, the two young men both had a tall and straight build and were rather handsome. The older one who looked more mature was Yan Qingchang, and the other who was more handsome was Lu Qingyong. The young girl’s name was Yan Qingting, she had large eyes and a petite nose. Only the second son took the mother’s last name.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, you’re home!” The girl looked at Yan Zhongyue and happily ran towards him to give him a hug. She completely ignored Qing Shui but she kept her eyes on him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought of his own daughter. The girl was slightly younger than Luan Luan, but acted similarly to how Yu Chang would if she saw him.</p>
 <p>The two young men seemed to be more mature than a typical 20 years old. Moreover, their strength was powerful as well. Of course, they were descendants of the Battle God, their bloodline and technique were the best.</p>
 <p>The two of them greeted the old man and Yan Zhongyue.</p>
 <p>The old man smiled as he nodded, “Telling you guys to come here was to tell you something. We have not told you, but your father had lost 20 years of his memories before. Now, he has all his memory back.”</p>
 <p>Afterwards, he told them Qing Shui’s identity and all three of them were shocked. Qing Shui laughed as he looked at them, “We are all grownups, we all hope that our parents will live a happy life.”</p>
 <p>“Alright, I gained another older brother. Do you have any meeting gifts for such a cute younger sister?” The young girl in front of Qing Shui asked happily.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui now knew that the girl was the bubbly type. He took out one of the Interspatial Silk Sachets that he had previously prepared and handed it over, “See if you like this or not?”</p>
 <p>“This is really for me?” The girl exclaimed, she had only asked as a joke previously.</p>
 <p>“Why would it not be? In the future, you will always have a share of gifts.” Qing Shui laughed as he spoke while he gave an Interspatial Silk Sachet to his two younger brothers.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that these three were children, that was of course due to the fact that he was more than 20 years older than they were. In the World of Nine Continents, 20 years did not mean that much. In large clans, there would be a lot of siblings who had a huge difference in ages. Although they shared the same father, their mothers were different, thus, the familial bond was weak.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was, however, still under the influence of the views from his previous life. Even after 40 years of staying here, he was still influenced by his previous life.</p>
 <p>“Your brother is the Miraculous Doctor. Have you guys heard of the Phoenix Dance Continent’s Imperial Cuisine Hall? That’s your brother’s,” the woman said with a laugh.</p>
 <p>“For real? Old brother, I want to eat Longevity Noodle and help me retain my youthful appearance…” The young girl smiled happily.</p>
 <p>…………...</p>
 <p>Originally, Yan Qingchang and Lu Qingyong had no interest in their newfound older brother, but now it was different. Their eyes began to lit up. As the woman explained the situation with the old man’s lifespan, the two could only become admirers of Qing Shui’s abilities.</p>
 <p>People were like this. Charisma was formed this way, this was a type of halo effect. With the influence of the halo effect, even if the person was ugly, he would be considered handsome and charming.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui laughed, he did not think this was a good thing. People were like this. Qing Shui had not contacted his old friends for a while because they currently belonged to different levels. They were no longer standing on the same playing field. This was something that could not be changed unless the other person carried blood ties. Familial ties were more reliable than anything else.</p>
