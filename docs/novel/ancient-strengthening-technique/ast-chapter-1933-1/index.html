 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The appearance of the old man gave peace to Qing Shui’s side. It was unlikely that this place would be disturbed by other people for the time being. After all, the Great Confucian Empire was still a very threatening existence. At noon, Qing Shui was surprised to see Dongfang Zhiqiu and her brother visiting him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were here to bid them farewell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Shui, my brother and I are both returning to the Heavenly Chess Immortal Palace.” said Dongfang Zhiqiu in a lonely tone. As usual, her brother was wise and dull. The women would usually find men like him very attractive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you for assisting me in stopping the Five Poisons Immortal Palace.” Qing Shui smiled and said. He was already informed about the things which the Dongfang siblings had done.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Deep down in his heart, Qing Shui had already treated Dongfang Zhiqiu as his friend, an intimate friend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Five Poisons Immortal Palace was responsible for laying their hands on my sister. There is no need to thank me for it. In the future, feel free to come and visit the Heavenly Chess Immortal Palace.” The man revealed a smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s impression of this man was only decent. He nodded, “I will definitely go there provided that I have the opportunity to do so.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dongfang Zhiqiu was staring at Qing Shui. Her beautiful pupils were flashing with traces of sorrow which words couldn’t describe. She seemed like she wanted to say something but yet was unable to do so. Eventually, she waved her hand at Qing Shui, “You must come and visit me at Heavenly Chess Immortal Palace or else, I will hate you for life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. But then when he saw her expression, he nodded and said, “I promise you that I will definitely go to the Heavenly Chess Immortal Palace to visit you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So, you managed to get another beautiful woman to fall into your trap.” Qing Hanye let out a soft laugh beside Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t move his lips. However, Qing Hanye was able to hear clearly what he muttered, “You little witch, I will deal with you tonight.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go ahead! As if I will be afraid of you!” Qing Hanye’s voice was clearly transmitted into Qing Shui’s ears. Upon hearing that, Qing Shui got really fired up. If there were no huge crowd at the moment, Qing Shui would have banged her immediately right on the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dongfang siblings left. If not mistaken, the Five Poison Immortal Palace should also have taken their leave. In fact, there wasn’t really anything which involved the two great sects to begin with. The reason why things ended up like this was merely that of the Grand Elder and Dongfang Zhiqiu. Luckily, things haven’t developed to the point of no return. Basically, both the Heavenly Chess and the Five Poisons Immortal Palace didn’t make a big fuss over it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The problems which revolved around the Great Confucian Empire could be considered as solved. Qing Shui was now the master of the future Great Emperor of the Great Confucian Empire. Not only that, but he was also a Battle God Inheritor. For a while, it was unlikely that any major wars would unfold around here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though the Great Confucian Empire might seem to be rich and powerful, in actuality, it was already riddled with gaping wounds. Hence, the empire has stopped expanding itself externally. Instead, it was focusing on developing its internal strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girls from the Sunset Seaking Palace and the Dragon Wolf Palace were also ready to leave. Qing Shui sent them away himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After going through the things around the Imperial Cuisine Hall, Qing Shui took the other girls along and immediately appeared in front of the Divine Cave. After that, they rushed their way to the Sunset Seaking Palace together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon arrival, the girls were pleased to find out that not much changes had taken place in the palace. They were finally able to put their mind at ease. Actually, these were all within Qing Shui’s expectations. After all, the current Sunset Seaking Palace was already one of the most powerful forces around the area. Under normal circumstances, very rarely would anyone attempt to provoke them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye received the Poison Dragon King. Furthermore, its strength was even more superior now. The Dragon Wolf and Sunset Seaking Palace was a complete being from Qing Shui’s perspective. Nevertheless, this didn’t mean that if they didn’t merge into one, there wouldn’t be any advantages. Of course, they could still look after one another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their strength was very close to one another. Maybe in the future, they might truly get to merge into one. However, for the time being, it wasn’t really important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can finally rest for a while now. During this time, my heart has always been feeling uneasy.” Yiye Jiange let out a sigh of relief and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s because Jiange has more people that she was concerned about than me. Here, let me carry the little brat for a while.” Luo Qingcheng took over Qing Xiu as she was speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Qing Shui felt that the little brat was very blessed to have so many people spoiling him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing cheng, since you are so fond of children, why don’t you try giving birth to one?” Qing Hanye smiled and made a joke about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was aware of the little witch’s change. Prior to this, or rather, a long time ago, she possessed the Nine Yin Body and had a pair of amorous eyes unmatched in her generations as well as a bewitching body. The girl at that time tended to get shy very easily. But ever since then, this woman had matured a lot. Though she still retained her habit of getting shy very easily, she had become a lot more daring, or rather, charming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For many times, Qing Shui would feel strongly about the so-called destiny between humans. It was something which words could never describe. Those that brushed past each other could only be strangers. It would be very difficult for them to meet each other again in their entire lifetime. However, when destiny came, they would become the closest person they could ever have for each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ye`Er, are you pregnant? Let me feel it…..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Qingcheng was not someone who was easy to deal with. Qing Shui began to touch Qing Hanye as he spoke. As soon as he interacted with her, the first thing he came in contact with was her bulging breasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui rubbed his forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stayed over at the Sunset Seaking Palace for a couple of days. He was very intoxicated with the tender land. Every single day, Qing Shui lived his life like a God. However, after a few days, Qing Shui still went back to the Imperial Cuisine Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui reminded the girls to work hard on cultivation. He also left behind quite a lot of the Nine Revolution Golden Pellets, Fortune Golden Pellet and the Yang Pellet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After heading back to the Imperial Cuisine Hall and greeting the people around there, Qing Shui made his way to the backyard. Along the way, he ran into the Thirteenth Prince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Thirteenth Prince was very delighted to see Qing Shui. The Bear Form which Qing Shui taught him had benefitted him a lot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, oh, I just remembered. How has your practice been going on? Let’s go to the backyard so that you can demonstrate it to me.” Qing Shui wanted to test how well the Thirteenth Prince was in comprehending the skills which he taught him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright!”</span></p>

Hence, Qing Shui was able to tell that the Thirteenth Prince possessed extraordinary talent. However, he wanted to see just up to what extent he had practiced his Bear Form.</span></p>

Though a bit clumsy, he managed to retain his nimbleness.</span></p>

Though his realm was still relatively low, it had only been a few days which made it acceptable. As long as he dedicated his mind to it, in the future, his realm was bound to increase.</span></p>

Most importantly, you need to be steady, as steady as a mountain, an immovable mountain.”</span></p>

When Qing Shui finished speaking, he left, leaving the Thirteenth Prince alone to ponder over the things that he said. After that, he continued on to try again and again. The more times he did it, the happier expression he had on his face. This was because he noticed that his Vicious Bear Battle God Inheritance’s level had begun to rise. He had already been stuck in the same realm for quite a while.</span></p>

Though he was confident with his strength, he believed that there should be many people whose strength was even more superior than his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Archs from the Barbarian Emperor’s brain had already been extracted out by Qing Shui. The Barbarian Emperor felt reborn and now he understood a lot of things which he didn’t understand before. Furthermore, he had also made his decision to go to the True Nine Continents World together with Qing Shui. Qing Shui was the one who gave him his life; thus, he wanted to follow Qing Shui.</span></p>

Instead, he became brothers with the Barbarian Emperor like how he did with Yin Tong and Lan Lingfeng.</span></p>

He wanted to wait, wait for his body to completely stabilize itself first. Qing Shui knew better than anybody else about the condition of his body. He had a feeling that now was an inappropriate time for him to use the Immortal Dao Divine Origin.</span></p>
