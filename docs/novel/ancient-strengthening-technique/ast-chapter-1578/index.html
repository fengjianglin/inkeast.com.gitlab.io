 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The purpose had been achieved but the Dragon Slaying Beast still regretted not giving the shark king another wound. Originally, it was planning to match the Thunderous Beast’s Purple Lightning Strike and kill the enemy, but it had underestimated the Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King’s strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the Dragon Slaying Beast was a threat to the Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King, Qing Shui had remained unscathed. &nbsp;This was possible not only because of the Thunderous Beast’s actions but also because Qing Shui had reduced the enemy’s speed and reaction speed by half. Since this had happened so suddenly, the enemy made a lapse in judgement with its slower reaction speed, barely holding on with great difficulty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King’s huge purple body exuded an intense purple glow. The scene was quite spectacular. Currently, the liquid pouring out from its sockets was shining with a purple glaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rooaarrrrr…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t know how the sharks from his previous lifetime yelled but this human-like giant shark before his eyes yelled quite miserably…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They’d be able to live without their eyes after reaching such a level of strength by using spiritual sense, touch and sense of smell to live a regular life. But most demonic beasts possessed special eyes. Often, they could see clearly with their eyes before detecting with their spiritual sense and such beasts also liked using their eyes to see the beautiful world around them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon Slaying Beast issued a tiny growl but its viciousness instead came out as it dashed towards the huge Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King like a meteor as it shifted its forms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Palace Laws, Gravity Law!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tidal Cloud Waves Seal, Twisting Water!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had reduced the Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King’s speed and reaction speed to its lowest and then appeared near its head. He kept attacking it with the Golden Battle Halberd while the Thunderous Beast continuously attacked with Thunderbolts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though all of this seemed to have taken a long time, it had happened in a single breath. Perhaps because the Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King had underestimated Qing Shui’s methods, it had received heavy injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s aim now wasn’t to injure the enemy with his attacks but instead to disturb him. The Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King used its huge body and sacrificed its agility and perception a bit to increase its strength. It seemed that its speed had been reduced by a large margin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon Slaying Beast angrily clawed at the Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King’s body, but it leapt outside soon after going in. This was one of the special aspects of the Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King: it could eject threats when it received a fatal attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, he couldn’t always use this ability all the time and it would certainly fail if an injury of a certain degree was dealt. This was also merely a life-preserving ability. It was similar to how he hadn’t lost his life even though Qing Shui and the Dragon Slaying Beast had pierced his eyes. Hence, this ability wasn’t useful to defend against attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the injuries accumulated, this ability would lose its effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s attacks were only enough to bring an injury to a weak place such as the eyes. If he attacked any other places, it’d leave at most a minimal injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Continents Mountain attacked continuously and also protected the Dragon Slaying Beast as it made surprise attacks. The current Nine Continents Mountain was also a threat to the Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King, especially if the attack was towards one of his weaker regions like the “place” between those two huge pillars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King couldn’t see where the Nine Continents Mountain was attacking, it could still sense it and reflexively evaded. He had already started to become anxious and didn’t dare to resist any of Qing Shui’s weaker attacks, fearing that the Dragon Slaying Beast would attack him in the meanwhile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Continents Mountain and the Thunderous Beast acted in unison; Qing Shui and the Dragon Slaying Beast also attacked in a frenzy. He used the Five Elements Divine Refinement Technique and used the Golden Halberd to continuously attack the enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lion King’s Imprint!</span></p>

The Nine Continents Mountain also played a crucial role as it was because of it that the Dragon Slaying Beast was able to display its strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roooaarrr!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King’s figure became smaller until it was about the height of two humans. Only his throbbing iron-like muscles seemed to contain a terrible explosive power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were two purple blood traces under his two eyes. He couldn’t see with them but those huge ears perked all around to take in all the noises from the surroundings as he used his spiritual sense to perceive danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t know that he was doomed to fail, but he was already afraid. In the entire Ice Ocean Domain, he was the strongest existence. The White Sea Domain was quite big, but no one could match him in this huge region. Yet he was now being hit around by a member of the younger generation…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the holes where the two huge eyes were. The Dragon Slaying Beast had already tried twice, but it was unable to invade through them, but he also didn’t want it to withdraw. When he neared the enemy again, Qing Shui made the Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm use its gentle strength to penetrate into the enemy’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t have any assurances, but the Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm had a terrible devouring ability. He didn’t want to give up and if this method didn’t work, he’d think of something else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wanted to end the fight quickly. He hadn’t used the Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm in a long time. Although the Dragon Slaying Beast was also cleaving the enemy’s body, it was proving futile. The Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm was similar yet also different in the way it could devour. For example, this giant shark’s defense could be overcome by the Dragon Slaying Beast, but the Silkworm couldn’t achieve that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It entered inside!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was dazed for a moment and was punched by the Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King, directly flying backwards, spouting blood. The injury wasn’t close to being fatal. Qing Shui’s current strength, especially his defense, was quite terrifying and the Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King’s strength had already been weakened a lot. This was the reason he wasn’t injured heavily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roooaarrr!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Quite soon, the Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King howled in grief while clutching its head. The mournful screams caused the surrounding water to tremble. Everyone belonging to the Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace battling nearby all skipped a beat. All of them could guess that this injury was fatal.</span></p>

This aura didn’t lose out to the Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a powerful existence from the Sea Dragon Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Golden Sea-Dragon Merman seemed the same as others, but golden armor-like dragon scales flickered on his body, which made him the odd one out in the crowd of Sea Dragons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That Golden Sea-Dragon Merman’s appearance was dignified and his features handsome. He exuded a powerful aura with his actions and possessed strong, well-proportioned arms which were the same length as a human’s. They weren’t that bulky but definitely had power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had just seen the Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King’s body collapse on his dying breath when he arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Flames of fury filled his eyes. No matter what kind of relation the Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace had, they both were really close. After working together for so many years, they had formed an understanding between them. They were close friends and had already stopped paying attention to the matters of the Sea Dragon Palace and the Vicious Shark Palace for many years; they had come out this time because they had sensed that their younger generations were in danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the outcome he saw was out of his expectations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was difficult to make a close lifelong friend and the Golden Sea-Dragon Merman’s only close friend was this Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King. As long as they were here together, the Ice Ocean Domain was safe. If someone tried to attack this place, they’d withstand the attack by cooperating together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally, the Sea King Palace’s elders were also an existence equal to these two. Merely, due to the identity of a Drakaina, it was impossible to live peacefully and coexist with each other. This hatred from those days had all originated because of Muyun Qingge’s father.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Sea-Dragon Merman and the Purple Crystal Crowned Shark King hadn’t attacked the later generations after Muyun Qingge’s parents had passed away. If their progeny wanted to attack them, they didn’t oppose it, as struggle was also common here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm returned back to Qing Shui, and it seemed that it had changed after absorbing such powerful energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After returning to the Blood Essence Pool, it transmitted through its consciousness that Qing Shui couldn’t call him out soon again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You unexpectedly killed him.” The Golden Sea-Dragon looked at Qing Shui with a face filled with killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If a person wants to kill you, I wonder whether you would resist or not?” Qing Shui said casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was someone else, they’d react to such a simple reasoning but this was a close friend. The merman said slowly, “I won’t let you off.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He felt loneliness. The longer a person like this Golden Sea-Dragon Merman lived, the lonelier they’d became. He only had one similar kind of existence to accompany him and that was the Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King. Even in the Nine Continents, there existed an intense generation gap and similar people grouped together. If everyone except a single person of that era was left, that loneliness wasn’t something explainable by words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You want to kill me? Who’s stronger between him and you?” Qing Shui laughed. At this moment, Yiye Jiange and Muyun Qingge had both returned, along with a few experts of the Sea King’s Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui hinted a few of them to continue battling while his gaze remained fixed on the Golden Sea-Dragon Merman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those words left the Golden Sea-Dragon Merman in a daze. His strength was on par with the Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King, but he didn’t believe he was stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s the point in using strange methods to achieve a kill? I see that you can only plot crafty methods to achieve victory.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two dragon-like claws appeared on the Golden Sea-Dragon Merman’s hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Beastmen’s cultivation didn’t need weapons, just like the huge arms of the Violet Crystal Crowned Shark King. To them, those who used weapons were all those who didn’t have confidence in their strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dragon Walking the Sea!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Sea-Dragon Merman’s arms suddenly rotated like drill bits as they attacked Qing Shui. The current lower body of the Golden Sea-Dragon Merman was that of a dragon, while his torso was human as he grew two dazzling golden dragon horns on his head.</span></p>
