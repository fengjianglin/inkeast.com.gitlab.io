 <p><strong>AST 844 - Saving, Miraculous Physician, Making Friends</strong></p>
 <p>"Sir, there's no need to stand on ceremony. I'll do my best."</p>
 <p>Many people looked at Qing Shui doubtfully, not understanding why the old man would believe this young man's words and had even promised that he would be rewarded heavily regardless of whether could save the young man or not. Qing Shui then said that he would do his best, making some people feel that he was some quack who was here to scam money.</p>
 <p>"The young man doesn't know how big the world is!" An old man carrying a medicine box sighed and said.</p>
 <p>"Old Liang is right. Fifth Master must have been too flustered. Can't he tell that this young man can't possibly be that skilled. Could it be that our few hundred years of experience with medicine and medicinal skills can not be compared with his ten plus years of experience?" A silver haired old man said, his tone sounding very dissatisfied.</p>
 <p>"Let's just wait and see. Old Liang, Old Yin, this young man will definitely say that he has no way out. After all, other than miraculous medicine, how else could one cure these injuries? If he can really save him, I, Huang Yang, will be willing to respect him as my teacher," an arrogant old man also said, dissatisfied.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>"Enough! Are you guys so willing to let my grandson die?" The old man said softly. Although his tone was very calm, his powerful aura shut many people up.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui naturally knew that he could do the job. As he walked over, he said softly, "If one has aspirations, age is not an issue; if one has no aspirations, living for a hundred or hundreds of years sometimes would just represent that the person could eat a few more years worth of food."</p>
 <p>Toward people who liked to throw their weight around because of their age, people who were very afraid of people infringing on their benefits and thus would exert pressure on others because of it, Qing Shui had no nice words to say.</p>
 <p>"Alright, alright, you're very arrogant. I'm going to see what means you have." The few old men were infuriated by Qing Shui's words. They were after all, the top notch alchemists and physicians in Tang Manor. In Tang Manor, they had received great respect and treatment, enjoying great statuses.</p>
 <p>"If you can really cure him, I'll respect you as my teacher," the old man from earlier once again repeated this in order to prove himself. It was as if this was the greatest price he could pay. He, Huang Yang, was also a reputable physician and he felt that lowering his status was the greatest sacrifice he could make.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head and smiled, not saying a word. He walked up close to the bed and said softly, "Take off his clothes."</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui's words weighed the most and thus there were people who immediately helped the man on the bed to undress. There were black and purplish marks on the man's chest.</p>
 <p>There were also some external injuries at his shoulder and it was the source of the blood traces. However, those were merely external wounds and what was fatal were his internal wounds.</p>
 <p>Saintly Hands!</p>
 <p>The increase to his cultivation level and spirit energy also caused Qing Shui's Saintly Hands to be much more powerful than before.</p>
 <p>Glittering and translucent like jade, his hands which were almost transparent patted gently onto the man's body.</p>
 <p>Bit by bit, the spirit energy flowed into Tang Chong's body. Qing Shui's palms grew increasingly faster and the dense slapping sounds kept sounding out. However, there seemed to be no changes to Tang Chong's body at all.</p>
 <p>When the few old men who were alchemists and physicians saw Qing Shui's hands, they were slightly astonished. However, seeing that there were no changes after so long, their astonishment once again turned into that of disdain.</p>
 <p>Fifth Master Tang looked at Qing Shui in astonishment. He could sense the flow of the spirit energy from Qing Shui's hand. At this moment, it could be said that this pair of hands were valuable treasures.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, he had the feeling that this young man would definitely be able to cure his grandson. Who on earth was he? To think that he was equipped with such a miraculous technique at such a young age.</p>
 <p>Another thing was his cultivation level. Although Fifth Master Tang could sense his abilities, he could also sense the dangerous aura concealed deep within Qing Shui's body.</p>
 <p>Although Tang Manor might not be the most powerful in Central Continent, it could be considered one of most powerful. However, within Tang Manor, amongst those who were close to his age, only Ye`er from his eldest brother's family would be able to be on par with him. As for the others, in a fight, they would probably not be a match for this young man.</p>
 <p>Who is he?</p>
 <p>What kind of person was able to nurture such an outstanding descendent?</p>
 <p>15 minutes later, Qing Shui stopped. A shimmering Gold Needle that was thin as a cow's hair appeared in his right hand. If not for its color, one might not be able to notice it.</p>
 <p>Acupuncture!</p>
 <p>There was acupuncture in the world of the nine continents but majority of them would only be able to show a slight effect. Therefore, acupuncture existed only within rumors and not many people had been able to witness powerful acupuncture techniques.</p>
 <p>When they saw that nine inch long Gold Needle in Qing Shui's hand, everyone was stunned. In acupuncture, a nine inch needle was the longest one. These people had experienced a lot of things in this world and could also tell that it was a Gold Needle.</p>
 <p>Right now, even they were starting to feel that this young man might really be quite capable.</p>
 <p>Shanzhong Acupoint!</p>
 <p>With a flash of his hand, half of the nine inch long Gold Needle was pierced in. That high proficiency caused everyone present to be astonished and even all the physicians and alchemists felt that this needle was extremely profound.</p>
 <p>The energy from the Ancient Book of "Rebirth"!</p>
 <p>Right now, the mysterious energy in Qing Shui's body from the Ancient Book of "Rebirth" started to circulate slowly and channeled into Tang Chong's body through the Gold Needle.</p>
 <p>Five Element Acupuncture!</p>
 <p>Using the inter promoting relation of the five elements between the organs to stimulate the patient's inner potential, Qing Shui then tried to recover the injured areas of the patient's organs through Saintly Hands and the energy from the Ancient Book of "Rebirth".</p>
 <p>The process was gradual but effective. However, it was impossible to cure him with just one treatment. Qing Shui would only treat him for this one. As for the subsequent treatment, they could rely on medicinal pills and time.</p>
 <p>He didn't wish to overly reveal his medicinal skills as it would be too astonishing. It was astonishing enough as it was and he wasn't sure if it was worth it for him to stay for a few more days since he didn't know if Tang Manor had a Sky Penetrating Grass which was at least 5,000 Years or more.</p>
 <p>Four hours passed and no one spoke a word during this time, nor did anyone leave. It was because they saw that Tang Chong's life had really been brought back by Qing Shui and his Gold Needle.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui removed the last Gold Needle, everyone seemed to exhale with relief.</p>
 <p>"Old Master, I'm thankful to have not failed your expectations," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Miraculous physician. This is really an eye-opener. It's really as you said, if one has aspirations, age is of no concern," Fifth Master Tang smiled and said, his eyes bright.</p>
 <p>"To think that he could really cure him," an old man who had been carrying a medicine box and standing there for four hours mumbled to himself, as if in a daze.</p>
 <p>"I wouldn't dare to call myself a miraculous doctor. Your grandson was really fortunate as well. If his injuries were slightly heavier, there would be nothing I can do either," Qing Shui said politely.</p>
 <p>"Miraculous physician, I've said that if you're able to cure Young Master Tang, I'll respect you as my teacher. I'll definitely work hard to learn the acupuncture you teach me and save the lives of the people in the world," the old man from earlier smiled and bowed, saying seriously.</p>
 <p>He had seen people who were thick-skinned but not one to this extent. Looking at this old man, Qing Shui said, "Sir, you're too old and there's not much future for you in the path of medicine. Even if you were to attain a breakthrough, it would be a waste."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and said to the old man. He could not understand people like them but there were plenty of such people around everywhere.</p>
 <p>"I've said it earlier that if you were to cure Young Master Tang, I'll respect you as my teacher. Don't worry, I'll definitely not bring shame to you..."</p>
 <p>"Did I say that I'd take you in as a disciple?" Qing Shui really found this kind of person revolting.</p>
 <p>"But I've said that..."</p>
 <p>"Huang Yang, that's enough. You can take your leave!" Fifth Master Tang frowned and said softly.</p>
 <p>It was only then that the few old men took their leave but it seemed as if they still had a lot of things they wanted to say. However, they also knew that Qing Shui was not interested in talking to them and thus could only leave, sighing.</p>
 <p>"He'll wake up in an hour. I won't need to meddle with the follow-ups," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Miraculous physician, thank you for saving my son," the beautiful married lady from earlier walked up to Qing Shui and said agitatedly.</p>
 <p>"Madam, it's fate for our meeting. Your son is also one with great luck." Qing Shui remained polite.</p>
 <p>"Lad, come, we'll go take a walk in the backyard. It's too messy here." Fifth Master Tang smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Alright!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Fifth Master Tang walked out of the place and headed for the backyard. Only then did Qing Shui take a look at the surroundings, looking at this huge and luxurious manor.</p>
 <p>"Lad, how can I address you? I'm Tang Wude from Tang Manor. As I'm ranked number five, all of them call me Fifth Master," the old man smiled and said, looking at Qing Shui as he walked.</p>
 <p>"'My name is Qing Shui!" After giving it some thought, Qing Shui felt that there was no need for him to hide it.</p>
 <p>"From Greencloud Continent." Tang Wude didn't try to hide his astonishment when he looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded. He didn't find this strange. After all, he was the most well-known person in Greencloud Continent now and it was normal for some great factions from other continents to keep an eye on him.</p>
 <p>"A genius blessed by heavens is already not enough to describe you," after taking a look at Qing Shui, Tang Wude said softly.</p>
 <p>"Sir, you've overestimate me," Qing Shui's heart skipped a beat and said.</p>
 <p>This rating was too high. While it was good to be receiving compliments, dangers would always lurk behind compliments. The greater the compliments, the greater the danger.</p>
 <p>There should be many people who wish to get rid of him as soon as possible!</p>
 <p>"You're very cautious. Haha, actually, I also want to tell you not to easily trust other people, especially in Central Continent. The mix of people here has some that are very messed up," Tang Wude said before he moved onward.</p>
 <p>"Thank you!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had initially felt that he was strong and had the ability to protect himself. However, recalling the lady in the crystal coffin, he knew that he was too careless.</p>
 <p>"Haha, you've saved Chong`er. To be honest, I'm really full of admiration for your medicinal skills. It's not just me, I'm sure it's the same for everyone else. Tang Manor is still considered to be quite powerful but I won't ask you to serve Tang Manor since you're not someone who would do so. It's fate that we have met. How about we be friends?" Tang Wude stopped walking, looked at Qing Shui seriously and said smiling.</p>
 <p>"I can't ask for anything better!" Qing Shui smiled and replied.</p>
 <p>"Alright, in the future, we'll address each others as brothers. It'll be a friendship between an old man and a young one," Tang Wude smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"I'll address you as Old Master and you can call me Qing Shui or lad," After giving it some thought, Qing Shui said.</p>
 <p>"No, I'll call you Qing Shui, you can call me brother. Let's not be too aloof with each other. You'll understand why in the future," the old man insisted.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded and said smiling, "Qing Shui greets brother!"</p>
 <p>"Alright, alright!"</p>
 <p>Tang Wude was good at judging people. This young man was like a dragon that was deep underwater and would soar up into the sky very soon, sending his name across the nine continents. This act would make their relationship more lasting and reliable, although it was just an address.</p>
 <p>Once they'd gotten closer, it was easier to talk. Tang Wude smiled and said, continuing walking, "You must stay for a few more days so that I can be a good host. I still need to thank you for saving Chong`er as well."</p>
 <p>"Our relationship is built on the bonding of our hearts, the other stuff is not as important. I'll probably not be able to stay for long and will leave tomorrow or at most the day after," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Are you in a hurry to look for the Sky Penetrating Grass?" Tang Wude frowned and said.</p>
