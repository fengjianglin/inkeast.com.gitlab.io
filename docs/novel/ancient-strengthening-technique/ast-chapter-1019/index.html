 <p><strong>AST 1019 - No One Can Stop Me From Meeting Mo Hongluo, The Head of Demon Gate</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui watched Mo Zitong who was dashing towards him. For his strength, Qing Shui would be able to settle this by lifting only his pinkie. He humbly took a step forward as he struck out with his hands. His movement seemed slow, yet it was actually fast and it was accompanied by a tiger’s roar.</p>
 <p>A gigantic white tiger was seen unleashed from Qing Shui’s palms, as it immediately leapt towards Mo Zitong. The strength he had unleashed was far beyond Mo Zitong’s. It was at least 4,000 stars of offensive power, but he knew nothing serious would happen.</p>
 <p>The gigantic white tiger silhouette leaped towards Mo Zitong with an intense killing intention. Even the Heavens and Earth changed colors. The powerful aura immobilized Mo Zitong. Mo Zitong turned pale with fright right at this exact moment. He was already aware of the disparity between Qing Shui and himself, but he now realized that there was no way he could evade.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled at Mo Zitong, who was already frightened and shocked. But just then, two waves of powerful auras appeared at Mo Zitong’s side in a flash. They extended their arms and shattered the white tiger that Qing Shui unleashed.</p>
 <p>Before this, the Tiger form that Qing Shui unleashed was always a huge tiger claw. But now, he was able to unleash a full form. Its might had also been tremendously increased. Although it was still inferior to using a weapon, Tiger Form had its own advantage.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t make another move. He only silently watched Mo Zitong who was still in a daze. He knew that he had shocked Mo Zitong too greatly this time, but he knew that Mo Zitong was unharmed. Only a person with unswerving determination could achieve the accomplishments that Mo Zitong had today. The more he experienced things like these, the more his hidden potential and will to fight would be stirred.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was looking at the two old men by Mo Zitong’s side right at this moment. The two old men were dressed in black clothes, but their hair was a mixture of black and white instead. Both of them had a perfectly straight figure. There weren’t any beard or deep wrinkles on their faces. People who were unfamiliar with them would probably think that both of them were very young.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui knew that the age of these two old men wasn't that young anymore. Both of them were also looking at Qing Shui in astonishment. They had no choice but to appear earlier, but this youth was aware of their presence. It was evident that this youth wasn’t weaker than them at all.</p>
 <p>“Young man, you are simply astounding.” The person on the left with dashing eyebrows sighed in amazement at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Thank you for the compliment, Old Man!” Qing Shui replied courteously. He was waiting for Mo Zitong to recover from this.</p>
 <p>“Speak. Who is it that you want to meet? Tell us.” The old man on the right spoke up. This old man had a very sharp nose, and he had a sharper pair of eyes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hesitated for a moment before he spoke slowly, “Mo Hongluo!”</p>
 <p>He watched how the other party didn’t blink their eyes at all ever since he uttered Mo Hongluo’s name.</p>
 <p>The two old men were staring at Qing Shui strangely. Mo Zitong, who had snapped back to reality, looked at Qing Shui in surprise. “You wanted to meet Young Aunt?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn’t too surprised either. After all, Mo Hongluo was the daughter of Demon Gate’s clan head. Mo Zitong seemed to be about his age, so Huoyun Liu-Li should also be around the same age as Mo Zitong.</p>
 <p>“She hasn’t been around for many years now," Mo Zitong only replied slowly after a while.</p>
 <p>“She’s dead?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was taken aback. Although he had thought of this possibility, he was still surprised. He kept staring into Mo Zitong eyes right at this moment, trying not to miss a trace of anything. When he thought back to what had happened just now and also Mo Zitong’s age, he felt that something fishy was going on.</p>
 <p>"I have come all the way here knowing she is still around." Qing Shui’s gave Mo Zitong a pointed look with his sharp gaze, as his powerful spirit energy bore down upon him.</p>
 <p>“Impudent!”</p>
 <p>The two old men summoned the Qi aura in their entire body and suppressed Qing Shui when they saw Qing Shui pressuring Mo Zitong with his spirit energy. At the same time, they took a step forward protectively to the front of Mo Zitong.</p>
 <p>Roc's Might!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui suppressed the two old men with his enormous pressure. With the Arhat Rosary Beads, the old men’s spirit energy attack was halved. The Spirited Snake Turtle also had the effect of reducing opponent’s spirit energy attack by 20%.</p>
 <p>With these, the spirit energy of the two old men, which were already pitiful enough to Qing Shui, became even more pathetic…</p>
 <p>To be competing with Qing Shui on spirit energy attacks was basically courting death itself. The two old men’s faces immediately paled, as they unconsciously retreated a few steps backward. Furthermore, this was when Qing Shui was already showing mercy on them.</p>
 <p>“My woman wants to meet Mo Hongluo. If she wasn’t a relative of yours, I wouldn’t be showing any mercy. I have no ill intention. My condition stays the same. I want to see Mo Hongluo,” Qing Shui said firmly while staring dead at Mo Zitong.</p>
 <p>Mo Zitong also understood why his opponent had gone easy on him last time. Even the two people by his side from the Elder Association were defeated so easily. Just how strong was he? Was Qing Shui showing mercy on him because his woman and Young Aunt were related? If she was related to Young Aunt, then didn’t that mean that she was his relative too? Who could she be?</p>
 <p>Mo Zitong was currently extremely conflicted. It seemed like this Qing Shui wasn’t going to return without meeting Young Aunt. On top of that, Qing Shui didn’t seem to believe the news that Young Aunt wasn’t here too. What should he do?</p>
 <p>Just when he was being indecisive, the aura around him surged. Soon enough, about a dozen elderly men appeared and their strengths were actually around 5,000 stars. One of them actually had the strength of 5,700 stars…</p>
 <p>Demon Gate was indeed a supreme sect. Not even the formidable Buddha Sect from the Central Continent dared to act recklessly around them due to their rich background. It was important to know that in the battle between powerful sects, whatever progress was made in the last few centuries would be regressed regardless of who won or who lost.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at these old men who had appeared, without much change in his expression. He was looking at Mo Zitong. He wasn’t sure if Mo Zitong could make a decision, but he still wished that he could make a decision.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, Young Aunt is really not around anymore…”</p>
 <p>“You’re lying. Do you think that my spirit energy from earlier is only for show?” Qing Shui laughed coldly at Mo Zitong.</p>
 <p>“Young man, your impudence will not be tolerated here!” A leading elderly man suddenly shouted at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui lifted his leg and immediately reappeared in the air. He stared at that elderly man. “Try telling me that again!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned to Mo Zitong again without waiting for the old man to speak. “I have been very patient. I only have something to tell Mo Hongluo. I sincerely hope that you will make the right decision. No one can stop me from meeting Mo Hongluo. You have to know that some sacrifices are unnecessary.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had been emitting a threatening atmosphere as he was speaking. The sudden release of powerful spiritual pressure had caused the old man from earlier to open his mouth, but he wasn’t able to say anything. He was looking at Qing Shui with his eyes that were as sharp as a knife, as if he had seen a ghost…</p>
 <p>“All of you, go down at once!”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, a voice rang out from afar. Qing Shui looked grave too when he sensed the other party’s aura. It was powerful and the aura seemed to have been masked. It was only 5,000 stars, but Qing Shui knew that it wasn’t as simple as merely 5,000 stars.</p>
 <p>“Clan Head!”</p>
 <p>“Clan Head!”</p>
 <p>“Grandfather!”</p>
 <p>…………</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was watching the old man who had appeared at a distance. The old man was only slightly older. He wasn’t particularly tall, but he had an intangible imposing aura. It was the aura of a leading man and his strength. Although his hair was white, the wrinkles on his face were very fine. There was a hint of a smile in his wise eyes.</p>
 <p>The old man waved his hand. Everyone including Mo Zitong left. Qing Shui looked at him. He didn’t expect the head of Demon Gate to actually be an old man who appeared to be particularly friendly.</p>
 <p>“Young man, you have really opened this old man’s eyes today. Why don’t you accompany me for some tea?” The old man invited Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p>“That’s all I could ever wish for. Please lead the way!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t expect to be able to meet the head of Demon Gate so soon. Perhaps it was due to how he had intentionally expanded his Qi aura earlier. Qing Shui followed the old man and flew to somewhere further.</p>
 <p>They were at a manor that was slightly more remote than the others. It was very peaceful and quiet here, without any other manors situated within its radius of 100 meters. The terrain was also higher here, so the other manors around here were visible.</p>
 <p>As soon as they entered a room, the old man smiled and gestured for Qing Shui to take a seat. In fact, the moment Qing Shui entered here, he could feel a wave of faint spirit energy around here. It was an indescribable sensation.</p>
 <p>“Daddy!”</p>
 <p>Just right after Qing Shui and the old man had taken a seat, a woman came in holding a teapot. She was tall, thin and had a pair of gorgeous phoenix-like eyes.</p>
 <p>Her nose was straight and sharp and her skin appeared to be smooth and silky. The loose clothes on her brought out her charm. She was also startled when she saw Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Lass, this is Qing Shui. Come have a seat and talk. It’s rare to have someone to talk to.” The old man chuckled.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, this is my daughter, Hongxiu!” The old man laughed.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui thought that the woman’s eyes were very similar to Huoyun Liu-Li’s, he had a feeling that Demon Gate wouldn’t let him meet Mo Hongluo so easily. Besides, even Mo Zitong said that Mo Hongluo wasn’t around anymore, though he wasn’t going to buy that.</p>
 <p>“How do you do, Mister Qing!” The woman greeted Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Hello, Miss Hongxiu!” Qing Shui greeted her politely then looked at the old man.</p>
 <p>“Old man, I am sure you’ve heard about what had happened between Demon Gate and I. It isn’t my intention to make enemies with anyone. I am only here today because I want to meet someone. To fulfill my wife’s wish.” Qing Shui went straight to the point.</p>
 <p>“You wish to see Hongluo?” The old man asked Qing Shui after contemplating for a moment.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw how this woman by the name of Hongxiu looked at him in surprise when she heard the old man’s words. However, she was only surprised but didn’t say anything else.</p>
 <p>“Old Man, I must meet Mo Hongluo.” Qing Shui stated firmly and decisively.</p>
 <p>“You know about Hongluo?” The old man sighed.</p>
 <p>“I know some, but not into details.”</p>
 <p>“It was an ill-fated relationship. Why don’t you share with me your purpose of coming? Why do you want to see Hongluo? If you have a strong enough reason, I will let you see her.” The old man gave Qing Shui a smile.</p>
 <p>The old man was also a little puzzled. Qing Shui was trying to fulfill his wife’s wish. What relation did his woman have with Hongluo? It had been more than 30 years. This youth seemed to only be in his thirties too.</p>
 <p>“Although Huoyun Peng and Mo Hongluo were taken back by the Buddha Sect and Demon Gate 36 years ago, they left their daughter out there. Unfortunately, she is my wife now.” Qing Shui explained to the old man, but his gaze was locked on that woman by the name of Hongxiu all this time.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know how many daughters this old man had, but he felt that something was off through the words of the old man from earlier. Especially how he had said that ‘it was rare to have someone to talk to’.</p>
 <p>That woman called Hongxiu appeared to be surprised, happy and nostalgic, yet she was biting down on her lips. She was trying her best to keep herself from making any noises and stop the tears in her eyes from falling.</p>
 <p>“You are Mo Hongluo, Huoyun Liu-Li’s mother!” Qing Shui immediately exclaimed while looking at that woman called Hongxiu. The tone of his voice was firm, as he slightly pressured her with his spirit energy.</p>
