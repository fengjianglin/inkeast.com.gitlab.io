 <p><strong>AST 1118 - Mutual Destruction, Marrow Nibbling Golden Silkworm, Close Call Between Life and Death</strong></p>
 <p>Unknowingly, about half of the 15 minutes had already passed. However, Qing Shui felt as if a very long time had already gone by. He didn't dare to let this Golden Ni Lion get close to him and thus he had brought out all of his best battle techniques without any hesitation to entertain it.</p>
 <p>Four Phases Formation!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui went into the Four Phases Formation with his three demonic beasts. Qing Shui stood at the Vermilion Bird’s position which would allow his spirit energy attacks to increase a little in prowess.</p>
 <p>The Nine Continents Mountain continued to smash down on the Golden Ni Lion from above but the effect wasn't great. However, Qing Shui’s aim was to create disturbances and to infuriate the Golden Ni Lion, causing it to have the thoughts of destroying the Nine Continents Mountain. This would allow him to buy some time.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>The Golden Ni Lion let out a deafening roar, exuding a golden light that almost seemed material. Even the Nine Continents Mountain was pushed away and some unfortunate people who came into contact with the light disappeared completely. This caused many more people to attempt to run for their lives. However, this time around, the Golden Ni Lion didn't give chase but merely opened its mouth to spew out a sphere of light that was as brilliant as the sun and the moon towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>A surge of formless power came towards Qing Shui, giving him the feeling of being entangled by spider webs. Qing Shui's heart clenched. In the spur of the moment, he wanted to try if the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring could help him escape from the restrictive power.</p>
 <p>300 meters!</p>
 <p>Thankfully, Qing Shui happy could still get out from the confinement of the surge of power. This made him happy. It should be that the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring could be used under a free state. If one was bound or trapped by some unique items, they wouldn't be able to use it. For example, when bound by the Demon Binding Ropes or pressed down by a demonic beast... Another prerequisite was that one's consciousness must not be controlled and the person must be alive.</p>
 <p>Primordial Flame Whip, Primordial Flame Dragon Drill!</p>
 <p>Although these attacks could buy him some time as well, it seemed that they couldn't deal much damage to the Golden Ni Lion. It didn't have much time left, but Qing Shui couldn't afford to be careless. There were the ladies behind him and Qing Shui had already told them that they must constantly be ready to use the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring.</p>
 <p>Just as Qing Shui let his guard down a little, the Golden Ni Lion once again spewed out a fine golden light toward him, striking Qing Shui's in a flash.</p>
 <p>No reaction at all!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui felt that his reactions were much slower. This was a constraining power, and it seemed to only target one's Sacred Jade Divine Stone. Qing Shui was about to use the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring and although he could use it with just a thought, it still required some time. For example, it depended on whether one was thinking about reaching exactly at 200 meters away or further off.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui couldn't afford this amount of time before the huge golden figure pounced toward him, quick as lightning.</p>
 <p>Marrow Nibbling Golden Silkworm!</p>
 <p>A hint of a golden light spot flickered on Qing Shui's chest and it shot out towards the Golden Ni Lion's head. It was so fast that no one had seen it. If it wasn’t for his connection with the Marrow Nibbling Golden Silkworm, he probably wouldn't be able to detect it either.</p>
 <p>Although the Marrow Nibbling Golden Silkworm was powerful, the Golden Ni Lion was much too big. It would take some time for this Marrow Nibbling Golden Silkworm to kill it based on its size alone. Moreover, there was also the question of whether it would be able to kill it.</p>
 <p>It's huge claw slapped down and Qing Shui instinctively crossed his hands. A faint layer of golden light appeared.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was sent flying away. It felt as if his body had fallen apart as he spewed out fresh blood. However, he noticed that the Golden Ni Lion seemed to appear a little despondent as it stayed where it was and trembled. It looked completely different from what it had looked like earlier and was roaring out in agony, slapping its two huge paws on its head.</p>
 <p>"Something's not right!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was puzzled. Even if the Marrow Nibbling Golden Silkworm had an effect, the attack from the Golden Ni Lion shouldn't be like this. Qing Shui should have been instantly killed...</p>
 <p>Lightning Recovery!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the Thunderous Beast that was also in a similarly despondent state and was using its Lightning Recovery. Its injuries immediately recovered by a lot.</p>
 <p>In the most crucial moment, the Thunderous Beast had saved Qing Shui by using the battle technique, Mutual Destruction.</p>
 <p>Mutual Destruction: Using 80% of its injuries in exchange for 80% of the target's injuries. It attacks the opponent with a terrifying power and both parties would suffer damage. Mutual Destruction cannot instantly take the opponent's life.</p>
 <p>It could only be used once a month!</p>
 <p>In a situation where the difference in strength was tremendous, the success rate was very low!</p>
 <p>However, this time around, it was a success. One reason for the success was the Marrow Nibbling Golden Silkworm. That short instant of immense pain created a great gap in the Golden Ni Lion's mental state, allowing the Thunderous Beast's Mutual Destruction to succeed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was really very lucky and it was as if he was destined to not die here. The heavy injury dealt in that moment caused the Golden Ni Lion's attacks to decrease in prowess and Qing Shui managed to survive the ordeal.</p>
 <p>80% injuries could be considered quite serious and it would be hard to save it. Moreover, this Golden Ni Lion was seriously injured to begin with and Beitang Yiyao had said that it had only 15 minutes left to live.</p>
 <p>To think that Qing Shui still suffered such a serious injury despite his Nine Yang Golden Body being at the small success stage. It was at this moment that Qing Shui discovered the advantage of the Nine Yang Golden Body. It allowed his bones to be terrifying strong and gave him a great resistance against attacks. And right now, a mysterious power was coming out from his bones, fixing up his physical injuries.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, his Yin-Yang Image and Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique were also aiding his self-recuperative process. Qing Shui's self-recovery abilities were very terrifying. Of course, it was still not a match for the Thunderous Beast.</p>
 <p>The surroundings fell silent. Many people didn't manage to catch what had happened. They had all thought that Qing Shui was doomed. Although it was very normal for Qing Shui to be seriously injured, what they were astonished about was why did the Golden Ni Lion suddenly appear as if it was on its deathbed?</p>
 <p>Seeing the state of the Golden Ni Lion, everyone's mood turned better and some of the remaining people from Beitang Clan were immediately jointly killed by Yin Clan, Yinyue Clan, as well as Violet Dragon Mountain.</p>
 <p>The few ladies had come out a long time ago and were looking at Qing Shui. They were worried, trying to see if his injuries were serious. In that moment earlier, they had dashed out, their hearts aching. Yiye Jiange was even acting as if she had gone crazy as she caught Qing Shui who was sent flying.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Qing Shui was still alive, Yiye Jiange heaved a sigh of relief. Even she couldn't understand why she was in tears.</p>
 <p>"You can't have anything happen to you, Qing Shui. We haven't gotten married yet." Yiye Jiange hugged Qing Shui and called out to him, seeing that his breath was very weak.</p>
 <p>"I won't die as long as you promise me one thing." Qing Shui's body continued to recover but blood was still trickling from the corner of his mouth. Yiye Jiange had wiped it off with her hand, but it still continued to drip out.</p>
 <p>"I promise you, I'll promise you anything. Even if it's one, ten, or tens of millions of conditions. I'll promise you, as long as you stay alive." Yiye Jiange didn't care about anything else anymore.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui struggled to stand in the air. Although he was seriously injured, his self-recovery abilities were monstrous. The people from Violet Dragon Mountain were now standing a short distance from them and the remaining members of Beitang Clan had also completely disappeared.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood there, seeming very weak. He didn't take a look at Yin Clan and Yinyue Clan but looked at the Golden Ni Lion which seemed to be breathing its final few breaths. To think that such a powerful demonic beast was going to die. It had lost its vitality. He let Luan Luan use the Demonic Beast Token to seal it up again. Qing Shui didn't have the confidence that he'll be able to heal it nor would he dare to save it.</p>
 <p>Just then, Du Yannian and the others also appeared. Qing Shui was supported by the few ladies and was covered in blood. Everyone could tell that he was now very weak.</p>
 <p>"Stop right there! No one is allowed to get close to Mister Qing now!" Even Zilong Shi didn't get close to Qing Shui. He only stopped Du Yannian and the others from getting close.</p>
 <p>"Mister, how are you feeling? Are you alright?" Du Yannian asked with concern. There were two old men next to him—Hao Tong and Yang Chong.</p>
 <p>"I'm fine!" Qing Shui waved his hand and the moment he said this, he spewed out another mouthful of blood.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, don't scare us." The ladies supported Qing Shui, their faces covered with tears.</p>
 <p>The atmosphere was now very strange. There were still many people from Yin Clan and Yinyue clan. Although their clan head had died, there were still people to take charge. Moreover, which clan wouldn't have someone lusting after the position of clan head?</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, many people gathered over. Although Zilong Shi did his best to control them, they lost in numbers and were forced back by a formless pressure.</p>
 <p>"Du Yannian, why are you standing there? Come over here."</p>
 <p>At this moment, an old man from Yin Clan shouted out. The old man looked a little like Yin Lan, just slightly older. Right now, he couldn't hide how pleased he was.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui closed his eyes, not looking at anyone and only focused on recuperating. He had really suffered from heavy injuries. It could be said that if another person of his level were to receive the same injury, that person would have died.</p>
 <p>Du Yannian had 300 people with him, and just the direct descendants of Yin Clan and Yinyue Clan were over 2,000 in number. Right now, there were also many people wearing clothes from Lion King's Ridge standing behind the two clans.</p>
 <p>Du Yannian looked at them, then at Qing Shui, and then to the 300 people behind him. Back then, Qing Shui hadn't killed them and even wanted them to push for one of their people to inherit Lion King's Ridge with absolutely no conditions attached.</p>
 <p>Back then, the three of them had even told him some of the addresses to their residences. Back then, they trusted that he would be able to move against Beitang Clan. And right now, although he had succeeded, he was in a horrible plight.</p>
 <p>"Du Yannian, you must think carefully. If you continue to stand there, I won't be able to guarantee your safety." Yin Shang looked at Du Yannian and said unhappily.</p>
 <p>"Beitang Clan has already been wiped out and they are already in this state. Why don't we stop here." Du Yannian looked at Yin Shang and said.</p>
 <p>"Hahaha, I'll ask you one more time. Are you going to return to Lion King's Ridge or rebel?" Yin Shang's tone was very cold.</p>
 <p>Du Yannian looked at Qing Shui and the ladies next to him and then shook his head, "We were meant to have died previously. Today, we'll return our lives to you. Later on, we'll protect you while you leave this place."</p>
 <p>Du Yannian looked at Qing Shui and said softly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't open his eyes but just revealed a faint smile. However, he didn't say anything.</p>
 <p>"Zilong Shi, if you guys were to retreat now, we can still be as before. Lion King's Ridge and Violet Dragon Mountain won't interfere with each other's matters." Yin Shang knew how terrifying Violet Dragon Mountain was and if they were to get into a fight, both parties would suffer great casualties.</p>
 <p>"I don't care about Violet Dragon Mountain. My life was saved by Mister Qing. I won't let anyone hurt him unless I die. This is what I owe him." Zilong Shi shook his head and said calmly.</p>
 <p>The several tens of people behind Zilong Shi also stood quietly behind him. Zilong Shi was someone of high status in Violet Dragon Mountain and his cultivation was quite high too. Most importantly, it would be very troublesome to kill him.</p>
 <p>Right now, Yin Shang was faced with a tough decision, he then looked at the people from Yin Clan and then at the weak young man. He waved his hand and said, "Kill! For our own sake, kill! Don't leave a single one of them behind! After killing them all, everyone can get a bottle of Spirit Concentrating Pills and Bloody Lotus Pills!"</p>
