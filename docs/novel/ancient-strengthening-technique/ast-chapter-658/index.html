 <p><strong>AST 658 - Uses of the ‘Pearl’, Seven Stars Street</strong></p>
 <p>“Poison Dragon Pearl?” Qing Shui couldn’t believe his ears and asked doubtfully.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su looked at Qing Shui and said seriously: “I’m also not quite sure, but I can feel that this is the Poison Dragon Pearl. Even though I have never seen it before, my assumption is unlikely to be wrong. You can also call it Poison Pearl since it might not be that apt to call it a Dragon Pearl.”</p>
 <p>“It doesn’t really matter what it is, what’s the use of this pearl?” Qing Shui was more concerned with this. He didn’t care if it’s the Poison Dragon Pearl, he just wanted to know what it could be used for.</p>
 <p>“For now, let’s just call it the Poison Dragon Pearl since there is a 80 percent chance of it being a Poison Dragon Pearl. Actually, the Poison Dragons arenlt the divine dragons mentioned in legends. They’re likely to be an ascended form of a Poisonous Jiao. The Poison Dragon Pearls were made of the essence within the Poison Dragon’s body.” Yuan Su explained slowly after pondering for a while.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui first heard the word dragon, he felt a bit excited. He assumed that it should be a demonic beast which was higher in rank compared to a Jiao. For example, Poison Dragon Beast and Poison Flood Dragon.</p>
 <p>“Even though it isn’t an true dragon, it still possesses a dragon’s veins within its body. The Poison Dragons are actually quite famous across the World of the Nine Continents. The only problem is that they are quite rare nowadays. This pearl could only be formed by a demonic beast at Peak Martial Saint grade. It’s even more rare than the demonic beast’s Core. Even though I have mentioned that only a demonic beast at Peak Martial Saint could make the pearls, it didn’t necessarily mean that all of them would be able to do it. Other than that, if a demonic beast was to lose this pearl, it would instantaneously turn into a crippled beast.”</p>
 <p>As Yuan Su spoke, Qing Shui finally understood that the pearl was not only the essence of a Peak Martial Saint Demonic Beast, but also an extremely rare object. Considering that it’s the essence within the body of a Poison Dragon, it should be really toxic.</p>
 <p>“I have spent so much time explaining, yet I haven’t told you about its use.” Yuan Su smiled and looked at Qing Shui. She seemed to be really patient.</p>
 <p>“Well then, will the Miss quickly explain the use of this pearl?” Qing Shui laughed as he said this.</p>
 <p>“I’m not quite sure myself. But I have heard rumors saying that this kind of pearl has intelligence. It’s no easy task but if you have it on you fairly often, you will be able to sense something, so much so that you will start to be able to control it with your mind. Furthermore, considering that this is a pearl from a Poisonous Dragon, it’s really risky to wear it since the essence of the dragons themselves is also poisonous.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui remained silent as he continued to listen to what Yuan Su said.</p>
 <p>“These kinds of pearls have particularly abundant spirit energy. If it wasn’t a Poisonous Dragon Pearl, it would still turn out to be an outstanding medicinal herb. The problem is that the Poison Dragon Pearls are also something which Poison Cultivators longed for. As long as you don’t directly come into contact with the Dragon Pearl, you will be fine. It can also be used to water poisonous plants or nurture living things which are poisonous to strengthen their toxicity.”</p>
 <p>As she spoke, Qing Shui seemed to have gotten a grasp on something even though he was still a bit confused. Despite this, he was still satisfied that he had finally understood its basic uses.</p>
 <p>“Is there no other use anymore?” Qing Shui asked casually.</p>
 <p>“Other? Regarding that, it's still used as a medicinal pill or it could be fed to other demonic beasts. There is a possibility that it will gain new abilities. It will have the best effect if it's taken in by a demonic beast. Or else the human warrior with it is very likely to be poisoned to death. It can also be used as a poisonous weapon, for instance, you can throw it at your opponent, inserting it into their body.”</p>
 <p>“How tough is the Poison Dragon Pearl?” Qing Shui asked after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>“Apparently, a Peak Martial Saint Warrior would also need to go all out and attack a number of times to break it.” Yuan Su smiled and explained.</p>
 <p>“If I open up this bottle, will the toxicity of the pearls in it be gone?” Qing Shui already had his own thoughts on how to use the dragon pearls. However, he was still a little apprehensive.</p>
 <p>“No it won't. These pearls would recover toxicity on their own so long as you still managed to retain half of it. But if you were to use up half of its toxicity at one go, it will slowly turn into a useless pearl. Normally, you can speed up the recovery by nurturing them with some poisons.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you!”</p>
 <p>“You’re welcome!” Yuan Su gave a faint smile and responded.</p>
 <p>“Shall we open it up and see?”</p>
 <p>“Alright, I too want to have a look.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui opened up the bottle. As soon as he did, the entire room instantaneously felt really chilly. The bottle was only the size of a baby’s fist. It's shaped like the bottom part of a calabash. Qing Shui also felt a strong spirit fluctuation from the chilliness of the room. He was truly amazed by the essence of a Peak Martial Saint Demonic Beast.</p>
 <p>He tried to look at the pearl through the mouth of the bottle. The pearl was as big as an oat, jet-black in color and unusually translucent. It was so black that it sent chills down Qing Shui’s spine and shone with light that seemed to belong to a demon.</p>
 <p>When looking at it, it gave off a feeling that would cause one to stop and not go further. It was a feeling of danger. Even Qing Shui who possessed the Nature Energy didn't dare to risk it. He didn't feel the need to risk himself for it. He would wait for his Nature Energy to ascend even further because only then, would he be able to resist the poison with it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that it might be useful for the poisonous substances in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Not to mention that his Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb needed to be refined urgently. It seemed like these pearls might really come in handy for him.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su passed it back to Qing Shui after looking a few times at it.</p>
 <p>After a while, Qing Shui stood up and said his goodbyes. He threw the bottle containing the Poison Dragon Pearl into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and placed it among the poisonous flowers and grasses.</p>
 <p>Just like that, the incident resolving the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death had been decided. Simultaneously, the world was really heated up with rumors about it. People from around the entire Seven Stars Country, other countries and other cities were all planning to head here to spectate the match.</p>
 <p>Within one short day, not only had the entire city found out about it, a few unknown forces even started to get themselves involved in it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't care about any of these. It's obvious that they were trying to profit from another’s misfortune. Other than that, there were still a lot of people who wanted to take advantage of the situation but in order to do so, they would need to be strong enough.</p>
 <p>“Chen`Er, let’s go out and walk around.” By the time Qing Shui found Di Chen, she was staring blankly into space.</p>
 <p>“Alright!” As soon as she saw Qing Shui, the upset look on her face immediately got replaced by a happy one.</p>
 <p>After taking only a few steps, they could already see both Di Qing and Yuan Su walking towards them. When Qing Shui saw this, he automatically knew that was impossible for Di Chen and him to spend some alone time.</p>
 <p>“Sister, where are you guys going?”</p>
 <p>“Let’s go together. We may no longer be in the mood to do so in two days.” Di Chen smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Di Qing’s face immediately turned upset.</p>
 <p>“Qing`Er, stop thinking so much, there's always a way out.” Di Chen said gently.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, it's nothing. I'm just a bit grumpy, how great would it be if I was a Peak Martial Saint, they wouldn't dare to come even if they had nine lives.” Di Qing said grumpily.</p>
 <p>“Sister Qing, do you believe in me?” Yuan Su smiled and asked Di Qing.</p>
 <p>“Of course I do! Who else is going to help us other than you?” Di Qing believed deeply in Yuan Su’s mysterious sensing ability. To be more accurate, her ability to sense a person’s character. It was not actually an ability that was capable of finding out things in advance before they happened.</p>
 <p>“If you believe in me, then be happy. Now that you have me aiding you, everything will be fine.” Yuan Su glanced towards Qing Shui and said calmly with a smile.</p>
 <p>Di Qing accidentally saw Yuan Su’s intentional glance. In response to that, she smiled: “I will believe in you then! Let's hang out together today.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was squished in the middle. Even though he was happy that he was like a moon surrounded by myriads of stars, he would quickly be the center of attention as soon as he stepped out of the house, considering that the three girls were all extreme beauties.</p>
 <p>On top of that, both Di Qing and Di Chen no longer wore their veils and Qing Shui was quite good-looking. There would be a lot of people talking about them along the way. Even if Qing Shui possessed great strength, it was still really easy for him to be criticized as a man who lived off women.</p>
 <p>If Qing Shui had looked tall, bold, powerful, and more boorish, he would end up being called a toad lusting after a swan’s flesh.</p>
 <p>To a certain extent, the only way to stop these kind of gossips would be for Qing Shui to continue getting stronger. Across the World of the Nine Continents, one’s strength was more than enough to decide everything.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, where shall we go?” After walking for a while, Di Chen asked Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go to Seven Stars street, I would like to go have a look at the Seven Stars Battle Arena.” Qing Shui responded after thinking for a while. He felt that it would be worth a visit before the match began.</p>
 <p>Everyone agreed with Qing Shui’s suggestions except Di Chen who glanced towards Qing Shui with an uneasy look. Despite this, she didn't say anything. Eventually, they rode on a beast cart and rushed their way towards Seven Stars Street.</p>
 <p>Seven Stars Street wasn't too far away from here. However, it would still take a long time for a person to walk there on foot and since there were a few outstanding girls with him, he thought that it would be better for him to ride a beast cart. He also felt it unnecessary to ride the Fire Bird, despite there being a lot of people riding their own mounts along the street.</p>
 <p>There was no wrong to maintaining a low profile, especially during times like this.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, the four arrived at Seven Stars Street. Qing Shui and the rest stopped when there was still quite a distance between them and the arena.</p>
 <p>The Seven Stars Street was one of the widest streets in Seven Stars City. This place was considered the biggest landmark in Seven Stars Country because it was also one of the most developed areas. The aristocratic clans would often do their business here.</p>
 <p>The width of the Seven Stars Street was roughly a thousand meters. A street that wide was something that Qing Shui would never have been able to imagine. But after spending so many years here, he had already gotten used to seeing it. Furthermore, the different kinds of beasts and beast carts that passed along the street gave a unique feeling to Qing Shui. He really enjoyed it.</p>
 <p>The environment here was also really good. Myriads of tall shops, many of which sheltered both sides of the street, the continuous yelling noises as well as noises of customers negotiating with the sellers, formed a type of melody along the street. Even though Qing Shui was in the middle of a noisy street, he felt really calm.</p>
 <p>“Look! The young lady from Di Clan! She’s so beautiful!”</p>
 <p>“Unfortunately, Di Clan will be finished in two days. No matter how beautiful she looks, she will still end up a toy for Ten Thousand Poisons Sect.” The person from just now said.</p>
 <p>“Actually, why does Ten Thousand Poisons Sect want to force Di Clan to the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death?” Someone interrupted the person from before. Topics like this would often end up gathering a lot of crowds fairly easily.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that you knew?” The others looked at the young man who spoke previously in suspicion.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, my cousin is from Sima Clan, it's normal for me to know things like this.” The young man responded in an arrogant manner.</p>
 <p>“Oh, I forgot, brother Zhao’s cousin is a steward from Sima Clan. Brother Zhao, please stop being so secretive and tell everyone the reason for it. The longer you hold it, the more impatient you’ll get.” One of the men from before quickly changed his expression and said with an ingratiating smile.</p>
