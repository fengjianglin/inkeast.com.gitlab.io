 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man wasn't an ordinary person and could tell that there was something suspicious about this. However, it was the truth that Xuan Tong had died here. It was normal for him to ask Qing Shui for an explanation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"My grandson had died here. Shouldn't I be asking for an explanation from you?" The old man looked at Qing Shui and said, seemingly unhappy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, he had lost a grandson. Although this grandson was a good-for-nothing, he was still a member of the Xuan Clan. The old man had hoped that he would be able to live his life in peace. However, as he had many children and grandchildren, although he was angry that this worthless grandson had died, it wasn't to the extent that he would be overwhelmed with fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'd have to say that it is really astonishing, the fact that such a childish method of shifting the blame had some effects." Qing Shui shook his head and looked at the old man before he then glared at that gentle-looking man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're saying that Xing Song had pushed the blame onto you and that he's the one who was behind my grandson's death?" The old man was also suspicious of Xing Song earlier. However, after taking a long look at Xing Song, he believed that with Xing Song’s ability, he wouldn't have been able to hide it from the old man if he had really done something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Then what if he wasn't the same person he was before?" Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man shook his head and looked at Qing Shui. "I know what you want to say, but my eyes haven’t blurred yet. I can still tell if he's still the same person."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head, "I hadn't detected it previously, but didn't you sense that his body and spiritual sense had been controlled? It can be said that a portion of the soul in his body isn't him anymore."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man's eyes lit up and when he looked at Xing Song once again, he saw that Xing Song, who was initially fine, had now fainted. The old man reached out his hand and grabbed Xing Song by the neck, lifting him up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cough cough...</span></p>

When he saw the old man, his face had turned pale and he stuttered, "Old... coughs coughs... Old Master!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Why did you kill Xuan Tong?" The old man bellowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Killed Xuan Tong? What? Young Master…?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xing Song stuttered and there were disbelief and fear on his face. However, people with good judgments would be able to tell right away if he was really the one who had done it. The old man got him to look at the dead Xuan Tong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Young Master! Young Master?!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What did you do for the past two days?" The old man's eyes were very sharp and serious. He now understood. However, he still threw occasional glances toward Qing Shui. This young man wasn't someone ordinary and there was still the possibility that he was the culprit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I, I can’t remember much from these past few days..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Bring him back and question him." The old man instructed and a middle-aged man and two young men brought the few people at the table back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui heaved a sigh of relief but still felt that this was bad luck. Xuan Tong had died here. He wasn't a firm believer of bad omen but was still a little unhappy that something like this had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were still five people left, namely the old man, as well as two middle-aged and two young men behind him. Xuan Tong had been brought back as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Young man. Are you able to convince me that you weren't the one who had controlled Xing Song?" By this time, the old man was already clear that Qing Shui had nothing to do with this. However, this was how great clans had acted with their arrogant characters. It didn't matter if Qing Shui wasn’t related to this matter. The fact that someone had died here meant that things won't be resolved so easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui heard what the old man had said, he frowned. Although he knew that the old man wouldn't let this matter slide just like that, he didn't expect to still be suspected. Could it be that the old man wanted to salvage Xuan Clan's reputations by using him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone from the Xuan Clan had died here and there must be someone to be held responsible for this. They wanted to let people know that wherever the people of the Xuan Clan died, the people from there would be held responsible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's gaze turned cold as he stared at the old man, "I can only say that this matter had nothing to do with me. You guys have already disturbed my banquet and I'm not obligated to say any more than this. Please leave!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Qing Shui didn't wish to create trouble, he wasn't afraid of them. He believed that there wasn't a need to continue and bear with it when others were already standing all over him. He was not that helpless yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was now chasing people away. Since the other party didn't know any better and thought that he was an easy target to bully, there wasn't a need for him to care about their reputations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man's eyes instantly became sharp as a blade, as if he wanted to tear Qing Shui to shreds. He had lived such a long life and hadn't been chased away before. At that moment, he was so infuriated that he burst out laughing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, alright. This is the first time that I, Xuan Yun, is being chased away. Let me see if you have the ability to do so." The old man was full of rage at this moment. However, he soon noticed that he seemed to have been led on by this young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In normal circumstances, he shouldn't get angry so easily. Moreover, the person he was facing was only a young man. Could it be because of this young man's abilities?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could sense that this young man was very strong. Could it be that he was already subconsciously treating him as an expert of the same level?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Did you know that evil can't win against the righteous? Do you know about Nature Energy? Do you know what it means to stand up for justice? I don't bully others, but I won't allow for others to bully me neither." Qing Shui said calmly but his voice was very strong and determined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xuan Yun's countenance changed. He could sense that as Qing Shui spoke, a powerful righteous force was being exuded from him. That was Nature Energy and the legendary Nature Energy could destroy everything when cultivated to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui also felt that recently, his Nature Energy was much stronger compared to how it was before. Both the Nature Energy and Unmoving Like A Mountain had been merged into the seven-colored pellet. However, that didn't mean that they had disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had no idea why, but the Nature Energy was actually very powerful and bursting out, gushing out unstoppably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Lord Guardian, we are not afraid of him. We'll make whoever dares to create trouble here to stay here forever." A seemingly young man said loudly. He seemed to be very headstrong and full of vigor, not knowing what consequences his words would bring him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui put out his hand and stopped them from spouting rubbish. After all, nothing good would turn out from getting themselves targeted by the old man and the people around him.</span></p>

Young man, how about we have a fight? If you were to win, we'll leave and we will never take another step in this area. If you were to lose, you'll give me an explanation." Xuan Yun calmed down and said to Qing Shui.</span></p>

I want to know who is it that is trying to scheme against me." Qing Shui shook his head and said calmly.</span></p>

Even if you didn't mention it, I'll still investigate the matter. That person isn't just scheming against you, but against me as well. I won't let such a vile character like this to continue to be arrogant." Xuan Yun nodded and said.</span></p>

He knew that now that things had come down to this, it could only be settled through a fight. This wasn't a life-or-death battle but was just a fight for both parties to come into contact and test each other’s strength. If the matter couldn't be resolved by words alone, then they would talk with their power.</span></p>

If he ended up losing, they could end up in a very bad plight. Without him, the Sunset Sea King Palace would find it hard to sustain themselves. Although they would be able to hold their stand in the Ice Ocean Domain, they still required him here. Qing Hanye had the backing of her Master, but it seemed that this was still insufficient. Otherwise, her Master wouldn't have arranged for this marriage for Qing Hanye herself.</span></p>
