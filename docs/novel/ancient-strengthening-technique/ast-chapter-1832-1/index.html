 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the two ladies opened their eyes again, they stared disbelievingly at Qing Shui, as they figured out the terrifying effects of the mysterious little pagodas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui and the two ladies already ranked at the top of the food chain. At least from Qing Shui’s perspective, this pagoda can double their strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the pagoda merged with their bodies, the two ladies could already figure out that it was an extraordinary treasure. It was unbelievable that it had such an astounding effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Increasing strength by onefold was only a temporary skill, but to negate damages from an equal-leveled opponent without any restrictions of time or place, it was truly amazing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, it was such a good item. Would you feel heartache with us taking it?” Qin Qing was very happy and unable to resist teasing Qing Shui. Even she didn’t know what state she was in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Giving it to my women would never give me heartache.” Qing Shui chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing did not respond, lightly lowering her head. She was extremely conflicted as this man was good in all aspects; he was merely a bit too frivolous and there was nothing to be done about it. Therefore, she could not succumb and become his woman that quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This thought made her sigh in her heart as she knew that she had completely fallen for him. She was destined to be entangled with him, or not marry at all. She would frequently think of him and her heart would feel peaceful when seeing him. It was a feeling she enjoyed very much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan was also accustomed to Qing Shui’s playfulness. People’s greatest strength was their adaptability and since no one wanted to be annoyed to death, they would eventually adapt and get used to things. Once someone was accustomed to another person’s presence, there would be a feeling of emptiness in the absence of the said person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wanted them to be accustomed to him and wormed his way into their hearts, to change them bit by bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan just had a breakthrough and now with the Parry Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda, her strength was improving rapidly. She was now more than twice as strong as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the Parry Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda, battling others of the same level was a child’s play as they could act like an invulnerable character in a game. They could keep throwing out powerful attacks without care.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two women were still ecstatic since Qing Shui had given them such a precious item. There were only three available and he had many more women than just three, yet he gave the pagodas to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his previous life, those with money loved money, as having money meant having the world. With money, people could be filial and buy presents and tonics for their parents. Of course, some claimed and believed that love and kinship could not be bought with money.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This seemed logical but practically, society was materialistic and simply surviving required money, so those who were poor did not have the luxury of love and kinship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was like what a man in his previous life had said. He was busy and though he couldn’t just use money to express his love for his parents, money was a channel for him to express it. When parents saw their children succeed, it was also a form of filial piety. If you were poor and suffering, could you still claim that you loved your parents, if you let them accompany you in poverty and suffering?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although this was slightly extreme, Qing Shui agreed with such thoughts. Money was not omnipotent, but without money, one was simply incompetent. Strength in this world was equivalent to money in his previous one. They were both far too important…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could finally understand why rich people could have women easily, as between women, bread, and money, no one would think that bread was necessary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In life, living in itself was the most important thing. To live and walk together with someone was the most blissful thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s already quite late. I’ll return first, good night!” Tantai Lingyan looked at Qing Shui and Qin Qing before smiling as she left towards her own pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded as he watched Tantai Lingyan return to her own pavilion. Her irresistible smile was still fresh in his memory and it wasn’t just him either; even Qin Qing would admit that her smile was too beautiful, like a flurry of flowers that were blooming in spring, carrying an undeniable charm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Isn’t it a good view!” Qin Qing smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes indeed, but you are also a good view.” Qing Shui turned to look at Qin Qing, who seemed slightly jealous…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t mean it!” Qin Qing smiled at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui suddenly felt like the gap between them was very small. He smiled and grabbed both her hands, causing Qin Qing to become flustered as she started to struggle. However, Qing Shui, albeit still smiling at her, refused to let go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little scoundrel, what are you up to?” Qin Qing stopped struggling, turning to glare at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You were contemplating whether to be my woman. How has that been turning out?” Qing Shui pulled them closer together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You promised you wouldn’t force me.” Qin Qing lightly lowered her head, the domineering lady suddenly turned meek and quiet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This transformation stunned Qing Shui momentarily, but not for long before he hugged her and was directly kissing those cherry lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing did not expect such a turn of events and was also stunned. When she got a grip, she felt something slippery in her mouth, a gust of a man’s odor and aura was wafting into her nostrils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was extremely conflicted, as she found herself not hating this sensation and only finding it interesting. When she finally returned to her senses, she realized that she had already come up with her conclusion. It was Qing Shui that kept pushing her to choose him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t expect her to respond after her surprise…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui greedily sucked on those lips. His hands constantly roamed and only until they reached her peaks did Qin Qing push him away. It was a pity that Qing Shui’s hands had already touched her pride.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Still not letting go.” Qin Qing coldly humphed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui used his strength to grope for a while, before unwillingly letting go. He took his hands out for a whiff, “Truly fragrant.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You really are a bad person.” Qin Qing quickly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui watched her leave, before walking to his own pavilion while smiling and grinning at his unexpected gains. Qin Qing wasn’t angry and her response told him that much. Qing Shui felt like a lot of progress was made and that it would be much simpler in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that he could not give up on some people, so he did not try to force himself to reject certain notions or actions. Life was really too short for regrets.</span></p>
