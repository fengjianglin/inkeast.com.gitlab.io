 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 204 Red Luan</strong></p>
  <p>“Didn’t you cry out louder than me the other day? But I still completed the massage, didn’t I?” Qing Shui grinned and sat up.</p>
  <p>“Stop talking about that. You’re not allowed to.” Huoyun Liu-Li said frantically. She recalled how she did not even have the strength to call out for Qing Shui to stop, but could not help and let out those embarrassing cries.</p>
  <p>“Your skills are not bad, and it’s really comfortable. No wonder the other day you…hehe.”</p>
  <p>“You’re so annoying. You’re not allowed to talk about it anymore.”</p>
  <p>“Or should I give you another massage?” Qing Shui grinned and said.</p>
  <p>“No!” Huoyun Liu-Li said firmly. Her flushed red face was especially tempting.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui continued to smile!</p>
  <p>“So how was it? Is my massage acceptable?” Huoyun Liu-Li lowered her head and said softly.</p>
  <p>“It’s good, but it’s not completed. Usually when it is not complete, it is really uncomfortable. See how I completed the whole massage the other time?” Qing Shui felt that it was a pity. He felt that the butt, which was only massaged for a short while, was still tingling and he wanted more.</p>
  <p>For the whole afternoon, Qing Shui did not see that headstrong lady, Canghai Mingyue, again. He wanted to see her because it was just like enjoying a nice scenery. He even wanted to remember some of the moments where she was especially beautiful.</p>
  <p>In the afternoon, Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-Li chatted happily about some of the events that happened recently. It was actually a very simple thing for two members of the opposite sex to have an enjoyable time together, with the prerequisite that the two of them have a favorable impression of each other. At the very least, Qing Shui had an extremely pleasant impression of Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
  <p>“How come you have so many varieties of those fruits all at once? It’s really amazing.”</p>
  <p>“I grew it myself, but I hope you don’t look down on it. There aren’t many of them.” Qing Shui rubbed his nose and said embarrassed.</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li was speechless as she looked at Qing Shui. When she heard what Qing Shui said, she really felt like strangling him.</p>
  <p>At night, Qing Shui specially cooked a meal himself with the turtles and black fishes from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Moreover, he also added the Drunken Fragrance Fruit, perilla, and thyme. Qing Shui was very happy that the flavors of these spice did not clash.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui actually had selfish motives. He wanted to see if the lady, who was so majestically beautiful and had beauty that could bring harm to the country and sufferings to the people, would take a fancy to good food. However, Qing Shui was disappointed that other than the initial slight discomposure, she only drank a bowl of All Aspect Nourishment Soup and some black fish but did not reveal anything thereafter.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt gloomy. It seemed as if she did not like to talk, or at the very least, not to him. She also did not look at him much, making Qing Shui feel especially like a failure. All the things he was proud of did not seem to be worth mentioning when placed before her.</p>
  <p>It might be because she had felt Qing Shui’s gloominess that Huoyun Liu-Li kept talking to both Qing Shui and Canghai Mingyue. She even got an additional serving of soup for Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>Upon seeing this, Canghai Mingyue broke into an intoxicating smile, but did not speak a word. Qing Shui chanced upon that amazingly beautiful smile once again.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s mind was flooded with the images of Canghai Mingyue. He imagined her beautiful brows, and her bright, profound eyes shining like stars yet were dark as ink. Her looks seemed to be full of disdain for the rest of the world. He was not sure who would be able to dominate such a woman.</p>
  <p>On the next day, Huoyun Liu-Li handed over the matters of the Earthly Paradise to Mei Yanxue, including the spice given to her by Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue let out a crisp call while Qing Shui’s expression turned grim. It was because he could feel the presence of his flaming bird. When he came to Earthly Paradise yesterday, he did not let the flaming bird return to the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui once again saw the beautiful Golden Winged Thunder Condor, but behind it was his flaming bird which was as big as the Golden Winged Thunder Condor. It seemed as if the Golden Winged Thunder Condor was trying to shake off his flaming bird.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui stood in a daze. Could it be that his flaming bird was a male while the Golden Winged Thunder Condor was a female…?</p>
  <p>When the flaming bird saw Qing Shui, it circled above him happily.</p>
  <p>However, Canghai Mingyue looked at the flaming bird in surprise and then looked at Qing Shui with her pair of profound eyes that was dark as ink. She spoke out in that unique and charming voice, “I like your big bird.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at Canghai Mingyue, stunned, while his mind was filled with the words “I like your big bird”. Qing Shui had a strange yet excited feeling all over.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui had never thought or dared to think of being able to make such a goddess like lady with a majestic aura say such words. If she were to know his current thoughts now, he wondered if she would eradicate him!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at Canghai Mingyue as he smiled bitterly and said, “While my bird is very big, I only have this one. You can see and touch it all you want. You can even ride or play with it, but I can’t let you have it…”</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Shui with a slightly weird expression, making him feel guilty. Qing Shui did not know if she was aware of the issue with the bird, but he knew for sure that Canghai Mingyue did not understand.</p>
  <p>However, Qing Shui still felt a bit scared after, feeling that he was really too lewd…</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue turned her gaze away from the flaming bird. She had only looked towards Qing Shui for a short moment when she said those words, making Qing Shui feel a bit unhappy at this prideful lady. That was why he decided to grasp the opportunity to take a slight opportunity to make himself feel happier.</p>
  <p>“Since you have a treasure like the Red Luan, you would surely not take a fancy to my Golden Winged Thunder Condor.”</p>
  <p>It was a rare opportunity for Qing Shui to hear her speak in such a tone. He was also shocked. Could it be that the flaming bird also existed in this world? He could not help but asked, “What’s a Red Luan?” </p>
  <p>“Don’t you know of the Red Luan? You have one but you don’t know what it is?” Canghai Mingyue looked at Qing Shui with a weird expression and asked, feeling puzzled.</p>
  <p>“I don’t. I got this flaming bird by chance.” Qing Shui was sort of speaking the truth.</p>
  <p>“Flaming bird? Mmm, it’s also right. Red Luan is a mutated beast in the world of the nine continents. It is said to be of the same blood heritage as the Flaming Phoenix and could possibly evolve into the legendary phoenix. However, the chance is very low since the phoenix is a legendary Divine beast in the world of the nine continents.” Canghai Mingyue looked yearningly at Qing Shui’s flaming bird.</p>
  <p>Mutated beasts. Qing Shui forgot completely about them and only knew of his flaming bird. Now, he came to realize that the flaming bird was actually the Red Luan in the world of the nine continents. It was stated in the that the Red Luan was a strong power amongst all the mutated beasts, and was also one of strongest of them all. As for the phoenix, it was a legendary top grade demonic beast but no one had seen it before.</p>
  <p>“You can take the Red Luan with Liu-Li. I’ll be in front.” After saying that, she mounted the Golden Winged Thunder Condor like a fairy taking a stroll.</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li was still in a daze, looking at Qing Shui’s beautiful big bird. She had once said that when she gets her own demonic beast, she would bring him to the places he wanted to go. Now, it felt so ridiculous. How could he be seen in the same light as normal people…</p>
  <p>The more Huoyun Liu-Li thought about it, the more helpless she felt. Within less than a year, she was already unable to catch up to him. When she first saw him, she had a better lead compared to him.</p>
  <p>“Let’s go, get on!” Qing Shui grabbed Huoyun Liu-Li’s small hand and pull her up onto the back of the flaming bird!</p>
  <p>With a cry from the condor followed by the bird, the two flying demonic beasts flew across the air quickly. One gold, one red. Qing Shui could not describe his feelings at that moment. It took him two months to come to this place and he could remember how envious he was when he first saw the Golden Winged Thunder Condor. Within a short year, he had managed to get ahold of a flying demonic beast that was stronger than the Golden Winged Thunder Condor. It felt very good to be looking down on the envious gazes of others.</p>
  <p>“Wow, Golden Winged Thunder Condor!”</p>
  <p>“What a big bird!”</p>
  <p>“Don’t you have a big bird as well?” The lady said teasingly.</p>
  <p>“When did I have one?” The guy asked.</p>
  <p>“Don’t you have a big bird below you?” The lady said in a charming and seducing tone.</p>
  <p>Guy: “…”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui heard the conversation very clearly with his keen sense of hearing. He started to break into a sweat!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui did not dare to look at Canghai Mingyue who was on the Golden Winged Thunder Condor nearby. He did not even dare to look at Huoyun Liu-Li. Thank goodness they left the area in just a few breath’s time!</p>
  <p>The flaming bird would follow closely behind the Golden Winged Thunder Condor and even go up to snug against its feathers at times. Qing Shui was speechless. Could it be that this lewd bird was really a male? To think that it was so proactive.</p>
  <p>At times when the flaming bird went overboard, the Golden Winged Thunder Condor cried out in protest and used its large golden wings to slap it. However, the lewd bird was not only just unafraid but it could also easily ward off.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was really quite speechless. He wondered if the Golden Winged Thunder Condor was already taken by the flaming bird…</p>
  <p>Once they were out of Cang Lang Country, the flaming bird and Golden Winged Thunder Condor flew side by side. They took up a circumference of 200 metres, much like that of a football field. It may be because their wings were too big that it was not especially bumpy when they were flapping.<br></p>
  <p>It was the first time Qing Shui experienced a long distance flight and he was especially excited. It took him two months to cover half of Cang Lang Country, and Cang Lang Country was northwest of the Greencloud Continent. It was more towards the far west while the Continent’s Capital was more towards the east. After all, the further east a place was, the closer it was to the prosperous Middle Continent.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Flying high up made Qing Shui recall the term “beyond the nine heavens” but he merely shook his head. In his previous life, Qing Shui had seen some information concerning the term “beyond the nine heavens”.</p>
  <p>There were different interpretations to this term in Daoism and Buddhism respectively, but Qing Shui did not know what to think of them. Rather than these interpretations, Qing Shui held a stronger belief in another interpretation, which was that everything in the world started from one and ended at nine. The nine heavens referred to the unattainable skies of extreme heights!</p>
  <p>It took them only one day to fly out of Cang Lang Country, so they decided to rest for the night. Qing Shui did not know where Canghai Mingyue took out a tent and other stuff from. Since they were in the wilderness and Qing Shui wanted to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal for training, he decided to find an excuse to leave and said that he would be back at a later time.</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Shui worriedly. After all, it would be bad if some accident were to occur in this desolate wilderness. The most dangerous things in the world of the nine continents would be the demonic beasts.</p>
  <p>“I’m fine, don’t worry!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui suddenly recalled that his goddess-like Master had said that Yan Jiang Country was in the southeast, so he looked towards Canghai Mingyue who was not far away.</p>
  <p>“Erm, can we pass by Yan City on the way? I’d like to take a look there!” Qing Shui looked towards Canghai Mingyue who was looking at the night sky. He could not help but tell himself that no matter what this lady did, she would always have a majestic beauty. Each movement was like nature itself, and each action was extremely beautiful. At the very least, there was nothing with greater beauty than her.<br></p>
  <p>“Yan City? Yan Jiang Country’s Yan City?” Canghai Mingyue turned and asked. Under the night sky, she was so beautiful that it would cause one to be dazzled and stunned!</p>

 <p>On the next day, Huoyun Liu-Li handed over the matters of the Earthly Paradise to Mei Yanxue, including the spice given to her by Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue let out a crisp call while Qing Shui’s expression turned grim. It was because he could feel the presence of his flaming bird. When he came to Earthly Paradise yesterday, he did not let the flaming bird return to the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui once again saw the beautiful Golden Winged Thunder Condor, but behind it was his flaming bird which was as big as the Golden Winged Thunder Condor. It seemed as if the Golden Winged Thunder Condor was trying to shake off his flaming bird.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood in a daze. Could it be that his flaming bird was a male while the Golden Winged Thunder Condor was a female…?</p>
 <p>When the flaming bird saw Qing Shui, it circled above him happily.</p>
 <p>However, Canghai Mingyue looked at the flaming bird in surprise and then looked at Qing Shui with her pair of profound eyes that was dark as ink. She spoke out in that unique and charming voice, “I like your big bird.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Canghai Mingyue, stunned, while his mind was filled with the words “I like your big bird”. Qing Shui had a strange yet excited feeling all over.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had never thought or dared to think of being able to make such a goddess like lady with a majestic aura say such words. If she were to know his current thoughts now, he wondered if she would eradicate him!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Canghai Mingyue as he smiled bitterly and said, “While my bird is very big, I only have this one. You can see and touch it all you want. You can even ride or play with it, but I can’t let you have it…”</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Shui with a slightly weird expression, making him feel guilty. Qing Shui did not know if she was aware of the issue with the bird, but he knew for sure that Canghai Mingyue did not understand.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui still felt a bit scared after, feeling that he was really too lewd…</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue turned her gaze away from the flaming bird. She had only looked towards Qing Shui for a short moment when she said those words, making Qing Shui feel a bit unhappy at this prideful lady. That was why he decided to grasp the opportunity to take a slight opportunity to make himself feel happier.</p>
 <p>“Since you have a treasure like the Red Luan, you would surely not take a fancy to my Golden Winged Thunder Condor.”</p>
 <p>It was a rare opportunity for Qing Shui to hear her speak in such a tone. He was also shocked. Could it be that the flaming bird also existed in this world? He could not help but asked, “What’s a Red Luan?” </p>
 <p>“Don’t you know of the Red Luan? You have one but you don’t know what it is?” Canghai Mingyue looked at Qing Shui with a weird expression and asked, feeling puzzled.</p>
 <p>“I don’t. I got this flaming bird by chance.” Qing Shui was sort of speaking the truth.</p>
 <p>“Flaming bird? Mmm, it’s also right. Red Luan is a mutated beast in the world of the nine continents. It is said to be of the same blood heritage as the Flaming Phoenix and could possibly evolve into the legendary phoenix. However, the chance is very low since the phoenix is a legendary Divine beast in the world of the nine continents.” Canghai Mingyue looked yearningly at Qing Shui’s flaming bird.</p>
 <p>Mutated beasts. Qing Shui forgot completely about them and only knew of his flaming bird. Now, he came to realize that the flaming bird was actually the Red Luan in the world of the nine continents. It was stated in the that the Red Luan was a strong power amongst all the mutated beasts, and was also one of strongest of them all. As for the phoenix, it was a legendary top grade demonic beast but no one had seen it before.</p>
 <p>“You can take the Red Luan with Liu-Li. I’ll be in front.” After saying that, she mounted the Golden Winged Thunder Condor like a fairy taking a stroll.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li was still in a daze, looking at Qing Shui’s beautiful big bird. She had once said that when she gets her own demonic beast, she would bring him to the places he wanted to go. Now, it felt so ridiculous. How could he be seen in the same light as normal people…</p>
 <p>The more Huoyun Liu-Li thought about it, the more helpless she felt. Within less than a year, she was already unable to catch up to him. When she first saw him, she had a better lead compared to him.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go, get on!” Qing Shui grabbed Huoyun Liu-Li’s small hand and pull her up onto the back of the flaming bird!</p>
 <p>With a cry from the condor followed by the bird, the two flying demonic beasts flew across the air quickly. One gold, one red. Qing Shui could not describe his feelings at that moment. It took him two months to come to this place and he could remember how envious he was when he first saw the Golden Winged Thunder Condor. Within a short year, he had managed to get ahold of a flying demonic beast that was stronger than the Golden Winged Thunder Condor. It felt very good to be looking down on the envious gazes of others.</p>
 <p>“Wow, Golden Winged Thunder Condor!”</p>
 <p>“What a big bird!”</p>
 <p>“Don’t you have a big bird as well?” The lady said teasingly.</p>
 <p>“When did I have one?” The guy asked.</p>
 <p>“Don’t you have a big bird below you?” The lady said in a charming and seducing tone.</p>
 <p>Guy: “…”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui heard the conversation very clearly with his keen sense of hearing. He started to break into a sweat!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not dare to look at Canghai Mingyue who was on the Golden Winged Thunder Condor nearby. He did not even dare to look at Huoyun Liu-Li. Thank goodness they left the area in just a few breath’s time!</p>
 <p>The flaming bird would follow closely behind the Golden Winged Thunder Condor and even go up to snug against its feathers at times. Qing Shui was speechless. Could it be that this lewd bird was really a male? To think that it was so proactive.</p>
 <p>At times when the flaming bird went overboard, the Golden Winged Thunder Condor cried out in protest and used its large golden wings to slap it. However, the lewd bird was not only just unafraid but it could also easily ward off.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was really quite speechless. He wondered if the Golden Winged Thunder Condor was already taken by the flaming bird…</p>
 <p>Once they were out of Cang Lang Country, the flaming bird and Golden Winged Thunder Condor flew side by side. They took up a circumference of 200 metres, much like that of a football field. It may be because their wings were too big that it was not especially bumpy when they were flapping.<br></p>
 <p>It was the first time Qing Shui experienced a long distance flight and he was especially excited. It took him two months to cover half of Cang Lang Country, and Cang Lang Country was northwest of the Greencloud Continent. It was more towards the far west while the Continent’s Capital was more towards the east. After all, the further east a place was, the closer it was to the prosperous Middle Continent.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Flying high up made Qing Shui recall the term “beyond the nine heavens” but he merely shook his head. In his previous life, Qing Shui had seen some information concerning the term “beyond the nine heavens”.</p>
 <p>There were different interpretations to this term in Daoism and Buddhism respectively, but Qing Shui did not know what to think of them. Rather than these interpretations, Qing Shui held a stronger belief in another interpretation, which was that everything in the world started from one and ended at nine. The nine heavens referred to the unattainable skies of extreme heights!</p>
 <p>It took them only one day to fly out of Cang Lang Country, so they decided to rest for the night. Qing Shui did not know where Canghai Mingyue took out a tent and other stuff from. Since they were in the wilderness and Qing Shui wanted to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal for training, he decided to find an excuse to leave and said that he would be back at a later time.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Shui worriedly. After all, it would be bad if some accident were to occur in this desolate wilderness. The most dangerous things in the world of the nine continents would be the demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>“I’m fine, don’t worry!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui suddenly recalled that his goddess-like Master had said that Yan Jiang Country was in the southeast, so he looked towards Canghai Mingyue who was not far away.</p>
 <p>“Erm, can we pass by Yan City on the way? I’d like to take a look there!” Qing Shui looked towards Canghai Mingyue who was looking at the night sky. He could not help but tell himself that no matter what this lady did, she would always have a majestic beauty. Each movement was like nature itself, and each action was extremely beautiful. At the very least, there was nothing with greater beauty than her.<br></p>
 <p>“Yan City? Yan Jiang Country’s Yan City?” Canghai Mingyue turned and asked. Under the night sky, she was so beautiful that it would cause one to be dazzled and stunned!</p>
