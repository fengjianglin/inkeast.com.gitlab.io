 <p><strong>AST 1121 - Transformation, Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm, Peng Meng Mountain</strong></p>
 <p>With an increase in strength as well as a change in his frame of mind, the sense of guilt he felt towards her increased as well. After all, that was the most precious first time for her. It was already fortunate that she did not kill him that time. The main reason why she did not kill him was because he did it to save her and she knew that it was an accident. Otherwise, she would have killed him instantly.</p>
 <p>The woman looked at Qing Shui and not too far from her side was the gigantic old turtle. Now it seemed to be even bigger. It was the biggest demonic beast that Qing Shui had ever encountered—its was similar in size to a small mountain peak.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that if he did not speak up first, she would never speak. As such, he walked towards the woman and stopped twenty meters away from her and said, “We meet again, this way of meeting each other seems a bit weird.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui forcefully laughed and said. Now that Lion King's Ridge’s issue was over, he was feeling pretty relaxed and he was more than happy to apologise to this woman.</p>
 <p>“But i really don’t wish to see you, not even in situations like this.” The woman said in a pleasant but cold and disappointed voice. It was a kind of pleasantness that could not be described with words. The coldness in her voice could freeze a person’s soul but it attracted people to listen to it.</p>
 <p>“I know. No matter what, it was my fault that time. Thank you for showing me mercy. If not, I would not have had the chance to complete my wish. “ Qing Shui calmly told her. There was no sign of closeness nor estrangement between these two people. It was just like a normal conversation between two people but they seemed a bit closer compared to strangers.</p>
 <p>The woman was shocked by what Qing Shui’s words. She had an unpleasant expression on her face as she said, “I hope we will never meet again, not even under circumstances like this and I hope you will forget that incident too.”</p>
 <p>“I know you dislike me and hate me to the point that you want to kill me. I just want to apologize to you. I know that you won’t be interested in me. I don’t have any other motives, I just don’t want you to be so sad.” Qing Shui said, feeling agonized. He had no idea what to say to her. A woman maintained her body purity for so long and in the end, it was ruined by him. He had no reason not to hate himself.</p>
 <p>The woman kept quiet for awhile and said, “I don’t hate you because I never remembered you!”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qing Shui had no idea what to say. Dealing with issues like these were outside his scope of expertise. Moreover, this woman hated him so much.</p>
 <p>“Are you at the other Four Continents.”</p>
 <p>“I’m leaving.” As soon as the woman finished her words, her silhouette faded away.</p>
 <p>“Consider it as I owe you one. I will make it up to you. No matter what you want, I will give it to you.” Qing Shui said softly and clearly as he looked at the fading silhouette of the woman.</p>
 <p>Withdrawing from his consciousness, Qing Shui’s mood was not good or bad either. He felt that a man must be responsible for his actions regardless if it was right or wrong. The responsibility that needed to be assumed, must be assumed unless the other party disapproved, scorned or loathed the man. He paused as he got to this thought and gave out a bitter laugh because this was exactly him now. The woman loathed him......</p>
 <p>She said she never remembered him and that she had never hated him. All of these words were lies. Qing Shui could feel the hatred from her and it was intense. It’s because of this that he wanted to compensate her. If she really forgot about him, he would not have the thoughts of compensating her anymore.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had no idea how to telepathically communicate with the lady in the Portraits of Beauty. He really hoped to telepathically communicate with Di Chen, but he could not do it. He could not establish a telepathic communication with any other women from any of the Portraits of Beauty, nor could he establish a telepathic communication again with the girl within the crystal coffin. It seemed like it could only be accomplished unintentionally.</p>
 <p>Forget it, now was time for happiness. There was no point in dwelling over this matter. Throwing these matters to the back of his mind, Qing Shui calmed his heart down and focused on his cultivation.</p>
 <p>Another thing that Qing Shui was happy about was the Marrow Nibbling Golden Silkworm in his Central Palace Blood Essence Pool, it had surprisingly undergone some changes to its body after eating the blood essence of the Golden Ni Lion. Its body had enlarged by one third. Most importantly, it’s small brain changed too but it still looked adorable. It looked just like the mini version of a Jiao. Due to its small size, it didn’t seem to be fierce or evil at all. In fact, it looked messily nice.</p>
 <p>Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm!</p>
 <p>It had transformed already!</p>
 <p>This could be considered as another major surprise of this Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm. This silkworm was Qing Shui’s greatest and scariest trump card. As such, the more powerful the Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm grew, the happier he would be and the more confident he would get.</p>
 <p>Additionally, after Qing Shui’s blood started to experience changes, the blood in his Central Palace Blood Essence Pool became purer. This greatly benefited the Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm’s growth. Even Qing Shui had no idea how terrifying this small creature was.</p>
 <p>On the second day, Qing Shui woke up pretty early. His injuries had already completely healed. He was practicing the Taiji Fist in the courtyard while feeling refreshed. Soon after, the women and Little Fatty all came out.</p>
 <p>To people who practiced martial arts, this period of time was crucial and important for their cultivation. That’s why since ancient times, there was a saying that is about practicing or training diligently. Time would pass very fast while cultivating.</p>
 <p>Lion King's Ridge had already stabilized, it's just that its strength was a lot weaker than it was before. However, a lean camel was still bigger than a horse. Thus, it could still be considered a strong sect.</p>
 <p>After breakfast, a group of people flew towards Peng Meng Mountain. It was not a long distance from here to Peng Meng Mountain. Departing this time could also be considered leaving Northern Sacred Lu Continent because they would go back to Central Continent right from Peng Meng Mountain.</p>
 <p>People like Du Yannian and Zi Longshi came to send them off, Qing Shui also said some polite and formal words to them. No matter what, their thoughts and sincerity were genuine and this was more than enough. To be able to come such a long way wasn’t an easy feat anyway.</p>
 <p>The distance between Peng Meng Mountain and Lion King’s Mountain wasn’t too long, it would probably take around two days time to reach one mountain from the another but since they had their Nine Continents Steps, it would take less than one day to reach there. In actual fact, Qing Shui didn’t really have much hope towards Peng Meng Mountain since he couldn’t confirm the authenticity of the information he knew regarding this mountain.</p>
 <p>The mountain in this area was the Peng Meng Mountain. Qing Shui asked Du Yannian regarding this mountain. Although this gigantic mountain range was not as magnificent as the Dragon Spine Mountain, it’s not inferior in any other way. It gave off a rich and broad vibe.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui remembers clearly that Wen Clan mentioned that the Realm of the Peng Meng Immortal was positioned at its center. It’s guarded by demonic beasts, that’s why the place was dangerous. After witnessing how terrifying and scary the Golden Ni Lion was, Qing Shui was no longer afraid of the powerful and strong demonic beasts of the Five Continents.</p>
 <p>That battle improved Qing Shui battle awareness tremendously. These battle experiences were very important and crucial. It's similar to a man learning a martial art for three years. They might not necessarily be able to win a hooligan in a fight who fought on the streets for three years.</p>
 <p>If it’s ordinary folks, it’s nearly impossible to find such a specific location on such a big mountain. On this mountain, everywhere was part of deep mountains and old trees. Additionally, poisonous and vicious beasts would appear at any time and anywhere, not to mention that terrifying demonic beasts would show up every now and then. However, the demonic beasts would flee once they approached Qing Shui and his crew. Not to mention how powerful they were, just the demonic beasts that they were using as mounts were enough to scare the demonic beasts in the mountain.</p>
 <p>Peng Meng Mountain’s temperature was relatively higher and the towering old trees could be seen everywhere. In addition, the temperature rose and the trees were denser as people got closer to the center.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, where’s the Realm of the Peng Meng Immortal that you mentioned? Why are we not there yet?” Di Qing looked around at the surroundings and asked.</p>
 <p>The group had already spent half a day at this center area but there’s still no sign of a place to cross where they will be able to find the entrance to the Realm of the Peng Meng Immortal.</p>
 <p>“Should be soon, it’s said to be a place where people can cross. Right in the center area.” Qing Shui laughed and replied.</p>
 <p>Right after Qing Shui replied, his spiritual sense picked up a very swift and strong aura, giving Qing Shui a misperception. However, his spiritual sense was very special, he had already gotten a hold of the hidden aura. Coincidentally, he wanted to find demonic beasts for the women to tame and this aura was suitable.</p>
 <p>Following the aura, everyone halted and froze after a while because right in front of them was a chasm that was so gigantic that it seemed like this split the entire mountain into two. This split was ten li wide. The source of the aura also appeared right before Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>All of the greenery within was split and two humongous demonic beasts appeared in front of Qing Shui. The strong aura earlier came from these demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>Silver-winged Feather Snake and Scarlet Flame Azure Wolf!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was not surprised about his feelings about the aura when he saw these two demonic beasts. This was because among all demonic beasts that were both vicious and can hide well, snakes and wolves were among them.</p>
 <p>The body of the Silver-winged Feather Snake was a few meters thick and was at least as thick as three big water tanks. Its light green and huge body looked surprisingly magnificent and beautiful. The huge snakehead wasn’t as terrifying as everyone thought and its body which was a few hundreds meters in length was especially stunning. In addition, its pair of gigantic Silver wings made it look extremely beautiful.</p>
 <p>Although the Silver-winged Feather Snake was classified as a type of snake, among all snakes, it had the most royal lineage. When compared to normal snakes, this type of snake was far superior. This was a spiritual beast, specifically a Spiritual Type of Heaven and Earth.</p>
 <p>Scarlet Flame Azure Wolf was red in color. In the Five Continents, it was also at the top of the food chain. Its powerful attacks and defense allowed it to charge around violently.</p>
 <p>Although it was indeed strong and powerful in the Five Continents, Qing Shui still was not bothered by the demonic beasts. One trip to the Ancient Ruins had caused drastic changes to Qing Shui’s strength. The demonic beasts that may seem terrifyingly powerful to others could be deemed to be extremely weak by Qing Shui’s standard.</p>
 <p>“Among you all, who want the snake and who want the wolf?” Qing Shui looked back and asked. Those who already possess demonic beast shall give it a pass, each person can only use the low grade Sacred Beast Pill once.</p>
 <p>“I want the snake!” Yu Ruyan smiled and said, breaking the silence.</p>
 <p>“Alright!” The women immediately agreed. Actually, this Silver-winged Feather Snake was very suitable for ladies as it was extremely beautiful and formidable, it could even be used as a formidable flying mount.</p>
 <p>It’s easy to tame and it didn’t take long for Qing Shui to tame the two demonic beasts. The Silver-winged Feather Snake was tamed by Yu Ruyan while Scarlet Flame Azure Wolf was tamed by Yu He.</p>
 <p>Yu He initially had her own flying mount and it was a pretty decent one. Nonetheless, Qing Shui wanted her to tame another demonic beast. Thus, this demonic beast was considered to be tamed by her as instructed by Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>There’s no need for everybody to panic as there were low grade Sacred Beast Pill and Qing Shui. Hence, there’s no fear of the demonic beasts. After taming the two demonic beasts, they walked through the split and saw a valley in front of them. The grass was so soft that it looked inviting to sleep on. Although it’s very cold and the vegetations were very unusual, what matters the most is the fact that it’s very quiet and beautiful here.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui had a feeling as if there was a mysterious force leading him. This feeling was very incredible. In fact, it felt surreal. However, Qing Shui believed in this feeling as he felt that it was a connection with something that’s a part of him.</p>
 <p>Relaxing his spiritual sense, he followed his feelings and slowly walked towards the other side of the valley.</p>
