 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2406 - Cool and Beautiful, the Beauty Remains</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui stood in the air and gazed at the Demon Gate. He had stood there for a long time but no one had noticed him. Therefore, he spoke up. There wasn't a need for him to shout to get the people below to hear him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Demon Gate's Sect Leader, get out here. Come on out..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui's voice echoed in every corner of the Demon Gate. In response to his shout, the people below descended into a state of chaos. An enemy had appeared. Many of them saw Qing Shui standing in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Lad, you're courting death by shouting recklessly here!" One of them charged out toward Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pa!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui kicked him down and bellowed, "Scram!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who are you? Why are you kicking up a fuss here? Our Sect Leader isn't someone you can meet just because you wish to," Another person merely shouted, not heading up after seeing that the person who was kicked down had suffered serious injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Come out. Come out. If you don't, I'll destroy your Demon Gate," Qing Shui continued to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Lad, you're courting death. You don't know what's good for you." A ferocious looking old man flew over from afar and dashed out toward Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's Elder Hong. This guy is in trouble today. He doesn't know his limits," When a young man saw Elder Hong challenging Qing Shui, he shouted out happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In an instant, Qing Shui had kicked Elder Hong down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Earlier on, it wasn't surprising that Qing Shui had managed to kick someone down. After all, that guy's abilities were really not up to standard. However, this new challenger was Elder Hong, the Demon Gate's Elder, a Demon King. For a Demon King to be kicked down by someone with a single move... How strong was this person?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This kick caused many people to be stunned and quite a number of Demon Kings who had come rushing over stopped in their tracks. It was because they weren't much stronger than Elder Hong, and there were some who were much weaker in comparison. They would be courting death by stepping forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who are you? Why are you bothering our Sect Leader?" An old man dressed in black clothes walked out and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This old man was the previous Palace Lord—the Black Shadow Demon King. He wore black clothes and was capable of hiding his entire presence even in the day. He was extremely fast and his assassination skills were exceptional. Right now, he was walking slowly toward Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Old man, you aren't my match. Although you aren't a bad person, I really don't wish to be too vicious toward you right now," Qing Shui looked at the old man and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How would we know if we don't try?" After saying this, the old man disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui's eyes gleamed and he stared in a direction. The old man's hair stood up after being stared at by Qing Shui. His aura became unstable and his figure was revealed. He then disappeared again. However, Qing Shui was still able to easily locate where he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man knew that Qing Shui had some unique abilities and decided to not disappear anymore. He charged out directly toward Qing Shui in a speed as fast as lightning, arriving in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, under the effect of Qing Shui's Heavenly Vision Technique, the old man's speed had become a lot slower. He then used the Berserk Dragon Fist together with the Windwhisk Willow to fight against the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Densely packed clashing sounds rang out in the sky. Their speeds were evenly matched and both parties engaged in a battle of speed. Their strength were also evenly matched. In the Forsaken Heaven City, there were still people who had reached the strength of ten trillion dao force. The strongest people amongst the major influences were all at this level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Qing Shui's strength was only at nine trillion dao force, he was still able to fend off attacks easily. His force was very skillful and incorporated hints of Taichi, the Back Connecting Fist, and the Yu Emperor Fists. For a moment, the old man kept being pushed back by Qing Shui and could only be on the defense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui's attacks were like a thunderstorm and the old man could only try to be on the defense. He kept on backing off and Qing Shui kept on attacking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people on the ground couldn't see the battle clearly, but everyone could tell that the old man kept backing off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the old man was no longer the sect leader, they still found it unbelievable that he wasn't a match for the young man. What kind of person was the former Sect Leader? He was a top ranked existence in the Forsaken Heaven City and there were only a rare few who could defeat him. Moreover, those able to defeat him wouldn't make it without paying a price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they found the current situation hard to accept. The current sect leader was that Demon Lord Goddess and she could defeat the former Sect Leader easily. This young man was beating up the former Sect Leader to the point where he was scrambling to ward off the attacks and the young man still seemed to be very much at ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui struck a palm onto the old man's chest and sent him flying out. "You aren't my match. Get your Sect Leader to come out!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man knew that Qing Shui had gone easy on him. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to leave with just light injuries. He would at least have suffered from serious damage. If he was struck on the head, he would definitely die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just then, a cold but graceful voice rang out, "Since when did the Divine Palace have someone like you?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This voice was familiar to Qing Shui, very familiar. He raised his head to look at the woman who walked over from afar, stepping through the air. Her appearance had changed. Her hair that was like fire previously had once again become dark, black, and beautiful. She wore a snow-white battle dress and was like a fairy that strolled through the sky. Who would have thought that she was the Demon Lord, a Demon King who had the Demon Saint Blood?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her beautiful hair draped down and she appeared even cooler and more beautiful than before. Her beautiful brows seemed soft and even though she didn't have any makeup on her, her face looked just like the morning glow reflected on snow. She was extremely beautiful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had a beautiful figure and her snow-white plain clothes couldn't hide her curves. Her shoulders were sharp as blades, and the arches before her chest were breathtaking. Her waist seemed to be smooth as silk, and her slender figure was beautiful like a great jade carving masterpiece. She emitted a disposition as if she were an existence that shouldn’t be tainted. This was the most unapproachable woman Qing Shui had seen in his life. It wasn't because she was cold, but it was that her soul emitted a sense of pride and arrogance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been very long since Qing Shui had felt this way. He realized that this feeling once again appeared within him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her cultivation had become deeper and more unfathomable. Qing Shui realized that although his cultivation had soared at a rapid speed, he didn't seem to have any advantage before this woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Lingyan, you're alright now. Could it be that you still haven't recalled who I am?" Qing Shui's aura seemed to be a little unstable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tantai Lingyan looked at Qing Shui calmly and said, "You're Qing Shui. I've pierced you with a sword before. I don't know you. Why did you come to look for me again?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sense of feebleness grew in Qing Shui's heart. He was about to say something when Tantai Lingyan spoke up again, "Don't say the things you've told me previously again. I don't know you now. It's fine to just take it as me having lost my memories. Without regaining my memories, I won't be able to recall stories from back then."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui smiled, "Then can we leave here first? I have some things to tell you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tantai Lingyan looked at Qing Shui and it took a while before she nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, she appeared a lot better than how she had been previously. Back then, she seemed to be especially cold-blooded but she seemed to have gained something since then. It could be that with time, she might be able to slowly find her own self back.</span></p>
