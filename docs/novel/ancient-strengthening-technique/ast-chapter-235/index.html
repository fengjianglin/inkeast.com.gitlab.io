  <p><strong>AST 235 – Confused heart of Canghai Mingyue</strong></p>
  <p>Not only that, there was no need for any comparison at all. The disparity was too great!</p>
  <p>“Since you want a 50% discount so much, the offer is five million taels of silver.” Qing Shui smiled lightly at this girl who he was not very interested in.</p>
  <p>“5 million taels of silver after a 50% discount? Does he really think that he’s a divine smith from the heavens?!” A youth booed.</p>
  <p>“This joke is not funny at all.” The girl stared at Qing Shui. The laughter in her eyes was replaced instantly by provocation.</p>
  <p>“Do I look like I’m joking? This is a weapon I forged myself, and nobody is going to force you to buy it.” Qing Shui gazed at the girl with contempt.</p>
  <p>The girl was stunned and after recovery, she seriously stared at Qing Shui. To think such a young blacksmith would be able to give her such a feeling. This was the type of guy she liked most and thus she had wanted to use her charm and beauty to seduce him. Initially, she thought that because of his age and inexperienced, he would easily be hooked. Who would have thought that she would come across a tough nail instead?</p>
  <p>“How dare you speak to me in this manner?! Are you not afraid I will cause your store to shut down?” A wretched expression flashed in the eyes of the girl as she squinted at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>Looking at the girl who had a cultivation of only 1st grade at the Martial Commander Realm, Qing Shui shook his head. “Don’t waste my time with these words. I have no interest. If you can do it, do it.”</p>
  <p>At this moment, Huyou led a horse carriage to the entrance of the store as Qing Shui took the Silver Jagged Sword and walked towards the exit.</p>
  <p>When he passed the girl, the female suddenly unleashed a sword blow aiming for his stomach. However, before even the sword could complete its trajectory, Qing Shui responded by executing a casual swipe which ended with his jagged sword on the neck of the girl. His attacks arrived first despite being slower in the execution.</p>
  <p>A trace of fresh blood dripped onto the ground, as the jagged sword left behind a faint cut&nbsp;in the neck of the girl. It caused her beautiful countenance to turn pale white, as droplets of her perspiration fell to the ground as though it was raining.</p>
  <p>Looking at the slight smile on Qing Shui’s face, she knew that she was hovering between a thin line between life and death.<br></p>
  <p>“Earlier when you struck out, you would already been a corpse by now if you had wanted to kill me. You can leave now. If a situation like this occurs again, do you believe that I would kill you without hesitation?” Qing Shui smiled as he slowly retracted his jagged sword.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The others watched this smiling youthful blacksmith with disbelief in their eyes. These people were all only at the Martial Student Grade. This female, a Martial Commander, probably brought all these people out to exhibit her might which also indicated her arrogance.</p>
  <p>Her other identity was that she was a plaything for a very powerful man, an extremely powerful man. Usually men on the streets could only stare at her and fantasize in their hearts despite her flirtations. No one dared to truly act out their desires unless they didn’t want their manhood any longer.</p>
  <p>The constitutions of humans in this world of the nine continents were somewhat special. Even ordinary humans would be able to move things that weighed about 200 jin.</p>
  <p>After the men shifted the two sets of forging tools over, Qing Shui contemplated the quality of the tools that was clearly higher than what he used before. He gave a satisfactory nod after his observations. After which, the men as well as the pretty girl left, but not before shooting a venomous look at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, be careful, that woman has a powerful background.” Huyou stated after everyone left, worry apparent in his eyes.</p>
  <p>“Powerful background? What background?” Qing Shui asked with interest. The strongest powers in the Southern City were none other than the Immortal Sword Sect, Joyous Sect, and the Imperial Beast Aristocrat.</p>
  <p>“She herself couldn’t be considered much, but she’s the lover of the 3rd Prince from the Imperial Beast Aristocrat. Usually, no one dares to offend her on account of the reputation of the Imperial Beast Aristocrat. I hope she won’t have any malicious thoughts towards you.” Huyou exclaimed worriedly.</p>
  <p>“Don’t worry. Tell me, how much do you think this type of weapon could sell for?” Qing Shui smiled and passed the jagged sword in his hands to Huyou.</p>
  <p>Huyou studied the sword that Qing Shui passed over, as the crazed admiration on his face already told Qing Shui that he was extremely impressed by the workmanship of this weapon.</p>
  <p>After a long moment, Huyou sighed. “It’s a good item but it’s a little lacking. Even if we have something of little value, we can’t say that it’s worth nothing. Just that it’s temporarily unable to fetch a good price.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui actually understood what Huyou was trying to say. After all, this weapon held nothing of interest to Xiantian experts. The Xiantian Realm was a huge watershed that not even one out of 10,000 people would be able to successfully break through. If one considered the total amount of people living in the world of the Nine Continents, there were still several thousand Xiantian level experts around.</p>
  <p>However, for cultivators below Xiantian, this weapon should be able to fetch an extremely satisfying price. The customers that patroned here were the same, and it was tough to sell the weapon before their store was famous. Although there were plenty of wealthy men around, not everyone was wealthy.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui laughed. He still needed to consider the expenses used when forging the sword. After his reputation would be established, there would even be people bringing rare materials for him to forge weapons for them. When that time comes, he could also obtain a portion of those rare materials as his reward.</p>
  <p>“Big brother Huyou, go create a signboard and say that we are buying all types of metals. People can use other stuffs to exchange if they so wish for it. In the future, we will only be manufacturing this type of weapon, so I want to raise the selling price higher.” Qing Shui happily stated, feeling that his glorious future was just beginning.</p>
  <p>“Okay, this is easy to do. How much should we set our selling price at?” Huyou inquired.</p>
  <p>“Since we are just starting out, we need to generate some publicity. What price do you think we should set that would cause the entire city to be in a frenzy?” Qing Shui counter-asked.</p>
  <p>“We should set a sky-high price then…” Huyou replied after some consideration.</p>
  <p>“Okay then, tag the price as five million taels of silver, and quickly spread the news. It doesn’t matter if people say we are crazy or stupid. What we need now is publicity.”</p>
  <p>After the skies darkened, Qing Shui decided to return to the residence he bought earlier. Soon, he suddenly saw Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li approaching. Qing Shui rubbed his nose and smiled as he gazed at both the peerless beauties.</p>
  <p>“Why didn’t you girls go back home? What are the both of you doing here?” Qing Shui regretted immediately the moment the words came out of his mouth.</p>
  <p>“You don’t wish to see us so quickly just after we went out together?” Canghai Mingyue calmly regarded Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui didn’t have time to reply because Canghai Mingyue had already turned and departed. Huoyun Liu-Li glanced at Qing Shui with an expression of exasperation in her eyes. “Qing Shui, you angered Sister Mingyue again, I’ll go take a look.”</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li immediately ran in the direction Canghai Mingyue went. Qing Shui rubbed his nose, wondering what should he do. Women were really mysterious creatures. He still didn’t understand why Canghai Mingyue got so angry abruptly… Could it be her post-menstrual syndrome taking effect?</p>
  <p>After Canghai Mingyue left, she discovered that her emotions were extremely complex. She didn’t know why was she angry. He has already taken plenty of advantage of her with his words. Today, she even accompanied him to look at houses, and did the bed for him… but why did she feel as though he didn’t like the sight of her?</p>
  <p>Did he really dislike her that much? Why didn’t he want to see her?</p>
  <p>She was currently very confused. Was it because of the fact that Qing Shui didn’t like her that caused her to be angry?</p>
  <p>“I don’t like him, I don’t like him. There’s no room for him in my heart and I don’t want to see him again in the future.” Canghai Mingyue silently told herself.</p>
  <p>“Sister Mingyue!” Huoyun Liu Li ran towards Canghai Mingyue, seriously looking at her as she hugged one of her arms.</p>
  <p>“This is Qing Shui’s usual behaviour. He didn’t have any other intentions, don’t be angry okay?” Huoyun consoled Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p>“I’m not angry, let’s leave and don’t mention him again.” Canghai Mingyue smiled as she pulled Huoyun along.</p>
  <p>The two females were speaking about their girls stuff, but Huoyun Liu-Li actually felt bitter in her heart. She understood the change that came over Canghai Mingyue’s heart, even if currently she didn’t have feelings for Qing Shui. At the very least, she was already starting to be concerned about him and had a shadow of him in her heart.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt extremely helpless. Canghai Mingyue abruptly left in a mysterious pique of anger which caused him to feel uncomfortable in his heart. Looking at her departing back, Qing Shui could only smile bitterly. He didn’t know what was he supposed to do. He still wanted to see that shy smile of Canghai Mingyue again.</p>
  <p>Her smile didn’t only exhibit the aura of a great beauty. It was so beautiful to the extent where birds would plummet and fish would sink. Not only that, she was extremely gentle, and Qing Shui felt that she was the most mesmerizing when she was smiling. Even Huoyun Liu-Li’s charm-filled smile wouldn’t be able to be compared to Canghai Mingyue’s.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui rubbed his forehead trying to clear his thoughts. Women were really troublesome but this was a trouble that he was willing to bring upon himself!</p>
  <p>Walking to the exterior of the blacksmith store, Qing Shui took up the forging tools that was left outside from the beginning. He then explained that he needed them. Under the astonished gaze of Huyou, Qing Shui brought the tools away!</p>

 <p>“Okay then, tag the price as five million taels of silver, and quickly spread the news. It doesn’t matter if people say we are crazy or stupid. What we need now is publicity.”</p>
 <p>After the skies darkened, Qing Shui decided to return to the residence he bought earlier. Soon, he suddenly saw Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li approaching. Qing Shui rubbed his nose and smiled as he gazed at both the peerless beauties.</p>
 <p>“Why didn’t you girls go back home? What are the both of you doing here?” Qing Shui regretted immediately the moment the words came out of his mouth.</p>
 <p>“You don’t wish to see us so quickly just after we went out together?” Canghai Mingyue calmly regarded Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t have time to reply because Canghai Mingyue had already turned and departed. Huoyun Liu-Li glanced at Qing Shui with an expression of exasperation in her eyes. “Qing Shui, you angered Sister Mingyue again, I’ll go take a look.”</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li immediately ran in the direction Canghai Mingyue went. Qing Shui rubbed his nose, wondering what should he do. Women were really mysterious creatures. He still didn’t understand why Canghai Mingyue got so angry abruptly… Could it be her post-menstrual syndrome taking effect?</p>
 <p>After Canghai Mingyue left, she discovered that her emotions were extremely complex. She didn’t know why was she angry. He has already taken plenty of advantage of her with his words. Today, she even accompanied him to look at houses, and did the bed for him… but why did she feel as though he didn’t like the sight of her?</p>
 <p>Did he really dislike her that much? Why didn’t he want to see her?</p>
 <p>She was currently very confused. Was it because of the fact that Qing Shui didn’t like her that caused her to be angry?</p>
 <p>“I don’t like him, I don’t like him. There’s no room for him in my heart and I don’t want to see him again in the future.” Canghai Mingyue silently told herself.</p>
 <p>“Sister Mingyue!” Huoyun Liu Li ran towards Canghai Mingyue, seriously looking at her as she hugged one of her arms.</p>
 <p>“This is Qing Shui’s usual behaviour. He didn’t have any other intentions, don’t be angry okay?” Huoyun consoled Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p>“I’m not angry, let’s leave and don’t mention him again.” Canghai Mingyue smiled as she pulled Huoyun along.</p>
 <p>The two females were speaking about their girls stuff, but Huoyun Liu-Li actually felt bitter in her heart. She understood the change that came over Canghai Mingyue’s heart, even if currently she didn’t have feelings for Qing Shui. At the very least, she was already starting to be concerned about him and had a shadow of him in her heart.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt extremely helpless. Canghai Mingyue abruptly left in a mysterious pique of anger which caused him to feel uncomfortable in his heart. Looking at her departing back, Qing Shui could only smile bitterly. He didn’t know what was he supposed to do. He still wanted to see that shy smile of Canghai Mingyue again.</p>
 <p>Her smile didn’t only exhibit the aura of a great beauty. It was so beautiful to the extent where birds would plummet and fish would sink. Not only that, she was extremely gentle, and Qing Shui felt that she was the most mesmerizing when she was smiling. Even Huoyun Liu-Li’s charm-filled smile wouldn’t be able to be compared to Canghai Mingyue’s.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his forehead trying to clear his thoughts. Women were really troublesome but this was a trouble that he was willing to bring upon himself!</p>
 <p>Walking to the exterior of the blacksmith store, Qing Shui took up the forging tools that was left outside from the beginning. He then explained that he needed them. Under the astonished gaze of Huyou, Qing Shui brought the tools away!</p>
