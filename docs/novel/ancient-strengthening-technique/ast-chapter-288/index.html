 <p><strong>Chapter 288 Cloudmist Steps, The Chief Disciple, Gongsun Jianwu, Who’s Like A Vixen.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 288 - Cloudmist Steps, The Chief Disciple, Gongsun Jianwu, Who’s Like A Vixen</strong></p>
  <p><span style>After speaking, Cang Wuya explained the method of channeling Qi twice and then started to demonstrate as he did so. Qing Shui did not know how far his Free Spirit Steps could progress, but the current Free Spirit Steps were not comparable to the Cloudmist Steps. Moreover, Qing Shui noticed that the level of his Free Spirit Steps seemed pretty high, and there did not seem to be much progress recently.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui’s and the two ladies’ level of comprehension was very high, and had soon picked it up, but they just seemed to be a bit stiff when using it. Let alone “strolling”, they could barely “glide”.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Cang Wuya had also said earlier that this technique was fully dependent on one’s familiarity and comprehension. It required one to comprehend with the heart, so Qing Shui practiced it seriously. However, the effects were not too good, and he kept feeling that something seemed off.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Suddenly, he thought of the state he had entered when he was practicing Tai Chi the other time. The feeling of as if he was in a dream. Qing Shui was also now considered to be slightly familiar with the Cloudmist Steps, and he repetitively performed the Cloudmist Steps as he searched for the same feeling.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Sometimes, the two ladies would calm down to give it some thought before they continued. Cang Wuya only watched from the side, not saying a word. Only smiling as he looked at the three youngsters he was sort of connected with.</span></p>
  <p><span style>For a full two hours, Qing Shui practiced like a robot. Suddenly, he closed his eyes, his body suddenly glided, but his eyes remained closed. He then glided once again. This time around, it was obviously more natural.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Cang Wuya’s gaze towards Qing Shui gleamed very brightly. The old man’s eyes became bright like the stars, but they turned back to normal in just an instant, the smile on his face turned increasingly warmer.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Even Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li were staring at Qing Shui with their unblinking beautiful eyes, marveling at how Qing Shui was moving with the Cloudmist Steps at a speed which the naked eye could see.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“He is really like a demon. This is too much of a shock. My talent wasn’t that bad since I was young either, but I’d already gotten a shock after meeting Sister Mingyue, and now he…” Huoyun Liu-Li looked towards the Canghai Mingyue who was similarly in a daze as she mumbled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue looked at Huoyun Liu-Li, finding it funny. She knew that the latter was very headstrong and seeing Qing Shui’s performance made her feel a sense of failure and frustration.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After Qing Shui felt satisfied he stopped, and another hour had passed before he saw other people looking at him. Only then did he then smile, embarrassed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui didn’t expect that the Cloudmist Steps actually had a similar mindframe as Taichi, allowing one to perform it casually as one wished to. He now understood why Cang Wuya had said those words from the start. This was why!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui, how did you do it?” Huoyun Liu-Li pouted her lips, saying in a pettish manner as she walked to Qing Shui and lifted her head to look at him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui found it funny to see such a charming lady acting like such a kid and said, “There’s no helping it, I’ve got the right character and a higher level of comprehension.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmph, get over yourself.” saying this, Huoyun Liu-Li could not help but smile too.</span></p>
  <p><span style>They continued to spend the afternoon practicing the Cloudmist Steps. Although the two ladies did not experience the chance encounter Qing Shui had, their progress was not bad either, though theirs was still far behind his. Huoyun Liu-Li would occasionally grumble, causing Qing Shui to not know whether he should laugh or cry. Just from one afternoon alone, Qing Shui had already been called a pervert by Huoyun Liu-Li at least three times.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The term ‘pervert’ might be seen as as a compliment at times though, just like how it was used now. When one’s progress was tremendous or one’s comprehension was extremely high such that they were beyond description, it would be described as demonic or pervert.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When it was time for dinner, Fei Wuji came over. In the Heavenly Palace, for them, it was like everyone in the family was reunited, even though Qing shui had only met them twice. However, Qing Shui was still full of respect for Fei Wuji. This man had given him the feeling that he was not only strong, but his eyes seemed to be able to see through many things. Just like Cang Wuya, this man gave off a feeling of so much wisdom and farsightedness that it was close to being demonic.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui, did you beat up the Gongsun Clan’s 3rd son’s underlings?” Fei Wuji chuckled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmmm. How did Martial Uncle know this?!” Qing Shui asked, astonished.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Gongsun Clan’s 3rd son has always been one to throw his weight about. The fact that you’ve beaten his people up is the same as having beaten him. The news is spreading like wildfire out there. Everyone is waiting to watch a show.” Fei Wuji seemed to be very happy as he said this.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui could not understand Fei Wuji’s feelings. He had already gotten himself into trouble, but why did he seem to be very happy?</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Martial Uncle, you’re not angry?” Qing Shui could not help but ask, puzzled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui’s words made Fei Wuji and Cang Wuya break out in laughter. And then, Cang Wuya started to feel emotional.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Canghai, Wuji and that son of mine used to be especially mischievous when they were young, creating trouble every so often. This old man was the one who had clean up the mess for them. Back then, what I enjoyed most was to clean up their mess, or even try to put in a good word for them in front of others. It’s because the elders from both families were on relatively good terms with each other. Well, it’s natural for kids to be fond of fights, so I’d be happy even if I have to pull down my face in front of others. It’s because it shows that my child and disciples were the most outstanding.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Cang Wuya’s words made Qing Shui’s heart warm, and even Canghai Mingyue listened silently when hearing about her father. However, her expression was very gloomy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Until one day, my son was killed by someone’s deliberate ‘accidental’ attack, and as his father, I had no other choice when the other came to offer their apologies. Who would be able to accept having their son killed? But the other party’s abilities did not allow me to take action. After all, the involved parties were the younger generation. In the end, in an unsuitable situation, Canghai could not restrain himself but killed the person who was his younger Martial Brother’s murderer. I did all I could, but was still not able to keep him in Heavenly Palace.” Cang Wuya shared the story of the past solemnly, telling them the reason why Canghai was chased out of the sect.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was no wonder Canghai Mingyue was treated like his biological granddaughter. Canghai was brought back and raised up by him and was no different than his biological son!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Back then, Wuji and Canghai were still immature. Now, only Wuji is left. Your Martial Uncle Wuji’s status is special. My old bones haven’t moved for a very long time, and our group has been desolate for very long. Whether we can stand up again will be up to the three of you. If you have any problems, this old man will fend them off for you. You guys only need to be rest assured and do whatever you wish.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>At that moment, Cang Wuya’s strong aura spread out to the surroundings, not threatening but yet shocking!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui, the other party already knows that you are with Master, and the one to deal with you can only be another 3rd generation member. I feel that you shouldn’t have any problems, just feel free when you deal with them.” Fei Wuji chuckled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Thank you Grand teacher, thank you Martial Uncle!” Qing Shui stood up to bow respectfully.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“We are a family, no need to be so courteous. In the future, when you guys get married, you must treat me to more wine!” Fei Wuji laughed as he bade farewell to the Old Master, and nodded to the rest and left.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was feeling puzzled, and also took his leave after Fei Wuji left.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He had not even reached his residence when he met a young lady with a demonic figure. Exaggerated curves, seductive vixen eyes, long thick and black lashes, and a small perked nose which seemed especially sexy.</span></p>
  <p><span style>This was a lady who one would associate with the bed in one look. She had a different type of seductive charm as Qinghan Ye. Qinghan Ye was seductive right down to her bones, while this lady was a vixen.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“So young?” The lady mumbled!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui looked at this vixen-like lady, puzzled, not understanding what she meant.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Are you interested in playing with me?” The lady blinked her pair of vixen eyes at Qing Shui. It was so charming that one’s nose would burst out with a nosebleed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui stared at the lady in a daze for a while, and his body started having a reaction. That seductive expression of hers was so intoxicating that he had the urge to carry her to his bed and roll around with her. However, Qing Shui could sense that this lady had spikes, and her cultivation was at the first level of Martial King. Her two long and slender arms were more like two longswords.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You’re sick!” Qing Shui forced out these words with a slight smile, moving away and taking his leave.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When she got a scolding, the lady broke out in laughter. Her beautiful smile made the blooming flowers nearby all pale in comparison.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What are you laughing at?” Qing Shui tried his best not to look at that face which could be said to be a femme fatale’s. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m laughing because you called Xi Yue a nutcase!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You’re crazy…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Thank goodness you’re not calling me a nutcase. Thanks!” The lady continued to smile prettily like a flower.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui: “...”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Speak up. If not, I’ll be taking my leave.” Qing Shui really did not know how to handle such ladies, and an extreme beauty at that.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’ll stop teasing you. I’m passing you a letter on someone else’s behalf.” After handing a letter to Qing Shui, she smiled and turned and left.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui looked at that rounded beautiful bosom which had a fatal seductive charm to it as it moved slightly when she sashayed. It formed a fatal curve when put together with that slender waist of hers, giving others an urge to touch it.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui lowered his head and saw that it was an envelope. There were very obvious words written on it, ‘Challenge Letter’!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Look, it’s Gongsun Jianwu!” Qing Shui heard an abrupt voice saying.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Wow, our Moonstar Hall’s Chief Disciple, so beautiful!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>… </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was extremely astonished. To think that that lady with such a perfect demonic figure was Moonstar Hall’s Chief Disciple, the most outstanding amongst Gongsun Clan’s 3rd generation. And she was a very beautiful lady on top of that.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui fell into a daze for a very long time before he looked down at the letter in his hands. There was only one line, “Three days later, see you at the arena at late morning!” The letter was signed off by Gongsun Jianyun!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Mmm? It’s not against her?” Qing Shui knew that the lady from earlier was called Gongsun Jianwu. Then Gongsun Jianyun was also part of the 3rd generation of Gongsun Clan since his name also started with ‘Jian’, just like Gongsun Jianwu.</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was just that he had no idea who Gongsun Jianyun was. However, he was not worried and he could not help but smile. Thinking of how the one to challenge him was not Gongsun Jianwu was likely because they did not want to bully a new member.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Back at his residence, Qing Shui did not come across Yan Ling`er and Xi Yue. He entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, and the first thing he did was to just get some sleep on the bed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After he woke up, he continued his never changing training regime. Qing Shui did not wish to ignore anything, since he knew that every skill had their use. It was just that when it would be of use was beyond his control.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After calming down, Qing Shui let his mind run amok. Looking at the beauty portrait on that screen with the majestic mountain and river portrait, Qing Shui realized that he would never have enough gazing at it. It was an unspeakable beauty. </span></p>
  <p><span style>He could not help but think of Gongsun Jianwu again. Why was she the one to deliver the letter? What did she meant when she first spoke? Why did she follow with an even more seductive line?</span></p>
  <p><span style>“She’s doing this on purpose, thinking of making a fool out of me? Or was it just for fun? Regardless of which it was, she definitely can’t be really thinking of having some fun with me!” Thinking of this, Qing Shui could not help but smile.</span></p>

My talent wasn’t that bad since I was young either, but I’d already gotten a shock after meeting Sister Mingyue, and now he…” Huoyun Liu-Li looked towards the Canghai Mingyue who was similarly in a daze as she mumbled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canghai Mingyue looked at Huoyun Liu-Li, finding it funny. She knew that the latter was very headstrong and seeing Qing Shui’s performance made her feel a sense of failure and frustration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Qing Shui felt satisfied he stopped, and another hour had passed before he saw other people looking at him. Only then did he then smile, embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui didn’t expect that the Cloudmist Steps actually had a similar mindframe as Taichi, allowing one to perform it casually as one wished to. He now understood why Cang Wuya had said those words from the start. This was why!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Shui, how did you do it?” Huoyun Liu-Li pouted her lips, saying in a pettish manner as she walked to Qing Shui and lifted her head to look at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui found it funny to see such a charming lady acting like such a kid and said, “There’s no helping it, I’ve got the right character and a higher level of comprehension.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph, get over yourself.” saying this, Huoyun Liu-Li could not help but smile too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They continued to spend the afternoon practicing the Cloudmist Steps. Although the two ladies did not experience the chance encounter Qing Shui had, their progress was not bad either, though theirs was still far behind his. Huoyun Liu-Li would occasionally grumble, causing Qing Shui to not know whether he should laugh or cry. Just from one afternoon alone, Qing Shui had already been called a pervert by Huoyun Liu-Li at least three times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The term ‘pervert’ might be seen as as a compliment at times though, just like how it was used now. When one’s progress was tremendous or one’s comprehension was extremely high such that they were beyond description, it would be described as demonic or pervert.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When it was time for dinner, Fei Wuji came over. In the Heavenly Palace, for them, it was like everyone in the family was reunited, even though Qing shui had only met them twice. However, Qing Shui was still full of respect for Fei Wuji. This man had given him the feeling that he was not only strong, but his eyes seemed to be able to see through many things. Just like Cang Wuya, this man gave off a feeling of so much wisdom and farsightedness that it was close to being demonic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Shui, did you beat up the Gongsun Clan’s 3rd son’s underlings?” Fei Wuji chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm. How did Martial Uncle know this?!” Qing Shui asked, astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gongsun Clan’s 3rd son has always been one to throw his weight about. The fact that you’ve beaten his people up is the same as having beaten him. The news is spreading like wildfire out there. Everyone is waiting to watch a show.” Fei Wuji seemed to be very happy as he said this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui could not understand Fei Wuji’s feelings. He had already gotten himself into trouble, but why did he seem to be very happy?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Martial Uncle, you’re not angry?” Qing Shui could not help but ask, puzzled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui’s words made Fei Wuji and Cang Wuya break out in laughter. And then, Cang Wuya started to feel emotional.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Canghai, Wuji and that son of mine used to be especially mischievous when they were young, creating trouble every so often. This old man was the one who had clean up the mess for them. Back then, what I enjoyed most was to clean up their mess, or even try to put in a good word for them in front of others. It’s because the elders from both families were on relatively good terms with each other. Well, it’s natural for kids to be fond of fights, so I’d be happy even if I have to pull down my face in front of others. It’s because it shows that my child and disciples were the most outstanding.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Wuya’s words made Qing Shui’s heart warm, and even Canghai Mingyue listened silently when hearing about her father. However, her expression was very gloomy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Until one day, my son was killed by someone’s deliberate ‘accidental’ attack, and as his father, I had no other choice when the other came to offer their apologies. Who would be able to accept having their son killed? But the other party’s abilities did not allow me to take action. After all, the involved parties were the younger generation. In the end, in an unsuitable situation, Canghai could not restrain himself but killed the person who was his younger Martial Brother’s murderer. I did all I could, but was still not able to keep him in Heavenly Palace.” Cang Wuya shared the story of the past solemnly, telling them the reason why Canghai was chased out of the sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was no wonder Canghai Mingyue was treated like his biological granddaughter. Canghai was brought back and raised up by him and was no different than his biological son!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Back then, Wuji and Canghai were still immature. Now, only Wuji is left. Your Martial Uncle Wuji’s status is special. My old bones haven’t moved for a very long time, and our group has been desolate for very long. Whether we can stand up again will be up to the three of you. If you have any problems, this old man will fend them off for you. You guys only need to be rest assured and do whatever you wish.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Cang Wuya’s strong aura spread out to the surroundings, not threatening but yet shocking!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Shui, the other party already knows that you are with Master, and the one to deal with you can only be another 3rd generation member. I feel that you shouldn’t have any problems, just feel free when you deal with them.” Fei Wuji chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you Grand teacher, thank you Martial Uncle!” Qing Shui stood up to bow respectfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are a family, no need to be so courteous. In the future, when you guys get married, you must treat me to more wine!” Fei Wuji laughed as he bade farewell to the Old Master, and nodded to the rest and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui was feeling puzzled, and also took his leave after Fei Wuji left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had not even reached his residence when he met a young lady with a demonic figure. Exaggerated curves, seductive vixen eyes, long thick and black lashes, and a small perked nose which seemed especially sexy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a lady who one would associate with the bed in one look. She had a different type of seductive charm as Qinghan Ye. Qinghan Ye was seductive right down to her bones, while this lady was a vixen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So young?” The lady mumbled!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui looked at this vixen-like lady, puzzled, not understanding what she meant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you interested in playing with me?” The lady blinked her pair of vixen eyes at Qing Shui. It was so charming that one’s nose would burst out with a nosebleed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui stared at the lady in a daze for a while, and his body started having a reaction. That seductive expression of hers was so intoxicating that he had the urge to carry her to his bed and roll around with her. However, Qing Shui could sense that this lady had spikes, and her cultivation was at the first level of Martial King. Her two long and slender arms were more like two longswords.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re sick!” Qing Shui forced out these words with a slight smile, moving away and taking his leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she got a scolding, the lady broke out in laughter. Her beautiful smile made the blooming flowers nearby all pale in comparison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you laughing at?” Qing Shui tried his best not to look at that face which could be said to be a femme fatale’s. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m laughing because you called Xi Yue a nutcase!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re crazy…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank goodness you’re not calling me a nutcase. Thanks!” The lady continued to smile prettily like a flower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui: “...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak up. If not, I’ll be taking my leave.” Qing Shui really did not know how to handle such ladies, and an extreme beauty at that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll stop teasing you. I’m passing you a letter on someone else’s behalf.” After handing a letter to Qing Shui, she smiled and turned and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui looked at that rounded beautiful bosom which had a fatal seductive charm to it as it moved slightly when she sashayed. It formed a fatal curve when put together with that slender waist of hers, giving others an urge to touch it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui lowered his head and saw that it was an envelope. There were very obvious words written on it, ‘Challenge Letter’!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look, it’s Gongsun Jianwu!” Qing Shui heard an abrupt voice saying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, our Moonstar Hall’s Chief Disciple, so beautiful!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>… </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui was extremely astonished. To think that that lady with such a perfect demonic figure was Moonstar Hall’s Chief Disciple, the most outstanding amongst Gongsun Clan’s 3rd generation. And she was a very beautiful lady on top of that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui fell into a daze for a very long time before he looked down at the letter in his hands. There was only one line, “Three days later, see you at the arena at late morning!” The letter was signed off by Gongsun Jianyun!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm? It’s not against her?” Qing Shui knew that the lady from earlier was called Gongsun Jianwu. Then Gongsun Jianyun was also part of the 3rd generation of Gongsun Clan since his name also started with ‘Jian’, just like Gongsun Jianwu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was just that he had no idea who Gongsun Jianyun was. However, he was not worried and he could not help but smile. Thinking of how the one to challenge him was not Gongsun Jianwu was likely because they did not want to bully a new member.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back at his residence, Qing Shui did not come across Yan Ling`er and Xi Yue. He entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, and the first thing he did was to just get some sleep on the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he woke up, he continued his never changing training regime. Qing Shui did not wish to ignore anything, since he knew that every skill had their use. It was just that when it would be of use was beyond his control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After calming down, Qing Shui let his mind run amok. Looking at the beauty portrait on that screen with the majestic mountain and river portrait, Qing Shui realized that he would never have enough gazing at it. It was an unspeakable beauty. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He could not help but think of Gongsun Jianwu again. Why was she the one to deliver the letter? What did she meant when she first spoke? Why did she follow with an even more seductive line?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s doing this on purpose, thinking of making a fool out of me? Or was it just for fun? Regardless of which it was, she definitely can’t be really thinking of having some fun with me!” Thinking of this, Qing Shui could not help but smile.</span></p>
