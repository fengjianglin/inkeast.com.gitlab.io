 <p><strong>Chapter 489 Buddha Apparition, Heaven Defying Opportunity, Armor Break Talisman.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 489 - Buddha Apparition, Heaven Defying Opportunity, Armor Break Talisman</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui had the confidence that he could resolve the situation as he had with the Heaven Soaring Silver Tiger.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had just comprehended the Sword of Fifth Wave. If he abandoned the Violet Gold Divine Shield, it would not give him any advantages. He did not know how to break past the defense of that large tiger; this perversely strong beast left Qing Shui at a complete loss.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hmm, Armor Break Talisman?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s eyes brightened, he could use the Armor Break Talisman!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, when he considered that the decrease in defense was based on his own body, he felt that it was insignificant compared to the Diamond Gigantic Elephant or the tiger outside. Even though his defense among the humans, especially those below the Martial Saint level, was incomparable, it was still inferior to many of the Peak Martial King level beasts.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Nevermind, there’s plenty of time, this day just started, I have slightly more than a month.” Qing Shui pondered, deciding to just draw the talisman first.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The frightful defense of the big tiger was around the strength of seven countries, even if he drew the Armor Break Talisman using the Golden Calligraphy Brush, it would only achieve an effect of 30%, at best 40%.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s current body’s defense was about fifteen million jin, the strength of one and a half countries!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Amongst the human race, it was considered to be extremely ridiculous already!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">40% of a strength of one and a half countries was only six million jin</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Reducing the big tiger’s defense by six million jin would not even decrease 10% of its defense, he still could not break through it, even if he could barely do it, so what?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was worried, looking at the people surrounding him outside. Although he had more than a month in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, it was only a few hours outside.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Never mind, let’s just draw the Armor Break Talisman first. Even if there is no effect we will deal with it then, at least a small decrease is better than no decrease at all,” Qing Shui thought, deciding to take action.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He skillfully prepared the tools for drawing the talisman, only then did he begin to draw the Armor Break Talisman. However he felt very annoyed, maybe it was because the Armor Break Talisman might not even be useful.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui might as well put down the Golden Calligraphy Brush and think about what to do next!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">First, Qing Shui observed the surroundings, the most terrifying thing was not the big tiger, but the guy riding on the Heaven Soaring Silver Tiger. He was the Senior Martial Brother of the Misty Hall Palace Mistress, a pity that he’d died as a result of being careless and being off his guard.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Most importantly was that Qing Shui did not expect to break through to the Fifth Wave at that moment!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“En, The Fifth Wave!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui decided to practice the Sword of Fifth Wave first, as long as he could become proficient in the Sword of Fifth Wave, he could repel the tiger. Qing Shui was just afraid that this one month of time would be insufficient.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Once he’d thought of that, Qing Shui’s brain operated furiously, he seemed to have understood the crucial point of his dilemma. However, Qing Shui decided to just practice the Sword of Fifth Wave first, to consolidate his strength. He would try it out for half the time first and see the results.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ah, Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui remembered as he was using the Sword of Fourth Wave, there were fleeting images of the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, the impressions it had left were very clear. This led Qing Shui to believe that the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm was related to the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the past, Qing Shui had used to frequently practice the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, however, after smoothly practicing it to the 200’s he was no longer to link it coherently, but the first 200 sets could be done in a breath.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, when piercing toward the Senior Martial Brother of the Misty Hall Palace Mistress, one of the fleeting images he had of the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint was not from the first 200, Qing Shui was sure that it had been after the first 200.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt like there was an itch in his heart that could not be relieved.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Finally, Qing Shui decided to just follow the image he’d had in his mind and practice the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, to prove his theory!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">240th Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui clearly remembered that he would always stop at the 200th Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, he was never able to complete it beyond that.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now that the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm had broken through to the Fifth Wave, the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint had broken through the 200th Palm, even reaching to the 240th Palm!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui immediately practiced the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, looking for that sense of continuity. Slowly, he found that it was very similar to when he was drawing talismans, they both required the sense of continuity to proceed forward.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew this ability was cultivated by him drawing talismans!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Through the tens of thousands of attempts to draw the talisman!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Therefore, when practicing the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, Qing Shui felt like he was in his element, pushing onwards to the next palm after the first 200.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui practiced at least ten times before moving on to the next one, the palm imprint was like a butterfly flying, a coexistence of mystery and beauty.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly felt intoxicated, and at the same time, frantic. His face had a faint trace of a smile, his dazzling hands executing the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, one palm after another, as though they were a whole, smooth and natural!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pa!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He once again broke through to the next palm, his body had a golden glow like that of a treasure. Behind Qing Shui’s back was actually the image of a Majestic Golden Buddha, extremely clear and sacred. It was ten meters tall, three meters wide; huge, divine and solemn. The Golden Buddha image was emitting a soft golden light, its eyes closed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At that moment, Qing Shui’s eyes suddenly opened wide, his whole body exuding a tremendous pressure!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pa!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s Nature Energy actually broke through at this moment, Qing Shui could feel his strength had improved greatly once again, he’d even broken through a few small bottlenecks.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mental State akin to that of Immovable Mountains!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui could feel that the “Mental State akin to that of Immovable Mountains” that had not improve for a long time, broke through as well. Originally, it had improved vigor by 50%, but Qing Shui felt that it increased less than 10% of his body’s strength, and thus he had overlooked it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now Qing Shui could feel what “Immovable Mountains” really meant!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Increased 100% of vigor, a passive increase of defense by the strength of one country!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The defense of one country!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt a huge change in his body’s strength, there had been a qualitative change!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui unconsciously turned his head and saw the huge Golden Buddha image behind him!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time, Qing Shui was thoroughly shocked!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint had reached the realm of Buddha Apparition, it was no wonder that his defense increased by the strength of one country. Looking at the dissipating Buddha image, Qing Shui felt that it was inconceivable, but could still understand it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yet another heaven-defying opportunity!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The tremendous shock had left Qing Shui stunned!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mental State akin to that of Immovable Mountains!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For his body’s defense to increase by the strength of one country, Qing Shui had nearly bit through his tongue at the thought of it. The vigor had increased from 50% to 100%.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Furthermore, his body’s strength increased by 20%, this was the increase of the body’s strength, just like using some techniques or strength increasing Medicinal Pills.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the true “Mental State akin to that of Immovable Mountains”. What caused Qing Shui to feel weird was the earlier huge Divine Golden Buddha Image.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This caused Qing Shui to be curious about the origins of the “Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm”. What were the origins of that Xiantian cultivator that had been killed by him?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After cultivating the Buddha image, Qing Shui figured that this Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm was the ultimate skill of the Buddhist sects, just the name itself made it obvious.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was a relation between the World of the Nine Continents and Buddha, the sects with the strongest strength were either the Buddha Sect of the Central Continent or the Formless Divine Sect of the Eastern Victory Divine Continent, Qing Shui did not know which sect the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm came from.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Thinking about that Xiantian cultivator he’d killed, Qing Shui remembered when he had obtained the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm, there had also been an erotic diagram, the one in the diagram was a monk.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Joyous Meditation Sect!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui currently understood some things about the Central Continent, after all, he intended to go there and the other continents. But Qing Shui had to first understand the major powers, sects, and clans of each Continent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Joyous Meditation Sect was the Central Continent’s Buddha Sect’s branch, just like the halls of Heavenly Palace, but they were not all located in the same location, instead they were scattered around.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was said that the Joyous Meditation Sect and Joyous Sect had similar Duo Cultivation Techniques, but the Joyous Meditation Sect’s Duo Cultivation Technique was one of the strongest.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Some Duo Cultivation did not require the interaction of Yin and Yang, Sex. Aside from physical Duo Cultivation, there was also the Duo Cultivation of the Mind; an interaction of the consciousness, the connection of the hearts of the male and female!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It only required the feets, hands and the hearts of the two cultivators!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Joyous Meditation Sect mainly cultivated these two types of Duo Cultivation Techniques!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui shook his head and stopped thinking. However, before he gained absolute strength, he shouldn’t use the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm in front of a monk, but he could use the Sword of Fifth Wave he had comprehended.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">From the very start, Qing Shui had persisted in unrelentingly practicing all his techniques, even the Basic Sword Techniques had been practiced to such a level, especially since these were not strong techniques in the first place.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint had already advanced to the 301st Palm. At the 300th palm, that huge Golden Buddha image had appeared again.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It had caused Qing Shui’s strength to improve a lot, it was an improvement of the body’s strength and vigor, which had resulted in a 20% increase in strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the benefit of a strong body!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not know what realm his “Mental State akin to that of Immovable Mountains” was, but compared to before, he had broken through a large bottleneck, entering into a new realm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Following that, Qing Shui continued to practice a few more rounds of the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, feeling particularly happy, he felt more motivated in his cultivation.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He could feel the energy of the Fifth Wave blast out in an instant!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Success!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that his theory was correct, this Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm was indeed related to the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint. Qing Shui just could not figure out the exact relation between the two, nor did he care.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Picking up the Big Dipper Sword, Qing Shui once again executed the Sword of Fifth Wave. It finally did not have the sense of weakness it had earlier.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Unknowingly, it had passed three days in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal! Qing Shui’s Sword of Fifth Wave could barely be considered consolidated.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The breakthrough of the Mental State akin to that of Immovable Mountains along with the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint had caused Qing Shui’s heart to become more steadfast. He once again looked toward the Golden Calligraphy Brush and the Moonstone Ink Slab on the forging platform.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">First, draw the Armor Break Talisman!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Currently, Qing Shui’s strength had improved a bit, but it had allowed Qing Shui to see hope. Because not only had the Mental State akin to that of immovable mountains explosively improved his defense and vigor, it had raised his strength by 20%.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although 2.6 million jin of strength could not turn the situation around, after adding the other techniques he had, armor, talismans. It was a total increase of the strength of one country.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Strength of one country!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That gave Qing Shui the confidence that if he could draw the Armor Break Talisman, he would be able to deal with the big tiger. Now that the situation had developed as such, this was all he could do.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was a crucial moment, if Qing Shui dealt with all these people, the situation of the Greencloud Continent would change, even the future of Greencloud Continent would be changed, changed by Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now, when Qing Shui drew the Armor Break Talisman, the process felt particularly smooth, maybe it was the result of him being in a good mood.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">97%!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The first time he drew the Armor Break Talisman, he’d achieved a 97% completion, however, even it was short just by a little, it was still trash. Qing Shui felt good about this, in at most 2 days, he knew he would succeed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Because drawing talismans had also improved his Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, even more so when it had caused the Buddha Apparition to appear. It had allowed the Mental State akin to that of Immovable Mountains to have a qualitative improvement.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">During the battle with the Senior Martial Brother of the Misty Hall Palace Mistress, he’d used the Sword of Fourth Wave, but because of his experiences in drawing talismans, it had affected Qing Shui and caused it to break through at that moment.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It did not break through when practicing normally, but when in danger, his body’s potential exploded.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The shape of the Armor Break Talisman was simple, it was just a sharp sword pointing toward the heavens; it looked plain and had an air of calm murderous intent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was now drawing the sword tip, it was also the last stroke. To draw that sharp edge, yet preserving the calm aura. With the experience from the last attempt, Qing Shui could do it smoothly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With the Diamond Qi, Nature Energy and Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, he could draw out that feeling.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui finally successfully drew the Armor Break Talisman, eight days had passed in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The might of the Armor Break Talisman decreased the defense by 30% with Qing Shui as the standard! Making Qing Shui feel helpless.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a good thing that his defense already reached the strength of two and a half countries. After calculating it, he could reduce almost eight million jin of defense from his opponent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui laughed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Maybe he did not have to run anymore!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Most of the people outside would not be able to injure him, unless there was a character like the Old Ancestor or some cultivators that took an extreme path, like an assassin with extreme speed, but used deadly poison or incapacitating agents on a strong dagger.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This kind of person treated killing as their target, their strength may not be the best, but their killing abilities and survival abilities were the best. They could kill cultivator that were stronger than them by many times.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was also the Beast Tamer. When comparing the tamed beasts and humans of equal levels, they were much stronger. The big tiger was one such example; if there were two or three, he would not stand much of a chance and would likely not even be able to withstand a single blow.</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 489 - Buddha Apparition, Heaven Defying Opportunity, Armor Break Talisman</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui had the confidence that he could resolve the situation as he had with the Heaven Soaring Silver Tiger.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He had just comprehended the Sword of Fifth Wave. If he abandoned the Violet Gold Divine Shield, it would not give him any advantages. He did not know how to break past the defense of that large tiger; this perversely strong beast left Qing Shui at a complete loss.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hmm, Armor Break Talisman?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s eyes brightened, he could use the Armor Break Talisman!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, when he considered that the decrease in defense was based on his own body, he felt that it was insignificant compared to the Diamond Gigantic Elephant or the tiger outside. Even though his defense among the humans, especially those below the Martial Saint level, was incomparable, it was still inferior to many of the Peak Martial King level beasts.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Nevermind, there’s plenty of time, this day just started, I have slightly more than a month.” Qing Shui pondered, deciding to just draw the talisman first.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The frightful defense of the big tiger was around the strength of seven countries, even if he drew the Armor Break Talisman using the Golden Calligraphy Brush, it would only achieve an effect of 30%, at best 40%.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s current body’s defense was about fifteen million jin, the strength of one and a half countries!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Amongst the human race, it was considered to be extremely ridiculous already!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">40% of a strength of one and a half countries was only six million jin</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Reducing the big tiger’s defense by six million jin would not even decrease 10% of its defense, he still could not break through it, even if he could barely do it, so what?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was worried, looking at the people surrounding him outside. Although he had more than a month in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, it was only a few hours outside.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Never mind, let’s just draw the Armor Break Talisman first. Even if there is no effect we will deal with it then, at least a small decrease is better than no decrease at all,” Qing Shui thought, deciding to take action.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He skillfully prepared the tools for drawing the talisman, only then did he begin to draw the Armor Break Talisman. However he felt very annoyed, maybe it was because the Armor Break Talisman might not even be useful.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui might as well put down the Golden Calligraphy Brush and think about what to do next!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">First, Qing Shui observed the surroundings, the most terrifying thing was not the big tiger, but the guy riding on the Heaven Soaring Silver Tiger. He was the Senior Martial Brother of the Misty Hall Palace Mistress, a pity that he’d died as a result of being careless and being off his guard.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Most importantly was that Qing Shui did not expect to break through to the Fifth Wave at that moment!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“En, The Fifth Wave!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui decided to practice the Sword of Fifth Wave first, as long as he could become proficient in the Sword of Fifth Wave, he could repel the tiger. Qing Shui was just afraid that this one month of time would be insufficient.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Once he’d thought of that, Qing Shui’s brain operated furiously, he seemed to have understood the crucial point of his dilemma. However, Qing Shui decided to just practice the Sword of Fifth Wave first, to consolidate his strength. He would try it out for half the time first and see the results.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ah, Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui remembered as he was using the Sword of Fourth Wave, there were fleeting images of the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, the impressions it had left were very clear. This led Qing Shui to believe that the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm was related to the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the past, Qing Shui had used to frequently practice the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, however, after smoothly practicing it to the 200’s he was no longer to link it coherently, but the first 200 sets could be done in a breath.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, when piercing toward the Senior Martial Brother of the Misty Hall Palace Mistress, one of the fleeting images he had of the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint was not from the first 200, Qing Shui was sure that it had been after the first 200.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt like there was an itch in his heart that could not be relieved.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Finally, Qing Shui decided to just follow the image he’d had in his mind and practice the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, to prove his theory!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">240th Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui clearly remembered that he would always stop at the 200th Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, he was never able to complete it beyond that.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now that the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm had broken through to the Fifth Wave, the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint had broken through the 200th Palm, even reaching to the 240th Palm!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui immediately practiced the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, looking for that sense of continuity. Slowly, he found that it was very similar to when he was drawing talismans, they both required the sense of continuity to proceed forward.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew this ability was cultivated by him drawing talismans!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Through the tens of thousands of attempts to draw the talisman!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Therefore, when practicing the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, Qing Shui felt like he was in his element, pushing onwards to the next palm after the first 200.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui practiced at least ten times before moving on to the next one, the palm imprint was like a butterfly flying, a coexistence of mystery and beauty.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly felt intoxicated, and at the same time, frantic. His face had a faint trace of a smile, his dazzling hands executing the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, one palm after another, as though they were a whole, smooth and natural!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pa!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He once again broke through to the next palm, his body had a golden glow like that of a treasure. Behind Qing Shui’s back was actually the image of a Majestic Golden Buddha, extremely clear and sacred. It was ten meters tall, three meters wide; huge, divine and solemn. The Golden Buddha image was emitting a soft golden light, its eyes closed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At that moment, Qing Shui’s eyes suddenly opened wide, his whole body exuding a tremendous pressure!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pa!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s Nature Energy actually broke through at this moment, Qing Shui could feel his strength had improved greatly once again, he’d even broken through a few small bottlenecks.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mental State akin to that of Immovable Mountains!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Qing Shui could feel that the “Mental State akin to that of Immovable Mountains” that had not improve for a long time, broke through as well. Originally, it had improved vigor by 50%, but Qing Shui felt that it increased less than 10% of his body’s strength, and thus he had overlooked it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now Qing Shui could feel what “Immovable Mountains” really meant!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Increased 100% of vigor, a passive increase of defense by the strength of one country!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The defense of one country!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt a huge change in his body’s strength, there had been a qualitative change!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui unconsciously turned his head and saw the huge Golden Buddha image behind him!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time, Qing Shui was thoroughly shocked!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint had reached the realm of Buddha Apparition, it was no wonder that his defense increased by the strength of one country. Looking at the dissipating Buddha image, Qing Shui felt that it was inconceivable, but could still understand it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yet another heaven-defying opportunity!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The tremendous shock had left Qing Shui stunned!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mental State akin to that of Immovable Mountains!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">For his body’s defense to increase by the strength of one country, Qing Shui had nearly bit through his tongue at the thought of it. The vigor had increased from 50% to 100%.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Furthermore, his body’s strength increased by 20%, this was the increase of the body’s strength, just like using some techniques or strength increasing Medicinal Pills.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was the true “Mental State akin to that of Immovable Mountains”. What caused Qing Shui to feel weird was the earlier huge Divine Golden Buddha Image.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This caused Qing Shui to be curious about the origins of the “Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm”. What were the origins of that Xiantian cultivator that had been killed by him?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After cultivating the Buddha image, Qing Shui figured that this Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm was the ultimate skill of the Buddhist sects, just the name itself made it obvious.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was a relation between the World of the Nine Continents and Buddha, the sects with the strongest strength were either the Buddha Sect of the Central Continent or the Formless Divine Sect of the Eastern Victory Divine Continent, Qing Shui did not know which sect the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm came from.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Thinking about that Xiantian cultivator he’d killed, Qing Shui remembered when he had obtained the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm, there had also been an erotic diagram, the one in the diagram was a monk.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Joyous Meditation Sect!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui currently understood some things about the Central Continent, after all, he intended to go there and the other continents. But Qing Shui had to first understand the major powers, sects, and clans of each Continent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Joyous Meditation Sect was the Central Continent’s Buddha Sect’s branch, just like the halls of Heavenly Palace, but they were not all located in the same location, instead they were scattered around.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was said that the Joyous Meditation Sect and Joyous Sect had similar Duo Cultivation Techniques, but the Joyous Meditation Sect’s Duo Cultivation Technique was one of the strongest.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Some Duo Cultivation did not require the interaction of Yin and Yang, Sex. Aside from physical Duo Cultivation, there was also the Duo Cultivation of the Mind; an interaction of the consciousness, the connection of the hearts of the male and female!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It only required the feets, hands and the hearts of the two cultivators!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Joyous Meditation Sect mainly cultivated these two types of Duo Cultivation Techniques!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui shook his head and stopped thinking. However, before he gained absolute strength, he shouldn’t use the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm in front of a monk, but he could use the Sword of Fifth Wave he had comprehended.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">From the very start, Qing Shui had persisted in unrelentingly practicing all his techniques, even the Basic Sword Techniques had been practiced to such a level, especially since these were not strong techniques in the first place.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint had already advanced to the 301st Palm. At the 300th palm, that huge Golden Buddha image had appeared again.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It had caused Qing Shui’s strength to improve a lot, it was an improvement of the body’s strength and vigor, which had resulted in a 20% increase in strength.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was the benefit of a strong body!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not know what realm his “Mental State akin to that of Immovable Mountains” was, but compared to before, he had broken through a large bottleneck, entering into a new realm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Following that, Qing Shui continued to practice a few more rounds of the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, feeling particularly happy, he felt more motivated in his cultivation.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He could feel the energy of the Fifth Wave blast out in an instant!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Success!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that his theory was correct, this Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm was indeed related to the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint. Qing Shui just could not figure out the exact relation between the two, nor did he care.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Picking up the Big Dipper Sword, Qing Shui once again executed the Sword of Fifth Wave. It finally did not have the sense of weakness it had earlier.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Unknowingly, it had passed three days in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal! Qing Shui’s Sword of Fifth Wave could barely be considered consolidated.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The breakthrough of the Mental State akin to that of Immovable Mountains along with the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint had caused Qing Shui’s heart to become more steadfast. He once again looked toward the Golden Calligraphy Brush and the Moonstone Ink Slab on the forging platform.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">First, draw the Armor Break Talisman!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Currently, Qing Shui’s strength had improved a bit, but it had allowed Qing Shui to see hope. Because not only had the Mental State akin to that of immovable mountains explosively improved his defense and vigor, it had raised his strength by 20%.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although 2.6 million jin of strength could not turn the situation around, after adding the other techniques he had, armor, talismans. It was a total increase of the strength of one country.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Strength of one country!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">That gave Qing Shui the confidence that if he could draw the Armor Break Talisman, he would be able to deal with the big tiger. Now that the situation had developed as such, this was all he could do.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was a crucial moment, if Qing Shui dealt with all these people, the situation of the Greencloud Continent would change, even the future of Greencloud Continent would be changed, changed by Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now, when Qing Shui drew the Armor Break Talisman, the process felt particularly smooth, maybe it was the result of him being in a good mood.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">97%!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The first time he drew the Armor Break Talisman, he’d achieved a 97% completion, however, even it was short just by a little, it was still trash. Qing Shui felt good about this, in at most 2 days, he knew he would succeed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Because drawing talismans had also improved his Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint, even more so when it had caused the Buddha Apparition to appear. It had allowed the Mental State akin to that of Immovable Mountains to have a qualitative improvement.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">During the battle with the Senior Martial Brother of the Misty Hall Palace Mistress, he’d used the Sword of Fourth Wave, but because of his experiences in drawing talismans, it had affected Qing Shui and caused it to break through at that moment.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It did not break through when practicing normally, but when in danger, his body’s potential exploded.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The shape of the Armor Break Talisman was simple, it was just a sharp sword pointing toward the heavens; it looked plain and had an air of calm murderous intent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was now drawing the sword tip, it was also the last stroke. To draw that sharp edge, yet preserving the calm aura. With the experience from the last attempt, Qing Shui could do it smoothly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With the Diamond Qi, Nature Energy and Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, he could draw out that feeling.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui finally successfully drew the Armor Break Talisman, eight days had passed in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The might of the Armor Break Talisman decreased the defense by 30% with Qing Shui as the standard! Making Qing Shui feel helpless.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was a good thing that his defense already reached the strength of two and a half countries. After calculating it, he could reduce almost eight million jin of defense from his opponent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui laughed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Maybe he did not have to run anymore!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Most of the people outside would not be able to injure him, unless there was a character like the Old Ancestor or some cultivators that took an extreme path, like an assassin with extreme speed, but used deadly poison or incapacitating agents on a strong dagger.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This kind of person treated killing as their target, their strength may not be the best, but their killing abilities and survival abilities were the best. They could kill cultivator that were stronger than them by many times.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was also the Beast Tamer. When comparing the tamed beasts and humans of equal levels, they were much stronger. The big tiger was one such example; if there were two or three, he would not stand much of a chance and would likely not even be able to withstand a single blow.</p>
