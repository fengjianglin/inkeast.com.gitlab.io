 <p>AST 1224 - I belong to her…… A change in situation</p>
 <p>“An arm, an arm of yours.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui found his calm tone very irritating. The Saint Child had made them come over to take an arm of his. Qing Shui was unable to sense the strength of the two old men, hence he wasn’t sure if the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant could beat the enemies.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui had a bad feeling. The reason being that a lot of people knew that the Golden Yang Wolf was killed by the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. They should be aware of how strong the Golden Yang Wolf was. Meaning that since they had dared to come today, they didn’t really care about the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. At the very least, these two elderly men shouldn’t be any weaker than the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui thought up to this point, he felt a bit distressed. He was worried that the two old men would be a lot more powerful than the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. Hence, today, he would really have to either run away or wait for someone to come save him.</p>
 <p>Should he ask Tian Jiange or the Eldest Princess to come and save him?</p>
 <p>Which one of them could come and help him solve the danger at hand? The reason being that even if he managed to kill these people today, he still wouldn’t be able to feel at peace. Next time, Saint Child Band would definitely send someone even more powerful.</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui felt that he did the right thing by pulling off the needle trick at that time.</p>
 <p>“Leave now. That way, at least Fu Yanting will still have a chance to live. If not, he will be dying very soon. I wonder if by then, your so called Saint Child will let you guys go,” Qing Shui said calmly.</p>
 <p>“What did you say?!”</p>
 <p>“I’m asking you whether Fu Yanting’s lifeforce is depleting little by little. If you want him to live, disappear now!” Qing Shui stopped being polite once he saw no good intentions from these people. Since they already weren’t respecting him, why did he still need to put up with them?</p>
 <p>“You impudent brat! Do you seriously think that you are truly invincible just because of a demonic beast? Come with us today and cure Prince Fu, if not, we will escort you there. That way, you are bound to taste some bitterness.” The old man in grey gown took a step forward and locked onto Qing Shui with his qi.</p>
 <p>“If you guys ever dare to lay hands on me, Fu Yanting will die for sure. By then, you guys will be the ones responsible for it. I am aware that you guys have looked for quite a lot of alchemists and doctors recently. You decide whether to believe it or not,” Qing Shui said in an indifferent tone.</p>
 <p>The hands of the old man in the blue gown trembled. The other old man on the other hand, he seemed like he was inquiring with his comrades about it. As Qing Shui saw their expressions, he already knew that there was no need for him to fight today.</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, the Eldest Princess came in with a group of people.</p>
 <p>“Go, if there is ever a next time when things like this happen again, I won't mind killing all of you. To think that you guys dare to even lay hands on my man.” The Eldest Princess’ words startled both the old men.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt puzzled, “I’m her man……”</p>
 <p>“Let’s go!”</p>
 <p>“Go back and tell him that I look down on him!” the Eldest Princess said in an indifferent tone.</p>
 <p>The group of people headed here aggressively, yet left with their tails between their legs. Seeing that they left, the little girl turned around and went into her room. Qing Shui on the other hand, moved his sight to the beautiful woman after looking at the little girl.</p>
 <p>Now, it seemed like she has gotten even stronger. This was a hunch. Actually, human intuition was quite a terrifying thing.</p>
 <p>“Thank you. To think that as the man I would need to be protected by a woman.” Qing Shui revealed a helpless smile.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong? Are you looking down on women now?” The Eldest Princess looked at Qing Shui with her brows knitted.</p>
 <p>“Why would I look down on women? In fact, I respect them. They’re the greatest. Like my mother, she is a woman as well.” Qing Shui never thought that this woman would feel so sensitive about this.</p>
 <p>“It seems like you are a chauvinist. I cannot stand this.” The Eldest Princess went up to Qing Shui and showed him a smile.</p>
 <p>Her faint yet delicate womanly fragrance rushed into Qing Shui’s nose. As he lifted up his head and saw the face of this woman, it was so close to his own… She was beautiful to the point where his soul itself could potentially be snatched away by it. Her beauty wasn’t the seductive kind of beauty. Contrary to that, she felt more like a fairy, a fairy which had descended to the mortal world.</p>
 <p>Compared to Yiye Jiange, her beauty tended more towards the ordinary kind of beauty. However, the noble royal aura on her was very pressuring. Qing Shui had a feeling of reluctance in moving his sight away when he looked at those beautiful eyes of hers. Other than sharing gazes with the women around her, he hardly shared gazes with other people, especially when it was for a long time.</p>
 <p>The eyes were the windows into one’s heart. Through a person’s eyes, one would be able to see the fluctuations of their heart. However, Qing Shui was unable to tell how the Eldest Princess was feeling. In addition to that, there was also such thing as sharing gazes with each other’s eyes. It felt just like two hearts colliding with each other.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head lightly and avoided eye contact with her, “Do you know about the Demon Lord?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui remembered the powerful woman and asked casually. The Eldest Princess on the other hand clearly didn’t know why he asked this question out of the blue. She still answered, “I have never seen her before. But I have heard about her.”</p>
 <p>“Actually, I feel that this woman is really powerful. For example, the Eldest Princess, I used to think that women would still need men despite how powerful they were. But now, I am not sure if the way I think is still right,” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“Are you looking for a beating? Are you saying that no one wants me and that I don’t have any feminine personality at all?” The Eldest Princess asked angrily. She who looked as beautiful as a fairy seemed to be unusually repulsed by these questions.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s heart unconsciously began to beat faster. He was stunned by her beauty. No wonder both of the leaders from Saint Child Band and Lord Sect would fall for her. Not only did she look pretty and graceful, she was born charming. This kind of woman was the most fatal to men. Legend has it that they were capable of squeezing a man completely dry. It was said that this kind of woman was capable of making men fight continuously in bed until they became dry husks. Furthermore, they would never show symptoms like tiredness or feebleness in the middle of it.</p>
 <p>“Why would you think so? I am fully aware that there are a lot of people who harbor bad intentions towards you. You are one of the most beautiful woman I have seen,” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p>For some reason which he himself was unclear about, he felt as if he was teasing the Eldest Princess. Seeing this side of her was also quite a rare sight.</p>
 <p>“Ah, I forgot, you have quite a few beautiful wives. It seems like you are really good with women.” The Eldest Princess had seen Di Chen’s portrait before. She had also seen Yu Ruyan. She couldn’t help but look at Qing Shui twice. She found that the only good thing about Qing Shui was that he wasn’t really that annoying. But as she thought deeper into it, she came to notice that there were very few men who she wasn’t annoyed with.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t say anything. He didn’t want to bind himself to this question. Hence, he smiled and said, “Let’s go sit down over there and talk about things regarding Saint Child Band and Lord Sect.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui made a pot of tea and sat down with the Eldest Princess in a pavilion in the yard.</p>
 <p>“Actually, it isn’t as the rumor said. I have only met Saint Child twice and the duration in which we met each other wasn’t longer than an incense stick of time. That man is really mysterious. He holds a very high position in the academy. Legend has it that he may even one day turn out to be the leader of Heaven Secrets Academy,” the Eldest Princess said.</p>
 <p>“Is he really that powerful?” Qing Shui was really curious about his opponent’s strength.</p>
 <p>“He is really powerful. Some say that he is 200 years old, some say he is 500. He looks really young but I am not certain about how strong he is.” The Eldest Princess explained to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Is his strength beyond that of Grade Five State Masters?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t know. Even though I have just achieved the strength of a beginner Grade Five State Master, I don’t know what the greatest strength a Grade Five State Master can achieve is. The things that were passed down from the past have proven to be absolutely inaccurate. Hence, State Master is really nothing but a title. At the end of the day, it still comes down to seeing who is strong.” The Eldest Princess didn’t try to hide anything in front of Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The further one progressed in their cultivation, the harder they would find it to continue ascending in grades. Each time they ascended up to a new grade, there would be significant improvements. While people with low cultivation may find it really easy to break through, each time they did so, the improvement shown was insignificant from an expert’s point of view. By the time they reached State Master grade, each ascension would signify a huge increase in strength. The further they progressed, the more terrifying the amount of strength increased would be. But similarly, it would be even more difficult to break through.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, you still need to stay cautious. Even though I have showed up this time and that person may give me some face, I reckon that there will still be people seeking trouble with you as you have indirectly slapped Saint Child. It’s fine if you kill them but things won’t be as simple if you slap them. They won’t let things go just like that.” The Eldest Princess showed a bit of concern when she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess left. Not long after, Tian Jiange came. He seemed a bit embarrassed, “Qing Shui, I have already informed my brother about the incident. He is going to talk through the matter with Saint Child Band. I never expected things to happen so suddenly.</p>
 <p>“It’s fine as long as you have the heart for it.” Qing Shui smiled as he told Tian Jiange to sit down.</p>
 <p>“I am the one who is incompetent. I am don’t have much influence in Lord Sect. To be honest, even meeting my own brother isn’t that easy a task. I need to look for people to help me pass along a message. Even so, they may have promised to help pass the messages, it’s unknown whether the messages will really be passed to my brother.” Tian Jiange let out a sigh and confessed his situation.</p>
 <p>“Brother, I will feel like you are regarding me as an outsider if you put it that way. We make friends by sharing hearts with each other. In fact, I can feel brother, that you are not a fake person.” Actually, Qing Shui never planned to rely on Lord Sect. If he was to entrust his hope to someone else, that would be equivalent to him putting his life in someone’s hand. If you want something done, do it yourself, instead of relying on others, why not rely on yourself?</p>
 <p>“What do you plan to do?” Tian Jiange was a bit concerned with Qing Shui’s safety.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, I will be fine. Teacher Sunv just came not long ago. Hence, the people from Saint Child Band will more or less stay away for now. In any case, I am still someone from Breezing Wind Veranda.” As Qing Shui spoke up to this point, he remembered the Eldest Princess’ dominating words from before, he is my man. Qing Shui felt really weird about it.</p>
 <p>“Sigh, I know Fu Yanting, there is no way he would just let things off as it is. Even if his brother doesn’t get involved in such small matters, Fu Yanting will try to think of a way to deal with you. He isn’t like me. He still holds quite an honorable position in Saint Child Band. A lot of the strong warriors are willing to help him do things.” Tian Jiange revealed a bitter expression as he spoke to this point.</p>
 <p>“Brother, if you have strength similar to Fu Yanting’s, I wonder if you will be promoted a higher position in Lord Sect?” Qing Shui asked after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>“In the world of martial arts, it goes without saying that only the strong will be respected. Put aside the fact that my brother is the leader of Lord Sect. Even without this kind of relationship, once I become stronger, my position in there will also become significantly higher.”</p>
 <p>“We are brothers. No matter what happens in the future, at least for now, we’re brothers. This is for you. It should be very helpful for you.” Qing Shui took out a Violet Gold Bloodline Pearl and passed it to Tian Jiange.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui felt like pulling Tian Jiange to his side. He has had a few interactions with this person lately and felt that he was a person worth knowing. He was aware that he could help him significantly increase his strength within a short period of time. Added on that he had the Nine Heavenly Golden Pellet, once he took the Violet Gold Bloodline Pearl and let the Violet Gold Bloodline change his body’s nature, he who was originally already a genius would have quite a high authority to speak in Lord Sect.</p>
