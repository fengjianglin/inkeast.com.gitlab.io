 <p><strong>Chapter 421 Binding Talisman, returning to Heavenly Palace, Shi Qingzhuang.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 421 - Binding Talisman, Returning to Heavenly Palace, Shi Qingzhuang</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui heard Ling Zhanhan’s words, he also understood that the physiques of Talisman Masters were normally weak. However, their spiritual energy was enormous. They also had incredibly fast speed, so much so that if there was a flying beast, they would be able to use Heavenly Talisman on it to defeat their opponents. But Qing Shui recalled that he was actually unclear about the attacking range and method of the Heavenly Talisman.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If he had enough speed, he could use the “Binding Talisman” to once again lower the speed of the opponent. He could then use the poisonous talisman to poison them, followed by the talisman to lower defenses.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">What was important was that among the “Heavenly Talisman”, there were also talismans used for attacking. For example, there were the five series of offensive Heavenly Talismans: “Golden Arrow Talisman”, “ Wooden Vine Binding Talisman”, “Ice Cone Talisman”, “Scarlet Flame Talisman”, and “Mountain Pressure Talisman”.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">These five talismans were briefly mentioned by Ling Zhanhan when he was talking about the “Weapons Talisman”, which greatly aroused Qing Shui’s interest. He came to like the “Heavenly Talisman” more and more.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Looking at Qing Shui’s expression, Ling Zhanhan smiled. He looked at Qing Shui and said: “In the world, not only was there no free lunch, it was also relatively &nbsp;fair to each and every person. You can also say that for each and every person, how much they get will depend on how much burden they bear, just like not revealing your money when you go out. When you are wealthy and free, you will also have more worries, so much so that you might have danger that will risk your life.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew about all of these. But at the moment, he didn’t really understand what Ling Zhanhan’s words actually meant. Hence, he looked at Ling Zhanhan in suspicion.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, the Heavenly Talisman may be really formidable, but it is definitely the most difficult one when it comes to cultivating as well. For those without talent, even if they used their best ability, they will still be unable to successfully draw a first grade Heavenly Talisman.” Ling Zhanhan smiled and looked at Qing Shui after he finished explaining.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Ling, is what I drew a success then?” Qing Shui noticed that it wasn’t actually easy as he thought. But Qing Shui had definitely felt a bit of “Godly power” flowing from his body into the Heavenly Talisman the last time he took up the brush.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You have only seen once and you were already able to remember this much. You are the most talented person I have ever seen when it comes to drawing Talisman.” Ling Zhanhan was especially happy as he said this.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui heard this, he already knew that the “Binding Talisman” was a failure. Perhaps it was quite close to success, but there was a high possibility that this was the biggest obstacle that every beginner would need to face.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui looked at the desk surface once again, the “Binding Talisman” that Ling Zhanhan drew had already begun to revolve in light. Qing Shui could clearly feel the spiritual fluctuation on the surface.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Ling, how do you use this Heavenly Talisman?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ling Zhanhan smiled and took up the “Binding Talisman” that he drew on the table. He said: “It’s really convenient to use the Heavenly Talisman. When you are using them, put in your Xiantian Qi. If it’s for your own usage, slam it at yourself, and it’s for opponents, throw it at them. Once it leaves your hand, it will break apart so long as it touches the opponent. The talisman strength within it will affect the body of your opponent. As for the attacking range, a first grade talisman can only be used within ten metres range. Second grade can only be used within twenty metres. Third grade will be thirty metres, fourth grade forty. For the fifth grade talismans and above, it will depend on your capabilities. The further you throw it, the further the attack will be.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Then why can’t the previous four grades surpass the distance?” Qing Shui asked Ling Zhanhan at a loss.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Let’s put it this way. Once a fourth grade of talismans or any of those below it are triggered by Xiantian Qi, it will break down even if it doesn’t touch anything. Take, for example, the second grade binding talisman in my hand. If you are standing at the spot fifteen metres away, this “binding talisman” will break down automatically at the spot five metres away from you.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As Ling Zhanhan finished his explanation, he threw the “Binding Talisman” from his hand at Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Pa!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The moment it interacted Qing Shui’s body, it gave a crispy noise. Qing Shui saw the “Binding Talisman” turn into bits of white lights, flowing into his own body.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In that instant, Qing Shui felt as if both of his legs were tied up with many things. For a while, Qing Shui felt a heavy burden which equivalent to twenty percent of a Xiantian warrior’s speed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, in an instant, the nature energy in his body immediately repelled the energy that had rushed in. Qing Shui had already experienced the mysteries of the Heavenly Talisman himself after all.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, you need to remember the important point about drawing talismans. I see that you have had a taste of its essence just now. The only things that you are lacking are time and practice. As for the drawing method, I will not teach you anymore. When it comes to drawing them, it is different for everyone. For a hundred people, there will be a hundred drawing methods. Thus, finding your own way of drawing it is your first step to it.” Ling Zhanhan said slowly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yeah. Grandpa Ling, are there any conditions needed for the beast skin and blood of the demonic beasts?” Qing Shui looked at the beast skin and blood that was shaped in talisman. There actually weren’t that many of them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Generally speaking, so long as it is the demonic beast’s skin and blood of those at the demonic beast grade, it will be usable. But the higher the grade, the more effective it will be. Moreover, the compatibility of the five series of the demonic beasts and the five series of the Heavenly Talisman will also be able to increase the power of the Heavenly Talisman. For example, the power of the “Scarlet Flame Talisman” will be increased if it is made by the skin of the “Raging Flame Thunderous Beast”. Of course, other than the five series, there are still a few other attributes. For example, wind attribute is compatible to speed. There is also thunder attribute……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Ling, could it be that the blood and skin of the demonic beasts were the only two things that could be used for talisman drawings?” Qing Shui felt that the most precious thing on a demonic beast was the demonic beast’s core, as well as its bones and other special stuffs. The blood and skin, on the other hand, were the most cheaply-priced ones to ordinary demonic beasts. Of course, there were also a few skins like those used to make “Interspacial silk sachet”.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Of couse not. The skin and blood of the demonic beasts are the most basic and also the most needed things, but if you want to use the bones of demonic beasts, their galls, or other special things, it will require your Talisman Drawing and refining skill to reach a certain realm. Of course, if you can use the core of the demonic beasts, its power would be even more formidable.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Refining skill?” He looked at Ling Zhanhan in doubt.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The skin and blood of the demonic beast were not something that could immediately be used as soon as it was taken out. It was something that needed to go through refinements from Talisman Masters with their Xiantian Qi before they were able to be used. There was also a distinct explanation inside the ancient book regarding the “Heavenly Talisman”. Even if it was used on either a demonic beast or other things, there would still be a distinct explanation.” Ling Zhanhan chuckled. He took a beast skin that was used to draw talismans and passed it over to Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took over the thin and long animal skin the size of two palms. It was warm. After that, he slightly closed his eyes, as if he were feeling the internal parts of it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After being refined, the vein lines in the beast skin had become even clearer. It was more condensed and tenacious.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He slowly operated his Ancient Strengthening Technique and used the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique that was mixed with another power to slightly warm the beast skin in his hand. After that, he began to slowly feel the change inside.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, the vein lines seemed like it was even more clear. The two vein lines that had originally been close to each other seemed to be even closer now, but they were still not joining with each other. Qing Shui, who was already in the “Ru Wei” Realm, found it quite easy to control the things on top of it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, even if this was the case, Qing Shui felt that there seemed to be a line that had been snapped by himself within the vein lines of the beast skin. After that, Qing Shui felt a slight change occurring within the beast skin. Qing Shui knew that this beast skin could no longer be used to draw talismans.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Ling, I almost forgot. How long will the effect of these Heavenly Talisman last for?” Qing Shui absolutely had no idea about the time these second grade “Movement Restriction Talisman” could affect other people because of the expansive vital energy inside his body.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“For the first grade, it would take a quarter of an hour, for a second grade, it would take two quarters and so on for all the talismans up to the fourth grade. For the fifth grade Heavenly Talisman, it would be half a day. The sixth grade will take one whole day, the seventh grade will take a day and a half, and the eight grade of Heavenly Talisman will take two days. For those at the back, no one knows how long it will take.”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">From the way it seemed, this Heavenly Talisman still looked like it had a lot of things that were yet to be known. Because no one had reached that kind of height, Qing Shui was already considered to have quite a good understanding to Talisman Drawing. &nbsp;Besides, there was still that “Ancient Heavenly Talisman Book” &nbsp;that Ling Zhanhan gave him. It should provide him with a detailed understanding.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, if you have anything on mind, you can leave anytime you want. Before you leave, don’t forget to say goodbye to my old man.” Ling Zhanhan said with a slight smile.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Ling, since you are not telling me about your stuff now, I will not ask anymore about it. I promise you, in twenty years, or at most twenty years, I should be able to help you.” Qing Shui said after thinking for a while.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ling Zhanhan smiled and waved at Qing Shui. He said to himself softly after seeing Qing Shui’s figure disappear, “Twenty years, maybe it wouldn’t even take that long.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui arrived at Qing Yi’s room. There he saw both Qing Qing and Qing Bei.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Shui!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; Qing Shui smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You guys are all here. What are you guys talking about? You all seem really happy.” Qing Shui asked without thinking the matter through.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Yi did not actually answer Qing Shui’s question. Instead, she looked at Qing Shui and asked, “Are you getting ready to go out again?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As soon as Qing Yi saw Qing Shui’s expression as he came in, she had already been aware of Qing Shui’s intentions.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ah, Brother Shui, are you leaving again?” Qing Bei said in shock.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui nodded at Qing Bei with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing did not say anything. She only looked at Qing Shui as if she was reluctant to part with him.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“When are you planning to leave?” Qing Yi asked with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It should be around these three to five days.” Qing Shui said after thinking for a while.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Shui, for these past few years, you have always been shuttling back and forth alone outside. When you came back, you came back particularly from Yan Jiang Country. I even thought that you won’t be going out for the time being.” Qing Bei said while depressingly looking at Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Little Bei, I have given those martial art skills and medicinal pill to you and Sister Qing. By the time I come back next time, you guys should already be Xiantian Warriors.” Qing Shui chuckled.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If you are not here, how will we be able to ascend to Xiantian that fast? Brother Shui, you have to come back as soon as possible.” &nbsp;Qing Bei said miserably. She had on a bitter face as she looked at Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Three days time went by very quickly. Qing Shui said goodbye to the people in Qing Clan and left on the firebird. One after another, the people from Qing Clan were occupied with a myriad of thoughts. From when he was sixteen years old up until he became an adult, Qing Shui’s experiences and shuttles were nothing that could be compared to other people. Even though it was really bitter, they were the things that a man should and would be willing to do.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui sat on the firebird and flew for a while. By late morning, he had already arrived in Hundred Miles City. He said goodbye to Yu He and, under her reluctant gaze, went to Shi Clan.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After smoothly arriving at the backyard, Qing Shui did not go and bother the old people in Shi Clan. He was just here to say goodbye to Shi Qingzhuang before leaving.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He could already sense the energy of the backyard, as well as a continuous energy fluctuation before he even reached there. Qing Shui knew that Shi Qingzhuang was cultivating. After taking a turn, he saw the elegant, bright-red figure from far away.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had never asked her why she had always dressed herself up in a blazing attire. All of her shirts were blazing red in color. From inwards to outwards, Qing Shui was fortunate enough to see them, especially when he managed to see it two times in a row.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui went forward a few steps, Shi Qingzhuan lifted up her head. After she saw Qing Shui, she was shocked. After that, she avoided Qing Shui with an expression that looked like a smile yet not a smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui walked to her side and naturally grabbed the soft hand of hers which was holding a sword. He used his other hand to grab the long sword and stick it in a distant spot. He pulled at her and walked next to a nearby couch.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuan reluctantly rolled her eyes at Qing Shui. She would only show such kind of feminine charm when she was in front of Qing Shui. Even though it wasn’t the first time he saw it, he would still feel quite tempted every time he looked at it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You are becoming more and more like a woman now.” Qing Shui extended his hand and scratched her elegant nose which was quite tilted.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Indecent little rascal.” Shi Qingzhuan slapped away Qing Shui’s hand and said angrily.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I am not little, nor is that part of mine little.” Qing Shui first looked at Shi Qingzhuan seriously, then laughed after he finished talking.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You should die.” Shi Qingzhuan punched Qing Shui’s chest with average force.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Wu-wu!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In response, Qing Shui hugged her and kissed her tender and beautiful red lips. His tongue violently extended into her mouth as if he wanted to swallow her in whole.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qingzhuang, I am leaving now.” After a long time, Qing Shui let go of Shi Qingzhuan, whose face was already scarlet red. That chilly complexion and tempting blush made her deadly attractive.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang was startled. After that, her hands softly went around Qing Shui’s neck.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, hug me… hug me for a while……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A blazing firebird sped high up in the air. Its speed was as fast as a shooting star. It was Qing Shui who was rushing towards Cang Lang Country City. It was also around the time for him to return to Heavenly Palace.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the moment, the time that Qing Shui needed to fly from Hundred Miles City to Cang Lang Country City would only be about one day and more. To Qing Shui, he was quite satisfied with the speed of the Firebird at the moment. With its speed, his wish to fly to any places in the world of the nine continents in the future would soon come true. The only thing that it was lacking now would be strength.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though the Firebird was currently a Martial King grade Demonic Beast, if it were to meet another demonic beast of the Martial Saint grade, it wouldn’t have any chances of survival. &nbsp;Even if Qing Shui had a Soulshake bell, it still hadn’t gone up by one grade after so many days, which had made Qing Shui felt quite upset. With just the current fourth grade Soulshake bell, it might even be hard to stand up against a demonic beast at the Martial King Grade let alone deal with Martial Saint grade Demonic Beast. If it could be upgraded to the fifth grade, the chances of it dealing with Martial King grade Demonic Beasts should be a bit higher.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They needed to fly for about one whole day along the road. Qing Shui laid on the back of the bird and had nothing to do. He might as well take out the ancient book Heavenly Talisman and take advantage of this time to read it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The golden ancient records of Heavenly Talisman sparkled with golden light under the sun. This golden title page wasn’t actually Golden Extract Essence, but its value should not be much lower than Golden Extract Essence.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The golden title page was really thin and full of tenacity. As Qing Shui took a look at it, he thought that it wasn’t really that thick, seeing as there were only about ten pages.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui has seen the two word heading, “Heavenly Talisman”, on the book cover a few times. Everytime he looked at it, he felt that it was full of majestic energy. It may only be two words that were the size of two fingers, but it still had managed to evoke an unusual pressure.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Flipping over the book, there was one whole paragraph explaining the “Heavenly Talisman”. It was basically the same as what Ling Zhanhan had said, therefore Qing Shui skimmed over very quickly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Following up, a lot of them were the ones that Ling Zhanhan mentioned before. When they flipped over to the second page, Qing Shui saw a talisman drawing. The very first one that began was also an attribute talisman, and it was also the first Heavenly Talisman that Qing Shui saw.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Godly Force Talisman!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that there was nothing special about this name, but it sounded quite intimidating. Qing Shui looked at the Heavenly Talisman that was carved on the ancient record. It was realistic, so much so that there appeared to be a kind of magical strength in it.&nbsp;</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 421 - Binding Talisman, Returning to Heavenly Palace, Shi Qingzhuang</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui heard Ling Zhanhan’s words, he also understood that the physiques of Talisman Masters were normally weak. However, their spiritual energy was enormous. They also had incredibly fast speed, so much so that if there was a flying beast, they would be able to use Heavenly Talisman on it to defeat their opponents. But Qing Shui recalled that he was actually unclear about the attacking range and method of the Heavenly Talisman.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If he had enough speed, he could use the “Binding Talisman” to once again lower the speed of the opponent. He could then use the poisonous talisman to poison them, followed by the talisman to lower defenses.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">What was important was that among the “Heavenly Talisman”, there were also talismans used for attacking. For example, there were the five series of offensive Heavenly Talismans: “Golden Arrow Talisman”, “ Wooden Vine Binding Talisman”, “Ice Cone Talisman”, “Scarlet Flame Talisman”, and “Mountain Pressure Talisman”.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">These five talismans were briefly mentioned by Ling Zhanhan when he was talking about the “Weapons Talisman”, which greatly aroused Qing Shui’s interest. He came to like the “Heavenly Talisman” more and more.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Looking at Qing Shui’s expression, Ling Zhanhan smiled. He looked at Qing Shui and said: “In the world, not only was there no free lunch, it was also relatively &nbsp;fair to each and every person. You can also say that for each and every person, how much they get will depend on how much burden they bear, just like not revealing your money when you go out. When you are wealthy and free, you will also have more worries, so much so that you might have danger that will risk your life.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew about all of these. But at the moment, he didn’t really understand what Ling Zhanhan’s words actually meant. Hence, he looked at Ling Zhanhan in suspicion.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, the Heavenly Talisman may be really formidable, but it is definitely the most difficult one when it comes to cultivating as well. For those without talent, even if they used their best ability, they will still be unable to successfully draw a first grade Heavenly Talisman.” Ling Zhanhan smiled and looked at Qing Shui after he finished explaining.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Ling, is what I drew a success then?” Qing Shui noticed that it wasn’t actually easy as he thought. But Qing Shui had definitely felt a bit of “Godly power” flowing from his body into the Heavenly Talisman the last time he took up the brush.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You have only seen once and you were already able to remember this much. You are the most talented person I have ever seen when it comes to drawing Talisman.” Ling Zhanhan was especially happy as he said this.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui heard this, he already knew that the “Binding Talisman” was a failure. Perhaps it was quite close to success, but there was a high possibility that this was the biggest obstacle that every beginner would need to face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui looked at the desk surface once again, the “Binding Talisman” that Ling Zhanhan drew had already begun to revolve in light. Qing Shui could clearly feel the spiritual fluctuation on the surface.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Ling, how do you use this Heavenly Talisman?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ling Zhanhan smiled and took up the “Binding Talisman” that he drew on the table. He said: “It’s really convenient to use the Heavenly Talisman. When you are using them, put in your Xiantian Qi. If it’s for your own usage, slam it at yourself, and it’s for opponents, throw it at them. Once it leaves your hand, it will break apart so long as it touches the opponent. The talisman strength within it will affect the body of your opponent. As for the attacking range, a first grade talisman can only be used within ten metres range. Second grade can only be used within twenty metres. Third grade will be thirty metres, fourth grade forty. For the fifth grade talismans and above, it will depend on your capabilities. The further you throw it, the further the attack will be.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Then why can’t the previous four grades surpass the distance?” Qing Shui asked Ling Zhanhan at a loss.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Let’s put it this way. Once a fourth grade of talismans or any of those below it are triggered by Xiantian Qi, it will break down even if it doesn’t touch anything. Take, for example, the second grade binding talisman in my hand. If you are standing at the spot fifteen metres away, this “binding talisman” will break down automatically at the spot five metres away from you.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As Ling Zhanhan finished his explanation, he threw the “Binding Talisman” from his hand at Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Pa!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The moment it interacted Qing Shui’s body, it gave a crispy noise. Qing Shui saw the “Binding Talisman” turn into bits of white lights, flowing into his own body.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In that instant, Qing Shui felt as if both of his legs were tied up with many things. For a while, Qing Shui felt a heavy burden which equivalent to twenty percent of a Xiantian warrior’s speed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, in an instant, the nature energy in his body immediately repelled the energy that had rushed in. Qing Shui had already experienced the mysteries of the Heavenly Talisman himself after all.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, you need to remember the important point about drawing talismans. I see that you have had a taste of its essence just now. The only things that you are lacking are time and practice. As for the drawing method, I will not teach you anymore. When it comes to drawing them, it is different for everyone. For a hundred people, there will be a hundred drawing methods. Thus, finding your own way of drawing it is your first step to it.” Ling Zhanhan said slowly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yeah. Grandpa Ling, are there any conditions needed for the beast skin and blood of the demonic beasts?” Qing Shui looked at the beast skin and blood that was shaped in talisman. There actually weren’t that many of them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Generally speaking, so long as it is the demonic beast’s skin and blood of those at the demonic beast grade, it will be usable. But the higher the grade, the more effective it will be. Moreover, the compatibility of the five series of the demonic beasts and the five series of the Heavenly Talisman will also be able to increase the power of the Heavenly Talisman. For example, the power of the “Scarlet Flame Talisman” will be increased if it is made by the skin of the “Raging Flame Thunderous Beast”. Of course, other than the five series, there are still a few other attributes. For example, wind attribute is compatible to speed. There is also thunder attribute……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Ling, could it be that the blood and skin of the demonic beasts were the only two things that could be used for talisman drawings?” Qing Shui felt that the most precious thing on a demonic beast was the demonic beast’s core, as well as its bones and other special stuffs. The blood and skin, on the other hand, were the most cheaply-priced ones to ordinary demonic beasts. Of course, there were also a few skins like those used to make “Interspacial silk sachet”.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Of couse not. The skin and blood of the demonic beasts are the most basic and also the most needed things, but if you want to use the bones of demonic beasts, their galls, or other special things, it will require your Talisman Drawing and refining skill to reach a certain realm. Of course, if you can use the core of the demonic beasts, its power would be even more formidable.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Refining skill?” He looked at Ling Zhanhan in doubt.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The skin and blood of the demonic beast were not something that could immediately be used as soon as it was taken out. It was something that needed to go through refinements from Talisman Masters with their Xiantian Qi before they were able to be used. There was also a distinct explanation inside the ancient book regarding the “Heavenly Talisman”. Even if it was used on either a demonic beast or other things, there would still be a distinct explanation.” Ling Zhanhan chuckled. He took a beast skin that was used to draw talismans and passed it over to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took over the thin and long animal skin the size of two palms. It was warm. After that, he slightly closed his eyes, as if he were feeling the internal parts of it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After being refined, the vein lines in the beast skin had become even clearer. It was more condensed and tenacious.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He slowly operated his Ancient Strengthening Technique and used the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique that was mixed with another power to slightly warm the beast skin in his hand. After that, he began to slowly feel the change inside.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, the vein lines seemed like it was even more clear. The two vein lines that had originally been close to each other seemed to be even closer now, but they were still not joining with each other. Qing Shui, who was already in the “Ru Wei” Realm, found it quite easy to control the things on top of it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, even if this was the case, Qing Shui felt that there seemed to be a line that had been snapped by himself within the vein lines of the beast skin. After that, Qing Shui felt a slight change occurring within the beast skin. Qing Shui knew that this beast skin could no longer be used to draw talismans.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Ling, I almost forgot. How long will the effect of these Heavenly Talisman last for?” Qing Shui absolutely had no idea about the time these second grade “Movement Restriction Talisman” could affect other people because of the expansive vital energy inside his body.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“For the first grade, it would take a quarter of an hour, for a second grade, it would take two quarters and so on for all the talismans up to the fourth grade. For the fifth grade Heavenly Talisman, it would be half a day. The sixth grade will take one whole day, the seventh grade will take a day and a half, and the eight grade of Heavenly Talisman will take two days. For those at the back, no one knows how long it will take.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">From the way it seemed, this Heavenly Talisman still looked like it had a lot of things that were yet to be known. Because no one had reached that kind of height, Qing Shui was already considered to have quite a good understanding to Talisman Drawing. &nbsp;Besides, there was still that “Ancient Heavenly Talisman Book” &nbsp;that Ling Zhanhan gave him. It should provide him with a detailed understanding.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, if you have anything on mind, you can leave anytime you want. Before you leave, don’t forget to say goodbye to my old man.” Ling Zhanhan said with a slight smile.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Grandpa Ling, since you are not telling me about your stuff now, I will not ask anymore about it. I promise you, in twenty years, or at most twenty years, I should be able to help you.” Qing Shui said after thinking for a while.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ling Zhanhan smiled and waved at Qing Shui. He said to himself softly after seeing Qing Shui’s figure disappear, “Twenty years, maybe it wouldn’t even take that long.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui arrived at Qing Yi’s room. There he saw both Qing Qing and Qing Bei.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Shui!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You guys are all here. What are you guys talking about? You all seem really happy.” Qing Shui asked without thinking the matter through.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Yi did not actually answer Qing Shui’s question. Instead, she looked at Qing Shui and asked, “Are you getting ready to go out again?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As soon as Qing Yi saw Qing Shui’s expression as he came in, she had already been aware of Qing Shui’s intentions.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ah, Brother Shui, are you leaving again?” Qing Bei said in shock.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui nodded at Qing Bei with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing did not say anything. She only looked at Qing Shui as if she was reluctant to part with him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“When are you planning to leave?” Qing Yi asked with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It should be around these three to five days.” Qing Shui said after thinking for a while.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Shui, for these past few years, you have always been shuttling back and forth alone outside. When you came back, you came back particularly from Yan Jiang Country. I even thought that you won’t be going out for the time being.” Qing Bei said while depressingly looking at Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Little Bei, I have given those martial art skills and medicinal pill to you and Sister Qing. By the time I come back next time, you guys should already be Xiantian Warriors.” Qing Shui chuckled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If you are not here, how will we be able to ascend to Xiantian that fast? Brother Shui, you have to come back as soon as possible.” &nbsp;Qing Bei said miserably. She had on a bitter face as she looked at Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Three days time went by very quickly. Qing Shui said goodbye to the people in Qing Clan and left on the firebird. One after another, the people from Qing Clan were occupied with a myriad of thoughts. From when he was sixteen years old up until he became an adult, Qing Shui’s experiences and shuttles were nothing that could be compared to other people. Even though it was really bitter, they were the things that a man should and would be willing to do.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui sat on the firebird and flew for a while. By late morning, he had already arrived in Hundred Miles City. He said goodbye to Yu He and, under her reluctant gaze, went to Shi Clan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After smoothly arriving at the backyard, Qing Shui did not go and bother the old people in Shi Clan. He was just here to say goodbye to Shi Qingzhuang before leaving.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He could already sense the energy of the backyard, as well as a continuous energy fluctuation before he even reached there. Qing Shui knew that Shi Qingzhuang was cultivating. After taking a turn, he saw the elegant, bright-red figure from far away.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had never asked her why she had always dressed herself up in a blazing attire. All of her shirts were blazing red in color. From inwards to outwards, Qing Shui was fortunate enough to see them, especially when he managed to see it two times in a row.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui went forward a few steps, Shi Qingzhuan lifted up her head. After she saw Qing Shui, she was shocked. After that, she avoided Qing Shui with an expression that looked like a smile yet not a smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui walked to her side and naturally grabbed the soft hand of hers which was holding a sword. He used his other hand to grab the long sword and stick it in a distant spot. He pulled at her and walked next to a nearby couch.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuan reluctantly rolled her eyes at Qing Shui. She would only show such kind of feminine charm when she was in front of Qing Shui. Even though it wasn’t the first time he saw it, he would still feel quite tempted every time he looked at it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You are becoming more and more like a woman now.” Qing Shui extended his hand and scratched her elegant nose which was quite tilted.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Indecent little rascal.” Shi Qingzhuan slapped away Qing Shui’s hand and said angrily.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I am not little, nor is that part of mine little.” Qing Shui first looked at Shi Qingzhuan seriously, then laughed after he finished talking.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You should die.” Shi Qingzhuan punched Qing Shui’s chest with average force.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Wu-wu!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In response, Qing Shui hugged her and kissed her tender and beautiful red lips. His tongue violently extended into her mouth as if he wanted to swallow her in whole.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qingzhuang, I am leaving now.” After a long time, Qing Shui let go of Shi Qingzhuan, whose face was already scarlet red. That chilly complexion and tempting blush made her deadly attractive.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang was startled. After that, her hands softly went around Qing Shui’s neck.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, hug me… hug me for a while……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A blazing firebird sped high up in the air. Its speed was as fast as a shooting star. It was Qing Shui who was rushing towards Cang Lang Country City. It was also around the time for him to return to Heavenly Palace.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the moment, the time that Qing Shui needed to fly from Hundred Miles City to Cang Lang Country City would only be about one day and more. To Qing Shui, he was quite satisfied with the speed of the Firebird at the moment. With its speed, his wish to fly to any places in the world of the nine continents in the future would soon come true. The only thing that it was lacking now would be strength.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though the Firebird was currently a Martial King grade Demonic Beast, if it were to meet another demonic beast of the Martial Saint grade, it wouldn’t have any chances of survival. &nbsp;Even if Qing Shui had a Soulshake bell, it still hadn’t gone up by one grade after so many days, which had made Qing Shui felt quite upset. With just the current fourth grade Soulshake bell, it might even be hard to stand up against a demonic beast at the Martial King Grade let alone deal with Martial Saint grade Demonic Beast. If it could be upgraded to the fifth grade, the chances of it dealing with Martial King grade Demonic Beasts should be a bit higher.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They needed to fly for about one whole day along the road. Qing Shui laid on the back of the bird and had nothing to do. He might as well take out the ancient book Heavenly Talisman and take advantage of this time to read it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The golden ancient records of Heavenly Talisman sparkled with golden light under the sun. This golden title page wasn’t actually Golden Extract Essence, but its value should not be much lower than Golden Extract Essence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The golden title page was really thin and full of tenacity. As Qing Shui took a look at it, he thought that it wasn’t really that thick, seeing as there were only about ten pages.&nbsp;</p>
