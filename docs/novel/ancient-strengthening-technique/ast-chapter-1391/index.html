 <p><strong>AST 1391 - Fire Bird's Morphing, Hell's Phoenix, Soaring to the Sky</strong></p>
 <p>"The Left Custodian is wanting to take action against you and will be bringing in other members of the Phoenix Dance Organization," the old man looked at Qing Shui and said.</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Qing Shui felt that his ability to get information was still very weak. Although the Jade Emperor Bees could be put to use, there were still plenty of disadvantages. Although he had a divine connection with them, they were after all, a lot different from humans.</p>
 <p>"Sir, if you guys don't have a lot of confidence, then it's better for you to not get involved,” Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</p>
 <p>"It's fine. Although the Cloud Flutter isn't as powerful as the Phoenix Dance, it isn't that easy for them to wipe us out. Even if they did eradicate us, the Phoenix Dance will suffer great losses as well and they'll end up being taken advantage of by other powers. Therefore, the Phoenix Dance won't really go all out with the Cloud Flutter."</p>
 <p>"If the Cloud Flutter were to stop the Phoenix Dance from making any moves against me, they still wouldn't fight it out with the Cloud Flutter?" Qing Shui couldn't understand.</p>
 <p>"They won't but they'll try to avoid us. Therefore, I'll do my best but I'm not sure if I'll be able to stop them entirely." Saying this, the old man was a little worried as well.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the old man for a while and felt that he did not lie. Smiling, Qing Shui said, "There's no need to worried. Even if the Che Clan and the Phoenix Dance want to swallow me up, it won't be that easy for them either."</p>
 <p>If this was said by some other young man, the old man would definitely treat it as rubbish talk. However, Qing Shui was different. The old man didn't feel that Qing Shui was boasting. After some hesitation, the old man said, "What do you think of letting Little Jian and Little Ying stay with you?"</p>
 <p>Little Jian and Little Ying were Yun Yijian and his wife.</p>
 <p>"That's good too. But don't let them make a move unless necessary. It'll be fine as long as they can help to take care of two people. As long as they are not attacked, then there's no need for the two of them to do anything," Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</p>
 <p>"Okay. I'll be more at ease with this arrangement. Having one more person would mean more security." The old man stood up.</p>
 <p>"Little Jian, you'll stay here and do what Qing Shui said," the old man said to Yun Yijian.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, I got it. Little Ying should be arriving soon. I'll go look for her."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>The people outside knew that there was trouble brewing here. Although nothing could be seen on the surface, everyone knew that there would be an explosion sooner or later. Those with news and quick wits would already have sensed the danger. There should still be other powers who would get involved.</p>
 <p>It wasn't known who was the one to spread the news but people now were aware that Qing Shui had helped Cloud Flutter's Yun Wanpeng increased his lifespan by several hundreds of years.</p>
 <p>Yun Wanpeng was that old man from Yun Clan.</p>
 <p>Many experts in this area knew that Yun Wanpeng's lifespan was nearing its end but now, Yun Wanpeng appeared to be invigorated and full of vitality. This was something which could not be faked. Experts were very sensitive to things like this. This was especially so, when one was only left with about half a year or so lifespan. It was hard to conceal something like this.</p>
 <p>Therefore, many people believed in the news and now knew that there was an amazing Miraculous Physician at the Imperial Cuisine Hall. In the past, many people had looked down on the Imperial Cuisine Hall but they now all changed their minds. Those who had received a token from the Imperial Cuisine Hall were now exhilarated. This was a token that could ensure one's life and increase one's lifespan. Moreover, the value of this token was now skyhigh.</p>
 <p>Those who had gone to the Imperial Cuisine Hall in the past and could have easily obtained a token, but had left in fury, were now full of regret. This was especially so for those who had said spiteful words and had done so in front of Qing Shui. These people now felt so upset that they wanted to bang their heads against a wall.</p>
 <p>Many people now knew of how amazing Qing Shui was and wanted to get into his good books. Even under such a situation, many people were still raring to take action.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui refused to meet anyone. Since he had decided to put on airs, he decided to go all out. Moreover, he spread the word that he would only meet others after the matter with the Che Clan was over.</p>
 <p>What a joke. After the matters with the Che Clan were settled, would it still be as easy for them to enter?</p>
 <p>Clever people knew what Qing Shui meant and thus, they backed off. Qing Shui's intentions were very clear. If they wanted him to help them increase their lifespans, then they would have to pay the price. For example, to go against the Phoenix Dance and the Che Clan. This was what Cloud Flutter had done...</p>
 <p>The Phoenix Dance wasn't the only big power in the continent's capital. Moreover, with the involvement of the Cloud City, there were still some bigger clans and powers who chose to stood up against the Phoenix Dance. There would be people keeping guard around the Imperial Cuisine Hall every day.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood on the rooftop. If the Phoenix Dance wished to take him on with their advantage in numbers, then they had underestimated his influence. As a powerful physician, as long as he played the right cards, he could easily let a great clan be wiped out completely.</p>
 <p>Of course, the situation had yet to become so serious. For now, he would let his targets feel troubled and go crazy.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't know if it was because of Cloud Flutter or because of the involvement of other clans and powers that the day had passed by peacefully. He called his demonic beasts out to stand guard while he entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to cultivate. However, the moment he entered, he was stunned.</p>
 <p>The Fire Bird had changed. Did it attain a breakthrough?</p>
 <p>Right now, the size of the Fire Bird was over two times bigger than what it was previously. Its feathers were still pitch black, like black treasured stones. It exuded a cold and elegant aura. When it saw Qing Shui, it cried out happily.</p>
 <p>This should be the cry of a phoenix!</p>
 <p>Why did it attain a breakthrough? Could it be because he had cultivated the Phoenix Form?</p>
 <p>What was the connection? Qing Shui assessed the Fire Bird and saw that the crown it had on its head previously had now grown very big. It was still a pitch black crown but was extremely brilliant.</p>
 <p>Phoenix?</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qing Shui felt very excited. The Fire Bird could now be said to be extremely close to the legendary phoenix. But was it considered a phoenix yet?</p>
 <p>Heavenly Vision Technique!</p>
 <p>Hell's Phoenix, Bloodline Power: Weak!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui understood at first glance and felt very agitated. The Fire Bird was now considered to be a phoenix. It was a Hell's Phoenix. Even though it was a phoenix with a weak blood lineage. It was still considered to be a phoenix.</p>
 <p>A phoenix wasn't an existence which ordinary demonic beasts could win against, even if it was a phoenix with the weakest blood lineage.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked toward its physical strength. It had now reached a terrifying 200 sun. Qing Shui was filled with emotions as well as feelings of regrets. It was because he hadn't been around when the Fire Bird went through the morph. He didn't get to see that majestic scene. He didn't even know how the Fire Bird had suddenly morphed.</p>
 <p>Although it always had the possibility of undergoing a morph, nothing had happened so far. Therefore, Qing Shui hadn't been paying attention in this area. The long time that had passed in the actual world was considered to be a very long time in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>For the "Fire Bird's" physical strength to reach 200 sun, it could be said that it had progressed tremendously. It was a huge rise. Qing Shui looked excitedly toward the Fire Bird's battle techniques, hoping that it could give him a great surprise during such a crucial period.</p>
 <p>Dark Phoenix of Nine Heavens, passive battle technique, zero depletion, permanently increases power by four times. The depletion from any usage of battle techniques and attacks would be reduced by half.</p>
 <p>Powerful... Qing Shui now had no idea what he could say to express his current feelings. He had a feeling that for the Fire Bird to have morphed into the Hell's Phoenix, it could not be considered an Immortal Demon existence and was now at the False God level.</p>
 <p>He now had a False God level demonic beast as well...</p>
 <p>The more Qing Shui thought about it, the more gloomy he felt for having missed the scene of the Fire Bird's morphing. This was a huge loss. However, looking at the Fire Bird, which should now be considered a Hell's Phoenix, Qing Shui still felt especially happy.</p>
 <p>Superior Flight: A powerful flying ability of the Hell's Phoenix. Flying speed is increased by tenfold and depletion from flying is reduced by tenfold.</p>
 <p>Terrifying... Qing Shui's mouth was agape and he was stunned... He hadn't expected that the Fire Bird would be the first one to undergo a morph. He had thought that the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant would be first.</p>
 <p>Hell's Inferno: The powerful flame attack unleashed by the Fire Bird. Its pitch black flames can burn everything and have terrifying destructive powers. It was the Black Phoenix's powerful battle technique and the power of fire attribute attacks was five times that of its physical strength.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Dance of Nine Heavens: Passive battle technique, permanently increase fire attribute attacks by tenfold. The damage it received would be halved. All resistance increase by threefold. Zero depletion.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw this, he smiled. He was unable to contain his smile. This was far too terrifying. The Hell's Inferno itself was five times its physical strength and the Phoenix Dance of the Nine Heavens once again increased tenfold... It had now exceeded 55 times...</p>
 <p>This was what morphing was. A phoenix Immortal Demon was a terrifying existence, even if it was just at the lowest level. The day he had been anticipating had finally arrived!</p>
 <p>Underworld Fireball: Unleash a fireball attack. Its attacking prowess was five times its strength. The fireball contained a terrifying explosive power. When it exploded, the prowess is doubled once again. Spiritually locked onto target.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's mouth was agape. That feeling was even happier than being hit by a fallen treasure from the sky. He now felt a little numb. All the cells in his body were jumping about excitedly and right now, he could no longer express the surprise in his heart.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Paradise: When the Fire Bird received fatal damage, it would have a 30% chance to go through a Firebath Rebirth. The successful rebirth would be like a transformation with its strength being twice as strong as before.</p>
 <p>There were no changes to this. Qing Shui didn't find it strange either.</p>
 <p>Finally, Qing Shui discovered that there were two more battle techniques.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Heart: A powerful Phoenix Heart could allow the all of the phoenix's prowess to be doubled once again, damage received reduced by half once again and all depletion to be reduced one fold. Zero depletion, passive battle technique.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Might: Absolute suppression over all bird-type beasts, with the exception of phoenixes, suppressing their abilities by at least 10%. At most, it could cause the target to lose its battle prowess but it was unable to cause a suppression in other areas. Zero depletion, passive battle technique!</p>
 <p>When the Fire Bird activated the Underworld Fireball, at the moment when it exploded, the prowess could surpass 20 million sun...</p>
 <p>Could this be the power of the phoenix? This was when it was just the Hell's Phoenix which had a weak blood lineage. Then what kind of power did demonic beasts at the level of phoenixes or dragons with a powerful blood lineage have?</p>
 <p>The Spirit Gathering Lamp once again lost its effect. Otherwise, if the prowess of the abilities were doubled again, he could go straight to wipe out the Phoenix Dance Organization. It should be possible...</p>
 <p>Since the effect was lost, then so be it. The power of the Fire Bird was already very terrifying. Its resistance was higher and so was its speed. Furthermore, there was also the suppression ability. Toward bird-typed beasts, with the exception of phoenixes, the suppression was absolute. For others, for example, humans, it was unknown how much the suppression would work. Since it wasn't absolute, any situation could be possible.</p>
 <p>Peak Grade Five False God was at a level with a strength of 16 million sun. The Fire Bird had already surpassed 22 million sun. Demonic beasts didn't have to go through the False God Tribulations but they would undergo morphing. The later the phase, the harder it was to morph.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's Paragon Strike was only slightly over 15 million sun. Right now, he felt very much at ease. After being weakened by the Hundred Birds Worshiping The Phoenix and Emperor's Qi, who could still withstand the explosive impact of the Fire Bird's Underworld Fireball? Furthermore, this attack was one that was locked onto the target and impossible to dodge, unless the target destroyed the fireball before it reached them.</p>
 <p>This was a surprise, a great surprise. Qing Shui felt very much at ease. In this situation, where he waited to receive things thrown at him, he had enough support.</p>
 <p>The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was also on the verge of attaining a breakthrough but there were still no signs of it. The Fire Bird's breakthrough could settle the pressing impending danger and after the things here were settled, he might be able to go take a look at the Demon Lord Palace. If the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant were to attain a breakthrough, he would be even more confident. Qing Shui was full of anticipation. Right now, his powers were stabilized and slowly improving.</p>
