 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><strong>AST 1600 - Inheritor of the Thunder Roc Condor Demon King, Qin Qing is defeated</strong></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The features across the man’s face looked unusually outstanding. He had deep and piercing eyes. His brows were sharp like swords and his nose was pointed like an eagle’s beak. This combination had caused the man to look unusually fierce, as sharp as a sword which could cut through anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked through the corner of his eyes. Yet again, the familiar Spiritual Sense appeared in his mind. This person was another person who received the Demon Lord’s Inheritance. Since he could have three to four people who received Battle God’s Inheritance on his side, it was not surprising that his enemies were also able to have them. Similar things came together, as this saying went, and it was indeed true.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This man had inherited the Thunder Roc Condor Demon King Inheritance. From his body, Qing Shui could feel powerful lightning energy. This man was a lot more powerful than Demon Child Niu. He quickly said, “Sister Qing, this is a warrior who has inherited Thunder Roc Condor Demon King Inheritance. Please be careful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing nodded. Like usual, she was sitting on the enormous Green Dragon. At the moment, Qin Qing still had the powerful Green Dragon to fight with her but despite all that, she was still in danger. The reason being that was her opponent specialized in lightning energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lightning energy surpassed fire attributes in terms of offensive strength. Furthermore, the lightning energy also carried a paralysis effect with it. As to exactly how strong the attack was, it would depend on the user’s strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young lady, you are very good-looking. I don’t care who you are, why don’t you be my wife? I can promise you anything.” The man didn’t seem to be in a rush to make his move as he greedily looked at Qin Qing. Luckily, his expression didn’t seem that lowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For someone at his level, every movement he made would contain some sort of elegance. Even if he was a bad guy, he would still somehow emit some sort of dominant aura off of his body. It was definitely not something which an ordinary gangster could compare to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing remained silent. It seemed like she didn’t hear what the opponent was saying. However, a lot of the people below had heard it. Qing Shui got upset and immediately said, “With that turtle look of yours, save it. Only speak if you are the last one to stand later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn’t that loud and not many people had actually heard what he said. The man, however, was one of the people who did. He looked at Qing Shui with a disdaining look and asked Qin Qing, “Does this brat like you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thing which approached him was a mouthful of thick Water Essence from the Green Dragon. Lightning was under the flame attribute in the five elements and Qin Qing’s Green Dragon, on the other hand, was water attributed. Hence, in terms of the five elements, Qin Qing held the advantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man also stopped talking. A pair of indistinct but huge lightning wings appeared behind his back. If one looked closer, they would know that they were the enormous wings which belonged to the Thunder Roc Condor. Traces of lightning flow could be vaguely seen on top of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man only moved slightly to avoid the Green Dragon’s attack. The Thunder Roc Condor possessed an extremely fast speed. Among the list of all living things, it was definitely considered as one of the outstanding ones. For the Thunder Roc Condor Demon Lord Inheritance, speed played as one of its most important factors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Speed was equivalent to strength and could decide everything. With formidable speed, the man was not in the slightest disadvantage. Even people who were slightly stronger in terms of offensive prowess, when in front of him, would become very fragile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the moment when the man was trying to dodge the attacks, the pair of wings behind him could be seen flapping. At that instant, the wings looked extremely distinct. A lightning sword formed swiftly and immediately shot its way through the Green Dragon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The target of the attack was precisely the dragon’s reverse scale. The most terrifying thing was the speed of the Lightning Sword. Though it might contain a lot of power, its most terrifying feat still lied in its power. Qin Qing quickly condensed a small azure-colored Phoenix with her consciousness and shot it towards the Lightning Sword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A layer of water vapor emerged from the Green Dragon’s body and it immediately covered up the dragon and Qin Qing entirely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once you hit a dragon’s reverse scale, you were bound to die.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Green Dragon seemed to have been enraged as well and let out an angry roar. The enormous dragon immediately unleashed its Divine Dragon Tail move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This attack seemed very inconsistent. However, it had a wide attack range which was around a thousand meter radius. Divine Dragon Tail was also considered to be a powerful battle technique and was a kind of Heavenly Dao which targeted an entire area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man was giving his utmost effort to avoid it but it seemed a bit tough for him to do so. He immediately flapped both of his enormous wings. As he did so, a cloud of Thunder Protection Shield appeared around him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Peng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Thunder Protection Shield was broken but despite that, the man wasn’t injured. The Green Dragon was aware that it must retreat after it landed a hit as the aura which the man possessed was too fearsome. Luckily, it held the advantage in terms of the elements which it possessed. Otherwise, no one would have known what would happen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment when the Green Dragon retreated, Qin Qing once again thrust out a blue Phoenix which was a meter in size. It charged its way towards the man like a meteorite falling from the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A two meters, violet-colored blade appeared in the man’s hand. There was violet light circling around the blade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Violet Lightning Sabre!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the man saw the tiny Phoenix that was approaching him, he didn’t hesitate and immediately slashed the sword towards it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A terrifying explosion was heard but the man wasn’t affected by it. His figure turned blurry and he disappeared from the original spot he was standing on. After that, he appeared above Qin Qing. While doing so, the Violet Lightning Sword in his hand abruptly enlarged in size and became about a hundred meters long. The formidable violet-colored thunder emerged from the Violet Lightning Sword, giving out crackling and rattling noises.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Water Divine Shield!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A huge wave of water emerged around Qin Qing. The azure water swiftly gathered up and formed an enormous water shield and everywhere above it was filled with whirlpools. They were giving out a powerful water pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All along, Qing Shui was observing the battle above him. It was the first time he saw how the Green Dragon battled. The man was very powerful, he was able to suppress Qin Qing and the Green Dragon with his speed. If it wasn’t because of the restraint due to the five elements, it was very likely that they would have long lost the battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Thunder Roc Condor Demon King Inheritance which the man possessed was very formidable. His lightning energy was also extremely terrifying. The Violet Lightning Sword in his hand wasn’t a Divine Weapon but it could well be considered to be a tiny Divine Weapon. The terrifying speed and destructive power he possessed was something which even the Green Dragon couldn’t withstand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">(Prior to this, it was mentioned that the Green Dragon hadn’t eaten the Diamond Fruit, this seemed to be wrong as it had actually eaten it before)</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that Qin Qing was no match for her the opponent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Qin Qing jumped down from the Green Dragon’s back. In her hand was her Long Phoenix Sword and thrust the sword towards the man. Qin Qing also specialized in her speed, it was just that she was no match to her opponent in terms of her power. In the case of speed, they were almost at the same level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, with her Nine Palace Step, though it might not be at Qing Shui’s level, she could still fight against her opponent for a short period of time. During this time, the Green Dragon constantly provided her aid from the side. Qin Qing mixed the strength of the Phoenix Finger into her Brushing Willow Sword Art.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Extreme Yang Violet Lightning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man’s strength once again burst abruptly and a bundle of violet light surrounded him. In a flash, he arrived in front of Qin Qing and slashed at her with the Violet Sun Sword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing was shocked with the surprise attack and quickly moved backward with her Nine Palace Steps. However, the man pursued her tightly like a poisonous ulcer that’s grown on a bone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing clenched her teeth and a pair of enormous colored wings appeared behind her back. The wings which appeared this time looked very distinct. As this happened, her speed received a significant boost. Qing Shui, however, let out a sigh; with her strength now, Qin Qing wasn’t strong enough to use her battle techniques. After this match, she would definitely need some time for her strength to recover.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The enormous colored wings were like Phoenix Wings of the Nine Heavens as they flapped. They also possessed incredible speed. Even now, the man in front of her was now inferior to her in terms of speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You lost. The longer you try to drag on the fight, the more serious your injury will become. Consider my suggestion earlier on. I will treat you really well.” To everyone’s surprise, the man stopped and said slowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that the opponent must have seen through Qin Qing’s unique physique. Despite that, it was still more due to her beauty that the opponent wanted her. He immediately moved and appeared next to Qin Qing, “Let me take over.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that Qing Shui was here, the enormous, colorful wings on Qin Qing’s back disappeared. However, her Qi and blood were surging violently. Her meridians were like needles constantly poking her. Qing Shui extended his hand and grabbed her. Following on, he passed some Divine Force into her body to help treat her wounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man could tell that Qin Qing was a virgin. While Qing Shui was holding her in his arms, the man became really furious. He had long since recognized Qin Qing as his woman; he would never allow any men to imprint their hands on her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could sense the pernicious aura being emitted by the man. Qing Shui said while treating Qin Qing’s wound, “Hey you, the guy who is already quite old, what’s your name?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man was now enraged. Despite this, he still said in an angry tone, “Lei Ming!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui slowly pulled back his hand, as Qin Qing didn’t suffer any major injuries. It would take her at most a day for her to recover. Prior to this, she didn’t excessively use her inner force, hence, the recoil damage wasn’t that significant. The earlier her injury was treated, the faster it would recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sister Qing, take a break first. I got this.” Qing Shui pointed towards the place where he was before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing nodded and said, “Be careful!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry about it. For you guys, I will be fine.” Qing Shui said with a smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was at this moment when Qing Shui felt how distant he was from Qin Qing. There was once a time when nothing much had happened between them. However, there existed feelings and ambiguous love from both of them. Though it might have been a lot fainter now, they were still present in the relationship between the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can you answer me one question?” Qing Shui smiled as he gazed at the man named Lei Ming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Ming knitted his brows. Actually, during this whole time, he had been probing Qing Shui’s strength. Though he might be powerful, it was still nothing compared to him. Hence, he wasn’t all that worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ask, but there is no guarantee that I will answer you.” Lei Ming said calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You should be aware of what I am about to ask. Can you tell me how many of you that are like Demon Child Niu are there?” Actually, Qing Shui was trying to ask the man how many people on his side had received the Demon Lord’s Inheritance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Ming smiled, “What’s wrong, are you scared?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am just curious to know since when you guys started walking together with the Niu Clan.” Qing Shui asked with a smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I find your question very childish. How did you guys get along? Is this still a question which is supposed to be asked?” Lei Ming looked at Qing Shui and smiled. His smile looked really gloomy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I understand now. Well then, why don’t we solve the issue between us with strength?” Qing Shui took out his Golden Battle Halberd. In an instant, his strength was boosted significantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As of now, even Lei Ming didn’t dare to look down on the young man in front of him. He realized that Qing Shui was very weird. His aura was changing from time to time and his strength was very unstable. Overall, he felt that something wasn’t right about Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Phoenix’s Battle Intent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Battle God’s Halo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s strength was still increasing. At this moment, Lei Ming was no longer able to keep himself calm. He swung the Violet Lightning Sword in his hand and slashed it towards Qing Shui. The enormous Violet Lightning Sword carried the might of both the heaven and earth as it slashed its way towards Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked extremely calm. He approached his attack with the Golden Battle Halberd in his hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Battle Halberd shot out a few golden lights that were about ten meters long towards the Violet Lightning Sword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thousands of golden lights burst out in the sky. There were a few violet lights mixed in it as well. Qing Shui’s body only shook for a while and didn’t suffer much injuries from the attack. As this happened, Qing Shui became even more confident regarding this match. Lei Ming, on the other hand, was shocked. He was aware of how much power that slash of his should have contained. He was extremely powerful in terms of strength and speed, the only thing he didn’t specialize in was his defense. Hence, normally, he would land countless attacks in a battle. For warriors at the same level as him, very few would actually be able to withstand his strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only did the young physician manage to withstand the attack, he didn’t seem to be affected by it in the slightest. Though he had yet to go all out, he had already used up about 80% of his strength.</span></p>
