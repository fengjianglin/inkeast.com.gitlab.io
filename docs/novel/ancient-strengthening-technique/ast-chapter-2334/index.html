 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2334 - Divine Rain Sect's Sect Leader</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Qing Shui came out from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal the next day, the sun was already up. Although the accommodations here were simple, each house had their own courtyards. Qing Shui practiced the Taichi Fist while facing the sun. His Taichi Fist was no longer the earliest version he had been practicing. There were hints of the Back Connecting Fist, Yu Emperor Fist, Berserk Dragon Fist, yet also seemed as if there was nothing at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui had no idea what realm he was considered to have reached. It was no longer the same stage as when the emphasis was on the intent and not the form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the practice, he seemed as if he wasn't exerting any strength at all, occasionally being soft and gentle, occasionally being flamboyant, occasionally being fierce and violent, occasionally being dignified...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rising sun in the east cast down endless golden light, dyeing the entire land in the color of gold. This place was a rainforest. Although there would be a drizzle most of the time, the sun would still be out in most situations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rainbows weren't a rare sight here and could be seen once every few days. Moreover, there would be many of them hanging up in the sky in different forms. They were beautiful and dreamy. Combining the bamboo houses, the rainbows, and the light drizzle, the scenery of this region filled the heart of the observers with a poetic feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was not only a place with terrific terrain and great calming aura, but overflowing Spiritual Qi could also be felt all over, a sign that there was a strong Spiritual Vein here. This place was definitely considered as one of the best areas in the Lower Three Regions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When one of the ladies saw Qing Shui downstairs, she smiled and said, "Miraculous Physician, please enter!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui smiled and headed over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time around, the woman stood in the middle of the room. When she saw Qing Shui, her eyes lit up, appearing more lively than they were before. Previously, they were dull and dark, but they were completely different now. It was as if pearls that were covered in dust had been cleaned and were emitting their original radiance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Mmm, you seem to be in quite a good condition. We can start on the scar removal."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'll have to trouble you," said the woman. She didn’t show any particular expression as she knew that in her current state, there was nothing that she was suited for. Even her smile would appear very ugly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"A bright pearl that's covered in dust. It's no trouble at all." Qing Shui signaled for her to lie down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn't the soft and comfortable bed from before; it was made of bamboo instead. Qing Shui covered up her eyes. Her face required multiple treatments, but for now, he was only going to focus on the spot below her eyes. He used the gold needles to numb her nerves before taking out a small knife. It was a small knife that was specially made from pure silver.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This knife itself had a self-purifying effect, thus saving the need for Qing Shui to do so. When it was about time, Qing Shui circulated his Qi and Force of Rebirth. He then started to slice off those scars. Qing Shui actually didn't know about the exact process of scar removals, but his powerful abilities allowed him to do this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this situation had occurred to him in his previous life, people would have died from surprise.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before the treatment, Qing Shui had given the woman the Aptitude Pill, Growth Pill, and other supplements. He was being very serious while he was slicing off the scars, doing every step so meticulously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Medicinal powder from the Flower of Life!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui applied this medicinal powder he had made and started applying acupuncture. He even used the Life and Death Needles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To be safe, Qing Shui applied the acupuncture for over two hours. Then, he put on bandages over her face, revealing only her mouth. The bandages could be taken off after a week. And in ten days, they would be able to treat the portion of her face above the eyes before eventually tackling the area around her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman looked at the bowl beside her that had so many of the removed scars and felt very relaxed. It was as if she had a lot of burdens removed. Regardless if her face would get better or not, she felt that she would undergo a change. The poison was gone, and there was no threat to her life. Thus, she thought that it was fine for her to remain ugly. With Qing Shui attempting to remove her scars, no matter how things turned out, it would probably be better than how it had been before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the treatment, Qing Shui made some food. Her condition required food therapy, for her to take medicinal cuisine. The woman felt a little bad as she saw Qing Shui busy in the kitchen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is medicinal cuisine. It'll be of great help for your recovery," Qing Shui said as he prepared the food.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no lack of medicinal herbs, and Qing Shui had even greater confidence in his culinary skills than his cultivation. Qing Shui felt that he was definitely considered top-notch in the field of medicine and culinary. Even if he were to head to the Upper Three Regions, he didn't believe that there would be people who would be able to surpass him in these two areas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he felt that he was a little arrogant, &nbsp;more of it was contributed to his confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, fragrant medicinal scent drifted out, tempting every soul around the area. An exquisite set of medicinal cuisine was brought out. It was just a small bowl, but its appearance and its delicious smell alone would cause one's appetite to perk up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman didn't expect Qing Shui to have such great culinary skills. Qing Shui placed this bowl of medicinal cuisine on the table and poured out a cup of plum blossom wine. The fragrance from the wine didn't clash with that of the medicinal cuisine. Instead, they seemed to have integrated together perfectly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman took a sip of the wine before trying the medicinal cuisine. After a moment of silence, she looked at Qing Shui in disbelief and then quickly finished both up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She ate very quickly with her head lowered, not showing any elegance at all. However, her figure was still extremely alluring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is the best food I've ever eaten and the best wine I've ever drunk." The woman wore an expression as if it hadn't been enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Thank you for your compliment, I'll give you some after you've recovered. I believe that when you eat it then, it'll taste even more delicious." Qing Shui also felt very happy although he had no idea why.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui had this feeling that the woman had an enticing aura, even when her face was covered in scars. By right, her face should make others detest her or feel horrified, but why was there an enticing feeling?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the view before Qing Shui changed. The woman was still herself, but there was a blurry shadow of eight fox tails behind her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sky Fox?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui closed his eyes for a while and when he opened them again, she returned to her original appearance. However, Qing Shui knew that this wasn't an illusion. He had the Heavenly Vision Technique and what he had seen earlier was through his Heavenly Vision Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui thought of that God Striking Whip and then this woman. He seemed to have understood something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Divine Rain Sect doesn't really have a sect leader who is training in seclusion, right?" Qing Shui asked casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How did you know that?" The woman looked at Qing Shui in surprise and didn't deny that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I guessed it. You should be the Divine Rain Sect's sect leader." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm only doing this to give the other members of the Divine Rain Sect hope," the woman sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui now understood why the Divine Rain Sect hadn't been so forceful previously and why they would agree to some of the conditions which might have seemed overboard. Back then, the Divine Rain Sect had quite a number of problems on their own as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, Qing Shui didn't say that she was from the Sky Fox race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui felt that the position of Divine Rain Sect's sect leader had been owned by the members of the Sky Fox race since ancient times. The Divine Rain Sect had been passed down from ancient times, and that God Striking Whip must have been the weapon belonging to one of the sect leaders. It wasn’t known how the whip had been damaged, but Qing Shui had the feeling that the owner of this God Striking Whip should have fallen. After all, even the God Striking Whip had been severely damaged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It could have been that since then, the God Striking Whip had been treated like a spoilt item and tossed in the Divine Rain Sect's storage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui naturally had no idea what the reason had been, nor did he wish to pursue the root of this problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Maybe due to the severity of its damage, the owner recognition process couldn't be conducted. And since the treasure couldn't be put through owner recognition, it was naturally treated like trash. However, they couldn't bear to throw it away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, even though the God Striking Whip was considered damaged, it was definitely still a miraculous treasure. Moreover, after the owner recognition process, 20% of the damage would be recovered, so its prowess would definitely become stronger. It might not be comparable to the God Striking Whip back in the ancient times, but at Qing Shui's current level, it was definitely considered a divine artifact.</span></p>
