 <p><strong>AST 1002 - Soaring Into the Sky, The Amazing Area Dominance, Power Determines Everything</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked toward the Four-eared Macaque. Right now, this little macaque only has a physical strength of 30 stars.</p>
 <p>Golden Spirit Body: passive battle technique, increases physical strength by three folds, zero depletion!</p>
 <p>Back then, when Qing Shui first saw this Four-eared Macaque, he could only see its spiritual type and it was also extremely weak. However, one year later, it grew stronger very quickly and its innate battle techniques also started to appear.</p>
 <p>Keen Intelligence: Unrivalled spiritual sense and senses. It was one of the most intelligent amongst all demonic beasts. Intelligence-type demonic beasts had an unrivalled advantage over other demonic beasts. They were able to fend of 20% of the impact from spirit energy attacks and physical attacks.</p>
 <p>Weakness Attack: As a Intelligence typed demonic beast, its attack was twice as effective. It would be able to attack the opponent's weak points and increase the damaging impact by one fold.</p>
 <p>This battle technique made Qing Shui felt that Qing Qing was very lucky. In the past, this kindhearted elder sister of his could be considered pitiful. However, she eventually was presented with such a great opportunity. Till date, Qing Qing didn't even know that this little monkey was a powerful demonic beast.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan could tell something. After all, she had the Heart of Seven Orifices. However, she only knew that this Four-eared Macaque was unordinary but she wasn't sure what made it so.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and handed Qing Qing two Hallow Pills, "Sister, find some time and give these to your little monkey. It'll make it more intelligent and healthy."</p>
 <p>Now that they were going to be on their way, Qing Shui gave it some thought and handed Qing Qing two Hallow Pills and heavily emphasized that she should only feed it one at a time. He made it very clear. Qing Qing was very good to this pitiful little monkey. Since Qing Shui said that this medicinal pill was beneficial to the little monkey, Qing Qing would definitely follow his advice..</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui called out the Fire Bird, everyone was surprised. It was because the Fire Bird had changed far too tremendously. Its color had turned completely black and although everyone recognized that this was the Fire Bird, they still found it unbelievable.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan looked at the Fire Bird and smiled. She knew that Qing Shui's Fire Bird must also had eaten the medicinal pill and went through a mutation.</p>
 <p>It was extremely rare for demonic beasts to go through mutation and it was a good thing. Most demonic beasts would have qualitative increases in their strength, talent, battle techniques and other aspects after they had gone through mutation.</p>
 <p>The chances of going through mutation was very low and over several hundreds of thousands, there might be one or two demonic beasts which would undergo mutation. It was even rarer for high grade demonic beasts to go through mutations. Qing Shui briefly explained what was going on. He was worried that Qing Yu might be afraid of the pitch black Fire Bird but he realized that she had shown no reaction.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Qing Shui picked up Qing Yu and went up to the Fire Bird with the few ladies.</p>
 <p>They didn't travel very fast but they would be able to arrive at the Qing Clan in a few days time. In the evening, they arrived at a city, Linhai City!</p>
 <p>After they found an inn, the group chartered the entire level but it was only for a night. They went out together with the kids to buy stuff and to look around.</p>
 <p>Children are very active. Bringing them out, Qing Shui looked at their happy smiles, which made him felt very happy himself. Qing Yu was in Qing Shui's arms. At the start, Qing Yu only took his hand as she walked but she was still too small in size. With there being such a huge crowd, her view was easily blocked, so Qing Shui decided to carry her.</p>
 <p>At night, Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal once again!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui watched as Qing Qing fed the Hallow Pill to the Four-eared Macaque before he entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. After taking it, the Four-eared Macaque's body was also very calm but only Qing Shui could tell that it had gotten a lot stronger.</p>
 <p>Elder sister would never had expected that this pitiful creature she had brought back was a heaven-defying battle beast. Qing Shui was happier than anyone else to see that his sister could have such a powerful demonic beast.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was now prepared to perform alchemy.</p>
 <p>Violet Qi Pellet!</p>
 <p>This time around, Qing Shui went ahead to use the Golden Snake Grass. At the start, he didn't feel like using it for fear that he might grow reliant to it. However, he eventually gave in. Although he was confident in his alchemy skills, there were too much Golden Snake Grass now. He would also not feel good if his alchemy were to fail and there were limited Purple Qi Star Grass.</p>
 <p>With the Golden Snake Grass, the alchemy was naturally performed successfully. Three pills were created. It was a pity that each person could only take one. For cultivators who were Martial Emperor or higher, it could increase 20% of their physical strength, with a cap at 30 stars.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't feel very disappointed. This was a restriction and it wasn't the first one he had ever encountered. He originally wanted to wait to take the Hallow Pill before the Violet Qi Pellet since he could get a greater increase but it seemed that there wasn't a need for that.</p>
 <p>Right now, his physical strength was at 220 stars, and 20% would be 44 stars. However, since the limit was at 30 stars, there wasn't a need for him to wait.</p>
 <p>After he absorbed the Violet Qi Pellet, Qing Shui's physical strength reached 250 stars.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui patted his head. This number made him speechless. However, he continued to cultivate in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, allowing himself to adapt to the explosive increment in strength. It was like how, in order for buildings to be built to great heights rapidly, both the foundations and the structure must be firm. Right now, he was firming up his increased in strength.</p>
 <p>After spending two months in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui took a Hallow Pill.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Qing Shui knew how it felt for his body to swell up as if he was going to explode. However, no matter how painful it was, it basically only seemed dangerous and was nothing much. As long as one was a Martial Emperor, it should be fine.</p>
 <p>This was what Qing Shui felt after eating one. This Hallow Pill was really domineering, to think that it had increased his physical strength by 100 stars. What surprised Qing Shui was that this power he acquired was very pure, as if it was something that he had worked hard to cultivate.</p>
 <p>Sacred fruits... This was the power of a sacred fruit.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was originally worried that if his strength were to increase too quickly, it might have negative impacts to his body. This was good, he would only need to familiarize himself with the newfound power. After having a break for a few days, Qing Shui took another pill.</p>
 <p>His physical strength increased explosively to 450 stars and the golden pellet in his Dantian was now at the size of a fist and extremely bright. Its texture felt like that of the sturdiest metal.</p>
 <p>Excellent!</p>
 <p>Right now, this was the best word Qing Shui could think of to describe his feeling. It was as if he was looking down on the entire world. This was a huge increase in terms of his cultivation level, it gave him the same feeling as a person who would feel courageous because they had great skill.</p>
 <p>With a physical strength of 450 stars, after adding the effects of the Diamond Qi, and Diamond Crossing Rivers, his strength had increased to 900 stars straight away. Then there was still Nature Energy and State of Immovable as Mountains...</p>
 <p>Under the impact of his techniques, he would be able to reach a strength of 2,200 stars. And if he were to hold the Big Dipper Sword and perform the Combination Sword Technique, he could reach a strength close to 12,000 stars.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui could guess the rough estimate, he was still stunned in shock. If the 20% chances were to appear and his attacking prowess was increased by another fold...</p>
 <p>If he were to use the Violet Star Thunder God, under normal conditions, he would also reach a strength of over 8,800 stars. If he were to perform the Raging Blow, each time, it would be over 17,000 stars. There was no need for any additional chances.</p>
 <p>The world's regulation. Qing Shui felt helpless just thinking about it. In the past, he hadn't expected that he would become so much stronger within a short period of less than a year.</p>
 <p>Back in the past, he felt that the regulations were good since he had the Emperor's Qi, thus he had great confidence to deal with his opponents. However, now that he was the one being restricted, he felt that he was the one on the losing end.</p>
 <p>In the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui unleashed his powers. Each time he attacked, he would create a huge phantom image. For example, when he used the Big Dipper Sword, there would be an image of a huge sword; when he used a hammer, there would be a huge image of a hammer, enlarged many times over. They came along with an overwhelming pressure.</p>
 <p>This was Form Transformation, just like when the Tiger Form Form Transformation. However, right now, it was a Form Transformation of weapons. Qing Shui swung out his Big Dipper Sword once again.</p>
 <p>Sword of Sixth Wave!</p>
 <p>Six gigantic sword shadows shot out into the air like murderous drills, disappearing out of sight.</p>
 <p>He came to a stop after very long time had passed, calming down. Even though there was the world’s regulations, Qing Shui knew that he still had the Emperor’s Qi and the Big Dipper Sword to rely on. The Big Dipper Sword would reduce 10% of the damage he received.</p>
 <p>If this was the case, he had the confidence. Although his enhanced powers couldn't be unleashed, his endurance was very strong.</p>
 <p>"Oh, right. That's the effect of Area Dominance." Thinking of this, Qing Shui couldn't hold it in anymore.</p>
 <p>However, he still left the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal when it was about time.</p>
 <p>The sky started to light up and Qing Shui left the inn, he performed the Nine Continents Steps toward the far distant.</p>
 <p>Area Dominance!</p>
 <p>“Mmm”, Qing Shui said this out unconsciously. He had came here to try out its effect and the moment he said it, a faint aura came out from his forehead. In that instant, the surroundings seemed to be like the fading away of clouds. Qing Shui felt that the sensation was very amazing and he performed the Combination Sword Technique with his Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned.</p>
 <p>6,700 stars!</p>
 <p>Why was it so high?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that something was not right. He could still accept it if he were to hit out with a strength of 6,000 stars but he didn’t expect that the effect of 'Area Dominance' would be so powerful. After all, the Spirited Snake Turtle only had a strength of 1,200 stars.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought hard about it but still couldn't understand, thus he had stopped altogether. However, he was overjoyed. With a strength of 6,700 stars, there was nothing he should be afraid of now.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Steps!</p>
 <p>When he returned to the inn, everyone had woken up. They had their breakfast and continued on their way.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, another two months had passed!</p>
 <p>Right now, Zhu Qing was already eight months into her pregnancy. Qing Qing was about the same as Zhu Qing. He went to the General Manor once during these two months and he finally knew why he could attack with a strength of 6,700 stars.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui asked Ji Yunlang, he went in a roundabout way and inquired if there was anyone who could attack with a strength of over 5,000 stars in the five continents. When Ji Yunlang heard this, he seemed to went deep into thought.</p>
 <p>What Qing Shui learned was that only those who had a strength that surpassed 10,000 stars could unleash another 10% of the strength that exceeded the 5,000 stars mark. For example, if a person had a strength of 11,000 stars, he would have exceeded by 6,000 stars and 10% of it would be 600 stars. This would mean that a person with a strength of 11,000 stars would be able to unleash a power of 5,600 stars.</p>
 <p>If one's strength was at 8,000 or 9,000 stars, then they would still only be able to unleash a strength of 5,000 stars!</p>
 <p>Only those who had reached a strength of 10,000 stars could make a slight exception to the world's rules. Qing Shui's strength was about 12,000 stars, which meant that he could display a strength of 5,700 stars. That additional 1,000 stars he had gotten must be from the effect of Area Dominance</p>
 <p>Although he knew that Area Dominance had a power of 1,000 stars, Qing Shui felt that it was very powerful and the Spirited Snake Turtle was very strong.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was assured after he understood this. Most people would leave the five continents when they exceeded 5,000 stars in strength. Of course, no one knew if there were anyone with a strength of 10,000 stars in hiding. Even if there were, Qing Shui wasn't worried. A person with a strength of 10,000 stars would only be able to unleash a power of 5,500 stars.</p>
 <p>The world's regulations wasn't absolute but it wouldn't be too far off. No one would be willing to be able to use only 10% of their actual prowess!</p>
