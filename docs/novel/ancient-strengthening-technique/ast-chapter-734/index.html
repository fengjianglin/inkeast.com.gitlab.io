 <p><strong>AST 734 - Massacre</strong></p>
 <p>When experts spar, victory would be decided in just an instant! That was a moment of life and death!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hadn't expect that the White Jade Jiao card would be so strong. To be able to have a 100% chance of reducing the opponent's speed as well as having a chance to freeze the opponent... No matter how long the opponent stayed in the frozen state, even a short amount of time was sufficient for Qing Shui to kill.</p>
 <p>In that short moment, one of the seven experts in the Zuoshi Clan had died while the strongest one still had a faint hint of ice blue aura on him. This was the effect of speed reduction.</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion!</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui killed that old man from earlier, he immediately used Instantaneous Diamond Evasion to dodge the combined attacks from three of the others. Now, his opponents had grouped up in threes. They had also realized that if they were split up, it would be easy for Qing Shui to launch a sudden attack and kill them.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw that his opponents had been scared out of their wits and had lost their spirit. This would also mean that it was going to be very hard for them to win now. After dodging the combined attack, Qing Shui reached out for two Frosted Iron Balls.</p>
 <p>These were not the ones he had tempered with poison. They were merely ordinary Frosted Iron Balls.</p>
 <p>Swoosh swoosh!</p>
 <p>The two Frosted Iron Balls intertwined in a spinning action as they were shot out toward the person in the middle of a three-man team. Their speed and aura were horrifying and the piercing sound seemed as if it was going to burst their eardrums.</p>
 <p>The slightly plump old man didn't dare to face it head on and could only dodge. He quickly dodged toward the right, resulting in there being two people on the right and one on the left.</p>
 <p>Break!</p>
 <p>The two spinning Frosted Iron Balls collided together, turning into many small pellets. The earlier collision further increased their speed as they shot out in all directions.</p>
 <p>The three old man instinctively waved their weapons about and retreated at great speed as they tried to fend off the pellets.</p>
 <p>This was what Qing Shui had been waiting for. Calling out to the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, they headed for the old man on the left who had been singled out with an Instantaneous Diamond Evasion.</p>
 <p>Earlier, with the ‘Twin Dragon Explosion’, the old man had been forced to retreat at least a hundred meters away. This gave Qing Shui a great opportunity to attack and he dashed over with two consecutive Instantaneous Diamond Evasions.</p>
 <p>Fiery Golden Eyes!</p>
 <p>Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui needed only but a second to activate Fiery Golden Eyes and Diamond Qi, but the Diamond Gigantic Elephant's Vajra Subdues Demons required a little more time which he couldn't afford.</p>
 <p>When the others sensed that the situation was not good and wanted to do something, it was already too late. Qing Shui instantly dashed up to the elderly and hit out a Shield attack with his Violet Gold Divine Shield.</p>
 <p>The elderly whose abilities had been weakened was not Qing Shui's match to begin with. Now in his weakened state, he was sent flying by Qing Shui and was in a horrible state.</p>
 <p>The Shield attack settled everything. After all, the gaps in their abilities were too huge. Under the State of One with Elephant, Qing Shui's abilities had reached over two stars and 2000 countries.</p>
 <p>Moreover, the opponent was only at one and a half stars to begin with. After he was weakened by 4000 countries, it ended up being an instant kill. The Diamond Gigantic Elephant's Instantaneous Diamond Evasion which had levelled up now allowed Qing Shui to be like a fish in the water. It wouldn't have been possible to do the same with the previous level of the Instantaneous Diamond Evasion which only allowed him to move a hundred meters each time.</p>
 <p>Two down!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the remaining five as he broke into a smile. To his opponents, this smile was like that of a devil's. Now, they were all looking at Qing Shui in shock.</p>
 <p>"How is it? Just because you're a reputable clan, you can bully whoever you wish?" Qing Shui stood on the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and said calmly to the five old men.</p>
 <p>"Today, you must die. Your whole family must die. I reckon that your family must be in a state of desperation right now." The old man looked at Qing Shui, hoping to make him worried and go crazy. Only then would they have a chance. Eldest brother and the others had left. Otherwise, there was no way that Qing Shui could be so arrogant.</p>
 <p>"I think you guys have not understand the situation yet. Let me wake you up!" Qing Shui said calmly, seeming to have an overwhelming aura.</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion!</p>
 <p>Fiery Golden Eyes!</p>
 <p>Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>Two of his opponents had been weakened by Qing Shui while the remaining three only had a strength of above one star but below one and a half stars. Those that he had weakened were the strongest of the few.</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>Prrrrttt!</p>
 <p>A pitch-black force shot out toward the opponents with a tearing aura. Everywhere it passed by, the space seemed as if it twitched. The pitch-black color was like a black hole.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>It exploded in the air. The five old men had retreated at great speed when the Diamond Gigantic Elephant had activated the Mighty Elephant Stomp. However, they had retreated together, not giving Qing Shui the chance to launch a surprise attack.</p>
 <p>Roar roar!</p>
 <p>At this moment, the two Black Ember Demonic Tigers charged toward Qing Shui, side by side. When they were less than a hundred meters away from Qing Shui, they suddenly spewed out two fireballs the size of a human head.</p>
 <p>The pitch-black flames were very similar to that of the Fire Bird's. As they shot out toward Qing Shui, the two Black Ember Demonic Tigers spewed out fireballs again.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's Violet Gold Divine Shield received the fireballs. At that moment, the five elderly charged toward Qing Shui together. They knew that they must work together and not get split up. Otherwise, they would be defeated one by one.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that he had made the wrong move. He should have dodged earlier. Now, his opponents had made used of the chance when he received the impact of the fireballs, especially the two from the second wave.</p>
 <p>The fireballs had cut off Qing Shui's retreat route and he could only meet the fireballs face on. And it was then when his opponents launched their attacks together.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used his Violet Gold Divine Shield to fight off two of them, then in that instant...</p>
 <p>Divinity Protection!</p>
 <p>At the crucial moment, he had to rely on the ultimate move from the Heavenly Palace. How could Qing Shui let this opportunity pass by? They stopped for a moment when the golden light appeared on Qing Shui's body.</p>
 <p>They fell into a short daze for a moment before the strongest elderly shouted, "Quick, retreat!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's Divinity Protection only took a short moment. When the others heard the command, they anxiously retreated, but there were still people who were too late. Qing Shui shot out two Coldsteel Needles which had been soaked in poison. In that moment, the dark glow, the close distance and Qing Shui's hidden weapons caught them unaware.</p>
 <p>Chi chi!</p>
 <p>One of the needles pierced through the person's brain while the other was stopped by a second person with his arm. The first person died on the spot while the other felt thankful that he had managed to keep his life.</p>
 <p>However, he had yet to feel happy when he felt very stuffy. Very quickly, his lungs and meridian channels started to shrink at an unbelievable speed and he died very quickly.</p>
 <p>Four down!</p>
 <p>Now, there was only three left. Qing Shui felt more relaxed now. However, he knew he must not let his guard down yet. It was because the moment he did, his opponents could deal him a deadly blow.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew how terrifying these coldsteel needles he had tempered in poison were. It was no wonder that the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect could bask in such glory previously. Most people would not be willing to offend a Poison Master for fear of not even being able to know how they had died.</p>
 <p>Alchemists save lives while Poison makers harm lives. These two kinds of people were the most terrifying and Qing Shui had not expected that he would be able to reach such mastery in both areas.</p>
 <p>Initially, Qing Shui had thought of using the Five Colored Poison to temper the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb, but it was a pity that there were insufficient poison and the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb was quite big. Therefore, he could only use the poison on the Frosted Iron Balls and Coldsteel Needles.</p>
 <p>The three left standing were the three who had stood in front at the start. They were also the strongest. However, Zuoshi Hu was now scared. He now finally felt the danger, the feeling that his life was threatened.</p>
 <p>It was only at this moment where he was faced with a life and death moment did he feel fear and terror. It was not just him alone, the other two old men beside him also currently had pale countenances.</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>The Mighty Elephant Stomp which had reached the great perfection stage was very terrifying. It was more than enough to deal with these people. However, this time around, the time it took to activate it was slightly longer so it was harder to deal them a heavy blow, unless they didn't move.</p>
 <p>The Demon Binding Ropes would lose all its effects before these three. Otherwise, it would be easier to kill them. Earlier, he had Divinity Protection. Otherwise, he would have been injured or even dealt a heavy blow.</p>
 <p>Meteor Smash!</p>
 <p>This time around, Qing Shui used a Frosted Iron Ball which had been soaked in poison. When the Diamond Gigantic Elephant had used its Mighty Elephant Stomp to push back the opponents, Qing Shui made his move.</p>
 <p>The gleaming pitch-black Frosted Iron Ball exuded an eerie black color as it shot out toward Zuoshi Hu who was standing in the middle. Its speed was quick as lightning.</p>
 <p>Since the attack came in a straight line, they could only choose to dodge either to the left or the right. They didn't dare to face the things Qing Shui shot out heads on. In the event that they were not able to dodge, they would choose to fend them off with their weapons.</p>
 <p>Earlier, Qing Shui had used hidden weapons to force back two of them and separated the three men team with an explosive attack before he dashed in for the kill. This time around, the three of them had great teamwork and they all dodged toward the left.</p>
 <p>However, they had no chance to take a breather when they realized that the Frosted Iron Ball had turned and was continuing to shoot out toward them. Its speed had not slowed down at all.</p>
 <p>This made them all astonished. However, they had no time to feel astonished. They changed their direction and retreated again.</p>
 <p>It was then when Qing Shui launched his attack!</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion!</p>
 <p>With an Instantaneous Diamond Evasion, he appeared behind the three of them. At that moment, the hidden weapon was dashing toward them again while they could feel that Qing Shui was not far behind them.</p>
 <p>Another two ordinary Frosted Iron Balls were shot out, cutting off their retreat route. Now, they were left with only one way out or to face him.</p>
 <p>However, if they were to face him, they would be attacked from both the front and back. Therefore, they would definitely choose the last route of retreat. However, how could Qing Shui possibly let them have their way?</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>With a Mighty Elephant Stomp, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant sealed up their last route, leaving them with no way out.</p>
 <p>Zuoshi Hu was breaking out in sweat. He had already been horrified when the other old man had died from poison earlier. This was why he wouldn't choose the direction with the Frosted Iron Balls. However, if they were to dash toward Qing Shui's direction, they would still be attacked by the Frosted Iron Balls if they failed to break through.</p>
 <p>There wasn't any time for them to think too much. In the end, Zuoshi Hu took the lead and led them toward the direction of the Mighty Elephant Stomp.</p>
 <p>“Illuminate！”</p>
 <p>Zuoshi Hu let out a loud bellow and the three of them became covered by a layer of soft glow as they entered the dark clouds of the Mighty Elephant Stomp.</p>
 <p>Boom boom...</p>
 <p>When they entered, the pitch-black Frosted Iron Balls entered as well.Loud sounds rang out and they appeared outside the "black clouds". However, Zuoshi Hu was spewing out fresh blood. His symptoms were exactly the same as the one who had been hit by the Coldsteel Needle earlier. He started to shrink...</p>
 <p>Five down!</p>
 <p>Only two were left in a sorry state!</p>
