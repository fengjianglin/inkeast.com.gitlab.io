 <p><strong>Chapter 365 Qing He broke through to Xiantian, Unparalleled Beauty Evildoer.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 365 - Qing He broke through to Xiantian, Unparalleled Beauty Evildoer</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui calmly walked out from the private room and slowly ascended the stone steps. Whether Qing He was able to break through to Xiantian would depend on his luck. Qing Shui looked forward to the result with much anticipation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A lot of people from Qing Clan were looking at Qing Shui with hopeful eyes as he emerged from the private room, especially Qing Jiang and old man Qing Luo, who came to Hundred Miles City just for this.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">No one knew how old man Qing Luo knew about his son possibly having the potential to enter Xiantian. He traveled all the way to Hundred Miles City with no rest when he knew about it. After all, entering the realm of Xiantian was his lifelong dream. He had tried to enter the realm of Xiantian his entire life, but was never successful. Since then, he tried to put all his hope onto his eldest and second sons. This was also the reason why he refused to let them consume the Crippling Divine Pill during that dreadful situation in the first place.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Old man’s biggest wish was for someone from the Qing Clan to break through to the realm and become a Xiantian martial warrior. Not just a Xiantian martial warrior, but a warrior that could master the Blue Lotus Art to the realm of the 9th Lotus Manifestation Stage.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a shame that Qing Clan’s current Blue Lotus Art was incomplete, so it would be very difficult to even reach Xiantian. That was why the old man’s wish was to break through the realm of Xiantian. As long as Xiantian was achieved, Hundred Miles City would become the strongest city to ever exist.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Each person’s ability will depend on their own horizon. Qing Luo’s horizon was the Hundred Miles City. Aiming for Hundred Miles City to rise above had always been his lifelong wish. Moreover, he had been the Peak of Martial Commander for years. He had been the paramount to a lot of people in the Hundred Miles City, but he was getting old. So whatever he did, he treated people with fairness and kindness, which was why even though Qing Clan did not have much influence, they never brought trouble to themselves. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">And when Qing Shui broke through to Xiantian afterwards, Qing Luo was happy for a while. He was overjoyed beyond words because relation by marriage was valued by the society, regardless whether it was the son or daughter, or son-in-law and the grandchildren from the third generation. As long as one man went to the top, all his friends and relations went there with him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Moreover, Qing Luo treated Qing Shui no different like his own grandchild. He grew up in the Qing Clan since he was young, and had been carrying the Qing surname with him wherever he went. He also had never seen anyone from Yan Clan. Everyone also knew that Qing Shui would soon seek the justice Yan Clan owed to the Qing Clan very soon.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Especially recently, Qing Yi was always in a trance. She would always stare blankly at girls who were at the same age as Shi QingZhuang. Qing Shui knew that his mother had been thinking of the nine-month- old girl who was forcefully taken away.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was more heartbroken about it because he knew that his big sister in the Yan City was still suffering. He didn’t have the heart to tell Qing Yi the truth. Qing Shui had been waiting for this moment, so there could be no effort wasted and abandoned. He must make preparations, because as he stepped into the Yan Clan, he will take everything back with him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought about leaving to Yan City by himself as soon as possible, but he felt that something was amiss. He had always trusted in his precise intuition, so he kept on waiting for the moment his heart would eventually calm down before leaving.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, how is it?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Luo laughed as he asked Qing Shui, he could tell that the old man was more nervous than he was. Qing Shui couldn’t help but feel speechless on the hopes parents instilled in their children all because they want them to come true. Hope will not change with time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Grandfather, don’t worry. It’s no problem even if we do not succeed this time. I have plans to make eldest uncle and second uncle Xiantian martial warriors until the end of the year.” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I can’t wait any longer. Your eldest uncle and second uncle are not young anymore. If they still can’t become Xiantian martial warriors in the next three or five years, I reckon there will be no hope after that. Even if they are able to become Xiantian martial warriors now, they won’t be able to walk down the martial path that far.” Although Qing Luo sounded a bit bleak, he was still happy nonetheless since it was just a wish. The conditions to become a Xiantian martial warrior were too severe.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Grandfather, don’t worry. Your grandchild will give a special present for you during the new years!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Right at that moment, there was a surge of powerful energy emanating towards Qing Shui. Of course, the surge of energy was nothing to him, but everyone was still looking at him in shock.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mingyue Gelou held in her laughter as she stood there silently. She understood clearly as she had experienced this kind of situation before!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Second uncle has barely succeeded entering Xiantian. No need to worry, he would need some time to stabilize his realm!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The others were excited as Qing Shui finished because they knew that the realm of Xiantian was one of the biggest pit-holes for all martial warriors. The surprise from entering the gate to the realm of Xiantian was as good as the surprise from breaking through to the Martial King.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Haha, our Qing Clan finally has another Xiantian martial warrior…...” Qing Luo’s eyes were filled with tears. Those were the tears of surprise.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Yi was filled with unspeakable satisfaction as she looked at her own son. Because of her actions long time ago, she allowed the Yan Clan to come to the Qing Village. Even though it had been a long time since, it was still unbearable when she was being forced to a certain level.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although no one mentioned anything, everyone understood her feelings. Qing Yi had been brooding over this matter for a long time. No matter what other people said, it was because of her that her father was held at knifepoint</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Her father had been putting up with his good-for-nothing daughter’s hot-tempered attitude for a long time. She had been wanting to go to Yan Clan more than anyone else. For her, who would do anything for her parents, she wouldn’t want to let her father worry until the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But she was helpless, because Yan Clan dominated the entire country. In these twenty years, she had not heard once from the man she loved. The vows and pledges of eternal love were not able to withstand the test of unforgettable years. Qing Yi had never thought of remarriage in these twenty years because of Qing Shui, and because she hoped that they will meet again one day. And lastly, because of her daughter whom she will never stop thinking about.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But what she didn’t know was that the man she had been waiting for all these years had already died!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Her son’s excellence was enough to break the shackles in everyone’s hearts in the Qing Clan. Moreover, Qing Shui would soon end it all as he would be going for Yan Clan soon.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Yi cried as she thought about it. She felt sad but relieved!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The third generation of the Qing Clan were all bursting with energy when they saw Qing He break through Xiantian. The hot-blooded boy took it as a strength for improvement, but the young one did not seek to prevail over others. She was not the type to want to dominate the martial peak in the world of nine continents, because she dreamt of riding high-leveled beasts and travel across the world one day.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The news of Qing He’s breakthrough to Xiantian spread throughout Hundred Miles City, as if he had grown a pair of wings. However, Qing Shui’s rise of power had already given Qing Clan the new title of the clan with the most potential in the Hundred Miles City.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">And there was also the engagement with the Shi Clan, as well as his relation to the Xiantian martial warrior from Yu Clan. There was also news about the realm of Xiantian beauty who belonged to Qing Shui and lived behind the curtains of Night Fragrance Court.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Clan became the strongest clan in Hundred Miles City when Qing Shui defeated the Xiantian martial warrior from the Situ Clan, and when Skysword Sect came in to resolve the crisis in Qing Clan and Heavenly River City.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">During the time when Qing Shui was away from Qing Clan, some people almost went mad when Mingyue Gelou broke through to Xiantian. Almost every large family now knew about Mingyue Gelou’s past and how hard it was to approache her in the beginning. However, no one lent her a hand. Perhaps they were helpless as well.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ever since this incident, a lot of people were beginning to understand what it meant to never judge a book by its cover. And at the same time, they learnt that good-heartedness would always be rewarded!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Some people were starting to realize the mysterious principles in Qing He’s breakthrough to Xiantian. Even though there was not much Xiantian in the Hundred Miles City, there were many Peak of Houtian out there just like Qing He. There were also many Peak of Xiantian like Qing Luo, but it was almost impossible for many to try and break through to Xiantian.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was one Peak of Xiantian martial warrior amongst the two martial experts Situ Clan recently hired, but the Peak of Xiantian warrior that Hundred Miles City looked up to was unfortunately wiped away by Qing Shui with just one move…..</p>
  <p dir="ltr">What kind of power did Qing Shui possess? How old was Qing Shui this year? No one knew the answers to these questions. He was worthy of the title the evildoer of the Qing Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He would always be the most striking evildoer wherever he went!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ever since Qing He broke through to Xiantian, the doors to the Qing Clan never stopped opening. Under the compliance of Qing Shui, the Qing Clan would have to accept valuable gifts from people, but they could directly refuse if the gifts were deemed inappropriate and unworthy. People were free to come in as they pleased, since they were incapable of doing any harm to anyone, but if they wished to gain benefits from the Qing Clan, that would to depend on their mood.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As Qing Shui walked down the large street in the Hundred Miles City, he gained the attention from people of different genders and ages. Most of them gazed at Qing Shui with envy in their eyes, and nearly none were filled with jealousy because they were incapable of it anymore.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled bitterly at the lady looking at him from a far end!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Xiang Bao from Xiang Clan!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She was the delicate girl who would always bump into Qing Shui a couple of times, the lolita who once confessed that she liked Qing Shui!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After three years of not seeing each other, Xiang Bao turned twenty years old, which was way younger than Qing Shui. She had grown tall and slender, and her figure was well-stacked. She was not as pretty as Canghai Ming-yue, not as extraordinary as Yiye Jian-ge, not as charming as Huoyun Liu-li, and not as cold as Shi Qingzhuang…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, she had her own youthful and beautiful girl-next-door temperament. It was a shame that Qing Shui had a mental age of a thirty-year-old man, because he was still uninterested in her no matter how hard he tried. Of course, he meant the ‘dating’ sort of interest.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just like Qing Bei, although Qing Shui was her elder brother, he still cared for her like an uncle would……..</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You are back!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt a bit like a stranger from the awkwardness. Time was a merciless guillotine. It can cut away lost things easily, including the never-ending affection. They can be reduced to fragments, until they are lost in the long river of history.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mm, you are well I suppose!” Qing Shui felt like he was too stiff. He could even feel his own insincerity from his words!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You don’t have to worry about me pestering you, I know now that I can never match up to you!” Xiang Bao smiled as she said that. Qing Shui knew that she would definitely be the girl-next-door from her delicate smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui realized that he disliked the type of girls like Xiang Bao, as he prefered enchanting women like Huoyun Liu-li, Qing Hanye, and Gongsun Jianwu. Even the ice-cold Shi QingZhuang was also included in that category.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui liked mature women. She must at least show her independent maturity in her attitude. For example, Wenren Wushuang and Shi QingZhuang, although they weren’t that old, their attitude had misled Qing Shui’s perception of their real age. Also, there was the other mature Zhu Qing. Until now, Qing Shui still didn’t know her age, but he could still sense her strength regardless. Nevertheless, Qing Shui could sense that she wasn’t young, but she wasn’t that old either. She was what he considered as a mature little woman.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The relationship between a man and a woman doesn’t concern whether they can match each other or not. It concerns whether there is love or nothing at all.” Qing Shui disliked marriages between families of equal social ranks, but he still had to believe that there was a certain level of effectiveness with those types of marriages.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After all, there were times when marriage between a man and a woman was not as simple as being together with each other, because there were a lot of customs involved in a marriage. Even if two people had finally gotten together, after a long period of time, the passion in the beginning of the relationship would slowly fizzle out. In this kind of situation, other opinions and ideas about their relationship would emerge. But if it was a marriage between families of equal social ranks, one would think twice about the consequences of leaving the relationship.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Also, a marriage between families of equal social ranks can greatly boost the status of both parties, since relation by marriage was highly valued across the world. Who didn’t want their sons or daughters to find a good and powerful family? There are a lot of benefits from this kind of marriage, like the vast connections to other people!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui had always been against marriage between families of equal social rank. All he wanted was a simple love without other factors mixing with it. but he was always dubious about it because sometimes it was difficult to shake. It was too difficult to not mix in other factors, perhaps even to the point of impossible.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was vulgar to like some based on their looks, and it was snobbish to like someone for how strong they looked or how powerful their strength was. Only now did Qing Shui realize that love was actually a simple thing. Liking a woman based on her beauty was an excellent example. All men loved beautiful things, there was no need to make things complicated.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even now, Qing Shui still felt that love was actually a type of feeling. It was a delicate sensation that happened between man and woman!</p>

Moreover, he had been the Peak of Martial Commander for years. He had been the paramount to a lot of people in the Hundred Miles City, but he was getting old. So whatever he did, he treated people with fairness and kindness, which was why even though Qing Clan did not have much influence, they never brought trouble to themselves. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">And when Qing Shui broke through to Xiantian afterwards, Qing Luo was happy for a while. He was overjoyed beyond words because relation by marriage was valued by the society, regardless whether it was the son or daughter, or son-in-law and the grandchildren from the third generation. As long as one man went to the top, all his friends and relations went there with him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Moreover, Qing Luo treated Qing Shui no different like his own grandchild. He grew up in the Qing Clan since he was young, and had been carrying the Qing surname with him wherever he went. He also had never seen anyone from Yan Clan. Everyone also knew that Qing Shui would soon seek the justice Yan Clan owed to the Qing Clan very soon.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Especially recently, Qing Yi was always in a trance. She would always stare blankly at girls who were at the same age as Shi QingZhuang. Qing Shui knew that his mother had been thinking of the nine-month- old girl who was forcefully taken away.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was more heartbroken about it because he knew that his big sister in the Yan City was still suffering. He didn’t have the heart to tell Qing Yi the truth. Qing Shui had been waiting for this moment, so there could be no effort wasted and abandoned. He must make preparations, because as he stepped into the Yan Clan, he will take everything back with him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought about leaving to Yan City by himself as soon as possible, but he felt that something was amiss. He had always trusted in his precise intuition, so he kept on waiting for the moment his heart would eventually calm down before leaving.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, how is it?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Luo laughed as he asked Qing Shui, he could tell that the old man was more nervous than he was. Qing Shui couldn’t help but feel speechless on the hopes parents instilled in their children all because they want them to come true. Hope will not change with time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Grandfather, don’t worry. It’s no problem even if we do not succeed this time. I have plans to make eldest uncle and second uncle Xiantian martial warriors until the end of the year.” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I can’t wait any longer. Your eldest uncle and second uncle are not young anymore. If they still can’t become Xiantian martial warriors in the next three or five years, I reckon there will be no hope after that. Even if they are able to become Xiantian martial warriors now, they won’t be able to walk down the martial path that far.” Although Qing Luo sounded a bit bleak, he was still happy nonetheless since it was just a wish. The conditions to become a Xiantian martial warrior were too severe.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Grandfather, don’t worry. Your grandchild will give a special present for you during the new years!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Right at that moment, there was a surge of powerful energy emanating towards Qing Shui. Of course, the surge of energy was nothing to him, but everyone was still looking at him in shock.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mingyue Gelou held in her laughter as she stood there silently. She understood clearly as she had experienced this kind of situation before!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Second uncle has barely succeeded entering Xiantian. No need to worry, he would need some time to stabilize his realm!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The others were excited as Qing Shui finished because they knew that the realm of Xiantian was one of the biggest pit-holes for all martial warriors. The surprise from entering the gate to the realm of Xiantian was as good as the surprise from breaking through to the Martial King.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Haha, our Qing Clan finally has another Xiantian martial warrior…...” Qing Luo’s eyes were filled with tears. Those were the tears of surprise.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Yi was filled with unspeakable satisfaction as she looked at her own son. Because of her actions long time ago, she allowed the Yan Clan to come to the Qing Village. Even though it had been a long time since, it was still unbearable when she was being forced to a certain level.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although no one mentioned anything, everyone understood her feelings. Qing Yi had been brooding over this matter for a long time. No matter what other people said, it was because of her that her father was held at knifepoint</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Her father had been putting up with his good-for-nothing daughter’s hot-tempered attitude for a long time. She had been wanting to go to Yan Clan more than anyone else. For her, who would do anything for her parents, she wouldn’t want to let her father worry until the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But she was helpless, because Yan Clan dominated the entire country. In these twenty years, she had not heard once from the man she loved. The vows and pledges of eternal love were not able to withstand the test of unforgettable years. Qing Yi had never thought of remarriage in these twenty years because of Qing Shui, and because she hoped that they will meet again one day. And lastly, because of her daughter whom she will never stop thinking about.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But what she didn’t know was that the man she had been waiting for all these years had already died!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Her son’s excellence was enough to break the shackles in everyone’s hearts in the Qing Clan. Moreover, Qing Shui would soon end it all as he would be going for Yan Clan soon.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Yi cried as she thought about it. She felt sad but relieved!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The third generation of the Qing Clan were all bursting with energy when they saw Qing He break through Xiantian. The hot-blooded boy took it as a strength for improvement, but the young one did not seek to prevail over others. She was not the type to want to dominate the martial peak in the world of nine continents, because she dreamt of riding high-leveled beasts and travel across the world one day.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The news of Qing He’s breakthrough to Xiantian spread throughout Hundred Miles City, as if he had grown a pair of wings. However, Qing Shui’s rise of power had already given Qing Clan the new title of the clan with the most potential in the Hundred Miles City.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">And there was also the engagement with the Shi Clan, as well as his relation to the Xiantian martial warrior from Yu Clan. There was also news about the realm of Xiantian beauty who belonged to Qing Shui and lived behind the curtains of Night Fragrance Court.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Clan became the strongest clan in Hundred Miles City when Qing Shui defeated the Xiantian martial warrior from the Situ Clan, and when Skysword Sect came in to resolve the crisis in Qing Clan and Heavenly River City.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">During the time when Qing Shui was away from Qing Clan, some people almost went mad when Mingyue Gelou broke through to Xiantian. Almost every large family now knew about Mingyue Gelou’s past and how hard it was to approache her in the beginning. However, no one lent her a hand. Perhaps they were helpless as well.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ever since this incident, a lot of people were beginning to understand what it meant to never judge a book by its cover. And at the same time, they learnt that good-heartedness would always be rewarded!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Some people were starting to realize the mysterious principles in Qing He’s breakthrough to Xiantian. Even though there was not much Xiantian in the Hundred Miles City, there were many Peak of Houtian out there just like Qing He. There were also many Peak of Xiantian like Qing Luo, but it was almost impossible for many to try and break through to Xiantian.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was one Peak of Xiantian martial warrior amongst the two martial experts Situ Clan recently hired, but the Peak of Xiantian warrior that Hundred Miles City looked up to was unfortunately wiped away by Qing Shui with just one move…..</p>
 <p dir="ltr">What kind of power did Qing Shui possess? How old was Qing Shui this year? No one knew the answers to these questions. He was worthy of the title the evildoer of the Qing Clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He would always be the most striking evildoer wherever he went!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ever since Qing He broke through to Xiantian, the doors to the Qing Clan never stopped opening. Under the compliance of Qing Shui, the Qing Clan would have to accept valuable gifts from people, but they could directly refuse if the gifts were deemed inappropriate and unworthy. People were free to come in as they pleased, since they were incapable of doing any harm to anyone, but if they wished to gain benefits from the Qing Clan, that would to depend on their mood.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As Qing Shui walked down the large street in the Hundred Miles City, he gained the attention from people of different genders and ages. Most of them gazed at Qing Shui with envy in their eyes, and nearly none were filled with jealousy because they were incapable of it anymore.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled bitterly at the lady looking at him from a far end!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Xiang Bao from Xiang Clan!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She was the delicate girl who would always bump into Qing Shui a couple of times, the lolita who once confessed that she liked Qing Shui!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After three years of not seeing each other, Xiang Bao turned twenty years old, which was way younger than Qing Shui. She had grown tall and slender, and her figure was well-stacked. She was not as pretty as Canghai Ming-yue, not as extraordinary as Yiye Jian-ge, not as charming as Huoyun Liu-li, and not as cold as Shi Qingzhuang…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, she had her own youthful and beautiful girl-next-door temperament. It was a shame that Qing Shui had a mental age of a thirty-year-old man, because he was still uninterested in her no matter how hard he tried. Of course, he meant the ‘dating’ sort of interest.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just like Qing Bei, although Qing Shui was her elder brother, he still cared for her like an uncle would……..</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You are back!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt a bit like a stranger from the awkwardness. Time was a merciless guillotine. It can cut away lost things easily, including the never-ending affection. They can be reduced to fragments, until they are lost in the long river of history.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mm, you are well I suppose!” Qing Shui felt like he was too stiff. He could even feel his own insincerity from his words!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You don’t have to worry about me pestering you, I know now that I can never match up to you!” Xiang Bao smiled as she said that. Qing Shui knew that she would definitely be the girl-next-door from her delicate smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui realized that he disliked the type of girls like Xiang Bao, as he prefered enchanting women like Huoyun Liu-li, Qing Hanye, and Gongsun Jianwu. Even the ice-cold Shi QingZhuang was also included in that category.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui liked mature women. She must at least show her independent maturity in her attitude. For example, Wenren Wushuang and Shi QingZhuang, although they weren’t that old, their attitude had misled Qing Shui’s perception of their real age. Also, there was the other mature Zhu Qing. Until now, Qing Shui still didn’t know her age, but he could still sense her strength regardless. Nevertheless, Qing Shui could sense that she wasn’t young, but she wasn’t that old either. She was what he considered as a mature little woman.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The relationship between a man and a woman doesn’t concern whether they can match each other or not. It concerns whether there is love or nothing at all.” Qing Shui disliked marriages between families of equal social ranks, but he still had to believe that there was a certain level of effectiveness with those types of marriages.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After all, there were times when marriage between a man and a woman was not as simple as being together with each other, because there were a lot of customs involved in a marriage. Even if two people had finally gotten together, after a long period of time, the passion in the beginning of the relationship would slowly fizzle out. In this kind of situation, other opinions and ideas about their relationship would emerge. But if it was a marriage between families of equal social ranks, one would think twice about the consequences of leaving the relationship.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Also, a marriage between families of equal social ranks can greatly boost the status of both parties, since relation by marriage was highly valued across the world. Who didn’t want their sons or daughters to find a good and powerful family? There are a lot of benefits from this kind of marriage, like the vast connections to other people!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui had always been against marriage between families of equal social rank. All he wanted was a simple love without other factors mixing with it. but he was always dubious about it because sometimes it was difficult to shake. It was too difficult to not mix in other factors, perhaps even to the point of impossible.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was vulgar to like some based on their looks, and it was snobbish to like someone for how strong they looked or how powerful their strength was. Only now did Qing Shui realize that love was actually a simple thing. Liking a woman based on her beauty was an excellent example. All men loved beautiful things, there was no need to make things complicated.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even now, Qing Shui still felt that love was actually a type of feeling. It was a delicate sensation that happened between man and woman!</p>
