 <p><strong>AST 1275 - Ice Silkworm, Ice Silkworm’s silk, Rapid, Meeting the Sect Lord of Lotus Sect</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui was really curious. He used to treat the Crimson Pellet of the Nine-headed Moon Wolf’s Core like his own treasure. That was a core, this on the other hand, was blood. Qing Shui once again gazed towards the few drops of Divine Beast’s Blood and noticed that he wasn’t being really attentive when he observed it just now.</p>
 <p>It was the Blood Essence of Divine Beasts!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. For some unknown reason, he missed out on the crucial word ‘essence’ previously. By missing that particular word, it would make the value of the object drop drastically. Take humans for example, within their bodies, there was a lot of blood but Blood Essence on the other hand, there was very little of it. Losing even a single drop of it would result in a huge loss to the human. That was what made it unique.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t actually let his demonic beasts feed on it right away. He first put it down. And then, he proceeded to take out the last porcelain bottle. Within it, there was a pair of Ice Silkworm eggs.</p>
 <p>Ice Silkworm was a unique thing. It was categorized as a demonic beast. In addition to that, it could spit out ice silk. This was the best material to make soft armor, internal armor, undergarments as well as outer clothing. It’s said to be immune to knives and swords and also totally resistant to fire and water. Furthermore, it feels unusually comfortable when worn. However, the ice silk was too rare.</p>
 <p>However, the Ice Silkworm was also a demonic beast. Furthermore, it’s said to be a powerful one. Of course, Qing Shui had never seen an actual one himself. He learned all of this from other people’s mouths and from some history books. Don’t underestimate the eggs of Ice Silkworms just because they were the size of a thumb, these small little things was said to be able to grow up to a hundred meters or even bigger if the conditions were right.</p>
 <p>If it was an Ice Silkworm which reached the size of a hundred meters, it would possess considerably terrifying strength. The Ice Silkworm was also an ancient mutated species. Unfortunately, the conditions to rear it were very harsh. He had never heard of anyone who was able to grow these small Ice Silkworms to such a huge size. Normally, only those that were in the wild had the possibility of doing so. Despite this, the chance for it to achieve it was still very small.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out the two Ice Silkworm Eggs. There was a trace of faint chilliness on his hand. It was a kind and gentle feeling. Suddenly, he felt something really faint between him and the eggs. It was a really unusual feeling. After that, Qing Shui felt that the Central Palace Blood Essence Pool had started stirring up a little.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned for a moment. A golden light shone on both of his hands. The next thing which happened was that the two Ice Silkworm Eggs disappeared. He quickly looked into the Blood Essence Pool with his Inner Sight. As he peeped on it, he froze in shock. He noticed that a pair of sky-blue colored objects the size of cereal had appeared within the pool.</p>
 <p>This was the Ice Silkworm. A newborn Ice Silkworm was this small!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui noticed that the Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm seemed to be really excited. He quickly used his consciousness to tell it that it wasn’t edible. He was really scared that it would end up being eaten by the Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm.</p>
 <p>The current Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm was still really small. It was less than one inch long and had its entire body covered in a gold color. The two tiny dragon horns on its head looked very impressive and both of its eyes the size of rice were also shining brightly. Despite its tiny body, it’s streamlined shape gave off the sensation that it was very powerful.</p>
 <p>Its dragon’s horns had already grown out completely. Qing Shui felt that the current Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm was even more terrifying. It was just like a mini golden dragon, filled with spiritual nature.</p>
 <p>As it sensed Qing Shui’s thought, the tiny thing immediately sank itself into the Blood Essence Pool. For now, Qing Shui didn’t know how powerful or how much destructive power the Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm possessed. In any case, he knew that it was really strong. For now, it could still become one of his trump cards.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui remembered the Blood Essence of the Divine Beasts. He came up with a thought which scared himself. He wanted to add a drop of Divine Beast’s Blood Essence into the Central Palace Blood Essence Pool. But very quickly, he rejected his idea.</p>
 <p>He felt that this idea was too scary. That was the blood essence of Divine Beasts. He was scared that he wouldn’t be able to withstand it. He kept having the feeling that this idea was really terrifying. It was just that he couldn’t add in the Divine Beast’s Blood Essence but Qing Shui noticed that he didn’t actually add the Violet Golden Blood Droplets from his Violet Golden Bloodline into the Blood Essence Pool.</p>
 <p>He carried out the task as soon as he thought about it and immediately guided one drop of the Violet Golden Blood into the Central Palace Blood Essence Pool.</p>
 <p>A drop of Violet Golden Blood entered the Blood Essence Pool. It caused Qing Shui to realize that the Blood Essence Pool looked like it had started boiling. That was a kind of richness and mightiness of life force. It was a kind of sensation.</p>
 <p>After observing for a while and realizing that there wasn’t too much of a situation, Qing Shui released himself from the Inner Sight. He never thought that the clumsy Ice Silkworms would eventually also end up within the Blood Essence Pool. It was just that he didn’t know until when its body could grow. Could it adjust the size of its body as it liked? If it couldn’t, Qing Shui reckoned that it would have to leave the Blood Essence Pool very soon.</p>
 <p>Not long after Qing Shui went out, a person came.</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled as he welcomed him to the living room, “Brother, how have you been?”</p>
 <p>Tian Jiange revealed a bitter smile as he looked at Qing Shui, “Little brother, will it be ok if you show mercy to the Tian Clan?”</p>
 <p>“Brother, you are too soft-hearted. If you keep going on like this, one day, it will really cost you dearly. Everyone has to take responsibility of the mistakes which they made. What do you think?”</p>
 <p>“I know, can you let them be ordinary people just like Fu Clan? I am aware that you are being put in a difficult position.” Tian Jiange knew about the things which Tian Clan had done to Qing Shui before. Even if the current Qing Shui was to wash the entire Tian Clan with blood, people would just find it perfectly normal.</p>
 <p>Since Tian Jiange had made such a request, Qing Shui would naturally agree to it. However, quite a lot of them crippled over 50% of their cultivation. This was something which Tian Jiange suggested.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>For the following days, not only Tian Clan, the remaining clans had also come to look for Qing Shui with the exception of only one clan. Eventually, Qing Shui ended up killing more than half of the people within the clan involved in the assassination. It was immediately considered to have been diminished.</p>
 <p>The world of warriors was like this. Showing kindness to others was equivalent to being cruel to yourself. It was just as stated within the saying that has been passed down since a long time ago, you can’t always do as you like, one has to compromise in this world.</p>
 <p>At a blink of an eye, yet another few days passed. Qing Shui was aware that the Heaven Secrets Courtyard supported his actions. Or else, they would have stopped him. Now, the Breezing Wind Veranda had already turned out to be a unique existence within the Heaven Secrets Academy.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess had gone into seclusion. This time, her seclusion was aided by Heaven Secrets Courtyard. By the time she came out, her strength would once again take yet another huge leap. As for to what extent it would go up to, this would depend on her innate skills and determination.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui on the other hand, was getting ready to head to Lotus Sect with Di Chen.</p>
 <p>Qing Sha, Yan Jinyu and Seventh Princess were still here. However, Qing Shui has already asked the old men to help him look after them.</p>
 <p>At the moment when they were about to separate from each other, Qing Sha, like usual, felt reluctant to say goodbye to Qing Shui. Qing Shui once again reassured her by promising her that he would come back very quickly to see her to let her cultivate in peace.</p>
 <p>On their journey back to Lotus Sect this time, Di Chen brought Qing Shui out of helplessness. Originally, she wanted to talk to the Sect Lord of Lotus Sect herself. But naturally, Qing Shui would disapprove of it. If by accident, Di Chen got captivated, he would need to go to a lot of trouble to get her back.</p>
 <p>The location of Lotus Sect was near Desolate Mountains Regions. It’s just that the scenery of the place looked unusually good. It was located at a secluded spot. If it wasn’t for Di Chen leading him, he reckoned that he really would have been unable to find this place.</p>
 <p>Looking into the distance from the sky, this was a place with enormous mountain valleys. It was shaped like a lotus. The Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth were gathered together high up in the air. Bamboo houses could be seen standing tall and close together here. There was a type of freshness and pleasantness to it’s scenery which couldn’t be described in words.</p>
 <p>“Let’s wait here. Very quickly, there will be people heading here. By then, I will let them notify the Sect Lord.” Di Chen stopped and told Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Alright!” Qing Shui said it indifferently.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, two young girls were already flying towards them, “Greetings, Martial Sister!”</p>
 <p>Within Lotus Sect, the Holy Maiden was also considered as a Chief Disciple. Hence, people from the same clan as her would address her as their martial sister.</p>
 <p>“Help me pass a message to the Sect Lord. Just tell her that there is something which I need to report to her about but I am currently not in a convenient situation to see her.” Di Chen said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Alright, I will do it right away!” The two young girls immediately flew away.</p>
 <p>“Are you feeling nervous?” Qing Shui looked at Di Chen and smiled.</p>
 <p>“A bit. She treats me really well. I don’t feel good making her sad,” Di Chen said helplessly.</p>
 <p>“This place is a female temple. Patroness, you have yet to completely set your heart on the mundane. You are still not able to depart from the world of mortals.”</p>
 <p>“Be more serious, my master is going to be here anytime soon,” Di Chen said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, a woman could already be seen appearing in the distance. She was a middle-aged woman who looked a bit old. Half of her hair had already turned white. There were a few wrinkles on her face. However, from her current appearance, one could tell that she used to also be an extreme beauty. She didn’t reveal any smile on her face. Upon seeing Qing Shui and Di Chen, she had been fixing her gaze at Qing Shui himself.</p>
 <p>“Are you planning to cripple Chen`Er’s cultivation?”</p>
 <p>The old lady stared directly at Qing Shui as soon as she arrived in front of them and asked him the question.</p>
 <p>“It’s not that I am planning to cripple her cultivation, it’s Lotus Sect that’s planning to steal away my woman.” Qing Shui was not in the least afraid of the old lady.</p>
 <p>A faint aura could be felt fluctuating vigorously around the old lady’s body. After that, she moved her sight to Di Chen, “You are the Holy Maiden of Lotus Sect. You know what you’re supposed to do. You can do whatever you like. But the only thing which I forbid you from touching are things that have to do with relationships. If you ever commit to that, your entire life will be done for.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t use your own experience as teaching materials. Don’t deny every single man around the world just because you got hurt by one of them. If everyone had been like you, humans would have died out on the entire continent,” Qing Shui said coldly.</p>
 <p>The old lady’s body trembled. She shot Qing Shui a glare like a knife. As soon as she moved her body, the gold colored sword in her hand immediately landed on Qing Shui’s shoulder.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s body immediately got blown backwards. He spurted out a mouthful of fresh blood.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui!” Di Chen quickly ran towards Qing Shui and held him.</p>
 <p>“Why didn’t you dodge it?” Di Chen asked.</p>
 <p>At the moment when the old lady saw Di Chen’s expression, the killing intent within her eyes got even stronger.</p>
 <p>“She is your master. In any case, she is considered to have helped you ever since you came here. I am willing to take this hit. This way, I will feel at ease while taking you away,” Qing Shui said gently.</p>
 <p>Now, his body physique was extremely outstanding. From outsider’s perspective, they would think that his bones would have been crushed completely upon receiving this blow. But only Qing Shui knew there was merely a crack. Furthermore, it would heal up very quickly.</p>
 <p>“Don’t compare the disciples of Lotus Sect to the prostitutes in the vulgar world. They’re not fit to be compared against.” The cold voice of the old woman came through. The things which Qing Shui said previously had really stirred her up emotionally.</p>
 <p>“Then what are you? Are you a prostitute?” Qing Shui asked while rubbing off the blood at the corner of his mouth.</p>
 <p>“You impudent child!”</p>
 <p>“Haha, what right do you have to strip off the rights of your disciples to enjoy the affections between men and women. Could it be that you thought you could do it just because of your strength? Don’t you think that you’re playing the bully in this case?” Qing Shui smiled while looking at the old lady.</p>
 <p>“You are deluding people with lies. I cannot bear to even take your words into my ears.”</p>
 <p>“Then why would you get cheated on back then……”</p>
 <p>“You, shut the hell up!”</p>
 <p>The old woman shouted loudly. After that, she charged towards Qing Shui. Qing Shui gently pushed back Di Chen into a distance with his palm and activated the Nine Palace Steps.</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation!</p>
 <p>Originally, whenever Qing Shui unleashed his Nine Palace Steps, his strength would increase significantly. Now, with the addition Formation Eye Stone, Qing Shui felt all the more like a tiger that had grown wings. As for the damage which he withstood from before, it was diverted away from the vital parts of his body with Qing Shui’s Minute Subtlety. Under allowed conditions, the damage he received was lowered down to its minimum.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui very easily avoided the attacks of the old woman.</p>
 <p>This made the old woman feel really shocked. Previously, the weakening in strength she received from him already made her feel extremely surprised. Considering that he was able to weaken people who had cultivated up to this grade, he should possess quite a decent cultivation himself. But he was so young…...</p>
 <p>“How about this, let's come to an agreement with each other.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p>
 <p>Just like this, Qing Shui would constantly change between Taichi Fist, Back Connecting Fist, Tiger Form, Crane Form, Bear Steps while fighting against the old woman. He was unpredictable but at the same time also extremely strong and violent.</p>
