 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Third Grand Master Liu trembled as he took over the longsword which he became well-known for. Deep down, he felt that his heart had been crushed. The way of thinking which he used to have throughout his entire life had been completely destroyed. If Qing Shui really had taken out the formidable support behind him, Third Grandmaster Liu would have completely surrendered himself to him. He wouldn’t really feel anything. This was how the World of the Nine Continents worked. Sometimes, if a person was still able to surrender himself, that would mean that the situation was still acceptable and had yet to develop to the point of no turning back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Third Grandmaster Liu had also thought about a day when the Liu Clan would surrender itself. However, he never expected for such a situation to happen today. In the past, even though he had had a feeling that monster-like characters existed, he used to think that he would never get to meet them in his entire life. However, the things which happened today proved him wrong. He was very upset about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you for holding back. Can I please leave now?” Third Grandmaster Liu seemed a bit distracted when he was saying it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course. Feel free to do so.” Qing Shui went back after he finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Third Grandmaster Liu took Third Young Master Liu’s body and left with the others. Things continued to go on like normal. However, the atmosphere around here had become a lot heavier. It no longer felt as relaxed as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, a few people had also come to try to know Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the majority of people didn’t do it. This was a very risky act. If the Liu Clan was to lay their hands on this young man, establishing a relationship with Qing Shui now would mean offending the Liu Clan. Thus, it was quite risky to be doing this now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only was it risky, they were even in danger of losing their heads. After all, the amount of strength which Qing Shui unleashed was no ordinary strength. Qing Shui could have totally ignored these people. To be frank, Qing Shui also never counted on using situations like this to make his name. Qing Shui sent away the people who came to establish relationships with him, He showed no intention on wanting to know them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Xixuan felt very calm and happy at the same time. She knew how frightening Qing Shui’s strength was. She had also developed a sort of dependency on Qing Shui. Yu Dinghe was a bit nervous. But with how things were at the moment, he might have run out of options. He had no choice but to put his faith on this young man. Yu Clan had decided to have a deep-rooted relationship with this young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They used the unique ingredients from Qing Shui. It was a restaurant, and drinking wine would require food as well. In fact, food was even more important than wine alone. Among the people who came this time, even though none of them were people from the top clans, many who came were still people with considerable high status and reputations. Thus, they could still help the restaurant to spread its name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people who came this time were able to satisfy their taste buds. The wines tasted nice. They were all from Qing Shui’s collections in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. At the moment, the space within the realm was too big. Qing Shui was able to put a lot of wines in it. He had collected way too many of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When people started eating, the fragrance from the food spread out far into the distance and attracted a lot of people coming here. Even the outside of the restaurant was surrounded fully by people. They knew that the restaurant started its business and they might have a chance to eat and drink for free. In a while, the entire restaurant became crowded with people. However, there were a few tables near the entrance. There were dishes and wine on each of the tables for people to taste for free.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very soon, people already formed a long queue outside the restaurant. They regretted not coming here earlier. Otherwise, they would have been able to fill their stomach today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t go to cook the food. Whoever cooked the food, it would be the same as long as they had the ingredients. He wasn’t worried that people would learn or research on it. It was impossible for them to get the ingredients. In the World of the Nine Continents, famous restaurants tended to have unique ingredients and recipes of their own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment, she was thinking about the things concerning the Liu Clan. She didn’t know if the Liu Clan would come. If they did turn up, in what way would they show themselves? However, Qing Shui knew that the Liu Clan would definitely show up, they might even show up today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time went on little by little. The atmosphere of the restaurant when it opened up was great and as a result, it washed away the pressure felt from before, when the Third Young Master Liu was killed. This was precisely how the World of the Nine Continents which focused primarily on warriors worked. A person just died before, but yet it seemed like nothing happened. The restaurant opened like usual, people were still drinking wine. If it had been his previous world, Qing Shui would have been locked up right away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the way until when half of the afternoon passed, did a group of people come to the restaurant. The people of the Liu Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">About tens of people came. Each and every one of them were expert warriors. The person leading the group was an elderly man. From the way he seemed, he looked quite old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone’s facial expression looked very unsightly. They looked so gloomy that it seemed as if they were about to sweat. They were all amazed by how popular the restaurant had gotten. At the same time, they could also be seen drooling with saliva when they saw the hot dishes that were being served. However, they didn’t come here to enjoy a meal. The old man leading the group didn’t say anything much, but the middle-aged man behind him yelled to the surroundings, “Liu Clan is trying to get their things sorted. If everyone has nothing to do, please disperse yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The long line of people, who were queuing up initially, scattered all at once. What a joke! If they angered the Liu Clan, they would immediately be slaughtered on the spot. Not only so, the man even yelled out to the people in the restaurant and demanded them to leave. Even though at that time, they were almost finished with their food, deep down, they would still feel a bit uncomfortable... But the opponent was the Liu Clan, what else could they do but to hold it in? All these people were people with high status and reputation. Unfortunately, when they ran into the Liu Clan, they would have no choice but to endure. There were still a lot of other people, thus, it wasn’t too embarrassing to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Clan wasn’t scared to offend anyone. In just a while, they annoyed a lot of people. However, to the Liu Clan, what were these people? If they dropped down any instructions, these people would still have to do as they said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui and Yu Xixuan came out along with a few people from the Yu Clan. The restaurant was finally considered to have started running its business. Qing Shui then looked at the old man in front of him who was leading the Liu Clan, “</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed that the Liu Clan has come up with a decision.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">” though Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You aren’t from an aristocratic clan. There isn’t that kind of profound qi around your body.” The old man was very straightforward with his words. Both of his eyes seemed like they had unusual sparks in them. It was similar to the light of a person with wisdom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t show reactions to it, “These aren’t important. My only advice to you is that once you made up your mind, make sure to not regret it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I won’t regret it. Do you really think that you can bully the Liu Clan with those hand techniques of yours which specifically targets one’s acupoints and meridians? You have truly underestimated the Liu Clan. Not everyone from the Liu Clan will be bullied that easily.” The old man glared at Qing Shui. The aura across his body spread out into the surroundings like sharp knives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me get this straight, I will still say the same thing. It is not easy for an aristocratic clan like yours to have made it this far. Don’t bring your entire clan to its doom for a trash or for your so-called faces. By then, you may not be able to explain well to your ancestors even after you die.” Qing Shui looked at the people of the Liu Clan with his hands behind his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Grandpa, let me go and kill him. This brat is acting as if he is a God himself.” A man who looked considerably young said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man opened up his arms and stopped the others. He then moved his sight onto Qing Shui, “That useless child from my clan has died. With that being the case, the promised fight between the Liu Clan and Yu Clan have also been canceled. Instead, we will settle all matters on that day.”</span></p>

It is also quite troublesome. Let’s decide the winner with just one round.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>

You are responsible for your own life. What happens if I lose?” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>

You must pay for the life of my child.” The old man said in a cold tone.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can do whatever you want with us. Since we lost, we won’t have any energy left to resist.” The old man said slowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the deal was made, the people of the Liu Clan left. Qing Shui, on the other hand, started pondering over how the match against the Liu Clan should be fought. Before this, there were a few powerful warriors among the people he saw. For example, the old man at the most front. Qing Shui was a bit frightened of his strength. This caused Qing Shui couldn’t help but feel that three matches might be a challenge. Even though the deal was to fight for three rounds, if he lost, both he and the Yu Clan would have been done for. As for the Liu Clan, even if they were to lose all three matches, they would still be able to survive. Liu Clan had a better base than Yu Clan.</span></p>

Other than himself, for a moment, he was unable to find any suitable candidates to take part in the fight. He moved his sight onto Yu Xixuan and Yu Dinghe, “Is there any suitable candidates from the Yu Clan to take part in the battle?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Dinghe shook his head awkwardly, “There is no one from the Yu Clan suitable to fight the people of the Liu Clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No wonder even a garbage from the Liu Clan was allowed to marry Yu Xixuan. The difference between them wasn’t just by one small point.</span></p>
