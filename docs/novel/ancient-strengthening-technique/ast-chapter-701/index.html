 <p><strong>AST 701 - Completion of the Everlasting Pellet, Skywolf Crystal Card</strong></p>
 <p>The Five Tailed Immortal Fox's death was confirmed and Qing Shui now stared at the Skywolf. He could feel that this creature was sly and powerful, and could make most Beast Tamers to gave up any thoughts to tame this type of demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>They don’t care if they could succeed, instead, they would choose to just get rid of it. The most important characteristic that Beast Tamers look for in a beast was loyalty.</p>
 <p>Wuu wuu...</p>
 <p>A pitiful cry rang out. When Qing Shui saw it, the Five Tailed Immortal Fox fell down. A big hole had been burned through its huge head.</p>
 <p>Ning!</p>
 <p>The Mystic Bird let out a happy cry before it pounced for the Skywolf!</p>
 <p>Roar... Wuu....</p>
 <p>The Skywolf knew that it was in danger and anxiously howled out in fury. It jumped around and caused many wounds on the Ice Fire Ferocious Lion, however, its condition was also not any better.</p>
 <p>There were no doubts on who would win when it was two against one. In the end the Skywolf, with its life at stake, had dealt a heavy blow on the Ice Fire Ferocious Lion. It splitted the stomach of the Ice Fire Ferocious Lion open that no one could tell if it would survive that blow.</p>
 <p>The Skywolf understood that there was no way for it to escape, so it decided to cast aside its defence and fight until the bitter death against the Ice Fire Ferocious Lion. Its neck was burnt by the Ice Fire Ferocious Lion's ice flames, and its head was also smashed by the enemy's giant claws.</p>
 <p>Without even a grunt, the Skywolf died immediately and fell down. The Mystic Bird caught up and grabbed the Ice Fire Ferocious Lion as it descended shakily.</p>
 <p>Immediately, the Ice Fire Ferocious Lion's fresh blood dyed the Mystic Bird red!</p>
 <p>Ning ning!</p>
 <p>The Mystic Bird's rueful cry pierced through the sky and also made Qing Shui felt sad. He had never expected that a demonic beast could have such a rueful cry.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing had walked towards Qing Shui as he also landed. "Qing Shui, it's so pitiful. Can you save that Ice Lion?"</p>
 <p>They said that women were softhearted. To be honest, Qing Shui had deliberately planned for this to happen to the Ice Fire Ferocious Lion. If he had weakened the enemy like what he did to the Five Tailed Immortal Fox, the Ice Fire Ferocious Lion wouldn't have ended in this state.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui had his concerns too. If there was only one demonic beast, after Qing Shui had weakened it, he could escape together with Hai Dongqing. If there were two of them, he would basically have no hopes of doing so.</p>
 <p>Ning ning!</p>
 <p>The Mystic Bird stood next to the Ice Fire Ferocious Lion as it repeatedly cried out ruefully. Only those who had seen this scene for themselves would understood that demonic beasts have feelings too and be able experience this shocking moment.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled bitterly and took out a Five Dragon Pellet and fed it to the Ice Fire Ferocious Lion. After that, he took out the Golden Medicinal Salve and applied most of it to the lion’s horrible wound.</p>
 <p>He then fed it with a Vital Essence Pill, to help it recover its essence, Qi, and spirit.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn't guarantee that he could save the Ice Fire Ferocious Lion. After he had done all that he could, he walked towards the Five Tailed Immortal Fox and the Skywolf then threw their corpses into his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>A hint of light came out from the east, as the sun was about to rise. They were at Icy Cloud Mountain, otherwise, the sun would have risen up long ago.</p>
 <p>The Ice Fire Ferocious Lion's condition had stabilized. When a powerful demonic beasts like this didn't die due to injuries, they would be able to recover quickly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that he must leave and hinted this to Hai Dongqing.</p>
 <p>Ning!</p>
 <p>The Mystic Bird lowered its head and cried out in a soft voice towards Qing Shui. It even gently rubbed its big head against him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui suddenly felt happy, "Could it be that it has decided to follow me in the future? Do you want to follow me?"</p>
 <p>The Mystic Bird let out two cries as it shook its head and tried to tell him that it was merely expressing its gratefulness.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui was disappointed that the Mystic Bird did not agree to follow him, he was delighted when he thought of the goal of this trip which is the Immortal Fox's blood. He stored two bottles inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal while he carried one bottle with him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was afraid that the effects and freshness of the Immortal Fox's blood would be gone due to the time flow in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Therefore, as long as this bottle he had with him didn't exceed three days, it could still be considered fresh.</p>
 <p>In the end, Qing Shui and Hai Dongqing left. Although the Mystic Bird couldn't bear to see him leave, it didn't follow him either. It could only watch and cried out a few times as Qing Shui disappeared at the distance.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, are we heading back now?" Hai Dongqing asked softly,</p>
 <p>"We'll stay here for a while. Our trip had been smooth so far. We'll stay here and cultivate for a month to stabilize our abilities before we go back. What do you think?"</p>
 <p>"Alright!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t expect Hai Dongqing to agreed so readily. It was only noon when they had left, he decided to stop and look for a concealed area to rest for now.</p>
 <p>"Let's stay here for a while as I'll be doing alchemy. I have some medicinal pills here which would be useful for you. If you don't mind, you can work on absorbing them during this time. There's also some that's for demonic beasts, maybe you can use it on your Silver Spirit Beast to achieve a breakthrough. I did said that if I find the Immortal Fox's blood, I'll give you some presents." Qing Shui took out some Beast Pills and some medicinal pills which could increase one's abilities. Although there were only a few of them, each could be considered as of good quality.</p>
 <p>“No need to hesitate. Just wait here and don’t leave this place. I’ll be done after six hours at most and if anything happens, I will know.” &nbsp;Qing Shui gave the medicinal pills and a piece of paper which recorded its effects to Hai Dongqing.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was happy to give those to her. It was just his way to share his happiness with friends after he had received great benefits.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui called out the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, the Fire Bird and the Jade Emperor Bee as he wouldn't feel at ease otherwise. It was only after he had done this that he decided to enter inside his tent.</p>
 <p>Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't dare to have any delays. He didn't wish to waste the Immortal Fox's blood which they had gone through great means to obtain, otherwise, he'd regret it. &nbsp;He then started to refine the Everlasting Pellet after he had circulated one cycle of the Ancient Strengthening Technique and recovered his abilities to its peak condition.</p>
 <p>This pill was the most powerful medicinal pill that he had ever attempted to refine since he began to perform alchemy. Qing Shui had never felt so nervous about refining a pill before. He couldn’t afford to waste the Immortal Fox’s blood, he needed more power in order to protect his important people.</p>
 <p>He sorted out the medicinal herbs required, cleansed them, then prepared them...</p>
 <p>He had chose only the best for each item and flaws mustn’t be present at all. Qing Shui was very confident in performing this alchemy. After his image of Yin-Yang had attained a breakthrough previously, his spirit energy had increased by a lot and it made him felt that performing alchemy was just a breeze.</p>
 <p>The boring alchemy process now started. Qing Shui had focused all his attention to sense the changes in the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron, as he was not worried that he would be disturbed inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Various precious medicinal herbs of the best quality were placed around Qing Shui. After a fixed period of time, he would throw some of them into the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron and would also change the degree of the primordial flames as required.</p>
 <p>One day had passed by!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui put in some more medicinal herbs!</p>
 <p>Two days!</p>
 <p>Three days!</p>
 <p>By the third day, A whistling sound came out from the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron as Qing Shui had finally put in all the medicinal herbs required to refine the Everlasting Pellet.</p>
 <p>Four days!</p>
 <p>Five days!</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>All the way up to the seventh day, Qing Shui didn’t stop his primordial flames. During the process, he had even took a Vital Essence Pill three times to be able to continue.</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>A melodious sound, together with a faint violet glow, came out from the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron. That crisp, melodious tune was even comparable to the charming sounds that women cried out when they had sex.</p>
 <p>After another two hours, Qing Shui gradually slowed down to a stop.</p>
 <p>He was very tired, this was the most tiring attempt he had did so far. However, he did not feel the urge to take a break as his emotions were agitated and he could not help but think of Yuan Su. If he didn't get the alchemy recipe for the Vital Essence Pill from her, it wouldn't have been possible for him to create the Everlasting Pellet.</p>
 <p>Everything seemed to be so coincidental, as if his luck was quite good. Qing Shui smiled as he thought of how he had always met people who helped him along the way. There were even a few of them who had ended up being his soulmates.</p>
 <p>He had gradually fell asleep unknowingly as he immersed himself in deep thoughts.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui woke up, eight hours had already passed. He walked towards the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron and opened it, which had caused a refreshing, illusory fragrance to drift around. It gave the feeling as if one was in the clouds.</p>
 <p>There was a single violet-colored medicinal pill with the size of a fingertip inside the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron. The violet glow was filled with spiritual intelligence and gave out an indescribable feeling.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stored it in a bottle as he didn't dare to take it now because he wanted to look for a suitable place to cultivate first. With the remaining time, he processed the Five Tailed Immortal Fox's hide and Core.</p>
 <p>Just as he was about to do the same on the Skywolf's corpse, Qing Shui had a sudden idea to try a second attempt at alchemy after he recalled his previous refining. Even when he knew that he might fail, he still decided to go ahead and do it.</p>
 <p>He took out the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace, one that was said to be able to refine anything in the world. Qing Shui had thought of using it before, but considered the consequences due to one's cultivation level. If he had sufficient powers, he would be able to refine anything in the world; otherwise, he might suffer a backlash effect.</p>
 <p>He decided not to delayed it anymore as he placed the Skywolf's corpse into the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace. He knew that more spiritual energy in the demonic beast's corpse would be lost as the time passed.</p>
 <p>This time, the progress was much faster. Qing Shui felt that he might not be able to create anything good because he knew that too much of the spiritual energy was already lost.</p>
 <p>The time it consumed was only half of the duration when he had refined the White Jade Jiao, and it made Qing Shui to not expect too much. However, he was overjoyed when he had succeeded in refining the Everlasting Pellet, thus his mood was not affected while he went through this.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked towards the furnace in anticipation when the familiar glow had flashed to indicate that the refining process was successful.</p>
 <p>There was a crystallized card inside with the size of a palm and had a shrunken image of the black-colored Skywolf embed. Qing Shui could sense an eerie feeling from it as he picked it up.</p>
 <p>Effects: sneak attack, catching opponents unaware. Can temporarily allow the user to have the ability to break through some of the opponent's defense as well as increase speed.</p>
 <p>Increase in speed as well as increase in attacking powers!</p>
 <p>"Doesn't seem bad. But it is unknown how much it can increase one’s abilities." Qing Shui thought to himself as he put it aside.</p>
 <p>There were still plenty of time left. Qing Shui continued to cultivate in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
 <p>In the previous breakthrough, the Heavenly Thunder Slash had reached the state of Peak Obscure Realm. However, if he wanted to attain another breakthrough, the conditions would be even harsher.</p>
 <p>When he had nothing to do, the violet colored Thunderous Beast would run up to him. It was now three meters big and was currently in a phase at which it was growing rapidly together with its cultivation level.</p>
