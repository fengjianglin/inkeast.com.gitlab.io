 <p><strong>AST 1078 Manifestation Trapping Formation, the powerful Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring</strong></p>
 <p>The Buddha's eyes had actually opened all by themselves...</p>
 <p>In a split second, Qing Shui felt that the sky seemed to light up. It was to the extent that his eyes and body had an unexplainable feeling. Or perhaps, it could be said to be a feeling of appreciation.</p>
 <p>His Buddha's True Eyes didn’t experience any breakthrough but he could feel an increase in its formidability. In addition, he felt that his Buddha's Piercing Eyes should have also improved.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui unhurriedly walked toward the temple steps and slowly headed up with heavy steps... Currently, he felt very relaxed almost relaxed as he was before...</p>
 <p>After a quarter of an hour, Qing Shui reached the entrance to the temple. There was no door at the entrance and an inscrutable mysterious aura spread outward, giving off a mind clearing sensation.</p>
 <p>Looking within, there were statues of all sizes in a myriad of colors. They were statues of cultivators, although there were still a few statues of monks and daoist priests.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took a step into the temple but did not move forward any further. He could tell that these colorful statues of various sizes were actually a formation.</p>
 <p>Manifestation Trapping Formation!</p>
 <p>This new formation was an evolution of the four symbols formation and a trapping formation. This formation was similar to the Nine Palace formation, with its biggest strength lying in trapping enemies instead of killing them.</p>
 <p>Four Phases Steps!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui walked slowly using the Four Phases Steps. Suddenly, the statue within the main hall of the temple moved. He raised his arm and directly struck out at the statue. What stunned him was that these statues were indeed special. He had thought that he could smash the statues apart in one hit. Instead, the statues only shifted slightly from their original position.</p>
 <p>“If such solid material strikes out, it should also be very formidable. Could they also possess other abilities?”</p>
 <p>While Qing Shui was still caught up in his thoughts, another of the Buddha statues struck out in his direction. Once again, Qing Shui reached out to smash the statue. What happened afterwards surprised him. He was actually jolted back and if he did not know much about formations, he would have been repelled into the center of the formation…</p>
 <p>Previously, he attacked from a distance. Currently, he had attacked directly but was unexpectedly repelled...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was knowledgeable about formations but this mystical power was still able to push Qing Shui out of the temple. He noticed that there weren’t any traces of corpses in the temple and it was very clean, causing him to feel a little puzzled.</p>
 <p>This mystical repelling force was just like a shield attack, making Qing Shui feel powerless to resist. His eyes brightened. His own shield attack was currently at the third grade, but the probability of him resisting this formation were still slim. Furthermore, situations for him to use shield attack in recent battles were rare, to the extent that he had nearly forgotten about it.</p>
 <p>He tried to barge in once more and the previous repelling power appeared once again. Only this time, Qing Shui allowed himself to fall back along with the repelling force. After that, a strange situation occurred.He was back at the entrance of the temple again.</p>
 <p>This stunned Qing Shui. This place was a temple and perhaps because of this, the formation had an extra effect, which was the repelling force that would send you back to the entrance.</p>
 <p>After countless tries, Qing Shui finally understood the Manifestation Trapping Formation. It would match the strength used by the intruder. The less strength Qing Shui used, the weaker the repelling force. However,he would still be repelled to the entrance of the temple.</p>
 <p>This formation was meant to prevent anyone from entering the temple, was there some secrets hidden within? This time, Qing Shui used the Four Phases Steps again. However, he was only focused on evading attacks. In the beginning, there was one statue attacking, then there were two of them, slowly increasing in number. So long as he made the slightest mistake, he would be jolted back to the entrance of the temple again.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui displayed the Four Phases Steps to its limits but he was still repelled eventually.</p>
 <p>Five Elements Steps!</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>Seven Star Steps!</p>
 <p>Eight Trigrams Steps!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui realized that this was the perfect place to train his Nine Palace Steps. He was able to reach within ten meters of the exit to the Manifestation Trapping Formation, but in the end, he was still repelled at the very last moment.</p>
 <p>As the skies had darkened, Qing Shui decided to stay for the night. However, he would first enter the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal and continue training his Nine Palace Steps when he’s out.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt very excited when he entered the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal this time around. The Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation had made a breakthrough and hence he decided to try it again. It would be wonderful if he was able melt the Sacred Jade Divine Stone.</p>
 <p>He still felt nervous even though the breakthrough of the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation had almost doubled his mental strength when compared to previous breakthroughs.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s base mental strength had currently reached around10,000 Stars. His Arhat Rosary Beads allowed him to reach 20,000 Stars, and with the Big Dipper Sword, around 40,000 Stars. With the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation increasing his abilities and mental strength by twofold, he could reach 1,200,000 stars. If he manifested his Buddha's True Eyes, his mental strength would reach above 2,500,000 stars.</p>
 <p>This was what Qing Shui had just experienced. When he used Buddha Form Reveal, the increase in his strength was greater than before. The breakthrough in Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation also doubled Qing Shui’s abilities. During this period of time, Qing Shui’s base mental strength had also improved immensely. After all, he would enter the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal to cultivate daily.</p>
 <p>Especially during this period of time, Qing Shui had put a lot of effort into cultivating his mental strength. Unfortunately, he was still unable to make a breakthrough in the Heart of Roc. Otherwise, his abilities would definitely improve monstrously.</p>
 <p>Besides, Qing Shui’s Primordial Flame was very special and he also had the Yin-Yang Image. Hence, Qing Shui’s overall strength was more than just his level of mental strength.</p>
 <p>After adjusting his condition, he started melting the Sacred Jade Divine Stone. He unleashed the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation and Buddha Form Reveal from the start. After four hours, a drop of melted Sacred Jade Divine Stone formed. This first drop made Qing Shui thrilled. Although the first drop took a long time, the melting process would become easier as time passed. Qing Shui had already prepared the ring mould to collect the melted Sacred Jade Divine Stone.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qing Shui brought the Divine Cast Stone next to the Sacred Jade Divine Stone. He would have to wait a long time for the stones to continue melting. Luckily only a few drops of melted Divine Cast Stone were needed. Qing Shui also compressed the Primordial Flames within an area to prevent the melted Sacred Jade Divine Stone from solidifying too early.</p>
 <p>The process unexpectedly took seven days. Fortunately it was just a ring. Otherwise, Qing Shui would have gone berserk waiting for the stone to melt droplet by droplet before even refining it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had already attained a high level in the Pentacolor Art of Forging. He felt that to an outsider, it would definitely be considered a divine forging technique. With the Divine Cast Stone and forging with his Thousand Hammer Technique, Qing Shui shivered in elation when he saw the bright radiance shine from the ring.</p>
 <p>This was because the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring was definitely considered a minor Divine Artifact, allowing its user to move as they wished. Such items could be easily binded, as for the reason it was classified as a minor Divine artifact, it was because it seemed to have a simple intelligent will. Thus, it needed to be binded by blood. Doing so would allow the owner to be more proficient in using the ring and they would even be able to find it through its aura when lost. Essentially, it would never be lost.</p>
 <p>Binding an item with blood wasn’t something that unreliable, thus Qing Shui decided to try it out. Yet, such a matter appeared very mysterious. An item with spirituality was able to link to an owner through blood.</p>
 <p>As he picked up this simple and unadorned ring, he could feel the slightly obscure spiritual fluctuations. In the end, he couldn’t help but use his Heavenly Vision Technique.</p>
 <p>Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring: A legendary mystical item, a spiritual object of Heaven and Earth. Allows the user to teleport as they wish within a radius of two hundred li, able to be used a hundred times a day.</p>
 <p>Method of Use: When worn, able to move as your heart desires.</p>
 <p>Status: Unowned. After binding with an owner, it would be able to link with the owner’s blood and have other special abilities.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was astounded. He didn’t expect the capability of the Sacred Jade Divine Ring to increase by this much. With the ring, he could easily shuttle and teleport anywhere within two hundred li. And the limit of use was a hundred times a day.</p>
 <p>Its formidability mainly lied in its ability to allow the owner to move as he wished This was an item essential for survival. Remembering that it would gain special abilities after binding with an owner, Qing Shui impatiently bit his finger and allowed his blood to drip onto the ring. Qing Shui was astonished when the blood actually permeated into the Sacred Jade Divine Ring.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, the ring only needed a few drops of blood with any additional drops just rolling off. After absorbing Qing Shui’s blood, the Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring gave off the same dazzling lights like when it was forged. After the light faded, the simple and unadorned Sacred Jade Divine Ring had an additional drop of red, which looked like plum blossoms yet looked like a casual dot. This caused the simple ring to have a bright color and look gorgeous.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could feel a subtle indescribable feeling when he held the ring in his hand. It was a similar feeling to when he used his Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p>He unleashed his Heavenly Vision Technique once again.</p>
 <p>Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring: A legendary mystical item, a spiritual object of Heaven and Earth. Allows the user to teleport as they wished within a radius of two hundred li, able to be used a hundred times a day.</p>
 <p>Method of Use: When worn, able to move as your heart desires.</p>
 <p>Status: Owned.</p>
 <p>Passive Effect: Doubles the user’s speed and healing capability.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gazed at the ring for a long period of time, feeling satisfied as he put it on. In that instant, he felt himself becoming stronger. Shutting his eyes, his figure shuttled around the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal like a ghost, suddenly appearing in one place and then in another, going wherever he wanted to go. Of course, the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal was only a hundred meters in height. If he was outside, he would be able to use this speed to advance 20,000 li. In his previous life, 20,000 li would be able to pass over a large country. In the World of the Nine Continents, it didn’t amount to much. However, it was sufficient for escaping as well as chasing enemies within a small radius.</p>
 <p>This was a pretty good Divine Artifact.</p>
 <p>In the following time, Qing Shui didn’t cultivate. It took roughly seven days to smelt one ring and one day of rest afterwards. Just like this, he continuously forged ten rings, which was enough for everyone that had journeyed this time around. Observing the remaining Sacred Jade Divine Stone, Qing Shui could tell that there wasn’t enough for him to make a ring for each member of the Qing Clan. Besides, it was not beneficial for those who were not strong enough to possess such an item as it would cause trouble if others vied for it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui left the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal after midnight. He felt extremely relaxed and started to shuttle through the Manifestation Trapping Formation. Currently, he wasn’t thinking about breaking through the formation and instead was thinking of staying here for a longer period of time.</p>
 <p>Just like that, the sky had already brightened. Qing Shui had spent the last two hours basically constantly inside the formation, leisurely wandered around the hall. While outsiders would be dazzled by the terrifying statues within the formation, Qing Shui actually felt that they were very slow. Currently, he could even travel around the formation with his eyes closed.</p>
 <p>When the sky had totally brightened and the sunlight shined into the temple, Qing Shui opened his eyes and looked past the formation, towards the stone altar in front of the statues.</p>
 <p>From his angle, he was unable to see what was on the altar as he could only see a corner of the altar while he was still within the formation. Even though the area was not too small, he still could not see anything. If he wanted to get a closer glimpse, he would have to pass through the formation.</p>
 <p>Currently, as it was easy for him to pass through the formation, he directly passed through the formation. With his first glance, he saw the item that was on the stone altar.</p>
