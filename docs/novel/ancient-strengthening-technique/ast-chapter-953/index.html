 <p><strong>AST 953 - Strongest Youngster In Demon Gate, One-sided Bashing</strong></p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, we, Demon Gate, have arrived!" An old sounding voice rang out.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked towards the old man who spoke. It was an old man with snow white beard and hair that was extremely old, at least 70 years of age. However, the old man stood upright, with no hunch. His pitch black clothes caused his barely existing amiable expression to be completely gone, leaving only a cold expression.</p>
 <p>"Demon Gate really does think very highly of me!" Qing Shui stood up and walked into the air, as if he was ascending a set of invisible stairs, one step at a time. It created quite a visual impact.</p>
 <p>"So this is that young man... He's so young!"</p>
 <p>"That's right. He's really powerful to be able to kill Marionette Sect's Grand Elder and other people."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Many people were also very astonished, as some of them had seen Qing Shui before in the Central Continent Inn. However, they hadn't known who he was back then and right now, they felt that it was unbelievable.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui spoke, he continued to walk up into the air. There were fifteen opponents, with a young man amongst them or at least, he appeared to look young. Qing Shui wasn't afraid that all of them would take action and attack him all at once. No one would believe that Demon Gate wouldn't dare to do this, since they would never consider what justice was or care about being cursed by others. Otherwise, no one would feel that Demon Gate was very terrifying.</p>
 <p>Other than old men, there were also people in their fifties. Qing Shui didn't know what their attitudes were and he didn't even know how things were going to progress from here.</p>
 <p>When the old man saw Qing Shui, his eyes lit up, "What a good seedling. It's a pity that you aren't a member of our Demon Gate."</p>
 <p>"Let's get the things settled fast. I still have things to do and we're all busy people. What do you think?" Qing Shui smiled and said, looking at the old man.</p>
 <p>"You killed the Marionette Sect's Grand Elder?" The old man acted as if he hadn't heard what Qing Shui said.</p>
 <p>"Oh, there's no need to ask this. Could it be that the old guy was resurrected? If so, I wouldn't mind killing him one more time. That old guy who wanted to turn everyone he saw into his marionette should have died a long time ago, don't you think?" Qing Shui continued to say calmly.</p>
 <p>Although the old man was a person of Demon Gate, they weren't really people who acted recklessly without any restraint. They would act accordingly to the location and situation. There were times where they must appear to be arrogant, vicious, unscrupulous and employ terrible means. They didn't really want to agitate the public, they only wanted people to be scared of them.</p>
 <p>A fist was the most powerful the moment before it was launched.</p>
 <p>"Young man, it's good that you're arrogant and fiery, but don't underestimate how big the world is just because you have a skill or two. No one dares to be arrogant before Demon Gate and you are no exception," the old man also looked at Qing Shui calmly and said.</p>
 <p>The old man's voice wasn't loud, but everyone in the area could hear him and it caused them to feel a chill running through their hearts. Many people felt worried for Qing Shui, but of course there were also some who were here for the action and the livelier, the better.</p>
 <p>"Your fieriness is no weaker than a young man!" Qing Shui didn't feel anything to the old man's words. He was numb to threats.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was in fact trying to discreetly express that the other party was so unrefined despite his age, not knowing how big the world was and if not for the Demon Gate, he would be nothing.</p>
 <p>"This is the first time I've come across someone who dares to talk to me like this. You have courage. We'll compare our skills today. It's useless to just talk about it." The old man held a White Bone Sword.</p>
 <p>"All of you can come at me together. This will save some time," Qing Shui smiled and said to the entire group.</p>
 <p>"Lad, there's no need to use reverse psychology on us. When the time has come, we'll definitely not go easy on you," the old man let out two cold laughs and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was speechless.</p>
 <p>"As expected, they really are shameless!"</p>
 <p>"You think Demon Gate is just a name? This is how it's always been. They've always been able to do things that others can't. Otherwise, how could they be so powerful?"</p>
 <p>"This Qing Shui is really unlucky to have offended Demon Gate."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui was it? Let's have a fight!" The one young man stepped forth and appeared 50 meters away from Qing Shui, smiling brightly.</p>
 <p>The young man was very handsome and even appeared to have a slight demonic charm. However, it was a pity that he was a guy. His appearance made Qing Shui felt very awkward. Qing Shui didn't know that he had a different charm to him as well, but thankfully it wasn't a feminine one.</p>
 <p>"Mo Zitong. He is Demon Gate's top expert amongst the younger generation."</p>
 <p>"It's said that he has inherited Demon Gate's legacy. Qing Shui's in trouble now that he's stepped forth."</p>
 <p>"Seems like Demon Gate is taking this issue very seriously."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could hear all the discussions going on around him. It was fine even if he couldn't, since he could sense the guy's abilities. It was about at a strength of 1,500 stars. The guy was holding onto a pitch black longsword, which was emitting a flashing three foot black sword light. He was the strongest person from the younger generation whom Qing Shui has come across thus far.</p>
 <p>"May I ask if your words carry any weight in Demon Gate?" Qing Shui was in no hurry to fight, he merely smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>The young man's slightly elegant looking brows raised up, "What do you want to say? Just get straight to the point!"</p>
 <p>"What will happen if you were to lose? What will happen if you were to die? Will these people be able to handle it?" Qing Shui said calmly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's words caused the brows of the old man from earlier to raised up and he quickly stepped forth. Sometimes, it was better to be safe than sorry. If Mo Zitong were to die here, they wouldn't know what were the consequences that they would have to face.</p>
 <p>"Do you think that you'll be able to do it?" Mo Zitong's sharp eyes stared at Qing Shui. His tone had also turned piercing cold.</p>
 <p>"Seeing how indecent the Marionette Sect is, even a large sect like the Demon Gate should be no different. Come, let's have a round. I want to see what Demon Gate's best youngster is capable of." Qing Shui stretched out his hand and the Violet Star Thunder God appeared in it.</p>
 <p>"Old man, if you're worried, you can join in," although Qing Shui said this, his tone was that of contempt.</p>
 <p>"No need. Elder Wu, don't worry, I'll be fine." Mo Zitong looked at the old man and said.</p>
 <p>Considering Mo Zitong's identity and status, the old man knew that he must definitely have something to protect himself and thus there was no need for himself to be too worried. He stepped back slightly, but was still careful to not be too far away so that he could deal with any sudden situations.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui started circulating his abilities. His physical strength was now at 100 stars and after using the Heavenly Talisman and holding the Violet Star Thunder God, his strength could reach slightly over 1,400 stars. It was about the same as the young man he was facing.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui felt that there was a need to forge his Big Dipper Sword. If his Big Dipper Sword could be as powerful as the Violet Star Thunder God, he could just deal with his opponents with just the Sword of Sixth Wave. People of the same level as him wouldn't be able to withstand the impact from the blow. Furthermore, if he were to use the Big Dipper Sword, he could also use the Combination Sword Technique and could unleash an additional strength of 40 stars.</p>
 <p>However, there were also many benefits for him in using the Violet Star Thunder God. Its attacking speed wasn't slow and there was still the killer move, Raging Blow. Furthermore, during this period of time, his Nine Palace Steps had also improved by a lot.</p>
 <p>Facing this young man before him, he felt no pressure at all.</p>
 <p>Mo Zitong's longsword trembled and his aura swelled up. In that moment, it was as if he was a sharp sword which was drawn from its sheath and the black colored cold gleam from the sword once again stretched out one foot longer. A clacking sound which gave one the feeling of pins and needles rang out.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's body was very strong and with the transformation to his Central Palace Blood Essence Pool, he was now more powerful than before. Despite this, he wouldn't use his body to try out how strong it was.</p>
 <p>He unleashed his spiritual sense quickly and everywhere around him was within the Nine Palace.</p>
 <p>Within the Nine Palace, he was the King!</p>
 <p>The young man moved. His speed was so fast that he appeared to be like a black line, as he charged toward Qing Shui with a flash.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui unleashed the profound Nine Palace Steps and once the young man entered the perimeters of the Nine Palace, it was as if his speed slowed down tremendously. To outsiders, it appeared as if Qing Shui's speed had become even faster.</p>
 <p>Thousand Hammer Technique!</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Hammering down from a difficult angle, Qing Shui pushed the young man several steps back. The young man probably hadn't given it his all either, but Qing Shui casually pushed him back with his Nine Palace Steps.</p>
 <p>To the young man, this attack seemed to be quick and elusive, catching him off guard. Just an attack had caused him to feel astonished. To think that there was someone who was so strong amongst the younger generation.</p>
 <p>Mo Zitong retreated slightly and suddenly let out a low bellow!</p>
 <p>A glow which was like that of Black Jade flashed. it was both eerie and beautiful. The young man then dashed out toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Jade Stars Cover the Skies！”</p>
 <p>The pitch black longsword immediately unleashed three sword shadows, each of them appearing as if there were pitch black crystals on them. It swung out and slashed toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't know what those dots were and he dodged them. With the Nine Palace Steps, he was like a fish in the water. Right now, he didn't wish to kill Mo Zitong. It hadn't reached such a serious stage yet. If he were to kill Mo Zitong, Demon Gate would definitely fight him to the bitter end.</p>
 <p>He wasn't afraid of Demon Gate, but the time hadn't come yet. Moreover, Demon Gate was a bit related to Huoyun Liu-Li. This was also a very important reason.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui appeared right before Mo Zitong and attacked with his Violet Star Thunder God!</p>
 <p>From this angle and situation, Mo Zitong had no way to dodge the attack.</p>
 <p>As numerous as raindrops in the wind, as powerful as a bolt of thunder!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui slammed down stance after stance of the Thousand Hammer Technique. He wasn't afraid of losing to anyone in terms of endurance. After his Dantian formed a pellet, his powers had become stronger and it was being replenished incessantly by the Yin Yang Image. Moreover, the depletion by Qing Shui's techniques was very low.</p>
 <p>In such a situation, Mo Zitong didn't even have the time to catch his breath. His handsome face had turned red due to his feelings of anxiety and anger. However, he wasn't stupid and knew that he wasn't a match for Qing Shui. To think that he wasn't able to break through Qing Shui's simple consecutive attacks. Although he managed to fend off slightly in the middle, it was useless. Qing Shui's foot technique was eerily and mysteriously terrifying.</p>
 <p>When experts sparred, it would only take a short moment to determine the winner. Basically, they would be able to find out each other's abilities with one move and the winner would emerge within a few moves. People who were mediocre would take the time for one incense to burn or even up to half an hour and people who were weak but persistent could take up to an hour...</p>
 <p>To the people on the ground, Qing Shui was the one who was one-sidedly bashing Mo Zitong. Mo Zitong was trying hard to fend off the attacks and didn't even have the ability to fight back. Everyone was astonished at how one-sided the fight turned out to be.</p>
 <p>Everyone knew about Mo Zitong, a person who had once won against a Martial Emperor. Moreover, the people from Demon Gate even knew that Mo Zitong had defeated a Martial Emperor who had a strength of close to 2,000 stars. He was a prominent existence even in Demon Gate and was Demon Gate's future pillar.</p>
