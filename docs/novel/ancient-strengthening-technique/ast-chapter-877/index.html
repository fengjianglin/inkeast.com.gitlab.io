 <p><strong>AST 877 - Targeted, Sky Prison Sect, [Sky Prison Massacre]</strong></p>
 <p>The two of them slowly walked in the mountain valley, time to time frightening hordes of small animals and beasts. When the two of them were together they truly did not have anything to talk about.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui discovered that he did not have anything that he wanted to talk to this lady about, while the lady had many things to say but was unable to speak. Although she had decided on what she wanted to do, she would not be that direct.</p>
 <p>It was in fact Mu Qing that was feeling the most helpless, as she did not have a single bit of experience in male and female relationships. She really did not know what to do, however she was intelligent and rational. She did not wish for herself to have regrets, therefore she had reduced some of her restraint, however from the look of it the results were no good.</p>
 <p>There were times where liking a person was very simple. Loving a person can be very simple too, however, sometimes loving a person was very hard. Even working hard one’s entire life might not have any results. The matters of unrequited love and lack of interest were too many in the world.</p>
 <p>Such a flower like her had met with a heartless person. If this was announced no one would believe it!</p>
 <p>There still were some days left and rushing would botch up the job, therefore the lady did not ask more on this question. Following this, she and Qing Shui started to talk about more relaxing topics and some simple information about him.</p>
 <p>Women were very skilled at talking, at least she knew what words to say and what not to. What to ask and what absolutely cannot be asked. She would talk about some of her circumstances. She wanted to understand Qing Shui more and wanted him to understand her more. “How’s the Dong Family in the county city?” since they were already talking, Qing Shui started to ask more.</p>
 <p>“Dong Family, how to put it? We’re in the top class within the city, however within this circle we are considered the weaker one.” replied the lady as she walked. She and Qing Shui walked shoulder to shoulder and from the look of it they seem to be well matched.</p>
 <p>The girl was not shorter than Qing Shui and when her hair was worn in a high bun she was almost as tall as Qing Shui. Her slender and graceful physique radiated an ecstatic aura that made people go crazy.</p>
 <p>This was an answer that Qing Shui could understand. The Dong Family was unable to compete with the Mu Family. Although they were in the same circle as the Mu Family, it was with some difficulty. However the Dong Family were already well off. After all, from amongst so many families, the Dong Family was able to rise up and stand up shows the might that they possessed. This did not happen just by a fluke. Without strength one cannot have fame or reputation, if not one would be harmed by this false reputation.</p>
 <p>The Dong Family was strong, however it was a pity that their number of people were not flourishing. When their population dropped, they would be unable to compete on the same level as a large family like the Mu Family. However, it does not mean that a family with fewer mouths would definitely be bullied.</p>
 <p>As long as the family had people who were able to bear the heavy responsibility or had a frightening existence among their elder generation, there would be no one who would dare to provoke them. After all, if the expert were to seek revenge, even a big clan would have a headache.</p>
 <p>“These are for you. Just pat them on your body to use them,” said the lady as she took out some crystal cards and handed them over to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The crystal cards refined by a Beast Tamer. Qing Shui smiled as he took them from her. There were those that increase speed, increase strength, increase defense...</p>
 <p>No wonder people would say that Beast Tamers were basically similar to Heavenly Talisman Masters. One was a talisman and the other was a crystal card. Both could boost the user or weaken their target. In addition the materials all came from demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui used the Descending Heavens Talisman, he did not know if the lady had seen it, however Qing Shui still took out a large amount of Heavenly Talismans and handed them to the lady. This was due to the fact that crystal cards and Heavenly Talismans do not conflict with one another.</p>
 <p>The lady happily took them and said, “You truly know quite a few things. Never did I think that the words you said in the Jade Cloud Pavilion were true.”</p>
 <p>“Within this region, is the Mu Family the greatest Alchemist Clan?” Qing Shui did not continue with the lady’s words, stopping for a while before asking his question with a smile.</p>
 <p>“ As of now we haven’t discovered anybody or any family that is better that the Mu Clan,” replied Mu Qing with certainty. When talking about refining demons, she was still very confident.</p>
 <p>“Is it convenient for you to talk about what things can refining demons result in? Er, I’m also a Demon Refiner and would like to know what things can a Demon Refiner refine.” Qing Shui had all along been want to interact with some Demon Refiners about the knowledge of demon refining.</p>
 <p>“You’re also a Demon Refiner?” this time it could be considered that Mu Qing was startled. There were many Demon Refiners in the capital city, however the majority of them did not have skills that were up to par. However, she felt that Qing Shui was different from them. She knew that anything that he had involved himself in, the result would definitely be perfected. Now he was saying that he was a Demon Refiner and that meant that he had unique understandings in refining demons.</p>
 <p>“Refining Demons is in fact refining the essence of demonic beasts. Those who are not strong enough would choose to refine a portion of demonic beasts. For example, the head, the core, the heart, the bones, the blood and fluids...those who are strong can choose to refine the entire demonic beast. When doing separate refining, the items obtained would be medicinal pills or some materials like pearls that can let demonic beasts regain their strength. There would be times where those crystal cards would appear,” replied the lady slowly as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was also in shock now. He did not know that one could split the refining into parts. During the first time he was muddleheaded and refined the entire demonic beast. Furthermore, it was two strong demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>“It's best to refine the entire corpse of the demonic beast. That way, the items obtained will be greater. Furthermore the items would be of better quality than refining a certain portion. The most important thing is that there is a definite success rate of obtaining the Demonic Beast Origin Essence Soul Pearl of the demonic beast,” continued Mu Qing.</p>
 <p>“Other that feeding to demonic beasts, what other use does the Demonic Beast Origin Essence Soul Pearl have?” asked Qing Shui after thinking about it.</p>
 <p>The lady looked at Qing Shui, having already guessed it secretly. He was actually about to refine a Demonic Beast Origin Essence Soul Pearl. However it seemed to not be too much of a surprise. After laughing for awhile, she replied, “Other that feeding to demonic beasts, it can be used in the refinement of some medicinal pills.”</p>
 <p>This had gone beyond Qing Shui’s expectations. He had never thought that the Demonic Beast Origin Essence Soul Pearl refined from the demonic beast could also be used to refine medicinal pills. He estimated that it was used to refine some special or strong medicinal pills.</p>
 <p>Unknowingly they had already walked for a very long distance, as the pace of a cultivator was much quicker than most people. Added with the fact that this was a mountain valley, seven or eight turns was enough to make people dizzy and turn back.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the lady stopped in her tracks, extending her hand and grabbing onto Qing Shui’s sleeves.</p>
 <p>“There are people!” said the lady softly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui tried to sense them using his Spiritual Sense and faintly sensed that there were indeed people, just that they were a bit far. The lady was able to sense them most likely due to her Lightning Bees.</p>
 <p>“They have already discovered us. Qing Shui, don’t you have a way to leave? You should leave first,” said the lady softly. Her voice was calm and tranquil. However Qing Shui discovered that she was controlling herself and in fact she was a little disturbed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was now very curious, as Mu Qing definitely knew of those people that had yet to appear. What people were able to invoke such dread in her. Without moving an inch, he looked at the lady, waiting for her explanation.</p>
 <p>“They are people of the Sky Prison Sect! We’re truly unlucky to have actually run into them.” replied the lady bitterly as she looked at Qing Shui, her absolutely beautiful face showing her helplessness.</p>
 <p>“Sky Prison Sect?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had heard of them before. They seemed to be a powerful existence within the Eastern Victory Divine Continent. At the Golden Buddha Temple he had heard about the powerful influences and the number one seemed to be the Sky Prison Sect.</p>
 <p>“The Sky Prison Sect is an ancient sect and no one knows where their sect is. We only know that their members are very strong. In the earliest days they were the existence that represented justice and righteousness, the Sky Prison and would catch those heinous hoodlums and bad guys. Five thousand years ago the Sky Prison Sect had captured a large number of bad guys. However, the sect had underestimated these people. The prisoners had unknowingly used some method to become a branch of the Sky Prison Sect after staying there for a hundred years. After another hundred years, an absolute genius appeared in this branch. Two hundred years later, this “genius” captured the Sky Prison Sect into his hands. This allowed his branch to sit firmly until now. The people who control the Sky Prison Sect are all his later generations. It is said that he had obtained the absolute treasure of the Sky Prison Sect, the “Sky Prison Massacre” Mu Qing calmed down, when she saw Qing Shui, she was surprised to learn that her emotions actually slowly calmed down.</p>
 <p>Although she knew that this man could not contend against the Sky Prison Sect, She felt very calm when she was in his presense. He had never said more words than needed, as there was no use in showing off. However he would accomplish stunning and breathtaking things.</p>
 <p>“Do you have a grudge with the people of the Sky Prison Sect?” asked Qing Shui softly as he looked at Mu Qing.</p>
 <p>He did not know about the Sky Prison Sect, however the Mu Family was still alright. From the looks of it this Mu Clan was not afraid of the Sky Prison Sect. Perhaps it meant that the Sky Prison Sect did not dare to brazenly appear in the capital city.</p>
 <p>“We don’t have a grudge. However, anyone that is targeted by them would not have a happy ending,” replied the lady while shaking her head.</p>
 <p>As of now, Qing Shui could already sense the auras of those people. There were approximately twenty people. Their strength was not overly frightening, however they were at least all cultivators with one star of strength.</p>
 <p>“They don’t seem to be that powerful?” asked Qing Shui doubtfully.</p>
 <p>“Yes, this is the reason why the Sky Prison Sect is strong and enduring. What they train is the “Sky Prison Massacre”. It’s a technique to imprison people. Their might when collaborating is frightening. The “Sky Prison Massacre” is able to make them seemingly share the same body. Their strange positioning and attacks have not been broken by anyone yet. This technique allows their strength to increase by a lot,” replied the lady while looking like she was pondering.</p>
 <p>The lady’s words made Qing Shui think about a thing that he had guessed.</p>
 <p>Array Techniques or something clever that had a different approach but same outcome, like blade arrays, sword arrays, spear arrays...</p>
 <p>Among the techniques used by Qing Shui, there were many that touched upon the concepts of the Eight Trigram Book of Changes, especially the Eight Trigrams Orientation. Formations and the Eight Trigrams Orientation comes together. In addition there was the Yin and Yang and the Five Elements.</p>
 <p>The Five Elements amalgamate into one, one would give birth to Yin and Yang. Yin and Yang would give birth to the Four Symbols. The Four Symbols would give birth to the Eight Trigrams Orientation. The Eight Trigrams Orientation would give birth to the 64 hexagrams of the Book of Changes. The 64 hexagrams of the Book of Changes would change into 384 divinations. 384 divinations would develop into the myriad of things.</p>
 <p>“Big miss Mu indeed has a broad knowledge. The number one beauty of the county City not only has absolutely good looks, your cultivation and experience are also at the peak.”</p>
 <p>Just at this time 22 people walked out from the two ends of the mountain valley. Most of them were males of forty years and below. Looking very crude, wild and fearless, they had a fierce and violent aura.</p>
 <p>Their leader was a rather handsome male. From the looks of it he was approximately thirty plus years old. He was tall and slender, sporting silver attire. On his face was a somewhat sinister expression, with the corner of his eyes faintly curling up, giving people a feeling of frivolity.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, he is the expert of the Sky Prison Sect’s younger generation. Don’t underestimate him. This person is perverted and in addition is a coward. Basically, any Women who he has taken a fancy to would not be able to live. There are many people who call him the flower snipper,” ignoring the youth, Mu Qing said as she thought about Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“If your elder uncles can come, we have quite a numerical advantage over them. Although victory or defeat is uncertain, the majority of them are not as strong as us. A few of the elder uncles are quite a bit stronger than them,” replied Qing Shui as he tilted his head to look at her.</p>
 <p>“There isn’t anything that is certain. If we can’t kill them instantly or we can’t break their technique, there would be simply no chance of victory,” said the lady with certainty while shaking her head.</p>
