 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After about two hours, the woman calmed down. The boundless aura around her body, however, was very obvious. Even Qing Shui himself was unable to sense the woman’s actual strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the wind blew, her clothes fluttered in the air following the wind. At this very moment, she herself was the most beautiful scenery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled as he stood near her and looked at her. He didn’t feel inappropriate with the change which the woman just went through. Though they were both unsure of each other’s position at the moment, Qing Shui could still be considered quite decent when it came to observing people. Even though the woman might be a State Master of the Great Confucian Empire, there was no way she would view him as an enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have recovered. How shall I thank you?” The woman turned around and looked at Qing Shui. At the moment, she looked unusually happy. The things which have been on her mind for quite a while has finally been solved. Qing Shui saved her life… Though she didn’t fear death, it wasn’t something which she wanted either. Hence, her entire body was currently filled with happiness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have already said before that I won’t ask for anything in return for helping you cure your poison. But if you truly want to thank me, I am still lacking a servant girl to be by my side.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In your dream. Tell me, I will try my best to realize one of your wishes as long as it’s something within my capability.” The woman shot Qing Shui a glare and said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head, “For now, money isn’t a problem to me. Beauties? They are all around me. I have also already gotten my own children. To be frank, there is really nothing else which I can possibly ask for.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman stared at the man whom she had yet to see through even until now. She didn’t know exactly what he meant with what he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Could he mean to say that I have desires?” For a moment, the woman’s thought changed very fast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s getting late. I would like to stay at the Imperial Cuisine Hall for a few days. Is that possible?” The woman asked Qing Shui while looking up at the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sure, but you will have to pay rent for it.” Qing Shui said after a few moments of thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman rubbed her head, “I will pay for it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman felt a bit helpless. She would never have thought that this was what Qing Shui wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they returned to the Imperial Cuisine Hall, it happened to be the time to have dinner. The woman went to take a shower. After all, the poisons and impurities that was extracted from her body had made her felt very uncomfortable. The moment she got back, she has already requested Qing Shui a small courtyard for her to take a bath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that she had gone to shower. Though he wanted to follow and see very badly, it was nothing but just a dream. He then went back to the main hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little brother, did you enjoy your honeymoon with the beautiful lass?” Lan Lingfeng said in a mischievous tone when he saw Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had a handsome look. Though he might look a bit vulgar at the moment, it wasn’t really too excessive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Master Lan, you are truly going through greater and greater changes as the day passed. I can now confirm that back then, you must definitely be the type who are shy outside but very wild inside.” Qing Shui smiled and said. He remembered the time when he first knew Young Master Lan, he was a cool person infatuated with love. But compared to him now, it was as if he was a totally different person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s what I thought. Furthermore, he might be the wildest one of all.” Yin Tong smiled as she came out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, now that my realm has ascended, I can finally be the type who are wild both inside and outside.’ Lan Lingfeng revealed an awkward smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled. Actually, he also thought that he from the past was also the type described before. As the saying went, out of ten men, nine were cold outside but wild on the inside. Only one would be so daring to reveal it from the inside and outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“By the way, little brother, I feel that you are the only person capable of handling the woman. When I see her, even I myself feel that I am a bit childish.” Lan Lingfeng said while looking like he was daydreaming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at Lan Lingfeng. He didn’t know what went on between him and Yin Tong. Just because he went out with that woman, they had actually started thinking so much about it. Also, Qing Shui understood greatly when he heard what Lan Lingfeng said previously. Actually, deep down, even he himself felt that he was a bit childish. In this context, he didn’t mean the typical small-minded children, to put it simply, they just felt inferior when compared to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like the unsophisticated village boys from his previous incarnation, when they stood in front of the beautiful and young women from the cities, they would find themselves lacking in self-confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luckily, Qing Shui, at the level he currently was, was unlikely to go as bad as what was described above. Nevertheless, the woman still gave him a lot of pressure. It was a kind of formless aura, or rather, temperament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While they were still chit-chatting, the woman came out. She has changed into a new cloth. Nevertheless, she was still wearing a purple cloth with golden lines at the side of it. It looked very graceful and noble. It was a kind of aura which originated from within the body, even nobler than those from royal clans. When she saw Qing Shui and the other two chit-chatting, she smiled and asked, “What are you guys talking about? You all seem so happy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My little brother said that you look very beautiful.” Lan Lingfeng chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, what else did he say?” The woman said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He even said that he is after you.” Lan Lingfeng continued on to wrangle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though it hadn’t been long since Qing Shui and the woman knew each other, she still had a degree of understanding towards him. From what she knew about the man, he wouldn’t say something like that. However, she also couldn’t confirm it entirely. After all, she has seen his fiery eyes a number of times back when he helped her extracted the poisons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she thought back to the scene when Qing Shui helped removed her poison, she couldn’t help but look at Qing Shui with a resentful look. Even she didn’t know exactly where these resentments came from. It might be that the look from Lan Lingfeng’s perspective, was a resentful look. This caused Lan Lingfeng to be really shocked. From this look alone, he could already tell that something must have happened between those two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, Lan Lingfeng also admired his little brother greatly. It was very rare for Young Master Lan to admire someone. Not only did he admire his cultivation, but he also admired the women that were with Qing Shui. Even he himself didn’t know why so many women would like being around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In terms of look, he was slightly more good-looking than Qing Shui. Qing Shui was only better than him in cultivation, medical expertise, and cooking skills…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui rubbed his nose and shook his head when he saw the woman’s eyes, “Let’s have dinner together as a way of celebrating you getting cured of your poison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was early evening. The Imperial Cuisine Hall was very noisy. Two long tables were joined together. Almost everyone was present, even Tian Yi, Yu Niang, and her family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui was eating, he noticed an unnatural look flashing across the woman’s eyes. That was a very complicated look. It looked helpless and at the same time also powerful. This really shocked Qing Shui. With how strong she currently was, what could possibly make her so worried?</span></p>

Is there something on your mind?” Qing Shui was sitting next to her. On the other side was Yiye Jiange carrying Qing Xiu. They simply picked a spot to sit on when they first entered the room. This made the other girls felt very uncomfortable. It was nothing much, they weren’t being narrow-minded either. It was just that deep down, they found it a bit uncomfortable.</span></p>

Maybe we can be of help to you. I am the one who gives you your life. If you don’t mind, I can help you one more time.” Qing Shui said while eating.</span></p>

I can almost confirm it to be him.” The woman looked even more worried now.</span></p>

The Grand State Master of Great Confucian Empire….. That was an existence second only to the top. Though the woman might also be the State Master of Great Confucian Empire, there were already quite a lot of State Masters in it. Hence, a Grand State Master was undoubtedly one of the leading person in the empire.</span></p>

Why would he want to poison her then? Did he intend on controlling her or killing her?</span></p>
