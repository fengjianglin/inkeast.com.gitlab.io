  <p><strong>AST 0141 – Drunken Fragrance Fruit</strong></p>
  <p>When Qing Shui saw Yu He, she was looking through the accounts. She could be looking at the earnings for the month, or merely for that day!</p>
  <p>Having heard the sound of footsteps, Yu He raised her head and saw Qing Shui. Her beautiful eyes were full of smiles as she said, “You’re back!” That joy was unconcealed.</p>
  <p>“Mmm, Sister Yu seems busy. Maybe I should come back another day!” Although Qing Shui said that he should visit another day, his legs were leading him towards Yu He.</p>
  <p>“Playing punk the first thing you’re back. Alright, my dear busy man, this sister thanks you for coming to visit me!” Yu He laughed as she poured Qing Shui a cup of tea.</p>
  <p>“You’re the boss of Yu He Inn. Look at how busy you are now. Yu He Inn is now known far and wide. Sister Yu has really gained both fame and profit.” Qing Shui smiled as he spoke and received the teacup from Yu He.</p>
  <p>“This is all thanks to you. You could cause our Yu He Inn to close down anytime. I’m not sure if I should be happy or sad. All of the current customers are after the black fish and the All Aspect Nourishment Soup. Once you leave, or are out of the black fish and turtles, my Yu He Inn would have to close down immediately.” Yu He smiled and said, taking the seat opposite Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was stunned. Next year, when he was going to head to the Skysword Sect, he wouldn’t be able to continue supplying the black fish and turtles. Although the Yu He Inn had earned quite a lot during this period, once there were no more black fish and turtles, the customer base would be greatly reduced, and it could even lead to the shop closing down. If that was the case, he would have caused trouble for Yu He.</p>
  <p>Seeing Qing Shui staring into space, Yu He smiled gently as she waved her slender fingers in front of Qing Shui. “Why are you in a daze? Don’t think about it too much, just leave it all to fate.”</p>
  <p>“That’s good, otherwise I’d be in trouble if you were to cry and not let me leave!”</p>
  <p>“You’re shameless. What do you mean by crying and not letting you leave?” Yu He rolled her eyes and said charmingly.</p>
  <p>Afterwards, Yu He asked after much hesitation. “Are you leaving again? Is it going to be for very long?”</p>
  <p>“After the new year, I may be leaving! Don’t worry, maybe there’ll be another way out then. Everything will turn out for the best!” Qing Shui raised his head and looked at Yu He’s unnaturally gloomy face.</p>
  <p>“You’ll be leaving after the new year? Will it be for very long?” Yu He might not have realized that there was attachment and reluctance in her tone.</p>
  <p>Looking at the brilliant elder sister in front of him, he thought of the complicated feelings between them. He recalled the mesmerizing first time they met, that well-rounded and sexy figure, that mature and poised pretty face, and the charming scene which happened between them the first time she called him lad…</p>
  <p>“Not sure. I might come back once a year, maybe 3-5 years!” Qing Shui thought about the notion of going to the Skysword Sect by himself. The Cang Lang Country was very far. Qing Shui had wanted to shift the whole Qing Clan to Cang Lang Country, but he had yet to finalize any plans on how to go about doing that.</p>
  <p>“Oh, seems like it’ll be hard for me to chase after you now. You have spread your wings, and will soon soar the skies. The only question is whether you’ll remember that you have a sister like me.” Yu He smiled and said.</p>
  <p>Although Yu He was smiling, Qing Shui could still tell that there was a strain in her smile. When he heard Yu He’s words, Qing Shui grinned and touched Yu He on the head. “Young lady, why think so much? Are you really satisfied with your current status? Don’t you want to reach Xiantian? Don’t you wish to go out to explore the vast world out there? Didn’t you ask if I would bring you along when I explore the world of the nine continents, wanting for me to bring you along?”</p>
  <p>Yu He was stunned as she looked at Qing Shui. Her eyes reflected hope, but it was soon replaced by a tinge of depression. “Across the world of the nine continents, there is no one who doesn’t wish to attain the realm of Xiantian, but it is too far away! One can see it, but never reach it!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui grinned and said, “If you don’t put in the effort, how would you know whether you won’t be able to reach it? Sister Yu, so long as you train hard, I’ll have a way to let you reach Xiantian in the future.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui thought that even if he were to have the means and abilities to get the ingredients to refine the Xiantian Golden Pellet, the requirement for one to take it would be to reach the pinnacle of Houtian.</p>
  <p>Seeing Yu He’s surprised and dubious gaze, Qing Shui had no choice but to continue his duping spirit. “You’ve seen for yourself my achievements to date. If you had not seen it with your own eyes, you definitely wouldn’t believe it. I can definitely make good on my words.”</p>
  <p>Yu He looked at Qing Shui’s determined gaze and thought back on what he had done for herself. Her grandfather was healed by his mysterious healing art. She realized that she did not really know him that well. But, she knew that he was good to her, and that was enough. Having thought it through, Yu He smiled brightly.</p>
  <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui thought of the Drunken Fragrance Fruit. The 100 fruits he had harvested were all still in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. It was really convenient to have this space. This was his biggest hidden trump card!</p>
  <p>Today, aside from visiting Yu He, he also wanted to test out the effects of this Drunken Fragrance Fruit. Qing Shui had wanted to use this to replace the black fish and turtles when necessary.</p>
  <p>Taking out a Drunken Fragrance Fruit, he passed it to Yu He and said, “Get someone to make an ordinary meat dish, and then add a little of this to it. Actually, make two pots of turtle soup instead. In the pot with the normal turtle, add this in. As for the other pot, make the All Aspect Nourishment Soup.”</p>
  <p>Yu He looked at the walnut-sized violet fruit, and when she thought of Qing Shui’s words, her eyes gleamed as she quickly left. When she returned, she sat besides Qing Shui and asked, “What was that little fruit?”</p>
  <p>A slight fragrance that was like that of orchids floated up to Qing Shui’s nose. He could not help but take in two deep breaths in a drunken state as he smiled and said, “Yu He, you smell really nice!”</p>
  <p>Yu He blushed at Qing Shui’s actions. “You rascal, quickly tell me what that fruit is, and what effects does it have?”</p>
  <p>“Drunken Fragrance Fruit! As for the effects, I’m not sure either!”</p>
  <p>Yu He looked helplessly at this man who had always given her surprises. She could only wait for the results. After all, he would always bring some surprises every time.</p>
  <p>After a while, Yu He asked Qing Shui what had happened recently. Qing Shui recalled that he still had a Golden-Ringed Snake Fruit, naturally he gave it to Yu He.</p>
  <p>After learning of its effects, Yu He accepted it without any hesitation. Qing Shui could only exclaim to himself how women would always care the most for their appearance and youth, no matter how beautiful they were.</p>
  <p>“Hmmm, what refreshing fragrance is that? It wasn’t so refreshing previously, it’s as if it is right in front of my eyes!” Yu He looked at Qing Shui in shock.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui closed his eyes and took in the refreshing smell that would make one want to drown in it. It was as if the fragrance directly entered one’s body. This was an intoxicating fragrance.</p>
  <p>Very soon, a waitress brought in two bowls of soup. Qing Shui saw that it was the same cute girl from before. Seeing that Qing Shui and Yu He were seated next to each other, she threw Qing Shui a crafty look as she blinked that pair of clear eyes!</p>
  <p>Between the two soups, one was the All Aspects Nourishment Soup, while the other was the normal soup with the Drunken Fragrance Fruit added. The intoxicating fragrance from earlier was the soup with the Drunken Fragrance Fruit.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, this smells even nicer than the All Aspects Nourishment Soup!” Yu He looked at the soup and then at Qing Shui in astonishment!</p>
  <p>“Have a taste, see what the taste is like. After all, this soup was made from normal turtles.” Qing Shui smiled. This situation was beyond his expectations. The reward from the 3rd level of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal would definitely be good. It had no other effects other than to make food taste delicious, therefore, taste wise, it would definitely be the best.</p>
  <p>“Right, I had forgotten that this was made from normal turtles until you reminded me. Let’s try it!” Yu He pulled Qing Shui and walked towards small side table where the two bowls of soup were sitting.</p>
  <p>Seeing Yu He holding onto his hand, Qing Shui thought to himself, “Is she thinking of making up with me because I’m leaving soon?”</p>
  <p>“This is really good, much better than the All Aspects Nourishment Soup. Qing Shui you try some!” Yu He sat down and impatiently took another sip of the turtle soup with the added Drunken Fragrance Fruit. She then scooped a spoonful and brought it to Qing Shui’s mouth.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was stunned. Yu He then realized that it was the spoon which she had just used, and it was too flirtatious. She was just about to retract it when Qing Shui quickly put it in his mouth and drank it all up in one go.</p>
  <p>The freshness that filled his mouth was top quality nectar. The feeling it gave was as if one was floating… simply indescribable. Most importantly, it was a feeling of losing one’s mind.</p>
  <p>“No wonder it’s called the Drunken Fragrance Fruit.”</p>

 <p>“Hmmm, what refreshing fragrance is that? It wasn’t so refreshing previously, it’s as if it is right in front of my eyes!” Yu He looked at Qing Shui in shock.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui closed his eyes and took in the refreshing smell that would make one want to drown in it. It was as if the fragrance directly entered one’s body. This was an intoxicating fragrance.</p>
 <p>Very soon, a waitress brought in two bowls of soup. Qing Shui saw that it was the same cute girl from before. Seeing that Qing Shui and Yu He were seated next to each other, she threw Qing Shui a crafty look as she blinked that pair of clear eyes!</p>
 <p>Between the two soups, one was the All Aspects Nourishment Soup, while the other was the normal soup with the Drunken Fragrance Fruit added. The intoxicating fragrance from earlier was the soup with the Drunken Fragrance Fruit.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, this smells even nicer than the All Aspects Nourishment Soup!” Yu He looked at the soup and then at Qing Shui in astonishment!</p>
 <p>“Have a taste, see what the taste is like. After all, this soup was made from normal turtles.” Qing Shui smiled. This situation was beyond his expectations. The reward from the 3rd level of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal would definitely be good. It had no other effects other than to make food taste delicious, therefore, taste wise, it would definitely be the best.</p>
 <p>“Right, I had forgotten that this was made from normal turtles until you reminded me. Let’s try it!” Yu He pulled Qing Shui and walked towards small side table where the two bowls of soup were sitting.</p>
 <p>Seeing Yu He holding onto his hand, Qing Shui thought to himself, “Is she thinking of making up with me because I’m leaving soon?”</p>
 <p>“This is really good, much better than the All Aspects Nourishment Soup. Qing Shui you try some!” Yu He sat down and impatiently took another sip of the turtle soup with the added Drunken Fragrance Fruit. She then scooped a spoonful and brought it to Qing Shui’s mouth.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. Yu He then realized that it was the spoon which she had just used, and it was too flirtatious. She was just about to retract it when Qing Shui quickly put it in his mouth and drank it all up in one go.</p>
 <p>The freshness that filled his mouth was top quality nectar. The feeling it gave was as if one was floating… simply indescribable. Most importantly, it was a feeling of losing one’s mind.</p>
 <p>“No wonder it’s called the Drunken Fragrance Fruit.”</p>
