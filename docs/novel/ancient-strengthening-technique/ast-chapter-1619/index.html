 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing what the elderly man said, Qing Shui smiled and said, "Of course!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man was the strongest person in the Nalan Clan and he was also the one with the highest level of seniority. Nalan Clan's Old Ancestor, Nalan Xinghai. When he saw how confident Qing Shui was, he knew that this young man wasn't simple. However, he hadn’t thought of the possibility that Qing Shui had any chance of defeating him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nalan Xinghai was able to push back the Phoenix Dance Amalgamation and in this place, he was undeniably the strongest. Right now, Nalan Clan's reputation was great and everyone had to show them some respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nalan Clan thought themselves as being very low profile. This time around, they believed that Qing Clan had gone overboard and walked all over them. They felt that while this young clan seemed to have some abilities, they didn't have enough in them to go up against the Nalan Clan. They thought that the Qing Clan didn't know any better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nalan Xinghai was a person with a fiery temper. However, he had lived for so many years after all and had gone through many things in his life. When he saw how powerful Luan Luan was, he changed his mind on letting the others from the clan to step out and fight. He decided to do it himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This would ensure that there wouldn't be any problems. Another reason was that he wanted to let the people here understand how powerful the Nalan Clan was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a flash, Qing Shui appeared in the sky, being only 50 meters away from the old man. This caused him to be slightly stunned. In a fight between the strong, this distance was considered to be very dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui continued to wear a faint smile as if he did not take this battle to heart. Despite that they were so close to each other, Nalan Xinghai still couldn't sense Qing Shui's abilities. This made him start assessing this young man very seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The aura that made Qing Shui seemed at ease and that he was exuding strong confidence made Nalan Xinghai felt a little uncomfortable. It was because in this situation if this young man wasn't one who would treat others with contempt, was arrogant or was ignorant, then he must be a person who was unfathomable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nalan Xinghai knew that Qing Shui wasn't an ignorant person, nor was he someone who would hold others in contempt. He was willing to save others without asking for anything in return, to get close to ordinary people. Through some information he had gotten, Nalan Xinghai had heard a lot about Qing Shui. He felt that this young man wasn't someone ignorant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Nalan Xinghai still had a lot of confidence. No matter what, Qing Shui was still very young, so how powerful could he be? Nalan Xinghai smiled and said to Qing Shui, "Let’s begin!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Please!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had nothing in his hands, seeming as if he had no plans on bringing out weapons. The old man seemed a little hesitant at this because he had already brought out a violet longsword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unhappy about this, the old man made the first move. When he did, Qing Shui moved as well. Qing Shui's speed was unbelievably fast and he punched out toward the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This punch made the old man astonished. It was now clear to him. It wasn't that Qing Shui was arrogant or ignorant, but that the old man himself was ignorant. The longsword which he had swung out was punched away domineeringly by Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Paragon Strike!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Qing Shui's Paragon Strike and it sent not only the old man's longsword flying but the old man as well. What Qing Shui wanted was to crush the old man's confidence in a single move, and to deal him with a serious injury. With that, even if Qing Shui were to leave, the Nalan Clan would not pose any threat to them. Right now, Yehuang Guwu's abilities were not to be underestimated and Wenren Wu-shuang, Canghai Mingyue, and Mingyue Gelou were all very strong as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yehuang Guwu was the strongest of them all with just the Tiger Form. As long as Nalan Xinghai no longer pose a threat to them, none of the others would be able to do anything to Yehuang Guwu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the Nalan Clan had managed to disband the Phoenix Dance Amalgamation, it only caused them to disband. They had managed to do so after Nalan Xinghai had killed their leader. In a situation when they had lost their leader, it was common for them to be disbanded. Recently, he had heard news that the Phoenix Dance Amalgamation had regrouped and planned on fighting it out with the Nalan Clan, to bring the Phoenix Dance Amalgamation back to fame again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man spurted out blood. This one strike had already damaged his internal organs. The old man did not have that much lifespan to begin with, but he shouldn't have any problems protecting the Nalan Xinghai for 100 years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Nalan Xinghai only had himself to blame for trying to find trouble with the Qing Clan. Qing Shui didn't have a good impression toward the people from the Nalan Clan and thus, with this strike, Nalan Xinghai would not be able to survive for more than three days. When the tree falls, the monkeys would scatter. Even if the Qing Clan did not do anything, the remnants of the Phoenix Dance Amalgamation would not let the Nalan Clan off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wouldn't comment on whether the Phoenix Dance Amalgamation was good or bad. There was no absolute right or wrong, only the balance of benefits or lack thereof. Therefore, to Qing Shui, as long as they did not come to create trouble for the Qing Clan, it wasn't of his concern who killed the other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Didn't we mention that there will be a condition afterward? I won't be too overboard. Since this matter is related to the Baima Clan's Young Miss, the Nalan Clan should just let the Baima Clan break off the engagement. This way, then there wouldn't be any hard feelings between everyone. What do you think?" Qing Clan smiled and looked at Nalan Xinghai.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nalan Xinghai nodded slowly, feeling very disheartened. It was over for the Nalan Clan. Even if Qing Shui didn't raise this condition, it would still be over for the Nalan Clan. The only reason Qing Shui brought this up was just to protect the Baima Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An old man from the Baima Clan looked thankfully toward Qing Clan. After all, it was over for Nalan Xinghai and if anyone wished to wipe out the Nalan Clan, as their in-laws, the Baima Clan would easily be brought into this conflict. This one word from Qing Shui could save the Baima Clan since many people would feel that he had said so in order to form a relationship through a wedding with the Baima Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man agreed and Qing Shui left the arena, saying to the people from the Qing Clan, "Come on, let's head back home!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The members of Qing Clan returned home happily, whereas every single person from the Nalan Clan seemed to be carrying huge stones that weighed 1,000 Jin on their backs. Each of them wore grim countenances and other than a minority of those from the third generation and most of the elders, everyone knew what this loss meant for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nalan Clan had lost their status, and most people still had not realized that it wasn't just that status. Nalan Clan now faced the threat of being wiped out. It was because most of them didn't know how the old man's injuries were and thought that he would be fine after returning home and recuperate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was just a single move. Many people were still thinking how Qing Shui had defeated Nalan Xinghai in a single move. What kind of person was Nalan Xinghai? He was an expert who had killed the leader of the Phoenix Dance Amalgamation and caused them to be disbanded. For an expert like him to be defeated in a single move, if they didn't witness this for themselves, they wouldn't have believed that it was true.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nalan Clan had many people, but there was only one of them at Nalan Xinghai's level. As for the others who were also False God cultivators, they were a far cry from Nalan Xinghai. Yehuang Guwu alone would be able to deal with them. After all, her Tiger Form was a Paragon and even amongst Paragons, it was also quite a top-notch skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a Paragon that came from anomaly. Even Qing Shui had nothing to pick about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How's Nalan Clan's Old Ancestor?" Yehuang Guwu asked Qing Shui. She was carrying her daughter while Hai Dongqing carried her son for her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"With you around, no one else will be a threat to the Qing Clan now." Qing Shui smiled and said. The answer was very clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yehuang Guwu smiled, "Very soon, even Nalan Clan's Old Ancestor would be thrown far away behind me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui believed her. With Yehuang Guwu in the Qing Clan, Qing Shui felt assured. Although some of his wives weren't in the Qing Clan, with their own things to do, there were still a number of them who stayed in the Qing Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yuan Su had placed her attention on the Imperial Cuisine Hall. Her reputation as a female miraculous physician had surpassed even Qing Shui's. After all, Qing Shui didn't spend much time here. Canghai Mingyue, Mingyue Gelou, Huoyun Liu-Li and Zhu Qing set up their own trade associations and their businesses expanded. They primarily trade medicinal herbs and medicinal ingredients from demonic beasts. They then expanded to start up their cloth shop, dealing primarily with beast hide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hai Dongqing stayed alone in Qing Clan's backyard. Her cultivation had reached a crucial point and she was getting ready to go into seclusion at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After returning home, Qing Shui was overwhelmed with emotions. He didn't know if his women felt tired. Suddenly, he wanted to let them take suitable breaks to relax and enjoy life, not wanting them to be too suppressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"In the future, all of you can do what you want to do. Don't be forcing yourself to cultivate, especially if you face a bottleneck and can't progress any further." When they were alone, Qing Shui said to the ladies, smiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The few ladies looked at Qing Shui, dumbfounded. Although what Qing Shui said made sense, he had emphasized that they shouldn't slack in their cultivation. Either you keep on forging ahead, or you'll end up falling behind. They must force themselves to cultivate and get into good conditions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Cultivation isn't all there is in life. There are many other things as well. If your cultivation continues to progress, then continue to spend some time cultivating every day, fully focusing without any distractions. If you arrive at an obstacle, then do some things that you like to do. It might be a lot better than if you were to keep cultivating." Qing Shui said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Qing Shui's serious expression, they knew that he was serious. Yehuang Guwu smiled and said, "That is what I'm doing now. If I wish to cultivate, I'll spend some time on it. If I don't, I'll either play with the kids or go and take a look at the trade association. It's good!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the afternoon, two people came to visit. Qing Shui was surprised by the guests. It was Nalan Ping and a plainly dressed married lady. The way the married lady walked was with a bit of a limp and she was a little old. However, she looked very amiable and was pleasant looking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, Qing Shui was playing with the few kids in the front courtyard. When he heard the sounds at the door and told them to come in, he realized that it was Nalan Ping and this lady. Very soon, he knew that this lady was Nalan Ping's mother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Why have you come to our Qing Clan?" Qing Shui asked curiously, wearing a faint smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The Qing Clan is kind and righteous. I hope to be able to find a place of protection. Mister, can you take us in?" Nalan Ping looked at Qing Shui and said calmly. Even when he was saying this, he still didn't give the feeling that he was beneath others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. When they were at the arena earlier, he had a good impression of this young man and had even thought of imparting him with Taichi. With his talent, this young man would be able to go very far on the path of Taichi. However, it was just a passing thought. After all, he was a member of the Nalan Clan. Although Qing Shui knew that Nalan Ping wasn't well-treated by the Nalan Clan, there was still Nalan Clan's blood running in him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, to think that he came to ask to be taken in. Qing Shui wasn't sure if he was a wolf. In normal circumstances, people with such a character would not become a wolf. [1]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mister is afraid that I'll harm the members of Qing Clan?" Nalan Ping smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui almost lost his calm before a junior. He shook his head slightly, "You're a filial son and you love your mother. If you're really thinking of doing that you won't bring your mother with you. moreover, I heard that you've never recognized yourself as a member of the Nalan Clan. Is that right?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nalan Ping smiled, "Mister, you have excellent judgment. There are some things that I really don't want to say. Everything about the Nalan Clan is of no concern to me. I'm a person who doesn't seek fame and reputation. I only hope that my mother is safe. Moreover, I also wish to be by her side. Right now, this place is the quietest and safest. In this world, my mother is my only kin. Would Mister be able to help me with this?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">[1] Assume that it refers to the possibility of him being a wolf in sheep's clothing.</span></p>
