  <p dir="ltr"><strong>474 - Surmounting All Difficulties</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not dare to be careless as he circulated the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Frenzied Bull's Strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Big Dipper Sword!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Plus the 10% increase of Frenzied Bull's Strength effects from the belt! Adding the Technique and armor, and now the Frenzied Bull's Strength effect also added another 80% to his strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even without the Godly Force Talisman, Qing Shui’s strength had already reach the strength of four countries!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Tai!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Feng Mingze shouted and the Sword Qi, from the sword in his hand, slashed towards Qing Shui!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">From this slash, there were many crackling sounds in the air, the earth on both side of its path were uprooted.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Roar!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui roared like a tiger, the Big Dipper Sword doing a similar hacking motion, moving towards the Sword Qi at a speed faster than it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was a large explosion, the rock path had a ninety centimeters deep fissure, its width about ten meters!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s current defense was terrifying, in addition to the Golden-Ringed Battle Armor, he was practically a demon in human form, Qing Shui, who had just received the move, rushed towards the old man in the midst of the smoke!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The most direct swordsmanship was also the most effective!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Basic Sword Techniques!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">One with Heaven! The Basic Sword Techniques, that had been practiced for umpteen times, moved like flowing water!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Feng Mingze’s eyes opened wide in shock, as though he had seen a ghost, he could not image that someone could train the Basic Sword Techniques to this level.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The originally non-fancy Basic Sword Techniques, under Qing Shui’s execution, had a simple atmosphere, it was direct and wide but skillful and dominating, every move had Qing Shui’s strong vigor infused into it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Only then, Feng Mingze knew that Qing Shui’s swordsmanship had an unyielding momentum, the shock shook all his bones and organs.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Art of Pursuing!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui crossed swords with his opponent again, this sword decided the fate of the old man!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The old man, who had his speed reduced by 20% and his weight increased by 20%, was being toyed around by Qing Shui, very soon afterward, the old man spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If Qing Shui had not used him as practice for his swordsmanship, he could have finished off the old man in no time. In this battle, Qing Shui could feel a significant improvement in his Basic Sword Techniques.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a very ordinary stab, the old man blocked it with his sword, after blocking it he was pushed aside, he had underestimated the strength of this sword, seeing that the sword was aimed at his heart.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although he had the battle armor to protect him, it was targeted at the chest and the Nature Energy had successfully pierced through it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Inconceivably, there had been no changes in the old man’s expressions, but his internal organs were all ruptured!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the results of Qing Shui’s great strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Plop!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly stepped over the old man and continued walking forward!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had almost arrived at the backyard!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt an indistinct air of strength, Qing Shui knew the Feng Clan’s ruler was here; the Feng Clan’s central figure and the strongest.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hahaha. the younger generations will surpass us in time, this old man had underestimated you too much!” Four old men walked out slowly, each one of them had white hair extending to their waists.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With deep blue pupils and dry skin, yet with a likable air. They say that the elderly are the treasures of a family because they have experience and knowledge that most people do not.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the World of the Nine Continents, the strongest cultivators were basically all elderlies, just like the old demon in front of him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Given the current situation, why do you insist in interfering! If you leave now, I will let you go!” Qing Shui looked at the few elders in front of him and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The difference with before would be when Qing Shui had said this, it would have caused his opponents to mock him, but now, no one felt that it was arrogant anymore.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Boy, we have already lived to this age, we can no longer make elementary mistakes, If we do, we would rather just die. Furthermore, you might not necessarily win today, so you are better off trying to figure out how to get past us!” One of the old men said, talking about life and death as though it was casual gossip, this had caused Qing Shui to be very impressed with his outlook on life.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought about Feng Yu’s words, The Feng Clan was not devoid of good people, it was just that there were some mistakes that they knew were wrong but had to persist on. Even the large clans cannot escape the clutches of the secular world, the death of Feng Yunyang was just the trigger, in addition with Qing Shui’s ravings…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">All of this &nbsp;had caused many people to become involved but were unable to pull out. At this moment, life seemed so insignificant!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui silently watched these old men!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Junior greets seniors, I take back what I just said, it looks like I have to offend you all.” Qing Shui raised his head and said. Before trying to persuade them, why didn’t he persuade himself first? There are some things that needed to be resolved.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Come, don’t go easy, or else the one to lose his life will be you!” The previous old man drew his silver-white longsword.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If not for the antagonistic relationship, Qing Shui felt that he would have been willing to be friends with these few old man, but due to the cruel twist of fate, the first time they met, they had to kill each other.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cloudmist Steps!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui decided to make the first move, to seize the advantage!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The unhesitating Qing Shui decided to end this battle quickly, each of the elders in front of him was stronger than the previous old men. Furthermore, they had good synergy with each other, it was no longer a simple addition of strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Art of Pursuing!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui activated it immediately!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Others did not know, only the people afflicted by the Art of Pursuing would understand what it felt like!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Under the cooperation of 4 people, Qing Shui was knocked down by one of them. However, it was insignificant, Qing Shui had avoided the blow, and the remnant force had not injured him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, the enormous defense had shown its decisive role, If Qing Shui’s defense had been weaker, especially that of his organs, then with the earlier strike, his organs would have been injured.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In a battle between cultivators, there was very little chance of a weapon coming in contact with the opponent’s body. However, once that happened, it usually resulted in severe injury or death.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When two or more people fight, it wouldn’t take very long. The Xiantian Qi in the Dantian cannot last that long. It was hard to differentiate a winner between scholars but not martial artists, even between two equivalent cultivators, a winner would emerge quickly. There are too many factors that can influence the battle; strength and cultivation level only gave a rough guide. Factors that can influence the battle includes judgement, experience, environment, equipment, reflex, etc …</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Very soon, all four of the old men were inflicted with the Art of Pursuing. Originally, they were not as fast as Qing Shui, but now, they were even slower. Speed is power. Above a certain level, speed provides an absolute advantage. With speed, you had the options of attacking or defending.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Lifting the heavy as though it was light!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s Big Dipper Sword, which weighed 3000 Jin, fiercely swung down, the move he used was even from the Basic Sword Techniques, it had almost reached a realm where it would leave people dazzled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everything has a weakness, expect for speed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Che!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took the opportunity to stab the longsword in his left hand into the cerebellum of one of the old men, who then fell to the ground, whether he was still alive, it was unknown!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Heavenly Protection!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui once again used the same method to fell another person!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The remaining two people were not able to last longer than the time it took for a pot of tea to brew, they were stabbed by Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the four old men lying on the ground and sighed. He then moved toward the backyard that was within his vision, the atmosphere there was even more distinct.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui thought back, he had defeated twenty-seven elder level people and eight supreme elder level people by himself. How big was the Feng Clan actually? Just based on this, it should already account for about 80% of the Feng Clan’s strength.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Twenty-seven early Peak Martial Kings with the strength of two countries, eight with the strength of three countries, it was already a terrifying force.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although the authority of the Feng Clan within the Starmoon hall was great, but these were the people of the Feng Clan in the first place. Maybe they did not even invite any outside help, or even had the qualifications to ask for help!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took resolute steps toward the Feng Clan’s backyard!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, the Feng Clan’s main gate was blasted open, many cultivators were pouring in!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Just carry on, we are just passing by!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“We are just here to observe!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Finally, we can see.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, it was suffocating earlier!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Many people poured into the Feng Clan, stopping at a distance of 100 meters away from Qing Shui, joking with each other. Those within the 100 meters radius would not know how they died when it happened.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Since the cultivators below had broken into the Feng Clan, those with flying beast flew directly into the airspace of the Feng Clan. The sky was full of flying beasts, the multitude of colours were spectacular.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Cultivators with flying beasts were few, but now, the skies were filled with them. Those with weaker flying beasts huddled together, not daring to offend those with higher ranked flying beast.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two girls and Cang Wuya flew into the Feng Clan without restriction. The might of the Fire Bird was considered top notch, but there were flying beasts that were stronger than it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was a girl, riding on a huge Ice Crane; its body was pure blue, larger than the Fire Bird by several times. It was the largest flying beast out of all around here; when its wings were spread, the wingspan was at least 50 meters, covering the sky.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The girl was wearing a large conical bamboo hat, her looks couldn’t be seen, she was also wearing a blue dress of the same tone as the Ice Crane. She had a curvy figure and looked very graceful. Maybe it was due to the ice blue color of the Ice Crane, but it felt like the girl had a cold personality.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The position of the Ice Crane was the highest, it was very eye-catching and conspicuous. The huge blue flying beast looked prettier than the fiery-red Fire Bird, it was a type of gorgeous beauty.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What a pretty Ice Crane and pretty person!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Since when the did Greencloud Continent have this kind of character? This Ice Crane is probably a peak Martial King level beast.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Could it be a passing cultivator from another continent!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Zhao`er, if you don’t wish to die, do not go and provoke her, she won’t even bother looking at you,” said an old man to the boy riding on the silver eagle with him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Bloody Butcher, please don’t interfere with today’s matter” Feng Shamo quietly said to the red-faced old man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The only people left drinking tea here were Feng Shamo and that red-faced old man, the servants, and the other weaker Feng Clan members had already left.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Old Man Feng, do you think I can’t beat this kid?” the red-faced man joked, his face looking very gentle and benign, but only those familiar to him knew how his nickname, Bloody Butcher, came about.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Only then, Feng Mingze knew that Qing Shui’s swordsmanship had an unyielding momentum, the shock shook all his bones and organs.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Art of Pursuing!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui crossed swords with his opponent again, this sword decided the fate of the old man!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The old man, who had his speed reduced by 20% and his weight increased by 20%, was being toyed around by Qing Shui, very soon afterward, the old man spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If Qing Shui had not used him as practice for his swordsmanship, he could have finished off the old man in no time. In this battle, Qing Shui could feel a significant improvement in his Basic Sword Techniques.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pu!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was a very ordinary stab, the old man blocked it with his sword, after blocking it he was pushed aside, he had underestimated the strength of this sword, seeing that the sword was aimed at his heart.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although he had the battle armor to protect him, it was targeted at the chest and the Nature Energy had successfully pierced through it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Inconceivably, there had been no changes in the old man’s expressions, but his internal organs were all ruptured!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was the results of Qing Shui’s great strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Plop!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly stepped over the old man and continued walking forward!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He had almost arrived at the backyard!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt an indistinct air of strength, Qing Shui knew the Feng Clan’s ruler was here; the Feng Clan’s central figure and the strongest.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hahaha. the younger generations will surpass us in time, this old man had underestimated you too much!” Four old men walked out slowly, each one of them had white hair extending to their waists.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With deep blue pupils and dry skin, yet with a likable air. They say that the elderly are the treasures of a family because they have experience and knowledge that most people do not.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the World of the Nine Continents, the strongest cultivators were basically all elderlies, just like the old demon in front of him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Given the current situation, why do you insist in interfering! If you leave now, I will let you go!” Qing Shui looked at the few elders in front of him and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The difference with before would be when Qing Shui had said this, it would have caused his opponents to mock him, but now, no one felt that it was arrogant anymore.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Boy, we have already lived to this age, we can no longer make elementary mistakes, If we do, we would rather just die. Furthermore, you might not necessarily win today, so you are better off trying to figure out how to get past us!” One of the old men said, talking about life and death as though it was casual gossip, this had caused Qing Shui to be very impressed with his outlook on life.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui thought about Feng Yu’s words, The Feng Clan was not devoid of good people, it was just that there were some mistakes that they knew were wrong but had to persist on. Even the large clans cannot escape the clutches of the secular world, the death of Feng Yunyang was just the trigger, in addition with Qing Shui’s ravings…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">All of this &nbsp;had caused many people to become involved but were unable to pull out. At this moment, life seemed so insignificant!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui silently watched these old men!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Junior greets seniors, I take back what I just said, it looks like I have to offend you all.” Qing Shui raised his head and said. Before trying to persuade them, why didn’t he persuade himself first? There are some things that needed to be resolved.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Come, don’t go easy, or else the one to lose his life will be you!” The previous old man drew his silver-white longsword.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If not for the antagonistic relationship, Qing Shui felt that he would have been willing to be friends with these few old man, but due to the cruel twist of fate, the first time they met, they had to kill each other.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cloudmist Steps!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui decided to make the first move, to seize the advantage!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The unhesitating Qing Shui decided to end this battle quickly, each of the elders in front of him was stronger than the previous old men. Furthermore, they had good synergy with each other, it was no longer a simple addition of strength.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Art of Pursuing!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui activated it immediately!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Others did not know, only the people afflicted by the Art of Pursuing would understand what it felt like!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Under the cooperation of 4 people, Qing Shui was knocked down by one of them. However, it was insignificant, Qing Shui had avoided the blow, and the remnant force had not injured him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, the enormous defense had shown its decisive role, If Qing Shui’s defense had been weaker, especially that of his organs, then with the earlier strike, his organs would have been injured.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In a battle between cultivators, there was very little chance of a weapon coming in contact with the opponent’s body. However, once that happened, it usually resulted in severe injury or death.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When two or more people fight, it wouldn’t take very long. The Xiantian Qi in the Dantian cannot last that long. It was hard to differentiate a winner between scholars but not martial artists, even between two equivalent cultivators, a winner would emerge quickly. There are too many factors that can influence the battle; strength and cultivation level only gave a rough guide. Factors that can influence the battle includes judgement, experience, environment, equipment, reflex, etc …</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Very soon, all four of the old men were inflicted with the Art of Pursuing. Originally, they were not as fast as Qing Shui, but now, they were even slower. Speed is power. Above a certain level, speed provides an absolute advantage. With speed, you had the options of attacking or defending.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Lifting the heavy as though it was light!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s Big Dipper Sword, which weighed 3000 Jin, fiercely swung down, the move he used was even from the Basic Sword Techniques, it had almost reached a realm where it would leave people dazzled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everything has a weakness, expect for speed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Che!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took the opportunity to stab the longsword in his left hand into the cerebellum of one of the old men, who then fell to the ground, whether he was still alive, it was unknown!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Heavenly Protection!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui once again used the same method to fell another person!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The remaining two people were not able to last longer than the time it took for a pot of tea to brew, they were stabbed by Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the four old men lying on the ground and sighed. He then moved toward the backyard that was within his vision, the atmosphere there was even more distinct.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui thought back, he had defeated twenty-seven elder level people and eight supreme elder level people by himself. How big was the Feng Clan actually? Just based on this, it should already account for about 80% of the Feng Clan’s strength.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Twenty-seven early Peak Martial Kings with the strength of two countries, eight with the strength of three countries, it was already a terrifying force.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although the authority of the Feng Clan within the Starmoon hall was great, but these were the people of the Feng Clan in the first place. Maybe they did not even invite any outside help, or even had the qualifications to ask for help!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took resolute steps toward the Feng Clan’s backyard!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, the Feng Clan’s main gate was blasted open, many cultivators were pouring in!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Just carry on, we are just passing by!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“We are just here to observe!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Finally, we can see.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, it was suffocating earlier!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Many people poured into the Feng Clan, stopping at a distance of 100 meters away from Qing Shui, joking with each other. Those within the 100 meters radius would not know how they died when it happened.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Since the cultivators below had broken into the Feng Clan, those with flying beast flew directly into the airspace of the Feng Clan. The sky was full of flying beasts, the multitude of colours were spectacular.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cultivators with flying beasts were few, but now, the skies were filled with them. Those with weaker flying beasts huddled together, not daring to offend those with higher ranked flying beast.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The two girls and Cang Wuya flew into the Feng Clan without restriction. The might of the Fire Bird was considered top notch, but there were flying beasts that were stronger than it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was a girl, riding on a huge Ice Crane; its body was pure blue, larger than the Fire Bird by several times. It was the largest flying beast out of all around here; when its wings were spread, the wingspan was at least 50 meters, covering the sky.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The girl was wearing a large conical bamboo hat, her looks couldn’t be seen, she was also wearing a blue dress of the same tone as the Ice Crane. She had a curvy figure and looked very graceful. Maybe it was due to the ice blue color of the Ice Crane, but it felt like the girl had a cold personality.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The position of the Ice Crane was the highest, it was very eye-catching and conspicuous. The huge blue flying beast looked prettier than the fiery-red Fire Bird, it was a type of gorgeous beauty.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What a pretty Ice Crane and pretty person!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Since when the did Greencloud Continent have this kind of character? This Ice Crane is probably a peak Martial King level beast.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Could it be a passing cultivator from another continent!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Zhao`er, if you don’t wish to die, do not go and provoke her, she won’t even bother looking at you,” said an old man to the boy riding on the silver eagle with him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Bloody Butcher, please don’t interfere with today’s matter” Feng Shamo quietly said to the red-faced old man.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The only people left drinking tea here were Feng Shamo and that red-faced old man, the servants, and the other weaker Feng Clan members had already left.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Old Man Feng, do you think I can’t beat this kid?” the red-faced man joked, his face looking very gentle and benign, but only those familiar to him knew how his nickname, Bloody Butcher, came about.</p>
