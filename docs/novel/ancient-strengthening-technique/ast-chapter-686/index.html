 <p><strong>AST 686 - The mighty Jade Emperor Queen Bee Butchering the White Jade Jiao!</strong></p>
 <p>Art of Pursuing!</p>
 <p>Reduce the opponent’s speed by 20% and increase their body weight by 20%!</p>
 <p>20%, that’s quite a lot!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s speed doubled whereas the opponent’s speed got reduced by 20%. In that case, even though Qing Shui wasn’t able to evade it, he was still able to retreat with his entire body by using the Taichi Diversion technique.</p>
 <p>However, the Frost Breath that the opponent used was still considerably strong. People with insufficient strength would immediately be frozen by it. Worse, they might even be frozen to death immediately and get swallowed by the White Jade Jiao.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had a formidable physical body. Adding in with the mysterious Yin-Yang Image and his Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique, he was able to thaw out from the ice. Even so, he was unable to use the Taichi Diversion Technique due to a time shortage.</p>
 <p>Critical Damage!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui grabbed the opportunity to use the Critical Damage which would enable him to ignore half of the opponent’s defense. Even so, the most he could do was just injure the White Jade Jiao slightly. This level of damage wasn’t threatening enough to the enormous White Jade Jiao.</p>
 <p>On the contrary, it was enraged by the attacks.</p>
 <p>Primordial Flame!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui threw out two bundles of the upgraded Primordial Flame Ball. This caused the enormous White Jade Jiao to roll on the ground to evade. Soon after, it breathed out a thick icy air towards the two Primordial Flame Ball.</p>
 <p>Chi-chi!</p>
 <p>Two powerful noises thundered out. The primordial flames which had ascended to a new grade wasn’t something which the White Jade Jiao was able to deal with. It started circling around the ground vigorously with its enormous body.</p>
 <p>Hu!</p>
 <p>It breathed out an intense icy breath.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Pu-pu!</p>
 <p>The Primordial Flame Balls were blocked by the Pure Jade Jiao. The thing the White Jade Jiao breathed out was actually an ice blade that materialized. The weapon was something which was formed as a result of the Core Qi within the Core of the demonic beast condensing together. It shot down the Primordial Flame Balls straight away.</p>
 <p>Chi-chi!</p>
 <p>The two Primordial Flame Balls, which dropped down on the snowy ground, immediately disappeared. A big part of the area however, was melted as a result of the fireballs dropping. Nevertheless, Qing Shui felt really happy because he found out that the White Jade Jiao was afraid of the primordial flames.</p>
 <p>Ang-ang!</p>
 <p>The White Jade Jiao loosed a few roars into the sky and shocked a lot of flying beasts in the surroundings. There was a mighty rage within its roar. Within it, there was also a strong desire to demonstrate its ability.</p>
 <p>Hu!</p>
 <p>Two primordial flames, which were two foot long, once again appeared on Qing Shui’s palm. After that, they quickly turned into two fireballs. Qing Shui swiftly tossed them out at the moment the White Jade Jiao was moving around uneasily.</p>
 <p>He tossed them out with the Hidden Weapons technique.</p>
 <p>The two Primordial Flame Balls swiftly flew towards the White Jade Jiao while it was moving around in dismay. The way it moved with its enormous body on the ground looked particularly stunning.</p>
 <p>Right at the moment it was about to open up its mouth and shot out an icy breath, Qing Shui made his move.</p>
 <p>Demon Binding Ropes!</p>
 <p>The Demon Binding Ropes was cast out instantaneously and could reach the opponent’s body in just a moment. Even if it wasn’t able to bind the opponent, it still had an insane ability. It was capable of interrupting the opponent’s attack the first time it was cast out.</p>
 <p>If there was a huge difference in strength, it would lose its functionality after the first time. As long as it couldn’t to bind the opponent, it wouldn’t have any effect the second time it was cast out.</p>
 <p>This was because Demon Binding Ropes was filled with abundant spiritual energy the first time it was cast out. When there was a huge difference in strength between it and the opponent, it would consume half of the Qi on the first try. In order to have similar effect on the second try, one would need to wait for it to recover its Qi. Unfortunately, most of the time, there wasn’t enough time to wait for this to happen.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s intention was just to interrupt his opponent’s attack. Even though it only managed to delay it for a bit, it was more than enough. The two Primordial Flame Balls shot towards the head of the WhiteJade Jiao.</p>
 <p>The White Jade Jiao avoided it with its agile movement.</p>
 <p>As if Qing Shui would let it do as it pleased!</p>
 <p>Burst!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui screamed. As soon as he did so, the two primordial flames collided with each other.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>After they burst, they turned into countless shattered flames the size of human fingers. The Twin Dragon Explosion this time was a few times more powerful than before it upgraded.</p>
 <p>It happened really suddenly. Additionally, the instantaneous collision and explosion of the primordial flames became a few times faster than before. It swiftly rushed towards the head of the White Jade Jiao.</p>
 <p>Ang-ang…...</p>
 <p>For a moment, a thunderous screeching and angry noise could be heard in the sky. The White Jade Jiao struggled mightily with its body, causing a mess around the snowy area in the surroundings. As a result, the snow mountains around them also began to collapse. In a short while, the sky became full of snowflakes and the area around him turned into ruins.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui spotted scarlet blood on the snowy ground. He suspected that it might have been from the eyes of the White Jade Jiao which were damaged by the primordial flames.</p>
 <p>No matter how large a demonic beast was, their eyes would still be their most vulnerable organs. Even if their eyes were the size of small aquariums, a primordial flame which was only the size of a finger was more than enough to blind it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn't sure if he blinded one or two of its eyes.</p>
 <p>Anggggh!</p>
 <p>The White Jade Jiao furiously glared at Qing Shu. its left eye had been blinded and blood was still flowing ou tof a terrible wound. If the White Jade Jiao hadn't had a formidable physical body, it would have been burnt to death by the primordial flames.</p>
 <p>Huuu!</p>
 <p>With its body curled, the White Jade Jiao abruptly threw itself at Qing Shui. After that, it shot out an intense Frost Breath from its mouth. Simultaneously, it also raised its body and whipped its thick tail at Qing Shui. It did all of this at an incredible speed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had long since prepared Primordial Flame Balls in his hand. He formed an up-and-down formation with his hands. One to aim towards the face of the White Jade Jiao, which was already scarred, while the other one was to aim for the stomach where its Core was located.</p>
 <p>After tossing out two primordial flames, Qing Shui immediately summoned the Jade Emperor Queen Bee.</p>
 <p>The Jade Emperor Queen Bee swiftly used the Poison Killer Sting, a Poison Killer Sting which contained a few times more poison than it did in the past.</p>
 <p>Anggg!</p>
 <p>A faint pink powder emerged from the body of the White Jade Jiao. The wounds that had been inflicted on it originally turned even more terrifying. The rate at which the blood was flowing out also became several times faster.</p>
 <p>Damage Increase!</p>
 <p>Until now, Qing Shui still wasn’t sure about what poison was contained in the Poison Killer Sting of the Jade Emperor Queen Bee. It seemed to change from time to time. This was also the first time the Jade Emperor Queen Bee used this poison since it had evolved.</p>
 <p>Following the loss of blood of the White Jade Jiao, Qing Shui used his spiritual sense to feel the strength of it. He could feel that not only was its strength dropping significantly, even its life energy was decreasing. He had finally come to realize what was happening. This was just the same as back then when he was facing off against the Sect Head of the Ten Thousand Poisons Sect.</p>
 <p>The effect of the Poison Killer Sting of the Jade Emperor Queen Bee was Damage Increase. By doing so, the enemy’s strength would drop and their lifespan would be reduced. It seemed to be somehow related to the enemy’s injuries. The heavier the damage it had taken, the larger effect the poison needles of the Jade Emperor Queen Bee would have.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui never expected for the Poison Needle Sting of the Jade Emperor Queen Bee to be this strong. It caused the enemy’s strength to drop and lifespan to decrease. Even Qing Shui himself found it hard to believe the ridiculous amount of reduction in strength caused by the sting.</p>
 <p>Five thousand and three hundred countries!</p>
 <p>At the moment the poison needle showed its effect, the strength of the White Jade Jiao dropped all the way down to only five thousand and three hundred countries. The injuries caused from before were still quite serious but because of the Poison Killer Sting, blood stopped flowing out of its injuries. Now, Qing Shui finally had a chance of winning the battle,.</p>
 <p>Diamond Gigantic Elephant!</p>
 <p>Gold-Silver Colored Butterfly!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly summoned them and rode on the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. The Gold-Silver Colored Butterfly followed from behind. The entire scene looked really spectacular.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui never thought that he would be able to reduce the strength of a White Jade Jiao, which was around twelve thousand countries, to this extent. Especially towards the end when the Jade Emperor Queen Bee used its poison. It was so insanely powerful. Unfortunately, the limit to which it could be used was too restrictive.</p>
 <p>State of One with Elephant!</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion!</p>
 <p>Shield Attack!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rode on the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and swiftly rushed towards the White Jade Jiao. He bashed out with the Violet Gold Divine Shield that was in his hand very quickly.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Originally, Qing Shui’s strength was already not inferior to that of the White Jade Jiao. By adding in the effect of the State of One with Elephant as well as Shield Attack, even the enormous Pure Jade Jiao would be blown away.</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion</p>
 <p>Diamond Sword Qi!</p>
 <p>Shield Attack!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui once again charged towards the White Jade Jiao that got blown away by his previous attack. He once again hammered ferociously on the White Jade Jiao with his Violet Gold Divine Shield.</p>
 <p>Combination Sword Techniques!</p>
 <p>Beng!</p>
 <p>After that, Qing Shui began to one-sidedly attack the enormous White Jade Jiao. While he was doing so, the White Jade Jiao continuously let out thunderous roars. Its cries were filled with rage.</p>
 <p>Ang!</p>
 <p>At the moment the White Jade Jiao once again got blown away, it curled up its enormous body and started spinning around the ground. After that, it swiftly soared up into the sky. Its hundred meter thick body truly resembled that of an enormous dragon.</p>
 <p>Hu!</p>
 <p>The icy breath that it let out in the air was totally different from the one on the ground. Simultaneously, it whipped its tail across the sky towards Qing Shui. The attack actually possessed more power when in air than on the ground.</p>
 <p>It’s always been a fact that a tiger would be much stronger once it went up a mountain and a dragon would be even stronger once it soared up the sky. Despite the White Jade Jiao not being a dragon, it still possessed the ability to do so.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s strength was nothing inferior to that of the White Jade Jiao. Under this kind of circumstance, he still had ways to kill the White Jade Jiao.</p>
 <p>Hidden Weapon!</p>
 <p>The current Hidden Weapon wasn’t effective in the sky. The White Jade Jiao that was at a disadvantage finally learned from its mistakes. It could barely dodge Qing Shui’s attacks. It was just that it looked like it was struggling to do so.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui waited until his opponent was weak to deliver consecutive blows. He even used the Twin Dragon Explosion. The moment when the White Jade Jiao moved back, Qing Shui charged towards it.</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion!</p>
 <p>Critical Damage!</p>
 <p>The previous Critical Damage wasn’t really effective against the White Jade Jiao. However, it had turned out to be the most fatal killer now. Qing Shui penetrated through the head of the malevolent creature with his Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>Its enormous head got directly sliced open by Qing Shui. The sharp and precise strength of Qing Shui’s sword immediately destroyed the head of the White Jade Jiao.</p>
 <p>A short, yet powerless, cry rang out. After that, the White Jade Jiao fell down onto the ground.</p>
 <p>Dong!</p>
 <p>The huge noise caused even the earth itself to vibrate.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned for a moment. After that, he gradually dropped down onto the ground. He never thought that he would actually be able to kill that huge beast. His original intention was only to steal the Ice Snow Sacred Fruit Tree. He never expected that he would actually end up killing the White Jade Jiao.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui first moved the Ice Snow Sacred Fruit Tree into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. This thing was like a treasure to him. In the future, his demonic beasts would still need to rely on this to raise their strength.</p>
 <p>Even though the Ice Snow Sacred Fruit Tree was only one meter tall, its roots penetrated really deeply into the ground. It was about fifty meters long. Qing Shui pulled it out perfectly. After that, he created a hole which was almost as big within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and planted it in the hole.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn't concerned whether the Ice Snow Sacred Fruit Tree would survive. Throughout all these years, Qing Shui hadn't found anything which couldn't survive within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>After tidying up everything, Qing Shui went out of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He had earned a lot from his trip to the Mountain of Longevity this time. It was a really worthwhile journey.</p>
 <p>It would have been perfect if he could find the Three Tailed Immortal Fox Blood. But it’s better to not be greedy since it’s already a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be able to kill the White Jade Jiao and obtain the Ice Snow Sacred Fruit.</p>
