  <p><strong>AST 251 – Coolsteel Boots, the feeling of boots and women </strong></p>
  <p>The turbulent wind precedes the mountain storm!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui cast off all the distracting thoughts in his mind and he immersed himself in dull and dry training. Ever since he practised Duo Cultivation with Qinghan Ye, his abilities were enhanced greatly. The liquid the size of a grape in his diaphragm was now the size of a walnut, the energy contained in the core of it was frighteningly pure.</p>
  <p>It’s a pity that he hadn’t broke through the ninety day cycle. Qing Shui was now expectant of the capabilities of the ninety days cycle, after all it was not easy to attain the fifth Heavenly Layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique – one could only look for an opportunity breakthrough after accumulating ninety nine days.</p>
  <p>For the Ancient Strengthening Technique, even when Qing Shui moves it quickly, it doesn’t move as fast. The liquid in his diaphragm rotated vigorously, and a tremendous and heavy burst of Ancient Strengthening Qi circulated naturally in his body.</p>
  <p>A cycle after another, the broad and tough vital path was still blocked on the eighty-ninth cycle. The cycle would always leave some Ancient Strengthening Qi everyday, making it stronger for the next cycle, which then leaves a little Ancient Strengthening Qi for the next one…</p>
  <p>Until the eighty-ninth cycle, the Ancient Strengthening Qi contained in the vital path was the most frightening, though it was still unable to break through to the ninetieth cycle. Once it was attained, the vital path, diaphragm, as well as the bones, tendons, muscles, body constitution throughout one’s body would be greatly strengthened.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui, who had opened his eyes, smiled bitterly. There was still no sign of a breakthrough. He couldn’t help but think, if it was so difficult now, what should he do to achieve the peak of the 4th layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
  <p>It was now in the accumulation period, following this ninety day cycle would be a wide expanse of accumulation till the ninety-ninth cycle, and a barrier between the 4th and the 5th layer.</p>
  <p>Finishing the compulsory training, Qing Shui saw that there was still a big piece of 1,000 year coldsteel left,and he remembered about the unfinished men’s boots that he had started making using the golden marbled skin of the Golden Ringed Snake King. Qing Shui started to smelt the 1,000 year coldsteel, and he decided to forge the boots using the 1,000 year coldsteel.</p>
  <p>He began forging the sole using the 1,000 year coldsteel, hammering seriously using the Thousand Hammer Technique. Qing Shui was especially careful this time, as he was using the 1,000 year coldsteel, striving to be meticulous, hammering each time with his best effort.</p>
  <p>This time, Qing Shui remembered every strike, hammering a 1,100 times made Qing Shui happy. It was probably the result of him forging till he entered a state of oblivion.</p>
  <p>WIth the help of the diagrams and methods, he created the ‘skeleton’ so that even when forging a pair of boots wouldn’t give QIng Shui an awful headache. With methods, steps, samples and examples, making one was smoother and simpler. If it wasn’t for them, he would not know where to start.</p>
  <p>Extracting the snake skin from the golden marbled part, Qing Shui had imagined it to be unisex since it was gold in colour, but the product had not turned out to be so “elegant”. Feeling the grains and texture of the golden ringed snake skin in detail made Qing Shui even more depressed.</p>
  <p>The Golden Ringed Snake King was famous for its golden rings, and the golden ringed marble portion was actually the essence of the Golden Ringed Snake King, making the practical value of the skin much much higher than the emerald portions.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui did not know whether to be happy or to mock himself about being blind as a mole, he sheathed the golden ringed snake skin with a frame and started smelting.</p>
  <p>This time, Qing Shui started with a warm fire, followed by a period of fierce flames, where the golden ringed snake skin and the “skeleton” of 1,000 year coldsteel sole completely fused, before resuming the smelting with warm fire again.</p>
  <p>When the golden gleam appeared, signalling the successful forging of the boots using 1,000 year coldsteel, Qing Shui felt a small excitement in his heart. It could be due to him using a metal like 1,000 coldsteel, or because he had put in the most effort this time.</p>
  <p>Though this pair of boots, which shone and glimmered like golden boots, were not as beautiful as the ones he gifted to Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liuli, it looked a little aggressive, at least men would wear it.</p>
  <p>Increase in Speed by 10%, Strength by 50, Agility by 30, and Endurance by 10!</p>
  <p>Even though the special skill Qing Shui yearned for had yet to appear, increases in these few attributes would make many fight over it. A 1-color graded boots was so powerful, how much stronger would he be if he forged a 7-color graded item? Qing Shui yearned for it with all his heart, but he knew that that would take time, the length of time enough to make one speechless.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui had made this boots for himself. He knew that every bit of strength would increase a little bit of hope; all this time other than training, he had been forging something that could enhance his abilities. He would forge even armours and necklaces for phoenix.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui wanted to try on the previous two pairs of boots he forged, but it was a pity that they were too small and only suitable for women. He could finally experience how it feels to wear the boots that had enhanced speed. .</p>
  <p>Hastily putting thr pair of golden coloured boots on, the legs of the boots were much shorter than the previous pairs, but it looked much more refined!</p>
  <p>“It does not feel cool at all? And it has a mild warm feeling.” Qing Shui was very surprised. He had thought that the sole of the boot forged with 1,000 Year Coldsteel would surely be so icy cold that it is piercing to the bone. However, he would never have thought that it was not cooling at at. While the exterior felt cooling to the touch, the inside of the boots did not feel cooling at all.</p>
  <p>When the automatically circulating Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique flowed into the boots, a mysterious energy flowed back from the boots’ sole and “frame”. That feeling was like having an ice-cream in the scorching summer, or like the moment one penetrated or was penetrated while enjoying sex. It was extremely wonderful.</p>
  <p>“Darn, even a pair of boots could give off such a feeling?” Qing Shui did not know whether to laugh or cry. However, he did not know how Huoyun Liu-LI felt while she was wearing it, nor did he know whether Canghai Mingyue knew of this feeling.</p>
  <p>A lady who had not experienced sexual acts would unlikely not link it to this, but rather, feel that it was extremely comfortable. Thinking of how happy Huoyun Liu-Li was at that time, and the excitement as well as the charm which was reflected on her face when she was dancing with her sword. Only now did Qing Shui realize that that was the reason, and not the excitement brought by the increase in speed.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui displayed the Crane Steps in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, and the result gave him a shock. The boots which should have increased his speed by 10% gave him an increase of at least 15%. Although it had the attribute to increase one’s speed, it should not have increased by so much.</p>
  <p>“Mmm, could it be that I had used the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique as a catalyst?” Qing Shui recalled how he had used the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique during the forcing process and when he was tempering as well. Now, it was not impossible for him to get twice the results with half the efforts with the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
  <p>Very soon, Qing Shui got used to the control of the increase in speed and he knew that it had an inseparable relationship with his Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. The same pair of boots brought about a different set of effects, Qing Shui was very happy. It was well worth the extra efforts in forging it.</p>
  <p>After getting used to it, Qing Shui took the pair of boots off. Seeing that it was about time, he left the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. In the time to follow, Qing Shui knew that he had to double up his spirits. He did not want to bear hatred, but there were many things he had to do. His mother was waiting for him, Yan City still existed, his goddess-like Master at the Skysword Sect was waiting for him, he still needed to extend Luanluan’s life, and had his Master really put down the events at the Lion King’s Ridge… ?</p>
  <p>Working hard and forging at the blacksmith store for the whole morning, while there were many people who came by to the store, he had not sold much in the whole morning, nor did he received any good metal or mysterious gemstones and such.</p>
  <p>When it was noon, Qing Shui closed the doors and headed for the Canghai’s residence. He wanted to avoid any unwanted attention, and at the same time, tell Immortal Sword Sect that he did not have any plans to run away.</p>
  <p>He heard from Canghai that they were not completely ready yet, and thus, he would not be able to escape fully either. mkîThe control was still with the Immortal Sword Sect. By right, if they were to make their escape, the control would be with them, but Qing Shui did not dare to think of having the Canghai couple sacrificing themselves.</p>
  <p>And Canghai Mingyue would not leave either. While Qing Shui did not understand Canghai Mingyue well, she would definitely rather die than to leave at this point.</p>
  <p>Unknowingly, he had already reached the entrance to Canghai’s residence. When he entered, he saw Canghai Mingyue standing next to the small pond not far away. Qing Shui suddenly felt that the lady with the majestic beauty, standing on top of the Golden Winged Thunder Condor now seemed to be thin to the bones. Qing Shui even felt that was a bit lonely. In the past, Qing Shui would never have felt that she would be frail nor be lonely. She was like the bright moon hung up in the sky, bright and clear. But while the backview that Qing Shui saw now was still beautiful, Qing Shui felt a bit sorrowful.</p>
  <p>She was worried about the events that would follow. She was afraid that what she was scared of would happen, and even more so, she did not know what she would do if they were really to happen.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui walked over slowly, standing next to her. He turned his head to look at the side view of Canghai Mingyue’s beautiful face. That slender and white neck, that translucent ear lobes, that skin that seemed as if it would break with a slight touch was giving off a glow as if a jade’s; and that unique disposition of hers made Qing Shui felt as if she was a most beautiful beauty portrait, unattainable like the clear moon in the sky.</p>
  <p>“Don’t worry. We should be thinking about how to avoid it for now. Moreover, things may not be what it seems to be.” Qing Shui said softly.</p>
  <p>“I suddenly feel as if I’m in a mess. I’m very scared, I don’t know what I should be doing.” Canghai Mingyue looked back at Qing Shui and said softly.</p>
  <p>No matter how proud or excellent she was, she was a lady who had been through such things. For her to suddenly be made to face such events, she was at a loss and she could not even calm herself down.</p>
  <p>“There’s still me, we can think of a solution together. Nothing is impossible to a willing mind. So long as we put in the effort, there’s nothing that we cannot accomplish.” Qing Shui knew that he needed to give her some support and encouragement now. If he were to stay next to her and wallow in despair together, it would only make her feel even more at a loss and helpless. While Qing Shui knew that the chances of turning things over was extremely small, but it was useless for them to be wallowing in despair. As a man, he should be upstanding and dauntless, even if he did not have a broad body, he should have a broad chest.</p>
  <p>“Nothing is impossible to the willing mind.” Canghai Mingyue repeated the line softly. Her black and deep beautiful eyes looked at Qing Shui, a lot of the paleness in her face had also left her.</p>
  <p>“Why are you willing to come by today?” Canghai Mingyue seemed a bit surprised to see Qing Shui taking the initiative to drop by.</p>
  <p>“Isn’t it because I’m worried about you? You’re not giving others a peace of mind despite your age. While the water in the lake is very clear, but to choose this kind of method, it’s really torturous…”</p>

Qing Shui yearned for it with all his heart, but he knew that that would take time, the length of time enough to make one speechless.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had made this boots for himself. He knew that every bit of strength would increase a little bit of hope; all this time other than training, he had been forging something that could enhance his abilities. He would forge even armours and necklaces for phoenix.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wanted to try on the previous two pairs of boots he forged, but it was a pity that they were too small and only suitable for women. He could finally experience how it feels to wear the boots that had enhanced speed. .</p>
 <p>Hastily putting thr pair of golden coloured boots on, the legs of the boots were much shorter than the previous pairs, but it looked much more refined!</p>
 <p>“It does not feel cool at all? And it has a mild warm feeling.” Qing Shui was very surprised. He had thought that the sole of the boot forged with 1,000 Year Coldsteel would surely be so icy cold that it is piercing to the bone. However, he would never have thought that it was not cooling at at. While the exterior felt cooling to the touch, the inside of the boots did not feel cooling at all.</p>
 <p>When the automatically circulating Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique flowed into the boots, a mysterious energy flowed back from the boots’ sole and “frame”. That feeling was like having an ice-cream in the scorching summer, or like the moment one penetrated or was penetrated while enjoying sex. It was extremely wonderful.</p>
 <p>“Darn, even a pair of boots could give off such a feeling?” Qing Shui did not know whether to laugh or cry. However, he did not know how Huoyun Liu-LI felt while she was wearing it, nor did he know whether Canghai Mingyue knew of this feeling.</p>
 <p>A lady who had not experienced sexual acts would unlikely not link it to this, but rather, feel that it was extremely comfortable. Thinking of how happy Huoyun Liu-Li was at that time, and the excitement as well as the charm which was reflected on her face when she was dancing with her sword. Only now did Qing Shui realize that that was the reason, and not the excitement brought by the increase in speed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui displayed the Crane Steps in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, and the result gave him a shock. The boots which should have increased his speed by 10% gave him an increase of at least 15%. Although it had the attribute to increase one’s speed, it should not have increased by so much.</p>
 <p>“Mmm, could it be that I had used the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique as a catalyst?” Qing Shui recalled how he had used the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique during the forcing process and when he was tempering as well. Now, it was not impossible for him to get twice the results with half the efforts with the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
 <p>Very soon, Qing Shui got used to the control of the increase in speed and he knew that it had an inseparable relationship with his Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. The same pair of boots brought about a different set of effects, Qing Shui was very happy. It was well worth the extra efforts in forging it.</p>
 <p>After getting used to it, Qing Shui took the pair of boots off. Seeing that it was about time, he left the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. In the time to follow, Qing Shui knew that he had to double up his spirits. He did not want to bear hatred, but there were many things he had to do. His mother was waiting for him, Yan City still existed, his goddess-like Master at the Skysword Sect was waiting for him, he still needed to extend Luanluan’s life, and had his Master really put down the events at the Lion King’s Ridge… ?</p>
 <p>Working hard and forging at the blacksmith store for the whole morning, while there were many people who came by to the store, he had not sold much in the whole morning, nor did he received any good metal or mysterious gemstones and such.</p>
 <p>When it was noon, Qing Shui closed the doors and headed for the Canghai’s residence. He wanted to avoid any unwanted attention, and at the same time, tell Immortal Sword Sect that he did not have any plans to run away.</p>
 <p>He heard from Canghai that they were not completely ready yet, and thus, he would not be able to escape fully either. mkîThe control was still with the Immortal Sword Sect. By right, if they were to make their escape, the control would be with them, but Qing Shui did not dare to think of having the Canghai couple sacrificing themselves.</p>
 <p>And Canghai Mingyue would not leave either. While Qing Shui did not understand Canghai Mingyue well, she would definitely rather die than to leave at this point.</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, he had already reached the entrance to Canghai’s residence. When he entered, he saw Canghai Mingyue standing next to the small pond not far away. Qing Shui suddenly felt that the lady with the majestic beauty, standing on top of the Golden Winged Thunder Condor now seemed to be thin to the bones. Qing Shui even felt that was a bit lonely. In the past, Qing Shui would never have felt that she would be frail nor be lonely. She was like the bright moon hung up in the sky, bright and clear. But while the backview that Qing Shui saw now was still beautiful, Qing Shui felt a bit sorrowful.</p>
 <p>She was worried about the events that would follow. She was afraid that what she was scared of would happen, and even more so, she did not know what she would do if they were really to happen.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui walked over slowly, standing next to her. He turned his head to look at the side view of Canghai Mingyue’s beautiful face. That slender and white neck, that translucent ear lobes, that skin that seemed as if it would break with a slight touch was giving off a glow as if a jade’s; and that unique disposition of hers made Qing Shui felt as if she was a most beautiful beauty portrait, unattainable like the clear moon in the sky.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. We should be thinking about how to avoid it for now. Moreover, things may not be what it seems to be.” Qing Shui said softly.</p>
 <p>“I suddenly feel as if I’m in a mess. I’m very scared, I don’t know what I should be doing.” Canghai Mingyue looked back at Qing Shui and said softly.</p>
 <p>No matter how proud or excellent she was, she was a lady who had been through such things. For her to suddenly be made to face such events, she was at a loss and she could not even calm herself down.</p>
 <p>“There’s still me, we can think of a solution together. Nothing is impossible to a willing mind. So long as we put in the effort, there’s nothing that we cannot accomplish.” Qing Shui knew that he needed to give her some support and encouragement now. If he were to stay next to her and wallow in despair together, it would only make her feel even more at a loss and helpless. While Qing Shui knew that the chances of turning things over was extremely small, but it was useless for them to be wallowing in despair. As a man, he should be upstanding and dauntless, even if he did not have a broad body, he should have a broad chest.</p>
 <p>“Nothing is impossible to the willing mind.” Canghai Mingyue repeated the line softly. Her black and deep beautiful eyes looked at Qing Shui, a lot of the paleness in her face had also left her.</p>
 <p>“Why are you willing to come by today?” Canghai Mingyue seemed a bit surprised to see Qing Shui taking the initiative to drop by.</p>
 <p>“Isn’t it because I’m worried about you? You’re not giving others a peace of mind despite your age. While the water in the lake is very clear, but to choose this kind of method, it’s really torturous…”</p>
