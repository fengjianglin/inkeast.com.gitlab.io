 <p><strong>AST 757 - Promotion, Qing Shui standing amongst the experts</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui Skywalked and at the same time, both the Fire Bird and Diamond Gigantic Elephant also flew towards him. He first took out four Crimson Pellets and fed each of them one. After that, he kept the rest of them because these things were precious treasures that could not be easily found. These were treasures which every tamer would seek.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't plan to let the Jade Emperor Bee use it as he thought that it would be a waste. He planned to give those that he left behind to Di Chen, Luan Luan, Mingyue, leaving them with two each for their mounts.</p>
 <p>After a short while, almost at the same time, both the Fire Bird and Diamond Gigantic Elephant shone with golden and red light. The Diamond Gigantic Elephant shone with golden light whereas the Fire Bird was bathed in flame. Loud chirping and trumpeting noises could be heard constantly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gripped both of his fists tightly because the amount of strength increase for both the demonic beasts was a deciding factor to see if he would continue to stay here or leave. Qing Shui wouldn't want to risk it if he could only rely on both the Thunderous Beast and Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable. Hence, he would see how much the Fire Bird and Diamond Gigantic Elephant broke through and how much additional strength boost he could receive from the Diamond Gigantic Elephant as a result.</p>
 <p>They broke through!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled as he felt the strength of the Fire Bird and Diamond Gigantic Elephant increasing madly. Furthermore, it was a continuous breakthrough. Eventually, it came to a stop.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui showed a satisfied smile because of the Fire Bird’s rapid improvement in strength. The Fire Bird’s raw strength doubled from the original two thousand and five hundred countries to a strength that was worth five thousand countries.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui now knew that once one’s strength exceeded a certain boundary, their ability to absorb more power would increase as their strength progressed further. It’s just like what’s happening with the current Fire Bird. It was absorbing a few times more amount of strength compared to the Thunderous Beast. The Thunderous Beast definitely wouldn’t come short in talent, it’s just that it started off really weak, hence, it was restricted with a lot of limitations.</p>
 <p>Five thousand countries worth of strength. It could already achieve strength that’s worth one star under the effect of State of Phoenix Dance. Under the effect of Phoenix Dance of Nine Heavens, it’s strength would once again double up. Before achieving the Martial Emperor Grade, the strength of both demonic beasts and human warriors were measured using stars as a standard.</p>
 <p>Merely one Crimson Pellet was already so powerful.</p>
 <p>After that, Qing Shui observed the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. There weren’t many changes in terms of its physical size. However, the aura that was emitted from it felt different. Its strength had also increased from the original two thousand and five hundred countries to five thousand countries.</p>
 <p>It went up by two thousand five hundred countries. Qing Shui felt roused. The thing that roused him the most was that the raw defense of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant had broken through from the original five thousand countries to eight thousand countries.</p>
 <p>The inner core of the Nine-Headed Moon Wolf had managed to significantly awaken the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s and Fire Bird’s innate skills and helped tremendously improve their strength. This was all achieved with just one.</p>
 <p>Without further hesitation, Qing Shui immediately fed them the two pills that he left in his hands and calmly observed them. His heart was thumping, the sense of exhilaration felt great.</p>
 <p>Not long after, the Fire Bird and Diamond Gigantic Elephant once again broke through. The Fire Bird’s strength barely increased by another two thousand five hundred countries and achieved a total of seven thousand and five hundred countries worth of raw strength. This time, a change also occurred to the Fire Bird’s body. The length and width of both of its wings were almost a hundred meters.</p>
 <p>Even though the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was huge, the space around it still felt a bit tight. The Fire Bird looked a lot smaller as soon as it folded its wings, the reason being that its wings were too large.</p>
 <p>An entire body of fire red feathers plus the crown that had gotten a few times bigger in size… A phoenix, that's what Qing Shui felt that it looked like even though he hadn't necessarily come across an actual one.</p>
 <p>This time, the offensive strength of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant went up by two thousand countries and achieved a total of seven thousand countries. It's raw defense had also increased by three thousand countries and achieved a total of eleven thousand countries.</p>
 <p>Roarr-roarr!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately let out multiple screams in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal to express his joy. It was a kind of joy that's not shared with anyone else. It felt more like he was stealing happiness.</p>
 <p>Under the effect of Phoenix Dance of Nine Heavens, the Fire Bird would possess strength of one star and it could execute attacks with strength that was worth three stars. Under the effect of Diamond Qi and Diamond Protection, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant would have attacks that was worth fourteen thousand countries and defense that was worth twenty two thousand countries. When the Diamond Gigantic Elephant attacked violently, it could draw out almost three stars worth of strength.</p>
 <p>But these were all unimportant. The most important things as of now were the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s Mighty Elephant Stomp at Great Perfection Stage that could draw out ten times its raw offensive strength which was worth seven stars……</p>
 <p>This was what was scary. Even though the damage wouldn't be as great if the Mighty Elephant Stomp was used from long range, it could still deal six a half stars worth of damage. Furthermore, it was capable of attacking one whole group.</p>
 <p>“Haha!” Qing Shui realized that he was already considered to possess two Peak Martial Saint Grade demonic beasts. During this crucial period, It seemed they appeared at just the right time.</p>
 <p>All of these happened too coincidentally. If they hadn't met Ye Yan, they wouldn't have stopped by Wolf Fang City. If Ye Yan hadn't talked about the Divine Wolf Shrine, Qing Shui too wouldn't have gone there, nor would he have gotten the inner core.</p>
 <p>Half a day passed after all of this happened. The weight that had been on Qing Shui’s heart also finally dropped down. He had always been afraid that the power boost of the Demonic Beasts, upon feeding them the inner core, would go in an undesirable direction. Now, not only did he feel satisfied, it has even gone beyond his expectations.</p>
 <p>Just what kind of strength did the Nine-Headed Moon Wolf possess when it was alive? Qing Shui couldn't help but start thinking about it. He was unclear about its ability, hence, he also couldn't figure out the answer to it.</p>
 <p>Now, he wanted to refine the 20% strength boost that was provided to him as a result of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s breakthrough. The four thousand five hundred countries strength increase to its offensive strength and six thousand countries strength increase to its defense along with its incredible speed, 20%. They were equivalent to nine hundred countries of strength and a thousand and two hundred countries of defense with some other boosts. As Qing Shui thought about it, he felt really agitated. This was the most significant strength increase he had ever experienced.</p>
 <p>Ancient Strengthening Technique!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui started cultivating to adjust his body’s condition. The cloud of qi within his dantian has gotten a lot bigger compared to before. This made Qing Shui felt really agitated and excited. He remembered that there were still three experts of his generation who were stronger than himself.</p>
 <p>They had supreme treasures but similarly, he also had his own Heaven defying treasures. He couldn't afford to lose to anyone, especially the young man from Donggong Clan who surpassed himself. If he was to lose to a young man from Donggong Clan, how was he going to help find justice for the Old Ancestor.</p>
 <p>Explode!</p>
 <p>The more he thought about it, the more agitated he felt. Qing Shui immediately used his Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique to penetrate through the cloud. Immediately, a violent strength started spreading out of his body. The tenacious meridians also reached their limits upon taking in the sudden supply of formidable energies.</p>
 <p>Compress!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui only felt scared after penetrating through the clouds. The last time he did it was when he was in the shrine, this time, he was a bit too rash. He didn't dare to be reckless. Qing Shui operated all of his abilities all the way to its peak and progressed forward step by step. He wouldn't allow any mistakes to be made.</p>
 <p>The speed at which the Yin-Yang image revolved also became faster and faster as it constantly refine the violent Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique and changing it to Qing Shui’s strength.</p>
 <p>The limitless surging strength was still increasing. Very quickly, Qing Shui was already sweating all over his body like he got showered with water. Qing Shui clenched his teeth and held on stubbornly. He was already provoked by it before when he attempted to forcefully pierce through the formidable clouds.</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui spurted out a mouthful of fresh blood. His body managed to loosen up a lot. Fortunately, after his last increase in strength, his meridians and bones all underwent a drastic improvement. Furthermore, the Yin-Yang Image had leveled up too.</p>
 <p>Slowly, a layer of fine grey sweat appeared on his body. The endurance of his body also reached a critical point. A lot of the bones across his body cracked. But at the moment when he was about to give up, Qing Shui suddenly remembered the grieving look of the Old Ancestor before he passed away.</p>
 <p>Also, both Qing Zun and Qing Yin’s face appeared in front of Qing Shui. For them, he would have to hold on no matter what. Considering that both Mingyue Gelou and Shi Qingzhuang were also already pregnant, he thought to himself that he needed to survive to take care of them. As this happened, a mysterious strength emerged.</p>
 <p>Rebirth!</p>
 <p>The power from the Ancient book of Rebirth once again appeared. His damaged body and meridians were constantly recovering.</p>
 <p>The bones that cracked before also started recovering on their own. He no longer felt excruciating pain in his body. Instead, it was replaced with a warm feeling.</p>
 <p>The Energy of Rebirth continuously wandered around his body. More and more strength was refined and as a result, the burden of his body also became less and less. Slowly, he could already control it as he pleased.</p>
 <p>Yet another two hours passed, Qing Shui opened up both of his eyes. This power took him three days to refine. He lowered his head and looked at the bloodstains all over his body and smelled the smelly bloody scent. He quickly took a bit of water to wash himself and put on the Silk Shirt of the Moon Silkworm. After doing so, he could already feel a kind of comfort that he never experienced before.</p>
 <p>Successfully refined!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sensed his own strength and realized that his raw strength had increased by nine hundred countries and his defense had increased by a thousand two hundred countries. This caused Qing Shui’s offensive strength to achieve a net worth three thousand one hundred countries and his defense to achieve five thousand countries.</p>
 <p>Under the effect of Diamond Qi, Diamond Protection and Diamond Crossing Rivers, he managed to achieve one star defense and six thousand and two hundred countries of offensive strength under his default state.</p>
 <p>The Nature Energy increased his raw strength by 50% whereas the Immovable mountain boosted it by 40%. His Frenzied Bull’s Strength also helped provide a 30% boost and the same also happened with the Heavenly Thunder Slash. Shield Attack helped provide a 20% strength boost and the Heavenly Talisman provided him with 40% boost for both his offense and defense states. The Combination Sword Technique provided a 20% boost whereas the Thunder God helped increase all of his strength by one fold.</p>
 <p>If Qing Shui was to take out the Violet Gold Divine Shield and Thunder God, his strength would end up slightly above three stars. If he was to take out the Big Dipper Sword and Thunder God, his offensive strength would end up being slightly weaker. If so, he could still use the 7 Stars Armor. Since his defense was already slightly more than three and a half stars to begin with, it would end up being about seven stars worth with the armor.</p>
 <p>To hit people, one must first learn to endure being hit. Now that he already possessed the ability to do so, even though his offensive strength wasn’t really that strong, he still had other killer weapons. His offensive strength was already enough for him to execute those techniques.</p>
 <p>Talismans drawing, drawing the Hundred Forms of the Tiger, Qing Shui who experienced a huge leap in strength calmed his mind and dedicated himself to cultivating. This was considered to be one of the shortcuts Qing Shui found. Once a person experienced a huge leap in strength, the person would similarly have significant improvement in both refining medicines and drawing talismans during that time. This was most likely the effect of the correlation of strength.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s was still threshold of the level of drawing bones in terms of drawing Hundred Forms of the Tiger. He was unable to step into the level that he has always looked forward to. It was when one achieved the level of drawing bones that one was considered to have officially stepped into the world of drawing.</p>
 <p>One by one, Qing Shui kept on drawing. At this moment, he was able to calm down his mind really easily. Maybe because of the huge leap in strength, he felt that the things which he has been concerned about for a long time weren’t as far-fetched as he had felt.</p>
 <p>This time, Qing Shui was able to draw it really skillfully, so much so that for an instant, it made Qing Shui feel that those that he drew in the past were unbearable. Nevertheless, he felt that he hadn’t broken through yet. Even so, he didn’t really bother about it as long as there was an improvement.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui woke up really early the next day. After that, he carried on with his morning exercise. Even though the Taichi Fist didn’t break through, it was constantly improving. Qing Shui felt that it was considerably stronger when he executed the moves now compared to before. This was the benefit of gaining an upgrade in strength. Once one’s strength ascended, the strength of Taichi Fist would become stronger even if it didn’t break through in realms. Similarly, if one only experienced an ascension in realm, the strength of Taichi Fist would also become stronger.</p>
