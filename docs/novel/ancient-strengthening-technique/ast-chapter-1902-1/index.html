 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lady also looked at Qing Shui curiously. She looked at this man who could still remain calm in such a situation, she did not know what backing him up that could let him remain so calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Encountering the Poison Dragon King was how player encountered another pay-for-win player in a game. The latter had stronger defense and attack, and there was no way the former would be able to defeat them. Just an attack from the latter would take away half of their health points. There was really no way to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite so, it wasn't as if the victor was absolute. There were still other things to consider. For example, one could apply seals to lock the opponent's abilities. No matter how strong the opponents were, if they didn't have the chance to fight, there was a chance that they would eventually die in the end. However, this was very difficult to achieve and required a lot of effort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Then I'll show you right now who is the pitiful one!"

Its body which was the size of a small mountain went sweeping toward Qing Shui. An attack like this would make an ordinary person feel as if a large truck had come crashing over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dodge!</span></p>

Qing Shui could only dodge. When he did this, he brought out his Emperor's Qi, Art of Pursuing, and other skills one after another.</span></p>

After all, Qing Shui's defense had only reached 40 million Dao Force and a few million Dao Force wouldn't make much of a difference. This was comparative to one's abilities. However, when Qing Shui got stronger in the future, the effect of this treasure would become stronger as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Poison Dragon King was very powerful, but its attributes had been reduced a lot by Qing Shui. However, it was still stronger than what Qing Shui and the lady could deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

The huge impact in that instant caused Qing Shui's mind to black out a little. Thankfully, he could still withstand such ordinary attacks. However, what the Poison Dragon King excelled in wasn't its physical attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!</span></p>

Then, a spurt of black mist shot out of its mouth. Like rain, it covered the entire area. The pitch-black fog brought with it a smelly and pungent scent that shot up to one's brain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seemingly Sealed Shut!</span></p>

Would it really destroy his Nine Continents Mountain? In the future, the Nine Continents Mountain's prowess would definitely be above that of Qing Shui's. It was something that was many times stronger than Qing Shui and was his shield and weapon. After all, the Nine Continents Mountain had an attacking prowess that was already stronger than Qing Shui and the grade hadn’t maxed out yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's heart ached to hear those terrible sounds. He only hoped that the Nine Continents Mountain wouldn't be destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were generally two types of poison attacks. The first type was the five elements' poison Qi typed, one that attacked the spirit. The other type would be the material poison such as venom or other types of poison that attacked the body directly. Sometimes, poison Qi could be seen in the form of fog. They weren't considered to have a material form. After all, although they could be seen, it wasn't really there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surrounding area was in a horrible state. The flat stone pavement was now filled with holes and there were many deep craters that one couldn't see the bottom of. It went to show how corrosive the poison was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the venom stopped, Qing Shui jumped out immediately to check the state of the Nine Continents Mountain. He noticed that there were small holes that were the size of beans and his heart ached. Although it could still be used, he had no idea if its effect would be greatly discounted and if its future advancement would be affected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, although there were some small holes, it went to show that the Nine Continents Mountain could still withstand the Poison Dragon King's venom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But then, Qing Shui was stunned. It was because he noticed that those small holes were recovering at a rate that could be seen by the naked eye. After a few breaths' time, it recovered to its smooth state...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What a powerful recovery ability!" Qing Shui was shocked, but was pleasantly surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the Nine Continents Mountain recovered, a thought entered Qing Shui's mind, causing him to be extremely surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its grade had increased! After being attacked by the venom, its grade had increased...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Grade Seven Nine Continents Mountain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui soon saw the abilities of the current Nine Continents Mountain. It was five times stronger than his own attack, accompanied by an Absolute Shield Attack. No matter how strong the opponent was, it would not be struck back. However, in such a situation, it would deplete the owner's Qi two times faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Five times his own attack, which meant it was close to 20 million Dao Force. Although it wasn't enough, it wasn't bad. Right now, it was at this level as his attacking prowess was a far cry from his opponent's. If both parties were on the same level, then the Nine Continents Mountain would be able to kill the enemy with a single smash...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the Absolute Shield Attack, even if the depletion were to increase, he would be able to take it. That was Qing Shui's specialty, he definitely had enough Qi that the Ancient Strengthening Technique stored up and his recovery ability was also very terrifying. Therefore, it was fine even if the depletion were to double, or even triple what it was before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amongst Qing Shui's treasures, he had things which could reduce his depletion by 20% and even if his depletion were to double, it would still be less than what it would cost the others. Being able to sustain oneself to the very end was an ability itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, double the rate of depletion was nothing for Qing Shui’s Absolute Shield Attack... This was the Nine Continents Mountain's unique trait. With this, he won't have to back off even if he were to face this Poison Dragon King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Grade Seven Nine Continents Mountain was much more powerful than when it was at Grade Six. This was a great gap and Qing Shui didn't find it surprising. Amongst his many martial techniques and realms, there were often great gaps between even three tiers. The groups would be differentiated into first to the third tier, fourth to sixth tier, seventh to the ninth tier... At the seventh tier, it would already be considered to be top notch and would have a qualitative difference from the sixth tier.</span></p>

The Nine Continents Mountain was floating above Qing Shui and he felt very confident right now.</span></p>

It's really a great treasure. It'll belong to me very soon. And those women with you... Quite a number of them are still virgins. I'm really lucky." The Grand State Master smirked evilly again, he was trying to agitate Qing Shui.</span></p>

He knew that the other party was trying to agitate him, feeling unthreatened by the fact that he had the Poison Dragon King on his side.</span></p>

Although the Nine Continents Mountain was unable to deal any damage to the Poison Dragon King, at least not a tremendous damage, the same couldn't be said for the Grand State Master. The attack that was about 20 million Dao Force plus the might of Absolute Shield Attack was something that the Grand State Master would not be able to fend off.</span></p>

Qing Shui smiled and looked at the Grand State Master.</span></p>

It could be because Qing Shui had called it a huge poison snake. However, it didn't attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Grand State Master hadn't expected that Qing Shui would still be able to say such words in this situation. He stared at Qing Shui seriously, not knowing if this man still had an ace up his sleeves or was just trying to bluff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The duration for the Grand State Master's Wind Trace Protection was going to end soon, but after calling out his Poison Dragon King, he was afraid of nothing anymore. The Poison Dragon King was strong. Dragons had powerful attacks, terrifying defenses, and their ability to withstand damages were definitely ranked amongst the very top. The Poison Dragon King was also ranked amongst the top few dragon types in terms of its prowess. There were many varieties of dragons, and the powerful ones included the Divine Dragon, Golden Dragon, Azure Dragon, White Jade Dragon, Fire Dragon, Water Dragon, Earth Dragon...</span></p>

For many dragons, their blood lineage was determined from the very beginning. Some dragons were born with two, three or four claws on each foot from the moment they were born, and it was only when they attained a breakthrough and became more powerful would their number of claws increased. It was said that the strongest one of them all was the Divine Dragon with nine claws.</span></p>
