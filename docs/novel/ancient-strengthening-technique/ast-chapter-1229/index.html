 <p><strong>AST 1229 - Departing in Dejection, Call me Sister Su</strong></p>
 <p>"We'll leave. But before we do, I'm going to see what you're capable of." Elder Tianyi unleashed his aura, causing everyone else to retreat.</p>
 <p>The people he had brought with him were beaten up and this was in Heaven Secrets Academy. He was an Elder of the academy while the other party was merely an elite disciple. Furthermore, the latter didn't even give a hoot about him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Elder Tianyi and smiled. "You should leave. You're no match for me. You can be barely considered a Peak Grade Four State Master and won't be able to defeat me."</p>
 <p>When Elder Tianyi heard that Qing Shui could actually discern his cultivation level, his expression flickered again as he looked at Qing Shui. It was only now that he realized that Qing Shui was an unfathomable young man.</p>
 <p>"Let's go!" Elder Tianyi's face turned dark and he eventually left in dejection with the two old men who were injured. Fu Yanting, the one who had made the loudest noise, left together after taking a look at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Do you want your life or your arm? Take your pick. If you want to live, then break your two arms." Qing Shui voice rang out into Fu Yanting's ears.</p>
 <p>Fu Yanting trembled. He now knew that things might not be as simple as he expected. What kind of person was Elder Tianyi? To think that he could be frightened off by a young man.</p>
 <p>This proved one thing. Qing Shui was very powerful. However, the problem now was that the more powerful Qing Shui was, the worse it was for him.</p>
 <p>However, thinking of his elder brother, that unease dissipated. His elder brother would not leave him be. No matter how powerful Qing Shui was, could he possibly be a match for his elder brother?</p>
 <p>The answer would be no!</p>
 <p>In the end, he only glared at Qing Shui viciously and said, "I don't have to lose anything and you'll still have to treat me. You're too young. There are too many things which you don't know yet."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't look at him but just shook his head and wanted to head back. As if he was thinking of something, he looked toward the sky to see that a lady was standing in the air, smiling and looking at him.</p>
 <p>Eldest Princess!</p>
 <p>When the Eldest Princess saw Qing Shui looking at her, she smiled and flew over, appearing next to him in an instant. Qing Sha quietly took her leave.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that the lass had left. He had gotten a little used to Qing Sha's behavior and thus didn't say anything. Even the Eldest Princess had gotten used to the girl's behavior.</p>
 <p>"You've attained a breakthrough again." The Eldest Princess smiled as she looked at Qing Shui, her beautiful eyes shining with an intoxicating glow, causing Qing Shui to go into a daze for a moment before he looked away.</p>
 <p>After attaining a breakthrough, Qing Shui's mental state had gone through some interesting changes. It was an urge to subjugate women. He found it strange that he would suddenly have such thoughts.</p>
 <p>After thinking for a while, Qing Shui let it be. Even ordinary men would harbor such thoughts. It was just that ordinary people did not have that capability. When they had it, they would naturally chase after such thoughts. It wasn't strange at all. It was just like how, in Qing Shui's previous life, there would be people who kept lovers and mistresses. That was a capability in a way as well, albeit it wasn't accepted by other people. Once a person gains power, they would become bad. For many people, it wasn't that they won't become bad but it was just that they weren't capable of doing so.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, I attained a breakthrough accidentally." Qing Shui smiled and said. He didn't dare to take a closer look at the Eldest Princess. Her skin that was snow white as jade would make a person have the urge to get a bite or two out of it.</p>
 <p>"Do you know how many people would want to give you a bashing because of what you've just said? To think that you'd say that you attained a breakthrough accidentally." The Eldest Princess looked at this man who was now stronger than her, as she sighed with emotions.</p>
 <p>His progress was really too fast. It was so fast that it was unacceptable.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui finally knew the Eldest Princess' cultivation level. The reason he could reach the cultivation level he was today was because of some legacies he had received and his amazing chanced encounter which eventually led him to have the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess' strength was slightly above three million nimbus. Qing Shui knew that she had her own share of chance encounters and she was the youngest Elder in the Heaven Secrets Academy. Moreover, with her being as beautiful as a fairy, there were many people in Heaven Secrets Academy who were protective of her.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui could roughly gauge the Eldest Princess' cultivation but the latter wasn't able to sense his. Qing Shui's aura was very vague and even people who were at the same cultivation level as him, or possibly even higher than him, would not be able to tell his cultivation level.</p>
 <p>The main reason was that Qing Shui's change was too huge that it was simply unacceptable. This was also the reason why the Eldest Princess kept on accessing Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"We can be considered to have totally fallen through with the Saint Child Band." The Eldest Princess changed the topic.</p>
 <p>"This day would come sooner or later. What difference does it make whether it's sooner or later?" Qing Shui shook his head and said.</p>
 <p>"How can it be the same? Your cultivation improves at a tremendous rate and it can be said that you're able to travel 1,000 li in a single day. If we wait it out a little more, we might really have a chance to pit against the Saint Child Band."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui belonged the Breezing Wind Veranda and was even more powerful than the Breezing Wind Veranda's leader. Such a situation wasn't common. In the world where the strong were revered, people competed in strength. It might be because the Eldest Princess had thought of these things that a hint of a complicated gleam flashed on her face.</p>
 <p>"What level is that Saint Child at? Are you aware?" Qing Shui asked again. He was really very curious.</p>
 <p>"Few people know of his level. Very few. There has only been rumors about it. Some people say that he has already attained a strength of ten million nimbus, but some people say he hasn't. There are also people who say that he has already surpassed ten million nimbus." The Eldest Princess smiled and said as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Ten million nimbus... This was still acceptable for Qing Shui. After all, the other party was Saint Child Band's leader and would naturally have an unordinary position in the Heaven Secrets Academy.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought of himself. Right now, if he were to use the Seal of Roc, he could bring his strength to about 6 plus million nimbus. However, it was only when his attacking prowess for the Seal of Roc chanced upon the doubling effect would his attacks reach slightly over ten million nimbus.</p>
 <p>He had the Emperor's Qi while the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant had the Vajra Subdues Demons. Relying on his battle techniques, even if the prowess of his Seal of Roc weren't doubled, he would still be a match for a person at ten million nimbus who was weakened. Right now, he should be considered one of the strongest in the Heaven Secrets Academy. Other than some ancient people, there were few who could be a match for Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"That Saint Child seems to be a great talent and I heard that he likes you a lot. If I were to fight with him one day, who would you help?" Qing Shui smiled and looked at the Eldest Princess.</p>
 <p>He felt that this day would arrive. Moreover, right now, he wasn't afraid of the Saint Child either. During this period of time, he would continue to become stronger. Therefore, his mood got better.</p>
 <p>"You've become stronger and you're even teasing me now." The Eldest Princess looked at Qing Shui, as if she was smiling yet not.</p>
 <p>"How would I dare? I'm already yours. I'm just afraid that you won't help me when the time comes." Qing Shui smiled bitterly and said.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess opened her little mouth slightly, as if she wanted to say something. In the end, she reached out her hand and knocked on Qing Shui's head. "You only know how to speak gibberish."</p>
 <p>She thought of what she had said the other time. She didn't mean much. Qing Shui was a member of the Breezing Wind Veranda but if one were to take it seriously, it could be interpreted in a different light.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the Eldest Princess and grinned. "I'm just joking, don't take it seriously. I only felt that what you said sounded very domineering and you were especially beautiful."</p>
 <p>"You're still going on? Is there no end to this? Oh right, I'm thinking of handing the Breezing Wind Veranda to you." When the Eldest Princess heard what Qing Shui said, she felt speechless. This was the only man who would dare to be so brazen before her, only he would proclaim that his wife was very beautiful before herself, and only he would show no constraints and say how many wives he had before her.</p>
 <p>"What would I want Breezing Wind Veranda for?" Qing Shui looked at the Eldest Princess, not understanding.</p>
 <p>"With your current abilities, you're able to lead them. In the future, our Breezing Wind Veranda might even be able to stand on equal grounds with Saint Child Band, Lord Sect, and the other factions." When the Eldest Princess said this, there was a hint of yearning in her voice.</p>
 <p>"Is Breezing Wind Veranda very important to you?"</p>
 <p>"Mmm, very important. This is my faction. Even though it isn't as powerful as Saint Child Band and Lord Sect, it's not to be underestimated. There are also some people from Grade Three Dynasties and they are quite helpful to the Great Yu Dynasty."</p>
 <p>She had the Great Yu Dynasty behind her because she was a member of the royalty.</p>
 <p>"Then Eldest Princess can bear to give me the Breezing Wind Veranda? Aren't you afraid that I'll run away with it?"</p>
 <p>"You won't be able to run. They won't allow it."</p>
 <p>"Oh? They won't listen to me? Are you getting me to go become a puppet?" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"How would it be possible for you to bring them along and run away when you just appeared? You'll have to at least get them to trust you first before you do so."</p>
 <p>"Alright. Breezing Wind Veranda is your painstaking effort and I'm yours. I'll definitely do my best to serve you." Qing Shui had no intention of taking over Breezing Wind Veranda. He had other things to do.</p>
 <p>This time around, the Eldest Princess couldn't even retort. She knew that the more she did, the messier it would become. She increasingly realized that this young man was very mysterious, as if she had never known him at all.</p>
 <p>"Share woe and weal together. I've got something here and will give you a drop. I'll also give you some to give to Sister Yan and the Seventh Princess." Qing Shui handed her a few small porcelain bottles.</p>
 <p>"What is this?" The Eldest Princess looked at it with some curiosity.</p>
 <p>"Not sure. Take a look."</p>
 <p>After the Eldest Princess opened it, she looked at Qing Shui in astonishment, "Spring of Life?"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. It seemed that this thing existed in this world as well, and the name was even the same. He continued to ask, "Spring of Life? This thing can increase one's life and strength. There are many benefits."</p>
 <p>"I really don't know what secret you have on you. Don't let other people know that you have the Spring of Life. Even if you've become strong now, don't say it." The Eldest Princess reminded Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Thank you. I will."</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess didn't ask what level of cultivation Qing Shui was at right now, nor how he got his hands on the Spring of Life. She also didn't make another attempt to convince him to take over the Breezing Wind Veranda. Unknowingly, she realized that she had become very good friends with this young guy who seemed a little unfamiliar to her.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, the way you previously called me is no longer suitable. If you don't mind, you can call me Sister Su." This was the first time the Eldest Princess had said something like this.</p>
 <p>"That was what I was thinking. We've already become so close. I also think that this address is a little distant..."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui went along with it and attempted to add a bit of teasing. He knew that there must have been no one who had spoken to someone like the Eldest Princess like this. He wanted to let her know more about the colors in life, but he didn't know that his actions could let a woman change a lot.</p>
 <p>Before Qing Shui finished, the Eldest Princess hand was already twisting his ear. It was only after she had done so that she felt that this action wasn't suitable. This was the second time she had lost her cool today. However, since she was already twisting it, she might as well continue.</p>
 <p>"Sister Su, please let go! It's dropping off!" Qing Shui reached out with his hands to grab onto her hand that was twisting his ears, speaking with exaggeration.</p>
 <p>He did this subconsciously. However, when he grabbed her hand, he realized that its softness and heat was a little cooling. It felt very comfortable.</p>
