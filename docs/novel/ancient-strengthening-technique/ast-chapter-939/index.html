 <p><strong>AST 939 - Jade Mountain Village of Bole Country’s Tigerfang City</strong></p>
 <p>After breakfast, Qing Shui and Yu He continued on their way again. The winter's sun was very warm. At their cultivation level, they were no longer bothered by cold or heat, however, the sensation was still very clear to them. No matter how strong one was, one would still get wet when drenched by water. It was a feeling, and those who were powerful had stronger senses. It was only that their ability to withstand the weather was also stronger, unless they were to use their Qi of Xiantian to cut themselves off from the rain.</p>
 <p>Although they could still feel cold, powerful warriors were very different from ordinary people. For example, an ordinary person would find it hard to move a single step in a strong gale and could only hear the strong gush of wind. On the other hand, they were like a slight breeze to the experts. This was the difference between them.</p>
 <p>Therefore, both the strong gales and loud noises from flying at a high speed were unable to affect them right now. The two of them could talk very leisurely, as if they were standing between the heaven and earth with a slight breeze blowing and they weren't affected in the least.</p>
 <p>Only those who had reached a breakthrough to the Martial Emperor level would be able to reach the realm where they had an individual world within them. In the past, although they could still converse, they would still sense that the gales in the surrounding were very strong.</p>
 <p>Now that the sun has risen, they could see the scene below them very clearly. This Ancient Mountain City was truly an isolated city that was very out of the way. There was only a single main path that lead towards the direction of the main city, with no other main roads heading to other directions. This meant that one could basically only head out and there were only a few people who would enter.</p>
 <p>The city was surrounded by mountains, but thankfully they were not extremely dangerous. Qing Shui also didn't sense any powerful demonic beasts in there. Otherwise, there was no way for this Ancient Mountain City to survive.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, how long can you stay when you return this time?" Yu He asked, as she looked at Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p>"I don't know. It might be for a while." He had no idea either. This time around, he planned to stay a little longer. There was a need to strengthen the Qing Clan.</p>
 <p>The people from the Qing Clan need to learn formations to the best that they could, he also planned to spend some time studying formations. He would let them comprehend some stone tablets to see if they could sense something, especially Mingyue Gelou.</p>
 <p>He had no idea what her mastery of the Tiger Form was at right now, but it shouldn't be lower than his. It was just that he had suddenly attained the Manifestation Realm and didn't know if Mingyue Gelou could do the same.</p>
 <p>There was also Luan Luan. He should also impart the other forms of the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique to her. Although they didn't have the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique to act as the foundation, it would be good to allow them to grow stronger, even if it was just a little.</p>
 <p>"How are the Qing Clan's three generations right now? Has Di Chen returned?" Qing Shui started to let his thoughts run wild, but he suddenly recalled that there was still someone waiting for him in the Central Continent.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing, Yun Duan, and there was also Di Qing!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was overwhelmed. He really felt that he had a strong affinity now with the Portraits of Beauty. What secrets did the women in the portraits hold? Why didn't the Art Maestro stated them down clearly?</p>
 <p>Why were there twelve? Were the remaining portraits in other people's hands or were they hidden somewhere? He thought of how he had eight of them now, and it seemed like there was a high chance of them to appear where deity statues were.</p>
 <p>"What are you thinking about? You're so engrossed!"</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui heard Yu He's words, he smiled, "I've been distracted by the thoughts of my family."</p>
 <p>"That's right, you've been out for so long and should miss them. Mmm, you're already in your early thirties, but I still subconsciously felt that you're that young lad who's not even in your twenties." Yu He broke into a smile.</p>
 <p>"Time passes really quickly. When we look back, it seemed as if a lot of time had passed, but in the blink of an eye, it has already been over ten years." Qing Shui also felt very emotional when he thought of this.</p>
 <p>"That's right. Time waits for no one." Yu He looked into the far distance, as if feeling great pity, yet also like she was lamenting.</p>
 <p>"Sister Yu's tone sound like you're very world weary. You're now at the prime of your life, how can you be so negative?" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Do you think my wish will come true?" Yu He turned to look at him, her beautiful eyes had a faint layer of mist, which caused Qing Shui to be in a daze.</p>
 <p>"What is Sister Yu's wish?" Qing Shui asked. At this moment, he felt that he was very fake. In relationships, he had always been the one who would seem to be putting up an act, or one who was hesitant and indecisive.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, he didn't have absolute confidence regarding relationships due to his inferiority complex. It might be because the ladies around him were all too outstanding and he had always felt that just having one of them was already a great blessing from the heavens. But right now, he felt just like a person who acts like a whore, but yet expected a monument created for her chastity.</p>
 <p>With this thoughts, Qing Shui smiled bitterly. He didn't deny that he had a strong sense of monopolizing, but he couldn't remove the burdens in his heart. A person would find it the hardest to win against his own heart and change it.</p>
 <p>He was already trying very hard to change himself, but yet he still couldn't let himself loose. He was not a playful and flirtatious person, but yet he had done things which a person like that would do...</p>
 <p>"I'll tell you in the future." Yu He smiled.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>When they passed by the Golden Buddha Temple, Qing Shui didn't go down. They would meet again if it was meant to be, and just merely flew along.</p>
 <p>The old man in the temple opened his eyes, as if his heart was connected to Qing Shui. An amiable expression was hung up on his face, "Soaring up to the heavens, no one can stop your progress."</p>
 <p>For the past few days, Qing Shui traveled in the day and stayed in an inn when they came across a city or town at night. If they were in the wilderness, they would set up tents. Everyday, he would carry Yu He and used the Nine Continents Steps twice.</p>
 <p>Gradually, the two of them grew very accustomed to this. Most importantly, after Qing Shui had performed the Nine Continents Steps while he carried Yu He, she wouldn't let go immediately, but continue to wrap her arms around his neck as she chatted happily with him. Her lazing charm made Qing Shui unable to let her go, and he would always feel an indescribable feeling. After all, their relationship had been ambiguous since many years ago.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know if love would blossom from frequent hugs, but it could be due to the deeply buried emotions within him. This emotion made him felt that Yu He was slowly permeating into his heart and it was unstoppable.</p>
 <p>He performed the Nine Continent Steps once again. This was the second time he was doing this for the day and this time around, they didn’t talk but Qing Shui didn’t let go of his hands either. He continued to wrap his arms around her slender waist, as he looked at this tame lady. There was only a slight difference between good fortune in love and calamity in love. He didn’t know which this was.</p>
 <p>Was this considered a relationship debt? Qing Shui thought of the Skysword Sect’s Zhu Qing. Although she didn’t ask him anything for fear that he would feel burdened, he knew that it was impossible for him to let her go. He wondered how she was now.</p>
 <p>“Hey, why are you always thinking of some other lady when I’m in your arms? Am I really lacking in charm?” Yu He said to Qing Shui angrily.</p>
 <p>A Woman’s sixth sense was truly very sensitive. Qing Shui smiled, not saying a word. However he suddenly felt a pinch at his waist.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t painful in the least and there was even a strange feeling that was growing between them.</p>
 <p>“In the future, when I’m in your arms, you must only think of me.” Yu He smiled and said, her tone very relaxed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded. Right now, he felt that their relationship was getting increasingly ambiguous. Humans have fear of getting too close to others, especially when it was someone of the opposite sex, let alone a beautiful lady who had set her eyes on him.</p>
 <p>Although he was slow in the area of relationships, he wasn’t stupid. Yu He was there when he held his wedding banquet with Mu Qing in the Eastern Victory Divine Continent. If she was only there to offer her congratulations, he wouldn’t be alone with her right now. For a lady like herself to want to return together with him and pulling him close, not even letting go. Everything was very clear to him now.</p>
 <p>Moreover, Mu Qing said that she came to the Eastern Victory Divine Continent to look for him. He didn’t know if this was true, but it was hard not to believe it when she decided to leave together with him, even though she had just arrived in Eastern Victory Divine Continent.</p>
 <p>His arms tightened uncontrollably, without any evil thoughts. He just felt thankful to her from the bottom of his heart. It was an honor to him!</p>
 <p>Yu He looked at Qing Shui. She could clearly sense the stir of his emotions. She smiled and pushed him away, “Let’s go down and look for a restaurant!”</p>
 <p>After she said that, Yu He descended.It was already dark. Qing Shui rubbed his nose, women were truly unfathomable creatures. He then kept the Fire Bird and descended as well.</p>
 <p>After using the two Nine Continent Steps, they would be able to reach the Eastern Victory Divine Continent’s borders. Right now, the Fire Bird’s speed was much faster. However, it still took them several days.</p>
 <p>A dreamless night!</p>
 <p>The next day, they continued on their journey. Qing Shui used the Nine Continents Steps right from the start. Yu He didn’t understand why he was in so much of a hurry. For the past few days, he had only used it at night.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that he wants to hug me…” Yu He blushed from her own thoughts.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t realize the changes on Yu He, who had lowered her head. He called out the Fire Bird and they went on their way. It was only in the afternoon when he found the place he was looking for. He was not good at remembering the routes, but the Fire Bird was. It could remember all the places it had been to before.</p>
 <p>Jade Mountain Village, Bole Country's Tigerfang City!</p>
 <p>It was a quiet and unnoticeable small village. Qing Shui had received the Spirit Channeling Jade from the head of the village, and he also met the two siblings who were the reincarnation of the devil. It had been a year since he last saw them and he decided to drop by for a visit on his way back.</p>
 <p>When the Fire Bird stopped in the air and the two of them landed, many people had already gathered in the village.</p>
 <p>“Teacher is here!”</p>
 <p>“It’s teacher!”</p>
 <p>“This is the teacher who had taught us the Tiger Fist Technique! He’s so young!”</p>
 <p>“Uncle!”</p>
 <p>“Is this teacher’s wife? She’s so pretty!”</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw them, he also felt very warm inside. He realized that there were many new faces who were youngsters. It seemed like quite a number of them had come back in the past one year.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also saw Chi Ao and Chi Feng. Only the two of them called him uncle. Yu He, who stood next to Qing Shui, stared at him in astonishment. She didn’t expect that there would be people from the village who would know him.</p>
 <p>She also realized why he was in such a hurry to hug her now…</p>
 <p>“Sister Yu, shall we stay here for a day?” Qing Shui said, as he looked at Yu He with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Alright. I’ll leave it all to you.” she blinked and smiled.</p>
 <p>To the others, the two people's expressions made them believed in their earlier guess even more.</p>
 <p>“The head of the village is here!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui watched as the old man walked over happily. He was walking very fast. After all, he was also a Xiantian cultivator now.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Yu He quickly walked over.</p>
 <p>“Sir!”</p>
 <p>“Mister, you’re here! Hello, miss!” The old man knew that a lady who could be together with Qing Shui would definitely not be an ordinary person. Moreover, this lady was extremely charming and was definitely not from an ordinary family.</p>
 <p>“Hello, Sir!” Yu He greeted the old man.</p>
 <p>The old man was very happy. He then looked towards the villagers.</p>
