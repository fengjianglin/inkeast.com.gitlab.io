 <p><strong>AST 1161 - Gaining Another Two nimbus, Improvement </strong></p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan became flustered when she remembered about the incident last time. Fortunately she was wearing a veil and her head was also slightly lowered right now. But she had already made a decision in her heart. She would definitely not stay in the same pavilion as them tonight.</p>
 <p>“At most two days. We may even leave tomorrow!” Yu Ruyan informed him with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Why in such a hurry? But I’m relieved too, since you will be staying at Putuo Mountain.” Qing Shui thought that it was a very decent decision. With his current strength, he reckoned that he’d have to flee everywhere if she was with him. Although his strength was quite decent in this Western Oxhe Continent, it was still not enough to create an impact.</p>
 <p>When Yu Ruyan realized that all she had been doing was talking with Qing Shui and had neglected Tantai Xuan, she hurriedly loosened her grip on Qing Shui. She then pulled Tantai Xuan towards the living room.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan didn’t really feel anything about it though. The expression on her face had already returned to normal. She looked at them smilingly. Regardless, she still felt that Yu Ruyan was blissful.</p>
 <p>To be able to reel in such an infatuated fish, she thought that this man wouldn’t be bad no matter what. She wouldn’t doubt the nature of an infatuated fish. Besides, master had a very high opinion of him. She thought back about the words of that Joyous Sage. Would something like that really happen between him and her?</p>
 <p>Someone who could infuse more than 100 nimbus of strength for others through Strength Infusion should be a Grade Three State Master at the very least. Tantai Xuan was deep in her thoughts. A Grade Three State Master was already quite a terrifying existence. That old man could very well surpass a Grade Three State Master.</p>
 <p>“Well, do you still have a lot of wine left?” Tantai Xuan whispered towards Qing Shui after taking a seat.</p>
 <p>“Oh, yes, a lot. How much do you want? I can give you it all.” Qing Shui was surprised at her question. At least he could be considered a friend to Tantai Xuan now and probably quite a good one at that. She treated his woman as her sister. The relationship between them was akin to that of a ‘bestie’ in his previous world or something even more than that.</p>
 <p>“No, I mean my master needs some!” Tantai Xuan hurriedly explained.</p>
 <p>“How much do you need? Is a hundred jars enough?” Over these years, Qing Shui had accumulated quite a lot in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. With the extension of time in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, the amount of those plum blossoms had grown quite a lot compared to the beginning.</p>
 <p>“No need for that much. Ten jars will suffice. I will buy them from you. Give me a price. I know this wine is very valuable. Or perhaps I can trade for them with items?” Tantai Xuan said after thinking.</p>
 <p>“You are Ruyan’s sister. Consider these a gift!” Qing Shui shook his head.</p>
 <p>“No, this wine is very valuable….”</p>
 <p>“I really don’t have any plans to sell this wine and I have not sold it before either. If you insist on paying for it, then go buy it from someone else!” Qing Shui smiled at her.</p>
 <p>“Sister Xuan, no need to be so courteous towards him!” At this very moment, Yu Ruyan laughed in an effort to resolve the dispute.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out 20 jars and placed them on the table. “Let me know when you run out. I’m guessing that you won’t find this anywhere else. Even if you do, it is very rare. I have more than enough, so just tell me when you need more. I’m treating you as a friend. You don’t need to guard against me like you would to a thief. Although you are very beautiful, I don’t have any intentions towards you. Besides, my Ruyan is more beautiful than you!”</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan turned gloomy as she put away the wine immediately. “I do treat you as a thief but I also treat you as a friend. Good to know that you don’t have that kind of intention towards me. That assured me.”</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, what nonsense are you talking about?!” Yu Ruyan glared him.</p>
 <p>Seeing that it was about time, and the sky would turn dark soon. “I’m going to cultivate. Wait for me tonight, alright? Both of you can go on and eat without me.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui left first as soon as he finished speaking, leaving behind a bashful Yu Ruyan and an embarrassed and flustered Tantai Xuan. Although the two ladies were very close with each other, this kind of thing was still very awkward.</p>
 <p>“Sister Ruyan, well…. Are you really very happy……”</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan asked in a soft voice when there was only the two of them around. The relationship between these two ladies was akin to that of blood-related sisters. Yet, they weren’t blood-related sisters, so they could openly discuss a lot of things with each other.</p>
 <p>When Tantai Xuan saw Yu Ruyan’s blissful and bashful smile, she couldn’t help but to ask. Yet at the same time, it was more like she was teasing her.</p>
 <p>“What do you mean?” Yu Ruyan asked Tantai Xuan, who seemed a slightly awkward, with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Sister Ruyan, I mean you and him!”</p>
 <p>“Oh, that. Of course, I am happy…”</p>
 <p>“No wonder why Sister Ruyan’s voice was so strange that time.” Tantai Xuan smiled faintly.</p>
 <p>“Oh, It seems like our Fairy Tantai can’t stand being lonely.”</p>
 <p>“I’m not! Both of you were so loud!”</p>
 <p>“Can’t you seal your spiritual sense and seal your sense of hearing?!” Yu Ruyan asked, equally shyly and timidly. After all, Tantai Xuan heard her.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan was unable to speak about her suffering. She had really sealed them at that time. But those scenes emerged in her mind like a spell, the same went for all of the sounds…...</p>
 <p>……….</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui got into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he immediately picked up the Portrait of Beauty that was still lying on the ground. Without realizing it, he had already found ten of them. He had already met the ladies on the other nine portraits and had formed some sort of relationship with many of them.</p>
 <p>Yet he still hadn’t met the woman on the tenth portrait. Moreover, he felt that it was very unlikely for him to meet her anytime soon. The position of other party wasn’t ordinary. He was still uncertain if he could find her in the Western Oxhe Continent. Besides, Qing Shui didn’t intend to search for her either.</p>
 <p>“Oh right, the nebula within my body dispersed earlier at the sight of this woman and that gigantic green colored dragon. I haven’t checked how much my strength has been raised.” Qing Shui quickly sensed it with great excitement.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t really the right time to do so earlier, but he had also vaguely sensed it. After all, any changes in the body could be felt. Qing Shui smiled when he sensed it. The nebula that had dispersed actually increased Qing Shui physical strength by two nimbus. But of course, he knew this was still mostly due to the Strength Infusion that the old man had performed on him. But during that time it had only reached the borderline. It just so happened that telepathic communication after that happened to catalyze the nebula.</p>
 <p>His physical strength had reached eight nimbus!</p>
 <p>Such a tremendous gain still made Qing Shui extremely surprised. At the same time, he was even more puzzled as to why the Joyous Sage would perform a Strength Infusion on him. One round of Strength Infusion would probably cause him to lose ten years of his cultivation!</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui had reached nearly 1,000 nimbus of strength with just using the Big Dipper Sword alone. If he used the Nine Continents Mountain, he would be close to 2,000 nimbus. By now, he was probably capable of fighting against a State Master of the lowest level!</p>
 <p>His spirit energy had also reached more than 1,500 nimbus. With some treasures, his spirit energy was also extremely terrifying in its resistant to damage. It could be said that if Qing Shui met a cultivator whose primary cultivation was spirit energy, he could confidently defend himself against him. To be able to cancel out about 70% of spirit energy was already beyond terrifying. This was the most scary part of the Arhat Rosary Beads.</p>
 <p>As for physical attack, Qing Shui had his Nine Yang Golden Body, Nine Continents Mountain and the rest. Besides, even the might of his Emperor’s Qi was turning domineering. He also had the Nine Continents Step and the Five Elements Divine Refining Technique…….</p>
 <p>Oh right, movement technique!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui suspended this Portrait of Beauty and then tried his best to recall the movement technique of that gigantic green colored dragon from back then. The way it moved and the Qi aura it exuded. At that time, it created an impact that caused Qing Shui to have a very intense realization.</p>
 <p>The reason why Qing Shui had a realization was due to the existence of Fish in Water. If he didn’t have Fish in Water, he wasn’t certain if such a realization would have come to him.</p>
 <p>He moved!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s figure rose to midair. His movement was still like Fish in Water but its swiftness could make one sigh in amazement. As time passed, his movements were also changing. The biggest change that could be observed was the aura that he exuded.</p>
 <p>Fish in Water emphasized agility and ingenuity, allowing him to roll with the punches. But Qing Shui’s current movement technique carried a domineering aura that was condemning. The movement technique was still agile and even more so compared to before. It felt almost like it was the work of the Gods. With this kind of agility and domineering aura together, that kind of impact was still very impressive.</p>
 <p>Roaming Dragon Steps!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled in satisfaction. Although he had only just grasped the Moving Dragon Steps, it was a lot more powerful than Fish in Water at its peak. Next, he had to coordinate it with Nine Palace Steps.</p>
 <p>The most important thing about the Nine Palace Steps was its orientation. He could move anywhere he wished within the Nine Palace and everything within there was under his control. The ability of his opponents would more or less be lowered Inside the Nine Palace. The Nine Palace Steps inside the Nine Palace was most straightforward but sometimes Qing Shui would still need to use the Cloudmist Steps in there when he was facing his opponents. However, the situation had turned for the better. He could use the Roaming Dragon Steps. This way, his power would probably become a lot stronger.</p>
 <p>Like this, a few days passed. Qing Shui would forget everything when he was cultivating. Just like this time, he didn’t stop to sleep or rest over these few days.</p>
 <p>For a powerful cultivator, especially of this caliber, they would still be fine even if they didn’t eat or sleep for ten days to half a month. Even so, they would still normally sleep because sleeping could recuperate the mind and it was a very special and vital thing to do. It was best that they at least took naps every day. It was very important do so.</p>
 <p>As soon as he stopped, Qing Shui felt mentally exhausted. His stomach also growled in hunger. So he sat down and ate some food then washed himself up before he immediately lay down on the big bed in the Realm of the Violet Jade immortal and slept.</p>
 <p>………….</p>
 <p>By the time Qing Shui came out, it wasn’t 11 pm yet. The two ladies were still around when he walked to the living room. Yu Ruyan smiled after she saw Qing Shui. “Wait for a moment, I will serve you your meal.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was going to say no, but he didn’t. In just a short moment, Yu Ruyan served him two dishes, a soup and some rice.</p>
 <p>A meat dish and a vegetable dish of quite ample portions!</p>
 <p>“Well then, I shall return to rest!” Tantai Xuan stood up and said smilingly.</p>
 <p>“It’s still early, have a rest first! Let’s sleep together tonight!” Yu Ruyan said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“No way!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hurriedly objected before Tantai Xuan could even say anything. It was still fine if he didn’t see Yu Ruyan. But if he couldn’t do that sort of things when Yu Ruyan was staying here, then that would really be an ordeal to him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui words made the two ladies fell embarrassed. Yu Ruyan’s face was crimson!</p>
 <p>“Miss Tantai, well… I haven’t seen Ruyan for so long… so you know… I have missed her terribly…...”</p>
 <p>“I don’t know!” Tantai Xuan spat at him and hurriedly stood up to excuse herself from Yu Ruyan before she left.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan left this pavilion immediately and made her way towards the other pavilion.</p>
 <p>“Huh, why did she go to the other pavilion?” Qing Shui stared at Yu Ruyan.</p>
 <p>“It’s your fault. She said it was a little noisy. Qing Shui, I think she didn’t only mean that it was noisy. Sister Xuan had a very strange expression on her face…… Was my voice really that loud?” Yu Ruyan asked as she blushed in shame.</p>
 <p>“Enough. Let’s not be bothered if she’s acting strange or not. Let’s go have our happy time! Oh right, you can be a little louder tonight. I love to listen to it the most……” Qing Shui said while he immediately lifted Yu Ruyan and walked towards the bedroom.</p>
 <p>Before they even reached the bedroom, Qing Shui was already kissing those sweet, soft and divine red lips. The wonderful sensation numbed the back of Qing Shui. By the time they reached the bedroom, Yu Ruyan only had her snowy white undergarments left on her body.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui kissed her lips, her face, ears, delicate neck and sucked on one of her nipples with her clothes in between. Yu Ruyan uncontrollably arched her back as she moaned uncontrollably, enticing Qing Shui through his sense of hearing.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had one of his hand on her breasts and his other reached over her delicate waist and groped her round, perky and beautiful rear. It was so round and soft, yet at the same time surprisingly elastic.</p>
