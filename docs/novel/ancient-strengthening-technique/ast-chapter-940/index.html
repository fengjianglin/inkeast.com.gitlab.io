 <p><strong>AST 940 - Trifling Issues, Chi Ao and Chi Feng, Hidden Reason</strong></p>
 <p>The old village head looked at the surroundings and said, “Everyone go back and have your meals first. Gather here earlier in the afternoon and let the Mister give you some guidance.”</p>
 <p>“Mister, what do you think?” the old man smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“I’ll leave that up to you. I’ll be staying here for a day.” Qing Shui looked around and smiled.</p>
 <p>Cheers broke out and the group was dispersed. Everyone knew that Qing Shui had something to discuss with the village’s head, so they all smiled and left.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the old village head and then he looked at the siblings and was taken aback. As expected devil reincarnations… their potential and talent did not lose out to Luan Luan in the slightest.</p>
 <p>He wondered who their parents were, to be able to give birth to these kids.</p>
 <p>There were rumors that their parents had died. It was said that after their birth, their family members had died one after another. Qing Shui didn’t dismiss this rumor, but there was one thing he couldn’t agree with. It was said that reincarnations of the devil tended to bring great negative influences to the people around them, causing them to die one by one. It wasn’t to the extent that all of their family would die from the moment they were born. Their pernicious aura wasn’t as strong at their birth and the pernicious aura was only especially strong and malicious toward the person’s kin. Those who weren’t blood-related would be unaffected. This was a pernicious aura that came from one’s blood and bones and would be extremely detrimental to individuals from the same bloodline.</p>
 <p>If the siblings had been taken in by the old village head since they were young, then there were two possibilities. The first one was that their parents were left with no choice but to abandon them. The second possibility was that their parents were aware that the siblings were the reincarnations of the devil and had heartlessly thrown them away in fear of encountering a great disaster.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui guessed that their parents were still around somewhere. It was impossible for people from ordinary families to have such physiques. As such, Qing Shui felt that the clan which had abandoned them must be very powerful—they might not be from the five continents.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the siblings in astonishment. In the past year, they had experienced a tremendous change. Even their heights and appearances had changed. People with such physiques were all elites.</p>
 <p>In just one year, the two of them had already reached Xiantian. Additionally, Qing Shui knew that their progress would be even faster from now on. Their progress speed was like Luan Luan's. After reaching Xiantian, they would advance very quickly and would rarely come across bottlenecks. Even if they met bottlenecks, they would be able to break through them very quickly. They were born with their lifespans ripped off from them and their short lifespans wouldn't increase even when their cultivation did.</p>
 <p>However, God was fair. When it took away some things, it would make it up with something else.</p>
 <p>Chi Ao and Chi Feng were still young, but it would be the prime chance to raise their cultivation from now onwards. Within ten years or so, they would be able to reach a considerable height. However, they would also face the problem of their short lifespan in that time. Their lifespans were destined to be similar to a person who had a Heart of Seven Orifices. It was destined to be tough for them to live past 40 years old.</p>
 <p>The last time he was here, Qing Shui had left them a few things. He left them each a Wondrous Fruit and a Physique-Enhancing Fruit. These fruits could slightly increase their potential and lifespan. He had made a ten-year promise with them and he wouldn't break it. He would lend them a helping hand when the time comes—as long as he had the ability to do so.</p>
 <p>"Uncle!" Chi Feng was very happy to see Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Although this lass looked very shy, she was very intelligent. However, individuals with a powerful spiritual sense would be able to sense the powerful pernicious aura she had.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could sense that their pernicious aura was stronger than before and fell into contemplation. As they grew stronger, their pernicious aura would become stronger and it could have negative effects on the people around them.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, Lass Feng has grown taller." Qing Shui smiled. He really wanted to treat this pair of siblings well.</p>
 <p>It was rare to encounter people with these physiques even in a hundred years. He didn't wish to see them die after only living for 40 years.</p>
 <p>He also wanted to see what level their physiques and Luan Luan's Heart of Seven Orifices could reach. He could help them along the way. After all, it would be hard for them to rely on themselves alone.</p>
 <p>"Uncle, we feel that our aura has grown increasingly stronger. The people around us can't get used to it. Why is it that grandfather and Uncle don't have such aura?" Chi Feng gave it some thought before asking Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Tomorrow, Uncle will give you something. It can block off some of your aura. Don't think about it too much. This aura can hasten your cultivation speed," Qing Shui said as they walked.</p>
 <p>"Thank you Uncle!" Chi Feng said happily.</p>
 <p>Compared to Chi Ao, Chi Feng was slightly more outspoken.</p>
 <p>"No need to stand on ceremony. If you have anything you want or anything you need help with, just let me know." Qing Shui's tone was very soft, but it felt very sincere.</p>
 <p>"Uncle, your wife is so pretty!" Chi Feng smiled and looked at Yu He.</p>
 <p>"She is very pretty, but she's not my wife." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"In the future, she will be. It's just a matter of time." Chi Feng blinked. Her eyes had a slight cold gleam. She now looked very cute, but she'll probably change slowly in the future...</p>
 <p>After saying that, Chi Feng secretly smiled and looked at Yu He. Although she was young, she was very intelligent. She only said what she said because she could tell that Yu He wasn't against it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't say anything, but Chi Feng got called over by the old village head. Experienced in worldly matters, he could naturally tell that there was something between Qing Shui and Yu He. This was why he only got his granddaughter to stop, but didn't say anything else.</p>
 <p>The stone house was basically the same as it was a year ago. It wasn’t very big but it was still relatively spacious, even after they had all entered.</p>
 <p>"Our stone house is run-down. I hope you don't mind." The old man politely invited Qing Shui and Yu He to sit down.</p>
 <p>"Sir, there's no need to stand on ceremony."</p>
 <p>"Many people have returned to the village and are all putting in a great amount of effort into their training. We can get enough to feed our families just by hunting now and still have some food to spare. There was only one incident where someone got hurt, but it was a minor accident and wasn't a serious injury. Recently, we've even found a small-scale jade mine and it has increased the village's income by quite a bit." The old man sounded very happy.</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Qing Shui also felt very happy. He had never denied that he was a kind man. Seeing that their lives had been improving, he felt happy from the bottom of his heart.</p>
 <p>Their lunch was very sumptuous. Since they hunted, they had both meat and vegetables. The old village head's culinary skills were quite good and Chi Feng also helped out. The meal was prepared very quickly.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui and the others arrived at the square in the afternoon, there was already quite a number of people from the villages nearby. This time around, there were a lot more youngsters when compared to before.</p>
 <p>"Hello Sir!"</p>
 <p>"Hello teacher!"</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui waved his hand and said, "Everyone stand properly and perform the Tiger Form together. There's no need to go all out. Just try your best to perform your Tiger Form perfectly."</p>
 <p>Chi Ao and Chi Feng also joined the crowd. With them in the lead, the others naturally followed. Although the two of them were young, they were already at the Xiantian realm. To the others, they were their role models.</p>
 <p>Chi Ao and Chi Feng stood in the lead and the others followed the two of them.</p>
 <p>"Remember, you can have different momentums. Don't use too much strength and aura. Just perform the Tiger Form which you feel is the most perfect." Qing Shui repeated.</p>
 <p>"Start!"</p>
 <p>Thanks to Qing Shui's words, the Tiger Form that they displayed wasn’t neat at all. Right now, Qing Shui primarily wanted to see who could show the charm to the Tiger Form.</p>
 <p>He was first astonished by Chi Ao and Chi Feng. Their pernicious aura was really powerful. Although it was still insufficient to take form, they were already able to do it with such power. When their cultivations improved in the future, how strong would that pernicious aura be? Qing Shui felt that when their pernicious aura reached a certain level, there would naturally be a way to control it. Right now, he needed to help them keep it in control.</p>
 <p>The others didn't manage to catch his attention. This was a small village and it was hard to encounter real geniuses.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then started to demonstrate the Tiger Form. He started off at a slow pace and merely displayed the movements. He then gradually sped up, bringing in the charm of the move. What he wanted was for them to comprehend the charm of the Tiger Form.</p>
 <p>Only by successfully comprehending the charm would they then be able to improve by leaps and bounds. If he were to give them verbal guidance only and let them think through his words, it would be too slow. He wanted to forcefully fill them in and then observe how much they were able to digest.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's Tiger Form slowly increased in speed, and eventually even reached the Manifestation Realm. The people around him were all astonished. After all, this was the first time that they had seen a powerful expert like Qing Shui. This left a strong mental impact on them.</p>
 <p>What Qing Shui wanted was results. If this could allow them to have a stronger mentality, they might be able to achieve something in the future. If their minds were not strong enough, it would be a blow to them. He had actually wanted to show this to Chi Ao and Chi Feng. As for the others, he just let it all to fate.</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, it was already late in the afternoon. Qing Shui continued to give them guidance. Qing Shui liked the villagers, as they were honest and easily satisfied with what they had. Sometimes, this was a flaw but sometimes it was a merit. There were always two sides to any matter.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw the surprise in Chi Ao and Chi Feng's eyes. Additionally, he saw determination and hope. When he saw their gazes, he felt relieved. This trip hadn’t been wasted and he had helped them set a life goal, which was to reach the level he was at now.</p>
 <p>One year was neither long or short. Seeing their current achievements, Qing Shui knew that they had put in a lot of hard work in the past year. Moreover, they had been eating meat since a young age and had good physiques. This was a village in the mountain and there was always the threat of wild beasts. Therefore, they had trained since they were young and now they were tempering their bodies with the Tiger Form. The one year period had allowed them a small but qualitative improvement.</p>
 <p>Although it was only one afternoon, many people had learned a lot. Just that short amount of time was sufficient.</p>
 <p>It was turning dark soon. Many people warmly invited Qing Shui to their homes for dinner. Qing Shui smiled and politely declined them. They went back unwillingly and knew that this might be the last time that they could meet Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>At night, both Qing Shui and Yu He found a stone house for themselves. Thankfully, the rooms were very clean. However, Qing Shui gave Yu He a large piece of clean beast hide and blanket. Both of the items were very thick and extremely comfortable. It was the hide of a Peak Martial Saint demonic beast that had recently been tempered by Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Yu He had her own to use, but when she saw the hide that Qing Shui took out, she took them happily. She liked Qing Shui's attentiveness. The bed in the room was a stone bed and although the beast hide and other stuff were all new, the smell of wild beasts still lingered. She wasn't able to get used to it.</p>
 <p>This was the scent that couldn't be removed from the hide of low level wild beasts, It was unlike high level demonic beasts whose hide would be extremely clean with a fresh smell as long as they were Xiantian or stronger no dust would gather on them. The hide of a Peak Martial Saint demonic beasts was even cleaner and was so pure that they could even slightly provide warmth in winter and a cooling effect in summer.</p>
