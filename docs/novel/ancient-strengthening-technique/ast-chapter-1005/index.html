 <p><strong>AST 1005 - Jiange and Luan Luan’s Breakthrough, Advancing Qing Shui and Qing Clan by 50 Years.</strong></p>
 <p>This time, Yiye Jiange came out very fast. On top of that, she came out dressed neatly. But her complexion was glowing and translucent like jade. She was slightly averting her gaze from Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“How do you feel? What’s your strength now?” Qing Shui asked with a smile.</p>
 <p>Actually Qing Shui more or less knew that too, he was just striking up a conversation. Her full strength could reach up to 120 stars with the Violet Jade Sword in her hands. Her physical strength was about 20 stars, her cultivation techniques and weapons provided a twofold increase respectively.</p>
 <p>This acupuncture had pretty much allowed Yiye Jiange to take a big leap. Yiye Jiange happily told Qing Shui about her strength. Qing Shui didn’t ask her to consume the Violet Qi Pellet though.</p>
 <p>It was a little wasteful for her to consume it right now. Qing Shui wanted to raise her physical strength to the maximum first so he found a type of medicinal pill that could increase strength by five stars. She had never consumed this medicinal pill before.</p>
 <p>With this, her physical strength had reached 25 stars. Only then he let her consume the Hallow Pill and Violet Qi Pellet.</p>
 <p>The Martial Emperor’s barrier didn’t appear. This most likely had some connection to her divine body. With this, Qing Shui knew now that the people who could ignore the barrier that hindered one from breaking through were not limited to only the women in the Portraits of Beauty.</p>
 <p>In just a flash, Yiye Jiange’s physical strength reached 255 stars. Each Hallow Pill could raise physical strength by 100 stars while the Violet Qi Pellet could raise by 30 stars.</p>
 <p>Under the effects of cultivation techniques, Yiye Jiange’s strength reached to 750 stars. The Violet Jade Sword that could increase strength twofold immediately allowed her strength to reach more than 2,200 stars.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui with a strange look on her face. There was a look of bewilderment in her eyes as she sat by Qing Shui’s side. In just four hours, he had turned her strength upside down, even though this meanie had also taken some advantage of her in the process.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui himself was aware that all this was mainly due to the Hallow Pill. It increased physical strength by 100 stars, which was simply too powerful. As long as one’s cultivation technique was great enough, then strength would very rapidly increase by leaps and bounds.</p>
 <p>The higher the cultivation technique’s level and a higher realm would allow physical strength to become even more powerful. But zero consumption passive cultivation techniques were the most powerful, just like Qing Shui’s Diamond Qi, Diamond Protection, Diamond Crossing Rivers, Nature Energy and State of Immovable as Mountains.</p>
 <p>For ordinary cultivators, even active cultivation techniques that could increase physical strength were already considered to be very powerful. Those that were passive and had zero consumption could almost be considered paragon.</p>
 <p>For average low level cultivators, their strength would be whatever physical strength they possessed. There weren’t any amplification through cultivation techniques and weapons. A beginner weapon was only sharp and could break through defenses. But it wouldn’t increase attack, so all those didn’t count.</p>
 <p>The surprises that Qing Shui had given to her over these few years were already too much. But this was simply inconceivable.</p>
 <p>“You don’t have to look at me like that. That’s due to the medicinal pills. I snatched the ingredients from the Sacred Land of Panacea and concocted them into medicinal pills. It’s a pity that each person can only consume up to two pills. It would’ve been better if they could be consumed without any limit.” Qing Shui smiled at the woman who seemed to be a little stunned.</p>
 <p>“Two pills are already very heaven-defying. If this kind of medicinal pills can be consumed by humans without limits, that would destroy the rules of Heaven and Earth. Besides, better medicinal pills have stronger drug resistance.” Yiye Jiange laughed softly.</p>
 <p>“You should rest early. I will send some better weapons to you later. This is no longer suitable for you to use.” Qing Shui got up. He still had to enter the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange nodded and saw Qing Shui off at the door with a smile. Qing Shui pulled her into a gentle embrace and then left. When he returned to his own room, he immediately went inside the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>A gentle and blissful smile appeared on Yiye Jiange’s face as she watched Qing Shui’s retreating figure.</p>
 <p>After entering the Martial Emperor realm, she could use weapons that could increase strength threefold. Qing Shui was also able to forge those that could increase strength by threefold too. The Big Dipper Sword could increase fourfold due to the Wolf Fang. Besides, the Big Dipper Sword itself was also tempered from the very precious Seven Stars Silver Sand.</p>
 <p>The Violet Jade Sword was forged in no time. This time, he had added a little bit of Wolf Fang and some pure gold. It was still mostly Violet Jade and the end product still looked like a Violet Jade Sword.</p>
 <p>The attributes of the Violet Jade Sword had changed to being able to increase strength by threefold and had 10% chance of doubling damage. Other detoxifying effects had also been increased. Overall, he was quite satisfied with it. There weren’t many weapons like this in the five continents either. Qing Shui discovered that the chance of doubling damage was a very powerful ability to have. Not only that, the rate was also very high.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange’s breakthrough was a beginning. The Qing Clan still had Canghai Mingyue, Mingyue Gelou, Luan Luan now and Di Qing was also almost there but they still needed some more time. In half year, all of them would be able to attain the Martial Emperor realm.</p>
 <p>So this time in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui immediately forged a few weapons with almost the same abilities for Martial Emperor cultivators to use.</p>
 <p>Roc Form’s cultivation was very slow. It was also progressing increasingly slowly. So Qing Shui had turned back to cultivating the six forms from before.</p>
 <p>Tiger Form!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui unleashed a Critical Tiger Attack in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal’s skies. An enormous shadow image of a gigantic tiger leaping out to kill was seen.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>It then immediately shattered into pieces. But the killing intent, speed, power and pressure that it exuded at that one moment were extremely terrifying. The tiger form had already completely manifested. Although the power it unleashed couldn’t match up to holding the Big Dipper Sword and Violet Star Thunder God, it could still be considered quite decent.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui continued unleashing a few techniques of the Tiger Form. His movement was as natural as the moving clouds and flowing water. His mental state was also rising. His heart grew brighter as time ticked away slowly.</p>
 <p>Among the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique, the first six forms out of the nine forms could be cultivated without any order and could be perfected. Just like Mingyue Gelou who primarily cultivated the Tiger form, she also cultivated the Deer Cantering technique and the Soaring Crane Steps. With her Tiger form’s attack and its speed, she had already cultivated Tiger Form to the Divine Connection Realm and had also reached the Manifestation Realm. But due to her lack in strength, she wasn’t able to completely manifest it. When Qing Shui’s strength was increased, he was able to suddenly learn some cultivation techniques by himself without any guidance. Even so, he reckoned that his current Tiger Form’s realm was about the same as Mingyue Gelou’s or maybe even inferior to hers.</p>
 <p>If Mingyue Gelou broke through to Martial Emperor, she should be able to immediately fully manifest it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s realm had only risen tremendously through his Tiger Form cultivation this time. He had a hunch that the last three forms of the Nine Animals Mimicry Technique required the first six forms as a foundation.</p>
 <p>This Tiger Form cultivation lasted about the duration of time where he could spend in the immortal realm. The remaining time was spent on cultivating something else. He still had to refine magic treasures in between.</p>
 <p>When he exited, it was already bright outside. He quickly went to the backyard. This was the best time to practise his Taichi Fists.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, you’re late. The sun is almost up,” Qing Yin called out with a smile when she saw Qing Shui. She was practising her Tachi Fist technique.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and rubbed her little head before he found an empty spot and started cultivating. There was nothing to complain about the little lass’s posture now. She mainly had to familiarize herself in it and to do that, she would have to practise it a thousand, ten thousand or even a million times. Practice makes perfect. This was the most stupid yet most effective method.</p>
 <p>During breakfast, he carried the meal to Zhu Qing’s place. Other than eating, the little fellow would be sleeping. Little children were growing their bodies so they spent most of their time sleeping. To be able to stay awake for two hours a day was very good already.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, you better not come here and eat. It smell nasty here,” Zhu Qing said with a smile.</p>
 <p>With a child in this room, of course it wouldn’t really smell great in here. But still, he didn’t smell anything yet. The child hasn’t consume any solid food and it had only been a short while so there wasn’t really any odor in the room.</p>
 <p>“Is there any odor here?” Qing Shui looked at Zhu Qing doubtfully.</p>
 <p>“No!” Zhu Qing laughed.</p>
 <p>Before Qing Shui went out, he kissed Zhu Qing and the little fellow.</p>
 <p>Ten days later, Luan Luan broke through to Martial Emperor. Her physical strength was 20 stars. With the Heart of Seven Orifices that increased it by 20% and also in addition to other cultivation techniques and weapons, her strength had reached to 120 stars now.</p>
 <p>The energy gained by the Hallow Pill was very pure. There was no need to worry about strength increasing too fast, causing instability in the realm. That was the difference between sacred fruits and average medicinal pills. Strength that was gained by normal medicinal pills still required some time to absorb, making that additional amount of strength truly become yours.</p>
 <p>The beauty of sacred fruits was that the energy belonged to you. The energy that was in your possession could be fully controlled skillfully, as if it was gained along with the rise in realm. For example, if a person gained a tremendous amount of strength and he shattered a teacup now even when he had no problem in holding one usually. This was the outcome of a tremendous increase in strength without the realm catching up. If the realm had caught up, one should be able to completely control the energy in his body as his heart wished.</p>
 <p>After consuming the Hallow Pill, Violet Qi Pellet and another type of medicinal pill, Luan Luan’s physical strength reached 260 stars. Under the effect of her Heart of Seven Orifices, it immediately became 780 stars. With a Threefold Weapon in her hands, her strength became slightly more than 3,000 stars…...</p>
 <p>The Hallow Pill was powerful but Qing Shui’s ‘wonder’ of forging played a big role too. In addition to their powerful cultivation techniques, Yiye Jiange and Luan Luan strengths were almost exactly 3,000 stars, at peak Grade Three Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan’s breakthrough had caused the strength of Qing Clan to soar all of a sudden. Canghai Mingyue and Di Qing were also about to breakthrough. Qing Shui was very happy in his heart. He didn’t really have to be to worried about his clan in the future.</p>
 <p>Aristocrat Clans and Sects were powerful because they possessed many powerful cultivators. Qing Shui had raised Qing Clan’s strength by relying on medicinal pills and forging. However, they were mostly relying on weapons. Without them, the Qing Clan’s strength would be as different as Heaven and Earth. But then again, all powerful cultivators relied on weapons. Without their weapons, many cultivators were trash too. Just like a saying in his previous world, no matter how glorious you are, you are nothing when you run out of money. This was nonsense but it had pointed out one thing; regardless of the method, it would be fine as long as one could survive and defeat his opponents. Winning was everything and no one would listen to the loser’s reasons. Sometimes, the losers didn’t even get a chance to tell their reasons.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Clan’s strength had overall been increased by a lot, most of the people were still unable to be improved. Perhaps he had to wait until he could concoct powerful medicinal pills that could be consumed without any limit to improve them. Just like this Hallow Pill, it would have been better if it wasn’t limited to only Martial Emperor’s consumption. Otherwise, many people from the Qing Clan would have been able to become a Martial Emperor…...</p>
 <p>They could only grow slowly. Qing Shui was already very content now. He had already earned more than enough during his visit to the Sacred Land of Panacea this time. It had let him and the Qing Clan advance by at least 50 years.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had only thought of making everyone in the clan into a Xiantian cultivator back then, so he thought of all kind of methods to concoct the Xiantian Golden Pellet only for the sake of those additional 500 years of lifespan.</p>
 <p>It was a different goal. Back then, even making everyone in the Qing Clan into a Xiantian cultivator was too high of a goal itself. Now that he was in a higher position, his expectations were different. A man who is never content is like a snake trying to swallow an elephant. In this situation, Qing Shui wasn’t even sure if one should know contentment or not.</p>
