 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 0129 – Martial Clinic (1)</strong></p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled bitterly to himself, feeling helpless as he glanced at Xiang Bao who was hanging onto his arm shamelessly. “Have you fallen in love with me?” Qing Shui stared at the flawless small face.</p>
  <p>“Dream on. Who would like you.” Xiang Bao’s small face turned pink and looked really pretty.</p>
  <p>“Then that’s good!” Qing Shui exclaimed exaggeratedly.</p>
  <p>“What, what do you mean by that? Am I that bad?” Xiang Bao stared angrily with her pair of pure looking eyes, and her small hands pinched Qing Shui on his arm. This cute little girl seemed to be very energetic today.</p>
  <p>“No, you’re very good, but it’s too bad that I already have a fiancee.” Qing Shui rubbed his nose and said, smiling.</p>
  <p>“Is it that Shi Qingzhuang from the Shi Clan who has plenty of rumors of being with you? She is Situ Bufan’s fiancee. You couldn’t be thinking of using your status as a Xiantian cultivator to snatch her, could you?” Xiang Bao’s pure looking eyes had a complicated look as she asked Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>With Xiang Bao’s reminder, Qing Shui realized that he had actually gained enough power to snatch Shi Qingzhuang away. It seems like it was time to finally consider if he will be snatching her away.</p>
  <p>“Hey… you can’t really be planning to snatch her away?” Xiang Bao asked in alarm.</p>
  <p>“Alright, stop fooling around. I still have matters to attend to!” <span style>Qing Shui looked towards his right arm which she was still Xiang Bao was tightly holding onto.</span> While he felt a tinge of softness and comfort, it was too bad that Qing Shui did not wish to get himself involved with such a little loli. He didn’t like pampered and stubborn little girls!</p>
  <p>“Don’t you even think of shoving me aside! I insist on following!” Xiang Bao pouted her lips and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui frowned, feeling slightly put off as his clear gaze looked towards the young lady from Xiang Clan. He disliked such clingy and pestering girls the most.</p>
  <p>“Alright, I won’t follow you. Did you really need to go to this far? It’s as if you’d eat me alive!” Xiang Bao felt uncomfortable upon seeing Qing Shui’s clear but emotionless gaze. She could only let go of Qing Shui for now, if not, he’d be even more put off by her.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui turned and left without saying a single word. This made Xiang Bao stomp the ground angrily. “Bad Qing Shui, stinky Qing Shui! How am I not good? That Shi Qingzhuang is an ice cube, I hope she freezes you to death!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui’s speed did not seem fast, but it was in fact faster many times than a normal person’s walking speed. There were many shops along the sides of the street, some were for rent, some were recruiting helpers, some were looking for business partners to collaborate with, and of course there were also those which were for sale!</p>
  <p>There were plenty of treasures all around across the world of the nine continents, but it was too bad that there were just too many people. Thankfully, the land was vast beyond one’s imagination, it’s just that there were too many places lurking with danger. The existence of demonic beasts imposed a restriction on many areas, thus there were many areas where not a lot of people headed to. Those who could head there were high level experts of at least the Xiantian realm, if not higher. When one was strong, of course they’d gain wealth!</p>
  <p>When he reached a crossroad junction, Qing Shui had wanted to turn right, but he heard some commotion coming from the left. It seemed like something had happened. Since Qing Shui had some time to spare, he decided to head down to take a look!</p>
  <p>“Dr. Yan, your medical skills almost ‘cured’ my butler to his death. What do you think we should do about this?” A voice that was filled with arrogance spoke out.</p>
  <p>“Mmm, it sounds a bit familiar!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt that the voice was very familiar, and lost control of himself as he started squeezing towards the front to take a look. Qing Shui smiled. The owner of that voice had once fainted from a beating given by Qing Shui. He seemed to be Shi Qingzhuang’s brother!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui took a look at the man lying on the floor who seemed to be over 50 years old. His face was a dark purplish color, and his breathing was very weak. The arrogant youth was facing two ladies, and out of two of them the one in front had a long and graceful figure. Her chest and hips were especially full and round. Qing Shui was stunned when he saw her face.</p>
  <p>It was a sickly look, with a pale pink color on the pale white face. Her pretty and pure eyes reflected indifference, her pink lips were shut tight, and her brows frowned slightly as she looked at the patient lying on the floor.</p>
  <p>“You’re talking gibberish. Since when did our lady do that? He was still fine after we treated him previously. He is obviously poisoned now, but when he came, it was merely a headache.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui raised his head to look at the lady who had spoken out. She was about 17 to 18 years old, slightly younger than that sickly beauty. She had a long ponytail, and her bright eyes complimented her youthful beauty even further.</p>
  <p>“You guys better help uncle to detox the poison. There’s nothing I can do for him here!” The indifferent lady who was addressed as Dr. Yan said in a soft voice. Her voice was very soft, with a tinge of mesmerizing hoarseness to it. It was very charming!</p>
  <p>“I’m talking gibberish? Everyone could see for themselves that my butler came to your clinic, and then he became like this after returning home. Do you think I shouldn’t be here to confront you, Dr. Yan?”</p>
  <p>The youth’s presumptuous gaze wandered all over the lady’s body, and especially on those peaks!</p>
  <p>“Hmph, Shi Mushi, don’t think that I don’t know that you have been having ideas towards our Lady Moyan. Aren’t you here today in a bid to force our lady to submit herself to you?”</p>
  <p>“Xue Er, no need to say anymore. Young Master Shi, you better bring the uncle to the Hundred Medicinal Hall. Any later, and he wouldn’t be able to make it.” The lady’s words seemed very urgent, but when she said it, they were slow, yet not awkward.</p>
  <p>“What a strange lady. She is by no means an unparalleled beauty, but no one would be able to resist her charms!” Qing Shui stared at the lady curiously.</p>
  <p>An abrupt voice spoke out!</p>
  <p>“Are you hoping that I’d give you another beating before you can bear to leave? Stop using such shameless methods to commit immoral acts. It will only make the lady look down on you even more.”</p>
  <p>Seeing that Shi Mushi still wanted to continue further, Qing Shui could not help but speak out.</p>
  <p>Shi Mushi was just about to blow up upon hearing these words, but he saw that it was the man who would wake him up even if he was dreaming. Furthermore, he had seen this man killing a Xiantian expert in a matter of seconds with his own hands at the wedding banquet the day before. Now that Qing Shui had suddenly appeared, he was even more astonished.</p>
  <p>“Brother Qing Shui, it’s you! You guys quickly bring Uncle Fu to the Hundred Medicinal Hall!” Shi Mushi looked towards Qing Shui smilingly after giving out the instructions.</p>
  <p>“Brother Qing Shui? When have we ever been that close?” Moreover, it seemed as if Shi Mushi was at least 1 or 2 years older than himself!</p>
  <p>“Haha, I even attended Brother Qing Zi’s wedding banquet yesterday.” Shi Mushi said shamelessly. Ever since Qing Shui appeared, that arrogance had completely disappeared.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui secretly admired him for having such thick skin. He had not given him a good expression all this while, but he was not afraid of losing face and acting all familiar with him, calling him brother here and there, thank goodness it was not very loud!</p>
  <p>The lady named Mo Yan also looked curiously at the young and elegant-looking man who could let Young Master Shi demean himself to try to get on his good graces. Other than being pleasing to look at, he looked completely normal!</p>
  <p>“Thank you!” The lady said, and then turned to head back to the clinic.</p>
  <p>“Wait a moment!”</p>
  <p>The lady frowned and looked at Qing Shui, “Is something the matter?”</p>
  <p>“Is your clinic hiring? I also know some medical skills, and would like to work there for a while.”</p>
  <p>The lady looked at Qing Shui with a puzzled look!</p>
  <p>“I can also ask for no pay!” Qing Shui said after giving it some thought!</p>
  <p>The lady remained puzzled as she looked at Qing Shui!</p>
  <p>“For every day that I work there, I’ll pay you a hundred taels of silver!” Qing Shui said solemnly after giving it some thought.</p>
  <p>The lady was even more puzzled as she looked at Qing Shui!</p>
  <p>“If not, make it two hundred taels. I’m only here to treat people. I’m a poor bloke, any more and I wouldn’t be able to afford it!” Qing Shui said with a bitter look.</p>
  <p>“Pfft!” A smile broke out on the sickly but beautiful face and it was as if the world had thawed, but she still remained to be an unparalleled beauty.</p>
  <p>“You should go consult a good clinic. Your illness is quite serious!” The lady pointed at his head cutely, the delicate appearance was so charming and enticing that it tugged on his heartstrings.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui: “…………………………………………”</p>
  <p>Shi Mushi looked at Qing Shui lifelessly, but he was very astonished. This was the highest level of picking up ladies, completely unlike his own unsightly methods. Merely a few words would make her remember him forever.</p>
  <p>If Qing Shui was to find out Shi Mushi’s thoughts, he would for sure be depressed. Qing Shui had not wanted to open a clinic for the sake of money. The money from Yu He Inn was sufficient for him. Ability was the most important thing. As for money, sufficient would be good. Therefore he had came up with the unnatural idea of helping out at that clinic for some time. Who would have thought that the lady would end up seeing him as a nutcase!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui turned and once again walked along the streets without a destination, thinking of where to set up his clinic!</p>
  <p>Shi Mushi followed Qing Shui. Qing Shui looked at him, puzzled.</p>
  <p>“Brother Qing Shui, do you have a thing with my sister?” Shi Mushi carefully probed Qing Shui as he gave him a slightly weird look.</p>
  <p>“Cough cough, did your sister tell your anything?” Qing Shui was a bit awkward, caught unaware by Shi Mushi. The reason he had not given this fellow a beating today was all because of Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
  <p>“Ever since the rumors spread, sister has not stepped out of the house. She often stares into space by herself. This has never happened before. Even when I ask her, she doesn’t say anything. I’d like to ask, are the rumors real?”</p>
  <p>“Don’t ask me, go ask your sister!” Qing Shui tried to said nonchalantly even though he was really worried for Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
  <p>“Mmm, this spot is not bad!” Qing Shui saw that there was a small shop the size of a house for sale somewhere not too far off from Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store!</p>
  <p>“You want to buy this small house?” Shi Mushi asked in surprise.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui nodded his head and walked in. There were three levels to this shop. The shop owner was a middle-aged married lady, with quite a well-to-do look. Upon hearing that Qing Shui had the intention of purchasing the shop, she immediately smiled brightly like a flower.</p>
  <p>“Big sister, be straightforward, you say a price, if it’s ok, I’ll take it. If not, I’ll go elsewhere!” Qing Shui felt uncomfortable at the lady’s hypocritical smile.</p>
  <p>“A fixed price, 100 thousand taels of silver!”</p>
  <p>“Mmm, esteemed brother, don’t go, we can always negotiate!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui stopped in his tracks. “Everyone is out to do business, one is sharper than another. Moreover, I had just purchased one nearby a few days back!”</p>
  <p>The middle-aged wealthy lady clenched her teeth, 50 thousand, this is the lowest price!”</p>
  <p>“30 thousand. If you’re willing, I’ll immediately buy it. You know better than anyone how much this house is worth!” Qing Shui smiled and said. He knew that this type of shophouse was too small, and it would be hard to do much business in it. Qing Shui felt that only he would be able to put it to good use. For medicine, he could just write out the prescription for the patients to head to medical stores or medical halls to get the medicine. He would just focus on providing consultation and acupuncture.</p>
  <p>“Esteemed brother, you can’t be so harsh. If it’s 30 thousand, then I would still suffer a loss of 10 thousand!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui remained silent, and only smiled while he looked at the middle-age married lady!</p>
  <p>“35 thousand. Let’s make it 35 thousand, this way we each give in 5 thousand. It’s also not easy for me being a widow taking care of a child!” The lady played the emotion card.</p>
  <p>“Alright, let’s do that!” Qing Shui seeing that the other party even brought out the topic of a widow taking care of a child, he didn’t even bother to check if it was the truth. Moreover, he himself did not care about that 5 thousand taels of silver.</p>
  <p>The administration was in place and both parties quickly completed the transaction. The married lady left very quickly. Qing Shui realized the reason why after he stepped in. All three levels were completely empty; there wasn’t even a table to be seen!</p>
  <p>In the future, this place would become the Martial Clinic!</p>

The existence of demonic beasts imposed a restriction on many areas, thus there were many areas where not a lot of people headed to. Those who could head there were high level experts of at least the Xiantian realm, if not higher. When one was strong, of course they’d gain wealth!</p>
 <p>When he reached a crossroad junction, Qing Shui had wanted to turn right, but he heard some commotion coming from the left. It seemed like something had happened. Since Qing Shui had some time to spare, he decided to head down to take a look!</p>
 <p>“Dr. Yan, your medical skills almost ‘cured’ my butler to his death. What do you think we should do about this?” A voice that was filled with arrogance spoke out.</p>
 <p>“Mmm, it sounds a bit familiar!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that the voice was very familiar, and lost control of himself as he started squeezing towards the front to take a look. Qing Shui smiled. The owner of that voice had once fainted from a beating given by Qing Shui. He seemed to be Shi Qingzhuang’s brother!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took a look at the man lying on the floor who seemed to be over 50 years old. His face was a dark purplish color, and his breathing was very weak. The arrogant youth was facing two ladies, and out of two of them the one in front had a long and graceful figure. Her chest and hips were especially full and round. Qing Shui was stunned when he saw her face.</p>
 <p>It was a sickly look, with a pale pink color on the pale white face. Her pretty and pure eyes reflected indifference, her pink lips were shut tight, and her brows frowned slightly as she looked at the patient lying on the floor.</p>
 <p>“You’re talking gibberish. Since when did our lady do that? He was still fine after we treated him previously. He is obviously poisoned now, but when he came, it was merely a headache.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui raised his head to look at the lady who had spoken out. She was about 17 to 18 years old, slightly younger than that sickly beauty. She had a long ponytail, and her bright eyes complimented her youthful beauty even further.</p>
 <p>“You guys better help uncle to detox the poison. There’s nothing I can do for him here!” The indifferent lady who was addressed as Dr. Yan said in a soft voice. Her voice was very soft, with a tinge of mesmerizing hoarseness to it. It was very charming!</p>
 <p>“I’m talking gibberish? Everyone could see for themselves that my butler came to your clinic, and then he became like this after returning home. Do you think I shouldn’t be here to confront you, Dr. Yan?”</p>
 <p>The youth’s presumptuous gaze wandered all over the lady’s body, and especially on those peaks!</p>
 <p>“Hmph, Shi Mushi, don’t think that I don’t know that you have been having ideas towards our Lady Moyan. Aren’t you here today in a bid to force our lady to submit herself to you?”</p>
 <p>“Xue Er, no need to say anymore. Young Master Shi, you better bring the uncle to the Hundred Medicinal Hall. Any later, and he wouldn’t be able to make it.” The lady’s words seemed very urgent, but when she said it, they were slow, yet not awkward.</p>
 <p>“What a strange lady. She is by no means an unparalleled beauty, but no one would be able to resist her charms!” Qing Shui stared at the lady curiously.</p>
 <p>An abrupt voice spoke out!</p>
 <p>“Are you hoping that I’d give you another beating before you can bear to leave? Stop using such shameless methods to commit immoral acts. It will only make the lady look down on you even more.”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Shi Mushi still wanted to continue further, Qing Shui could not help but speak out.</p>
 <p>Shi Mushi was just about to blow up upon hearing these words, but he saw that it was the man who would wake him up even if he was dreaming. Furthermore, he had seen this man killing a Xiantian expert in a matter of seconds with his own hands at the wedding banquet the day before. Now that Qing Shui had suddenly appeared, he was even more astonished.</p>
 <p>“Brother Qing Shui, it’s you! You guys quickly bring Uncle Fu to the Hundred Medicinal Hall!” Shi Mushi looked towards Qing Shui smilingly after giving out the instructions.</p>
 <p>“Brother Qing Shui? When have we ever been that close?” Moreover, it seemed as if Shi Mushi was at least 1 or 2 years older than himself!</p>
 <p>“Haha, I even attended Brother Qing Zi’s wedding banquet yesterday.” Shi Mushi said shamelessly. Ever since Qing Shui appeared, that arrogance had completely disappeared.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui secretly admired him for having such thick skin. He had not given him a good expression all this while, but he was not afraid of losing face and acting all familiar with him, calling him brother here and there, thank goodness it was not very loud!</p>
 <p>The lady named Mo Yan also looked curiously at the young and elegant-looking man who could let Young Master Shi demean himself to try to get on his good graces. Other than being pleasing to look at, he looked completely normal!</p>
 <p>“Thank you!” The lady said, and then turned to head back to the clinic.</p>
 <p>“Wait a moment!”</p>
 <p>The lady frowned and looked at Qing Shui, “Is something the matter?”</p>
 <p>“Is your clinic hiring? I also know some medical skills, and would like to work there for a while.”</p>
 <p>The lady looked at Qing Shui with a puzzled look!</p>
 <p>“I can also ask for no pay!” Qing Shui said after giving it some thought!</p>
 <p>The lady remained puzzled as she looked at Qing Shui!</p>
 <p>“For every day that I work there, I’ll pay you a hundred taels of silver!” Qing Shui said solemnly after giving it some thought.</p>
 <p>The lady was even more puzzled as she looked at Qing Shui!</p>
 <p>“If not, make it two hundred taels. I’m only here to treat people. I’m a poor bloke, any more and I wouldn’t be able to afford it!” Qing Shui said with a bitter look.</p>
 <p>“Pfft!” A smile broke out on the sickly but beautiful face and it was as if the world had thawed, but she still remained to be an unparalleled beauty.</p>
 <p>“You should go consult a good clinic. Your illness is quite serious!” The lady pointed at his head cutely, the delicate appearance was so charming and enticing that it tugged on his heartstrings.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui: “…………………………………………”</p>
 <p>Shi Mushi looked at Qing Shui lifelessly, but he was very astonished. This was the highest level of picking up ladies, completely unlike his own unsightly methods. Merely a few words would make her remember him forever.</p>
 <p>If Qing Shui was to find out Shi Mushi’s thoughts, he would for sure be depressed. Qing Shui had not wanted to open a clinic for the sake of money. The money from Yu He Inn was sufficient for him. Ability was the most important thing. As for money, sufficient would be good. Therefore he had came up with the unnatural idea of helping out at that clinic for some time. Who would have thought that the lady would end up seeing him as a nutcase!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned and once again walked along the streets without a destination, thinking of where to set up his clinic!</p>
 <p>Shi Mushi followed Qing Shui. Qing Shui looked at him, puzzled.</p>
 <p>“Brother Qing Shui, do you have a thing with my sister?” Shi Mushi carefully probed Qing Shui as he gave him a slightly weird look.</p>
 <p>“Cough cough, did your sister tell your anything?” Qing Shui was a bit awkward, caught unaware by Shi Mushi. The reason he had not given this fellow a beating today was all because of Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
 <p>“Ever since the rumors spread, sister has not stepped out of the house. She often stares into space by herself. This has never happened before. Even when I ask her, she doesn’t say anything. I’d like to ask, are the rumors real?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t ask me, go ask your sister!” Qing Shui tried to said nonchalantly even though he was really worried for Shi Qingzhuang.</p>
 <p>“Mmm, this spot is not bad!” Qing Shui saw that there was a small shop the size of a house for sale somewhere not too far off from Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store!</p>
 <p>“You want to buy this small house?” Shi Mushi asked in surprise.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded his head and walked in. There were three levels to this shop. The shop owner was a middle-aged married lady, with quite a well-to-do look. Upon hearing that Qing Shui had the intention of purchasing the shop, she immediately smiled brightly like a flower.</p>
 <p>“Big sister, be straightforward, you say a price, if it’s ok, I’ll take it. If not, I’ll go elsewhere!” Qing Shui felt uncomfortable at the lady’s hypocritical smile.</p>
 <p>“A fixed price, 100 thousand taels of silver!”</p>
 <p>“Mmm, esteemed brother, don’t go, we can always negotiate!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stopped in his tracks. “Everyone is out to do business, one is sharper than another. Moreover, I had just purchased one nearby a few days back!”</p>
 <p>The middle-aged wealthy lady clenched her teeth, 50 thousand, this is the lowest price!”</p>
 <p>“30 thousand. If you’re willing, I’ll immediately buy it. You know better than anyone how much this house is worth!” Qing Shui smiled and said. He knew that this type of shophouse was too small, and it would be hard to do much business in it. Qing Shui felt that only he would be able to put it to good use. For medicine, he could just write out the prescription for the patients to head to medical stores or medical halls to get the medicine. He would just focus on providing consultation and acupuncture.</p>
 <p>“Esteemed brother, you can’t be so harsh. If it’s 30 thousand, then I would still suffer a loss of 10 thousand!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui remained silent, and only smiled while he looked at the middle-age married lady!</p>
 <p>“35 thousand. Let’s make it 35 thousand, this way we each give in 5 thousand. It’s also not easy for me being a widow taking care of a child!” The lady played the emotion card.</p>
 <p>“Alright, let’s do that!” Qing Shui seeing that the other party even brought out the topic of a widow taking care of a child, he didn’t even bother to check if it was the truth. Moreover, he himself did not care about that 5 thousand taels of silver.</p>
 <p>The administration was in place and both parties quickly completed the transaction. The married lady left very quickly. Qing Shui realized the reason why after he stepped in. All three levels were completely empty; there wasn’t even a table to be seen!</p>
 <p>In the future, this place would become the Martial Clinic!</p>
