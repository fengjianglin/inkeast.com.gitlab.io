 <p><strong>AST 600 - Obtaining a treasure, Arriving at the Central Continent again</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui was not worried that the Thunderous Beast would not be able to survive in his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The Thunderous Beast’s ability to adapt was very strong. Furthermore, Qing Shui had decided to bring the entire Golden Buddha Aura Lotus into the Realm.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that he had to be quick. In the event that the Old Thunderous Beast had not met any accident and suddenly returned, they will be in deep trouble!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out his Water Repelling Pearl and directly thrust it into the water. He wanted to transport the entire Golden Buddha Aura Lotus as well as the little Thunderous Beast within it into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was quite surprised to find that the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus actually had roots above the riverbed. The roots extend about a hundred meters into the water. Under the water, the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus had rhizomes which were as thick as a human’s body. They were like a huge python, the fibrous roots intertwined a large, complicated and extended mess.</p>
 <p>Keep!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui pushed his spirit energy to its peak. He brought the entire Golden Buddha Aura Lotus into his Realm and placed it into the pond. Luckily for him, his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had become much larger after he raised it to the sixth layer. The pond had expanded a few times in size. The depth of the pond barely contained the plant but the plant had to extend outward.</p>
 <p>It was said that once the Thunderous Beast opened its eyes, it will protect the first person it saw for its entire life. Most of the time, however, the first thing that it saw was the Old Thunderous Beast.</p>
 <p>After he had placed them properly, Qing Shui left the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and flew out of the water. Qing Shui inferred that the Old Thunderous Beast must not have left more than a year, otherwise the baby Thunderous Beast would have already opened its eyes.</p>
 <p>From what he observed, the baby Thunderous Beast would open its eyes soon. Before that, the Old Thunderous Beast will definitely rush back if it was still alive. With that in mind, Qing Shui knew that they have to leave this place quickly.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Di Chen was puzzled because the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus suddenly disappeared. Additionally, she wondered why Qing Shui dived into the water. Just when she suspected that something was going on, Qing Shui suddenly came out of the water.</p>
 <p>“Sister Chen, let’s go. Quick.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui pulled Di Chen’s sleeve and ran back to their camp quickly. Qing Shui did not want to explain the situation with the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus right now, as he sensed imminent danger. He had the intuition that he was correct.</p>
 <p>Di Chen felt weird when Qing Shui ran and pulled her along by her sleeve. She could not say what this feeling was and neither did she know what this man was thinking. She only knew that he was very good to her.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly packed up the tents and other things. Without even eating breakfast, they sat on the Fire Bird and flew towards the Central Continent speedily. Mid-journey, they also flew to the west for about ten thousand miles.</p>
 <p>Even though they had escaped, Qing Shui felt that the Old Thunderous Beast might have met its demise. After all, the beast would not leave the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus for more than three days. It will accompany the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus till its death but it will also die if the plant dies.</p>
 <p>Another rumor said that a Thunderous Beast would only give birth to its young when it was about to die. However, Qing Shui was afraid that something might happen to them, which was why he left hurriedly.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, why are we leaving so quickly. What did you see?” perplexed, Di Chen asked Qing Shui as they flew on his Fire Bird.</p>
 <p>“I’m afraid that the Old Thunderous Beast will appear.” Qing Shui was still worried as he looked behind them.</p>
 <p>“Old Thunderous Beast?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, there was a baby Thunderous Beast within the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus. It had not opened its eyes. I got it out.” Qing Shui replied thoughtfully.</p>
 <p>“A Thunderous Beast cannot leave its Golden Buddha Aura Lotus. It takes one thousand years to mature. Unless you use those sort of legendary pills which can boost its growth rate. Unfortunately, that sort of medicine or items were rare treasures. You won’t be able to buy them even with money nor exchange for them.” replied Di Chen, who did not look happy at all. She seemed to be trying to tell Qing Shui that the baby Thunderous Beast had little worth. Even though they had the Golden Buddha Aura Lotus, the baby Thunderous Beast was still too pitiful.</p>
 <p>“I wanted to give it to you because of this, since I have a way to expedite its growth.” Qing Shui touched his nose, feeling a little awkward. He just directly kept it without even offering it to her just now.</p>
 <p>I don’t want it! The better the demonic beast is, the longer it takes to mature. By that time, I would already be an old woman.” Di Chen replied casually.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>After two months, the Central Continent was finally within sight.</p>
 <p>“Sister Chen, which country should we go to first?” Qing Shui asked with a smile.</p>
 <p>“You can decide. I prefer to not think about anything right now and not make any decision. It is relaxing this way.” Di Chen laughed lightly as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>She had worn her snow white veil again but Qing Shui felt he could still see her beautiful smile!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui touched his nose as he heard those words. This woman was a woman with her own strong views. Over these years, she had always been a quick and decisive person. She made all her decisions on her own and was very opinionated. Despite that, she actually said something like that to Qing Shui, he found it rather unfamiliar.</p>
 <p>“Well then, let’s go to Xing Hai Country first!”</p>
 <p>Since they were already at the Xing Hai Country, it would be impolite to not pay the Qianyu Clan a visit since he had some connections with them.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, if we plan to go to the Di residence in the future, you must act as my husband..” Di Chen seemed to have thought of something as she whispered to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Her veil covered her face, but it could not cover her heart. Qing Shui was amazed that he could feel her anxiousness. It was just like when they were at the dream among the sea of flowers.</p>
 <p>Di Chen seemed to have felt it too. Her elegant eyes held a peculiar expression as she looked at Qing Shui. At this moment, there was a sort of ambiguous romantic attraction.</p>
 <p>Red-Lined Snake!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could not help but remember the Red-Lined Snake. Trying to remain calm, he broke the gaze and laughed, “Since Sister Chen is not afraid, what am I afraid of. I’ll just do what you want.”</p>
 <p>“Then, we should start acting now… otherwise, it will be easy for others to see through our act..” This was the first time her unique and calming voice faltered. She actually showed some hesitation.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt a little bewildered. Di Chen was not like this in the past. Even though they had known each other for some time and had often met up. Even spending time every day together on this three month journey and meeting a Red-Lined Snake along the way...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui believed that familiarity breeds fondness. Besides, when they first met, it was in such a dramatic way. The scene of Qing Shui touching Di Chen’s silky bosom within the dream among the sea of flowers had replayed in his head countless times…</p>
 <p>This had already been carved into their soul.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could feel that Di Chen was actually very nervous so he just laughed and said, “Well, what should we call each other?”</p>
 <p>After asking, Qing Shui realized that he really did not know what to call her. He usually called the women around him by their names, occasionally using the term ‘lass’ for endearment.</p>
 <p>“Let’s just use each other's name. How about that?” Di Chen hesitated for a while before she finally gave such an answer.</p>
 <p>“Sister Chen has always been calling me by my name.”</p>
 <p>“You should call me by my name too.”</p>
 <p>“Di Chen seems so distant..” Qing Shui replied laughingly.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“We’re here. We will stay here for a day before going to Jade Sea Country.” Qing Shui said while pointing to the Qianyu Clan’s manor.</p>
 <p>After that, his Fire Bird landed some distance away from the manor. Qing Shui then walked toward the manor with Di Chen by his side. The feeling he had coming to the Central Continent this time round was vastly different from the previous visit.</p>
 <p>Previously, when he had not even reached Martial Saint level, he could already defeat a Grade One Martial Saint with his full strength. This time around, he could not be compared to what he was before. Perhaps, the only people who could defeat him were within that group.</p>
 <p>When they reach the gate, they coincidentally met Qianyu Feifei who was coming out. When she saw Qing Shui, her face instantly showed her surprise, she happily ran over called, “Big brother!”</p>
 <p>“Feifei, where are you going?” Qing Shui smiled and asked as the little lass hugged his arm.</p>
 <p>“This must be sister-in-law?” Qianyu Feifei glance at Di Chen with her large eyes. Once again, she had asked a question that made Qing Shui feel awkward. Previously, when he came her with Di Qing, she had asked the same question.</p>
 <p>“You must be Feifei. Your big brother has mentioned about you before.” Di Chen saw that Qing Shui’s was feeling awkward and that he seemed to be considering something, so she stood forward to reply with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Oh! You are really sister-in-law. You are so beautiful. Big brother is so fortunate!”</p>
 <p>“That is some way to praise a person..” Qing Shui muttered.</p>
 <p>The three of them headed toward the manor. Di Chen was now conversing with Qianyu Feifei, whereas Qing Shui followed at the side unable to join in, so he decided to look around.</p>
 <p>They had not walked for long when they met Qianyu He and Qianyu Dingjun coming out with smiling faces. Qing Shui knew that it must be because Qianyu Feifei had informed someone to announce their arrival.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, you’re here.”</p>
 <p>“Uncle Jun, brother He!” Qing Shui greeted with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Brother Qing Shui!”</p>
 <p>“Let’s talk inside.” Qianyu Dingjun pulled Qing Shui wrist as he said amiably.</p>
 <p>Before Qing Shui could introduce Di Chen, Qianyu Feifei had already blurted out that she was Qing Shui’s wife. Qing Shui knew that he could not oppose that.</p>
 <p>A short time later, Qianyu Qingqing returned. She greeted him happily when she saw him. After knowing that the beautiful veiled lady was his wife, she also said that Qing Shui was a fortunate man just like Qianyu Feifei had complimented him…</p>
 <p>“Uncle Jun, are you familiar with the Duanmu Clan from Zhongyuan Country?” Qing Shui could not help but ask when he thought about the Duanmu Clan. Even Elder Ge from Greencloud Continent was unfamiliar with them.</p>
 <p>“Duanmu Clan? Qing Shui did you provoke them?” Qianyu Dingjun said in a manner as if he had lost his voice, his face grim.</p>
 <p>“No I did not provoke them, I just wanted to know what was their influence like in Zhongyuan Country?” Qing Shui replied quickly. From Qianyu Dingjun’s expression, he could tell that Duanmu Clan was an extremely large and powerful clan.</p>
 <p>“Duanmu Clan is very famous throughout the Central Continent. They can’t be considered the very top, but they are within that circle. The head of the Duanmu clan is a woman. She is also Duanmu Ling’s wife. Duanmu Ling died at a young age, leaving his young child and his wife. Nobody would have thought that such an enigmatic woman would actually be so powerful. She managed to support the entire Duanmu Clan by herself.” Qianyu Dingjun voice was filled with admiration even as he explained.</p>
 <p>“How is Madame Duanmu’s character?” Qing Shui asked with great interest.</p>
 <p>“She is an amazing woman. She is kind and charitable. She is someone that is very benevolent and sympathetic. She is honest and upright and values loyalty. On the other hand, she can be very cruel to her foes and she never shows mercy to her enemies. All in all, she has a good relationship with people and has a good reputation.”</p>
 <p>“Some time back, she was poisoned. Uncle Jun do you know anything about that?” Qing Shui wondered why nobody stepped forward to help her during such a situation. Her daughter had to run to Greencloud Continent, bearing that sort of pain… If she had not met him, she probably would have been met with a tragic fate.</p>
 <p>“I know. There were a lot of controversies because of it. That situation between the Duanmu Clan and Dongguo Clan where both families were enemies of each other. The Dongguo Clan poisoned Madame Duanmu using some unscrupulous method. They planned to annihilate the entire Duanmu Clan. Unfortunately for them, they were stopped by Madame Duanmu’s friends. Actually, Duanmu Clan could defend themselves but after Madame Duanmu was poisoned she lost the abilities to use her hands, which led to a split in the clan. Someone wanted to take this chance to control the clan so they colluded with the Dongguo Clan. The poison that Madame Duanmu was poisoned with is called Poison Marsh Kirin. The poison is from Dongguo Silang’s demonic beast. In such a situation where there was trouble outside as well as internal conflicts in the clan, Madame Duanmu could only depend on her friends. But for some reasons, after a bit over a year, she was actually cured. There were alchemists within her group of friends but it was rumored that the person who cured her was actually from another continent. “</p>
 <p>“So, what it is like internally at the Dongguo Clan and Duanmu Clan now? Qing Shui knew that Madame Duanmu was fine now and that it was he himself who cured her.</p>
 <p>“They got the punishment they deserved. It only took three days.” Qianyu Dingjun seemed somewhat sad and even a little bit emotional.</p>
