 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Please spare my life! Mister Ye was the one who made me do these." The man's body was limp, and he was in so much pain that his body was completely drenched in cold sweat. Currently, he was simply begging for mercy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui looked at this man. He was middle-aged with narrow long eyes. Qing Shui said, "Where are the bones? Don't tell me they are in him. His bones are still his."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What kind of person was Qing Shui? He naturally saw through everything by using his Heavenly Vision Technique. Moreover, this person didn't have the ability to change one's bones either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man shivered and Qing Shui's heart shivered as well. He was really scared that his son's bones were gone for good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Speak up. Where are the bones?" Qing Shui's voice was ice-cold and piercing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"They have been fed..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui kicked out, sending the man flying. What kind of force did this kick contain? The man died immediately. Qing Shui's hair was raised, fluttering despite the absence of wind. The thing he feared the most had happened and an indescribably fury emerged within him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother, let's head to the Ye Clan to take a look.” Cong Yunlong was also extremely furious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui looked at that kid. Despite being of such a young age, his gaze was very vicious and he appeared so cold that he didn't have the bearing of a child. Qing Shui didn't think of killing him. This had nothing to do with the child and Qing Shui was in no mood to take this kid into consideration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He just got someone to take the kid away and take care of him, and told them that they were not to beat him up or do any sort of bullying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This child was a descendent of the Golden Yakshas and it seemed that he wasn't any different from humans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother, tell me where the Ye Clan is. I'll go by myself," Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No way. I'll go with you. The Ye Clan isn't as simple as you think they are. After all, they are an influence in the Nine Continents Star Ocean Domain. Moreover the Huang Clan, the Jin Clan, and the Cha Clan are all on their side as well. If the Ye Clan were to be in danger, they won't let things slide." Of course Cong Yunlong wouldn't agree to Qing Shui going alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There's no need to look for us, we've come. You're not staying at the Northern Emperor Domain and have decided to come to the North Sea. Do you think that you'll still be able to continue living?" A bright voice rang out from the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui walked out and saw a lot of people in the distance. This was the ocean doman and the tall Golden Yakshas flickered in golden light, emitting violent energy. They exuded a mysterious force and were staring at Qing Shui as if they were looking at a dead man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Which of you laid your hands on my child?" Qing Shui walked over and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Golden Yakshas would have some reservations if they were on land, but things were different now that they were in water. In the ocean, their strength would receive a boost while a human’s strength would drop. However, Qing Shui was proficient in the water element and also had the Water Flight ability. Therefore, his strength wasn’t impeded the slightest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Cong Yunlong, you're here as well? This is good. Cong Yunlong killed my child, but you protected him and even killed countless of our Ye Clan's experts. Today, I'm going to settle our debts. I had merely dug out two bones from your child. That was to lure you over. The bones are here, are you able to retrieve them?" A tall Golden Yakshas held two boxes and even opened them to show Qing Shui. The two snow white bones in the boxes were the pieces which had been dug out from Qing Xiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the bones made Qing Shui inwardly heave a sigh of relief. He stared at the tall Golden Yaksha and said, "You're really courting death."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After saying that, Qing Shui charged out like a gust of wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Windwhisk Willow!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Windwhisk Willow was extremely eerie. It didn't seem very quick, but was actually astonishingly fast. Moreover, Qing Shui had already integrated the Windwhisk Willow into his Nine Palace Steps. In the blink of an eye, he appeared before the opponent and reached out with his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gouging Strike!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he snatched the bones from the other party's hands, a gleam of light shone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone saw a massive head flying into the sky. That glimmer of light then returned to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Divine Weapon Flying Sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first time Qing Shui had used the Flying Sword in front of others. Moreover, it was a Grade 16 Flying Sword of terrifying prowess. Not many people were able to see that it was a Flying Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was thoroughly enraged. If he didn't kill this person, he would feel horrible. Therefore, he used the Flying Sword directly. This was actually one of his killing moves and he hadn't planned on revealing it so early.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui stood before the tall Golden Yakshas. HIs figure was a lot smaller compared to the Golden Yakshas, but he gave off the illusion that his presence was tall and mighty, even more so than the Golden Yakshas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything happened too quickly and they didn't even manage to react at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He killed Third Brother! He actually killed Third Brother!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Father!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other party was in a mess. They looked at Qing Shui as if they were spewing flames, but no one dared to charge out. Qing Shui's earlier attack was too terrifying. The few older Golden Yakshas in the front also had to reassess the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While they were still reassessing the situation, Qing Shui’s fury raged on. He said to an old Golden Yaksha, "We'll have to settle this sooner or later. Let's just get this over with right now."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui held the Golden Battle Halberd and charged forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mighty Elephant Stomp!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Five Elements Divine Refining Technique!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui unleashed his techniques casually and charged out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His actions took many people by surprise. Beihuang Fan was worried about Qing Shui since the opponents were many Golden Yakshas. It was too dangerous for him to charge out alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Golden Yakshas were also astonished. What was this young man trying to do? Was he going to kill everyone by himself?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Kill him! Kill him!"</span></p>

The surrounding rocks all shattered and the water currents were cut off. They were at the bottom of the ocean, but the surrounding water currents had been completely cut off.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui charged out once again, unleashing continuous strikes with the Golden Battle Halberd. Each time the Flying Sword flew out, it would take the life of a Golden Yaksha. Qing Shui also called out his demonic beasts. Long Zhu`er's great spider web entangled a large number of them and the Dragon Slaying Beast shuttled about, launching sneak attacks. Every attack was lethal as it flashed around like a ghost in the battlefield, catching opponents by surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui called back the Divine Weapon Flying Sword. After making several hundred kills, Qing Shui felt a little tired. The depletion from this Grade 16 Divine Weapon Flying Sword was tremendous. With the help of his demonic beasts, he no longer needed to use his Divine Weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because the Golden Yakshas were already retreating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, Qing Shui's attacks were too terrifying, whether it was the Flying Sword or the Stellar Transposition. The Stellar Transposition in particular, had been able to kill the Ye Clan's Doyen in a single move. However, he was only able to use the Stellar Transposition once every several minutes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon Slaying Beast's and Long Zhu`er's teamwork made them seem like a massacre machine. Both of them used the Heavenly Magic Stars and the Dragon Slaying Beast's speed surged exponentially while Long Zhu`er's spider threads became even more strong and sturdy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spider net covered a huge area and a single strand of spider thread could entangle those that wished to flee. The spider thread would rapidly entangle the targets and the Dragon Slaying Beast would go for the kill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While the Dragon Slaying Beast was the primary attacker, the Dark Phoenix had both control and attacking abilities. It could reduce the opponent's speed substantially before attacking violently with a combination of fire and ice. Qing Shui's Golden Battle Halberd was also effective in attacking. After all, the Golden Yakshas weren't as powerful as the people from the Nine Continents Food Residence. If Qing Shui's Golden Battle Halberd struck the opponent's weakness, even if they weren't killed, they would be gravely injured.</span></p>
