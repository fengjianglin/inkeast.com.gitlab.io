 <p><strong>AST 1064 - Earth Essence, Dragon Spine Mountain, The Symbol of Lion King's Ridge</strong></p>
 <p>His speed didn't appear very fast, but it came over like a huge formless mountain range, giving off an extremely imposing feeling.</p>
 <p>Sixth Wave of the Great Golden Buddha Palm!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't hold back and used the sixth wave of the Great Golden Buddha Palm!</p>
 <p>Pa pa pa!</p>
 <p>Consecutive explosions rang out as the Earth Jiao's body nimbly passed through those six golden buddle palms. Qing Shui performed the Nine Palace Steps and dodged once again before quickly activating the Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation!</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>The faint gold colored image let out a growl and although the pressure it exuded wasn't as powerful as the Earth Jiao, it had a terrifying explosive prowess to it. This was the Earth Diamond Bear which was a legendary existence that was comparable to a dragon. It was a pity that it was currently only in the adolescent phase and was just a phantom image.</p>
 <p>Buddha's True Eyes!</p>
 <p>Primordial Double Dragon Dance!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly circulated his powers to its peak. He knew he was no match for his opponent, but still wished to give it a try as there weren't many chances like this. He didn't dare to call out his Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant as it was much weaker compared to this Earth Jiao. It wouldn't be able to stand up to the Earth Jiao and it would be a tremendous loss if it was killed instantly.</p>
 <p>The two grey-colored dragons each the size of an adult's arm shot out, instantlý tangling themselves with the Earth Jiao.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>The Earth Jiao looked at the grey-colored flame dragons that were closing in. It opened its big mouth and an earth colored gas encompassed the two grey-colored flame dragons, rapidly extinguishing the primordial flames.</p>
 <p>Although fire wasn’t weak to earth in the theory of the five elements, even water had a two-way restricting relationship with fire. For one side to be able to overcome the other, it must be more powerful. While water can extinguish fire, the prerequisite was that there must be enough water.</p>
 <p>Earth could also extinguish fire. What the Jiao had spewed out was a type of "Earth Essence". Used by the Jiao, it was extremely powerful and terrifying. The Jiao was doted by the earth and its talent lied in its extremely strong defense. In this mountainous and rocky terrain, it had the absolute advantage and could do whatever it wished, be it to fly or to dig into the ground. Its huge body was its greatest weapon and its attack was many times more powerful. That was an attack using the force of the earth!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui only felt that the "earth clouds" were nearing him and his primordial flame dragons were constantly being corroded. He suddenly felt extremely uneasy.</p>
 <p>His first reflex action was to perform the Nine Palace Steps. However, he had just lifted up one of his foot when the huge Earth Jiao's tail suddenly appeared. Qing Shui's heart skipped a beat as he quickly slapped out with his other hand.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>He hadn't been able to dodge this completely. Qing Shui had just started to move when he was struck by the huge tail. He felt as if his bones had all come apart and was feeling hot in his throat. He couldn't help but spouted out a mouthful of blood.</p>
 <p>This was the result Qing Shui had achieved after hitting against the Earth Jiao's body to accelerate and dodge the attack. Despite doing so, he was still hit by the force of the earth. In terms of physical strength, Qing Shui was far too weak in comparison to the Earth Jiao.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui showed no hesitation and entered the formation, tossing out a formation flag which was destroyed and replacing it with a new one. His face was pale as he looked at the people who were worried for him.</p>
 <p>"Erm, I've overestimated myself... Let's leave this place quickly!" Qing Shui rubbed his nose and said with a bitter smile hanging on his pale face.</p>
 <p>The women's hearts were aching, but they were also reproachful toward him. The few of them then stood together, destroying the eye of the formation just as the Nine Continents Steps was activated, disappearing from their spot amidst the Earth Jiao's furious roar.</p>
 <p>The Nine Continent Steps was the final trick Qing Shui had up his sleeves. If he were to fight head-on with the Earth Jiao, he basically won't have much chances of winning. Within the Five continents, the Earth Jiao was a top notch existence and was known as the beast of the earth.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>A few days later, Qing Shui and the others could already see Dragon Spine Mountain and was gazing at it from afar. It was a mountain range, its rising peaks and falling troughs resembled the skeleton of a huge dragon. From afar, they could sense a faint pressure similar to an ancient aura, giving off a desolate and impressive feeling.</p>
 <p>Dragon Spine Mountain, this was Dragon Spine Mountain!</p>
 <p>While they were there, they could occasionally see flying demonic beasts flying in from various directions as well as those that were flying out. There were no interactions between both sides, but those who could come here were all dominating and influential characters.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui called out the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and flew toward the Dragon Spine Mountain. This time around, there was still some time before they could enter the Ancient Ruins. Although they only traveled by using the Nine Continents Steps, they still arrived about 20 days earlier.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had long since recovered from his wounds. Not only had he recovered, he was also stronger than before. When they walked up to the Dragon Spine Mountain, the discovered a huge mountain range that was inclining toward the northeast. That was the beginning of this stretch of mountain, which was also the dragon's head.</p>
 <p>Currently, there were quite a few people scarcely scattered around. It might be because they had plenty of time that some of them were going around the area on their demonic beasts or looking for some medicinal herbs. There were also some who stayed in their tents and those who stayed outside and talked.</p>
 <p>All these people originated from different places. There were many people, at least several tens of thousands of them. Of course, many of them came along as accompaniment and those who could actually enter were much lesser in numbers. It would still depend on how weak the seal turned out to be.</p>
 <p>The people who had come were all top influences and the strongest people within the five continents. Many of them had a strong arrogance which rejected everything else. Of course, there were also some people who were wearing warm smiles and would nod and even greet the people they came across.</p>
 <p>There were people of varying strengths, yet many of them had the strength of 5,000 stars. Under normal circumstances, it would be hard for one to encounter anyone of such a level, but there were too many of them here. After all, this was where all the strongest cultivators in the five continents who could make it would come. Entering the Ancient Ruins was a very good opportunity and if they were lucky, they might be able to achieve great progress. Thus, it would be worth it even if they were to risk their lives.</p>
 <p>The auras here were all mixed together, but there were some faint auras which were extremely powerful. Qing Shui suddenly felt that Yiye Jiange's aura was in a state of disorder. He was stunned and quickly looked toward her.</p>
 <p>What greeted him was Yiye Jiange wearing a complicated expression as she looked into the far distance, feeling pained yet helpless. There was indescribable pain and fury in her gaze, and when Qing Shui saw this, he could guess what was wrong.</p>
 <p>"Did you see someone from Lion King's Ridge?" Qing Shui held one of Yiye Jiange's hands as he asked out of concerned.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw a spread of tents, each of them having the image of an impressive blue-colored male lion. Its azure blue fur was like an armor, its blue colored eyes showing off a gleam that was piercingly cold.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that Yiye Jiange must have become so pained and furious after seeing this symbol. He knew how she felt and grabbed her hand tightly while whispering, "It'll be very soon. I'll soon bring you there and have your revenge. As for the people here, if you wish, I'll make sure that all of them will remain here!"</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, I'm worried!"</p>
 <p>"Don't worry, aren't I around? You should at least trust in the guy you chose!" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"I'm not worried about myself, I'm worried for you. If something were to happen to you, I won't be able to forgive myself even if I were to die. Do you understand my feelings?" Yiye Jiange held Qing Shui's face, making him look at her.</p>
