  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 545 - Hundred Miles City For A Day, Planning And Preparations, Hair Flying Around</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everyone in the Qing Clan was gathered in the living room of the Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store. Of course, Qing Luo and Lin Zhanhan stayed behind at Qing Village, but Qing Shui had planned to visit the Qing Village tomorrow.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, the matters there have already been settled!” Qing He smiled at Qing Shui, there were a few geniuses that arose from the Qing Clan, benefiting the whole Qing Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Maybe this was the so-called riding on someone else’s success!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That's good, I came back this time to discuss something with everyone.” Qing Shui decided to reveal things, since Qing He was about to ask.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Oh! I also want to congratulate the extraordinary genius that came from the third generation of our Qing Clan. Xiao Bei, Qing You, you guys need to work harder.” Qing Shui smiled at the third generation of the Qing Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Daddy, what about me? Do I count?” Luan Luan blinked her large eyes, there was a look of expectation in them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Luan Luan is the genius of the fourth generation!” Qing Shui said quietly. Children have to be encouraged, even a talented child was still a child</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everyone looked happily at Qing Shui patiently praising the two girls, Qing Shui gave each of the two girls a bowknot hair fastener.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Soon, fifteen minutes went by!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Shui, what is the matter, everyone is waiting for you to tell us!” Qing Bei was an impetuous person, she could not help but urge Qing Shui to quickly reveal the matter.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I just wanted to see if you are interested in going to larger places to expand, like maybe the Greencloud Continent City.” Qing Shui smiled as he rubbed Qing Bei’s head.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother, You are rubbing my head again, I already said that I am a big girl, I am not longer a kid…” Qing Bei smiled as she mumbled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“To the Continent City? What can we do there?” Qing Yi looked at Qing Shui. She felt, as well as knew, that it was already not easy for Qing Shui to be out there alone. If the Qing Clan followed him, then Qing Shui’s burden will only grow bigger.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was Qing Yi’s son, with one look, he could tell what she was thinking. “Mother, you don’t have to worry about these matters, your son now is the person in charge of Heavenly Palace, as long as you are in the Greencloud Continent, everyone will give you face.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The person in charge of the Heavenly Palace?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother, I want to join the Heavenly Palace!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, bring me into the Heavenly Palace too!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, since they wish to go, if you have the capabilities to take care of them, then take them. Me, your grandfather, third uncle, fourth uncle, and other uncles and aunts are already satisfied with the strength we have attained. We are also no longer able to break through to further realms, thus we will not be going,” Qing Yi said after she thought for a little.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mother is worried that I cannot manage?” Qing Shui looked at Qing Yi. A mother and child would understand what each other was thinking.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, it is actually good to stay in Hundred Miles City. Although we only have the strength of Xiantian realms, we are considered experts in the Hundred Miles City. Furthermore, this is home, we have been living here for many years, I can’t bear to leave this place.” Yuan Ying said as he smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Maybe it was because it was Qing Yi and Yuan Ying’s words, but their words obviously revealed that it was not because they did not want to go, but because they were worried that Qing Shui cannot manage. It was already not easy for Qing Shui to manage alone, now with so many people, he needed to make arrangements for everyone.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even those that originally wanted to go, like Qing Bei, Qing You and the others kept quiet and stopped asking to go!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Now, I have the ability to bring you all to go around the Greencloud Continent. The purpose of bringing you all was so you can raise your strength faster, unless you intend to stay here forever, to limit the growth of the Qing Clan? When the descendants of the Qing Clan go out, would anyone respect them?” Qing Shui said patiently.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Which youth does not want to be excellent? Which warrior does not want to stand at the peak of the World of the Nine Continents? Given the hot-bloodedness of young men, it did not matter even if they were ordinary people.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If Mother and Uncles feel that they do not have much of a future in cultivation, you can choose not to pursue cultivation, instead, if you are interested in doing business, I have helped the business grow big, If Mother wants to just have a break, I can accompany Mother to tour the Greencloud Continent. If I have the chance to in future, I will bring you to see the World of the Nine Continents.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui hesitated for a little before saying.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, How about this, let’s wait till we meet your grandfather and Grandpa Lin first and seek their opinion. If they support you, we will all go, what do you say?” Qing Yi thought for a little and smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui happily nodded his head!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Following that, Qing Shui mostly talked about the important matters in the Greencloud Continent. He then suddenly remembered the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear in the Interspatial Beast King Medallion.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Luan Luan, I have this bear, can you communicate with it?” Qing Shui asked the young girl in his embrace.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I can!” Luan Luan confidently replied, then looking at Qing Shui in joy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Father, where is the bear? Where is it?” Luan Luan happily asked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Come, Let’s go outside!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everyone went to the courtyard of the Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store. Qing Shui took out the Interspatial Beast Medallion and released the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear. It looked the same as before, despite the fact it looked downcast, it still looked healthy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear looked at its surroundings. It was not panic or take interest in anything, instead, it wanted to close its eyes!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Roar roar!” a soft and immature roar came from the mouth of Luan Luan!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear suddenly opened both its eyes and look at Luan Luan interestedly, but Luan Luan just continues to make that soft and immature roar, one after another.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Under Qing Shui’s astonished gaze, the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear stood up and walked over and crawl to the front of Luan Luan petite figure, as she continued to roar.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In that moment, Qing Shui felt that Luan Luan was especially large, even larger than adults, even the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear seemed small and meek!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The was the strength of the Heart of Seven Orifices…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui seemed to be able to see that after tens of years after Luan Luan grew up, she would control thousands of strong demonic beasts, nothing would be able to stop her…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But now, she was still young, Qing Shui shook his head. When he saw Luan Luan happy rubbing the head of the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear, Qing Shui quickly took out some barbecued meat from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Luan Luan, feed this to it!” Qing Shui remembered that it rejected it the last time, most importantly, was that it must be famished.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Luan Luan happily received it, then she went to feed the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear. Qing Shui watched blankly as the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear ate ravenously.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It only took a moment for the meat to be eaten finished. Qing Shui took out another big piece and waved it at the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear. Qing Shui was depressed when it ignored it again.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Luan Luan joyfully took it, then threw it to the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear. Once again, it ate it ravenously, causing Qing Shui to feel like a failure.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Originally, Qing Shui had the Emperor's Qi, although it was not as good as the Heart of Seven Orifices, but it was sufficient for him to become a beast tamer…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Luan Luan, feed this to it, it can become stronger. When you want to fight someone, it will fight for you.” Qing Shui gave ten plus Beast Pills to Luan Luan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Good! Good!” Luan Luan happily took the Beast Pills.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After it had eaten one Beast Pill, when Luan Luan was about to feed it a second one, it let out a loud roar towards the sky. Its whole body was releasing smoke like a blazing flame.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It’s figure increased tremendously, it’s height was now three meters. It looked majestic, radiating a tyrannical strength, its fire armor looked even more bright.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was stunned, the first Beast Pill could cause it to evolve, its luck was shockingly high.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Luan Luan happily took the rest of them and fed them to the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear, at this moment, it seemed the abilities of the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear had an explosive increase.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a pity that the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear was similar to the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, their defense was strong but their attack was lacking. Even so, the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear still had the strength of around two countries.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But it had the defense of more than twenty countries!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gave the Interspatial Beast Medallion to Luan Luan, that way she could store the demonic beasts up when it was not convenient for them to be out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui taught her the method to use it, causing Luan Luan to jump around happily!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The third generation of the Qing Clan looked at Luan Luan enviously. After such a long period of time, they knew she was a genius beast tamer. At a very young age, she already had three Xiantian level demonic beasts and now with this Martial King Level beast, it could even fight with some low-level Peak Martial king cultivators.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was normal to envy, even Qing Shui was a little envious. The status of a beast tamer in the World of the Nine Continents was pretty high.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This required talent, effort played no part!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They knew that it was not because Qing Shui did not give it to them, but because they did not have the talent. Fortunately, this heaven-defying young girl was Qing Shui’s daughter…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although she was a little old…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could guess what they were thinking, Qing Shui could even guess that his mother thought that Luan Luan was Qing Shui’s flesh and blood. Luan Luan’s attachment to Qing Shui, in addition to her resemblance to Yiye Jiange, it was normal to think that she was born of Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange, in fact, it was natural. Thinking back to when Yiye Jiange first came to Hundred Miles City to rescue Qing Shui and looking at Luan Luan, the timing seemed to match.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even Luan Luan addressed Qing Shui as Father, and called that refined extraordinary girl mother…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The sky turned dark!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Daddy, let’s go out and play!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sure!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mother, come along as well!” Luan Luan pulled at both Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At first, the others wanted to come, especially Mingyue Gelou and Yuchang, but when they saw that family of three, they just waved their hands at Qing Shui and smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At that moment, Qing Shui had a sour feeling in his heart, he felt that he was not good enough to his women…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange brought Luan Luan for a walk under the Light Stones, on the west side hung a bright moon. Yiye Jiange, who was beside him, looked beautiful beyond compare.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Luan Luan was now already ten years old, looking at the two people who were the closest to her and treated her the best. &nbsp;Within the time in Hundred Miles City, she felt that her parents were different from others, she just could not put her finger on what it was.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Luan Luan skipped along the side, this gave Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange some space, after all, there were some things that they could not let the girl know about.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Are you going to continue to keep it from her?” Yiye Jiange asked as she looked at Luan Luan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’d rather help trample on Lion King's Ridge, than to let her know any of this. Because that way, her life would fall apart. Isn’t it better for her to spend her rest of her life happily?” Qing Shui asked quietly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange’s delicate body could not help but tremble. She looked at the man beside her, he seeme to be changing more and more. He was no longer that young man, in the past when he’d called her master, she felt nothing, now she found it hard to accept.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The thing that led Yiye Jiange to be grateful about was Qing Shui’s attitude to Luan Luan. Luan Luan was her brother’s daughter, she was her only blood relative left in this world. However, Qing Shui treated her really well. To the point where it was better than a real father would.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was a saying where if you love someone, you love everything connected to that person. Perhaps because of Luan Luan, Yiye Jiange had some kind of feelings for Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was also the fact that he remembered about her matters, and even worked toward solving her problems. Because the matter with the Qing Clan was solved, he had no more need to grow stronger.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Could it be that he is working so hard so that he can work his way to Lion King's Ridge?” Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Although this can allow Luan Luan to be happier, it caused you to be wronged. This problem is a headache,” Qing Shui said after thinking for awhile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Me? Wronged? How?” Yiye Jiange could not understand then and suspiciously looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That would be, if Master were to marry, Luan Luan would be upset, because since she was young she thought we were…” Qing Shui rubbed his nose and laughed in awkwardness.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Who said I’m getting married, I won’t marry!” Yiye Jiange said in a seemingly angry tone.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright, alright, you are not getting married!” &nbsp;Qing Shui face was a little warm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange: “...”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Master!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Can you not call me Master…” Yiye Jiange felt the word ‘Master’ to be particularly awkward. In the eyes of the Qing Clan, they appeared to be like husband and wife, but the way they addressed each other, it seemed that…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Father, Mother, you are walking so slowly!” at this moment, Luan Luan ran back and squeeze herself between Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange, holding their hands.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The most lively place at night were the snack stalls at the roadside, there were all kinds of things, they had everything, those that could fly, those that ran on the ground, those that swam, alive, dead…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was confident that he could make better ones than them, but snacks were about the mood and atmosphere. In addition, Luan Luan was excited. She was, after all, a child.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the end, they got a few sticks of fried crab meat!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It tasted fresh, just like a young and inexperienced girl. The first time may not be pleasant, but that frame of mind was definitely beautiful.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the distances, there were many couples holding their children’s hands forming a circle, spinning around the square, it seemed to be a type of game.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hand in hand, in a circle, looking at the moon. This can cause a family to feel fortunate and blissful together!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Father, Mother, let’s play like them, shall we!” Luan Luan looked surrounding few hundred people playing like that nearby when they made a wish, the children’s clear laughter could be heard from afar.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The nearest couple from them was only about five to six steps away.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Luan Luan said that, she looked at Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sure!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that he should take the lead, he rubbed Luan Luan’s head and then naturally grabbed Yiye Jiange’s hands. Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange could not help but tremble.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The three of them turned around, Luan Luan’s laughter were loud and clear, but Qing Shui’s hair ended up flying around because of Yiye Jiange, she looked elegant and stunningly beautiful.</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 545 - Hundred Miles City For A Day, Planning And Preparations, Hair Flying Around</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everyone in the Qing Clan was gathered in the living room of the Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store. Of course, Qing Luo and Lin Zhanhan stayed behind at Qing Village, but Qing Shui had planned to visit the Qing Village tomorrow.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, the matters there have already been settled!” Qing He smiled at Qing Shui, there were a few geniuses that arose from the Qing Clan, benefiting the whole Qing Clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Maybe this was the so-called riding on someone else’s success!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“That's good, I came back this time to discuss something with everyone.” Qing Shui decided to reveal things, since Qing He was about to ask.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Oh! I also want to congratulate the extraordinary genius that came from the third generation of our Qing Clan. Xiao Bei, Qing You, you guys need to work harder.” Qing Shui smiled at the third generation of the Qing Clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Daddy, what about me? Do I count?” Luan Luan blinked her large eyes, there was a look of expectation in them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Luan Luan is the genius of the fourth generation!” Qing Shui said quietly. Children have to be encouraged, even a talented child was still a child</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everyone looked happily at Qing Shui patiently praising the two girls, Qing Shui gave each of the two girls a bowknot hair fastener.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Soon, fifteen minutes went by!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Shui, what is the matter, everyone is waiting for you to tell us!” Qing Bei was an impetuous person, she could not help but urge Qing Shui to quickly reveal the matter.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I just wanted to see if you are interested in going to larger places to expand, like maybe the Greencloud Continent City.” Qing Shui smiled as he rubbed Qing Bei’s head.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother, You are rubbing my head again, I already said that I am a big girl, I am not longer a kid…” Qing Bei smiled as she mumbled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“To the Continent City? What can we do there?” Qing Yi looked at Qing Shui. She felt, as well as knew, that it was already not easy for Qing Shui to be out there alone. If the Qing Clan followed him, then Qing Shui’s burden will only grow bigger.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was Qing Yi’s son, with one look, he could tell what she was thinking. “Mother, you don’t have to worry about these matters, your son now is the person in charge of Heavenly Palace, as long as you are in the Greencloud Continent, everyone will give you face.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The person in charge of the Heavenly Palace?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother, I want to join the Heavenly Palace!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, bring me into the Heavenly Palace too!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, since they wish to go, if you have the capabilities to take care of them, then take them. Me, your grandfather, third uncle, fourth uncle, and other uncles and aunts are already satisfied with the strength we have attained. We are also no longer able to break through to further realms, thus we will not be going,” Qing Yi said after she thought for a little.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mother is worried that I cannot manage?” Qing Shui looked at Qing Yi. A mother and child would understand what each other was thinking.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, it is actually good to stay in Hundred Miles City. Although we only have the strength of Xiantian realms, we are considered experts in the Hundred Miles City. Furthermore, this is home, we have been living here for many years, I can’t bear to leave this place.” Yuan Ying said as he smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Maybe it was because it was Qing Yi and Yuan Ying’s words, but their words obviously revealed that it was not because they did not want to go, but because they were worried that Qing Shui cannot manage. It was already not easy for Qing Shui to manage alone, now with so many people, he needed to make arrangements for everyone.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even those that originally wanted to go, like Qing Bei, Qing You and the others kept quiet and stopped asking to go!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Now, I have the ability to bring you all to go around the Greencloud Continent. The purpose of bringing you all was so you can raise your strength faster, unless you intend to stay here forever, to limit the growth of the Qing Clan? When the descendants of the Qing Clan go out, would anyone respect them?” Qing Shui said patiently.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Which youth does not want to be excellent? Which warrior does not want to stand at the peak of the World of the Nine Continents? Given the hot-bloodedness of young men, it did not matter even if they were ordinary people.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If Mother and Uncles feel that they do not have much of a future in cultivation, you can choose not to pursue cultivation, instead, if you are interested in doing business, I have helped the business grow big, If Mother wants to just have a break, I can accompany Mother to tour the Greencloud Continent. If I have the chance to in future, I will bring you to see the World of the Nine Continents.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui hesitated for a little before saying.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, How about this, let’s wait till we meet your grandfather and Grandpa Lin first and seek their opinion. If they support you, we will all go, what do you say?” Qing Yi thought for a little and smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui happily nodded his head!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Following that, Qing Shui mostly talked about the important matters in the Greencloud Continent. He then suddenly remembered the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear in the Interspatial Beast King Medallion.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Luan Luan, I have this bear, can you communicate with it?” Qing Shui asked the young girl in his embrace.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I can!” Luan Luan confidently replied, then looking at Qing Shui in joy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Father, where is the bear? Where is it?” Luan Luan happily asked.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Come, Let’s go outside!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everyone went to the courtyard of the Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store. Qing Shui took out the Interspatial Beast Medallion and released the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear. It looked the same as before, despite the fact it looked downcast, it still looked healthy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear looked at its surroundings. It was not panic or take interest in anything, instead, it wanted to close its eyes!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Roar roar!” a soft and immature roar came from the mouth of Luan Luan!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear suddenly opened both its eyes and look at Luan Luan interestedly, but Luan Luan just continues to make that soft and immature roar, one after another.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Under Qing Shui’s astonished gaze, the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear stood up and walked over and crawl to the front of Luan Luan petite figure, as she continued to roar.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In that moment, Qing Shui felt that Luan Luan was especially large, even larger than adults, even the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear seemed small and meek!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The was the strength of the Heart of Seven Orifices…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui seemed to be able to see that after tens of years after Luan Luan grew up, she would control thousands of strong demonic beasts, nothing would be able to stop her…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But now, she was still young, Qing Shui shook his head. When he saw Luan Luan happy rubbing the head of the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear, Qing Shui quickly took out some barbecued meat from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Luan Luan, feed this to it!” Qing Shui remembered that it rejected it the last time, most importantly, was that it must be famished.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Luan Luan happily received it, then she went to feed the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear. Qing Shui watched blankly as the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear ate ravenously.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It only took a moment for the meat to be eaten finished. Qing Shui took out another big piece and waved it at the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear. Qing Shui was depressed when it ignored it again.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Luan Luan joyfully took it, then threw it to the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear. Once again, it ate it ravenously, causing Qing Shui to feel like a failure.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Originally, Qing Shui had the Emperor's Qi, although it was not as good as the Heart of Seven Orifices, but it was sufficient for him to become a beast tamer…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Luan Luan, feed this to it, it can become stronger. When you want to fight someone, it will fight for you.” Qing Shui gave ten plus Beast Pills to Luan Luan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Good! Good!” Luan Luan happily took the Beast Pills.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After it had eaten one Beast Pill, when Luan Luan was about to feed it a second one, it let out a loud roar towards the sky. Its whole body was releasing smoke like a blazing flame.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It’s figure increased tremendously, it’s height was now three meters. It looked majestic, radiating a tyrannical strength, its fire armor looked even more bright.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was stunned, the first Beast Pill could cause it to evolve, its luck was shockingly high.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Luan Luan happily took the rest of them and fed them to the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear, at this moment, it seemed the abilities of the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear had an explosive increase.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was a pity that the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear was similar to the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, their defense was strong but their attack was lacking. Even so, the Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear still had the strength of around two countries.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But it had the defense of more than twenty countries!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gave the Interspatial Beast Medallion to Luan Luan, that way she could store the demonic beasts up when it was not convenient for them to be out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui taught her the method to use it, causing Luan Luan to jump around happily!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The third generation of the Qing Clan looked at Luan Luan enviously. After such a long period of time, they knew she was a genius beast tamer. At a very young age, she already had three Xiantian level demonic beasts and now with this Martial King Level beast, it could even fight with some low-level Peak Martial king cultivators.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was normal to envy, even Qing Shui was a little envious. The status of a beast tamer in the World of the Nine Continents was pretty high.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This required talent, effort played no part!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They knew that it was not because Qing Shui did not give it to them, but because they did not have the talent. Fortunately, this heaven-defying young girl was Qing Shui’s daughter…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although she was a little old…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could guess what they were thinking, Qing Shui could even guess that his mother thought that Luan Luan was Qing Shui’s flesh and blood. Luan Luan’s attachment to Qing Shui, in addition to her resemblance to Yiye Jiange, it was normal to think that she was born of Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange, in fact, it was natural. Thinking back to when Yiye Jiange first came to Hundred Miles City to rescue Qing Shui and looking at Luan Luan, the timing seemed to match.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even Luan Luan addressed Qing Shui as Father, and called that refined extraordinary girl mother…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The sky turned dark!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Daddy, let’s go out and play!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sure!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mother, come along as well!” Luan Luan pulled at both Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At first, the others wanted to come, especially Mingyue Gelou and Yuchang, but when they saw that family of three, they just waved their hands at Qing Shui and smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At that moment, Qing Shui had a sour feeling in his heart, he felt that he was not good enough to his women…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange brought Luan Luan for a walk under the Light Stones, on the west side hung a bright moon. Yiye Jiange, who was beside him, looked beautiful beyond compare.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Luan Luan was now already ten years old, looking at the two people who were the closest to her and treated her the best. &nbsp;Within the time in Hundred Miles City, she felt that her parents were different from others, she just could not put her finger on what it was.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Luan Luan skipped along the side, this gave Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange some space, after all, there were some things that they could not let the girl know about.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Are you going to continue to keep it from her?” Yiye Jiange asked as she looked at Luan Luan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’d rather help trample on Lion King's Ridge, than to let her know any of this. Because that way, her life would fall apart. Isn’t it better for her to spend her rest of her life happily?” Qing Shui asked quietly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange’s delicate body could not help but tremble. She looked at the man beside her, he seeme to be changing more and more. He was no longer that young man, in the past when he’d called her master, she felt nothing, now she found it hard to accept.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The thing that led Yiye Jiange to be grateful about was Qing Shui’s attitude to Luan Luan. Luan Luan was her brother’s daughter, she was her only blood relative left in this world. However, Qing Shui treated her really well. To the point where it was better than a real father would.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was a saying where if you love someone, you love everything connected to that person. Perhaps because of Luan Luan, Yiye Jiange had some kind of feelings for Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was also the fact that he remembered about her matters, and even worked toward solving her problems. Because the matter with the Qing Clan was solved, he had no more need to grow stronger.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Could it be that he is working so hard so that he can work his way to Lion King's Ridge?” Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Although this can allow Luan Luan to be happier, it caused you to be wronged. This problem is a headache,” Qing Shui said after thinking for awhile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Me? Wronged? How?” Yiye Jiange could not understand then and suspiciously looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“That would be, if Master were to marry, Luan Luan would be upset, because since she was young she thought we were…” Qing Shui rubbed his nose and laughed in awkwardness.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Who said I’m getting married, I won’t marry!” Yiye Jiange said in a seemingly angry tone.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright, alright, you are not getting married!” &nbsp;Qing Shui face was a little warm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yiye Jiange: “...”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Master!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Can you not call me Master…” Yiye Jiange felt the word ‘Master’ to be particularly awkward. In the eyes of the Qing Clan, they appeared to be like husband and wife, but the way they addressed each other, it seemed that…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Father, Mother, you are walking so slowly!” at this moment, Luan Luan ran back and squeeze herself between Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange, holding their hands.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The most lively place at night were the snack stalls at the roadside, there were all kinds of things, they had everything, those that could fly, those that ran on the ground, those that swam, alive, dead…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was confident that he could make better ones than them, but snacks were about the mood and atmosphere. In addition, Luan Luan was excited. She was, after all, a child.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the end, they got a few sticks of fried crab meat!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It tasted fresh, just like a young and inexperienced girl. The first time may not be pleasant, but that frame of mind was definitely beautiful.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the distances, there were many couples holding their children’s hands forming a circle, spinning around the square, it seemed to be a type of game.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hand in hand, in a circle, looking at the moon. This can cause a family to feel fortunate and blissful together!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Father, Mother, let’s play like them, shall we!” Luan Luan looked surrounding few hundred people playing like that nearby when they made a wish, the children’s clear laughter could be heard from afar.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The nearest couple from them was only about five to six steps away.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After Luan Luan said that, she looked at Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sure!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that he should take the lead, he rubbed Luan Luan’s head and then naturally grabbed Yiye Jiange’s hands. Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange could not help but tremble.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The three of them turned around, Luan Luan’s laughter were loud and clear, but Qing Shui’s hair ended up flying around because of Yiye Jiange, she looked elegant and stunningly beautiful.</p>
