 <p><strong>Chapter 162 The Beauty of Cang Lang Country.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 0162 – The Beauty of Cang Lang Country</strong></p>
  <p>When he was disrupted by Wenren Wu-Shuang, Qing Shui lost interest in the book he was reading. He decided to close the book and threw it into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal with the prescription for the recipe of Heaven Yang Pill and the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm.</p>
  <p>He recalled that the refinement of the Heaven Yang Pill required the gut of a demonic snake which had gotten from killing the Golden-Ringed Snake King. Snakes are such lewd creatures. This prescription was also very lewd as it would not even let snake guts slip by.</p>
  <p>By obtaining the snake gut, one of the ingredients required for the refinement of the Heaven Yang Pill was settled. Qing Shui could only laugh bitterly as he recalled the fact that he needed over 10 demonic beast penises for his concoction.</p>
  <p>Passing by the desolate wilderness and valleys, they finally arrived peacefully at the Cang Lang Country about a month later!</p>
  <p>“We’ve finally reached our destination! It’s been so boring!” Wenren Wu-Shuang said happily as she alighted from the metallic bull beasts carriage. Her tone sounded as if she was just relieved of a heavy burden.</p>
  <p>The two men had lost their abilities to harm others, so Qing Shui did not bother to concern himself with them. The two sturdy men repeatedly gave their thanks as they boarded the metallic bull beasts carriage. They left quickly after.</p>
  <p>“I wonder if they’d still be so happy when they will realise that their man part can no longer be used.” Qing Shui thought to himself as he looked at the departing metallic bull beasts carriage.</p>
  <p>The city walls of Cang Lang Country were towering and extended out like a gigantic dragon. The wide black city gate was opened, and passing through was an incessant stream of traffic . It really deserved to be called a big city. The impression it gave was really different. From afar, it seemed like a creeping and ferocious beast that emitted a mysterious aura!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui decided to just alight from the carriage with Wu-Shuang and enter the city by foot!</p>
  <p>In his previous life, Qing Shui felt that there were a lot of people in prosperous cities when he saw the busy life in their boisterous streets. Now at that moment, he felt that they didn’t even compare to the scene before him. An overwhelming number of people entered and exited through the city gate. Each time they passed by, they would need to pay a toll of a copper coin. This also helped the income for Cang Lang Country. It was an advantage that the land across the world of the nine continents was truly vast. If it wasn’t, the overcrowding would cause people to be squished to death.</p>
  <p>“Wu-Shuang, let’s enter. Look for a place to eat and rest for a day!” Qing Shui looked at the endless human traffic as he grabbed onto Wu-Shuang’s hand and headed towards the city gate.</p>
  <p>Wu-Shuang knew that Qing Shui was afraid that she would be “bumped into” in the crowd. Therefore, he had led her along while pushing through the crowd himself. Wu-Shuang let Qing Shui lead her along which caused a tiny smile to creep on her face.</p>
  <p>Once they passed through the city gate, there was a straight and wide path before them. The immense crowd of humans began to disperse as everyone went on with their busy lives. Along this path were two rows of shophouses and multi-storeyed pavilions not far from the city gate. There were pavilions that had a height of 100 metres, only slightly shorter than the city walls.</p>
  <p>It was an eye opener for Qing Shui. He felt that when he compared the Hundred Miles City to Cang Lang Country, it was like playing house.</p>
  <p>There were plenty of ferocious beasts rides everywhere on the streets. There were even the occasional Xiantian demonic beasts.</p>
  <p>These people all had strong spiritual senses, and would even occasionally throw a glance towards Qing Shui and Wenren Wu-Shuang. Qing Shui knew that it was because they had sensed Wu-Shuang’s Xiantian abilities.</p>
  <p>Most martial art practitioners in the land of the nine continents would already have their own rides. After all, the world was vast and endless. Even a Xiantian would not be able to travel such long journeys with his own two feet. Moreover, there were many speedy beasts in the world. However, a normal horse would not fall short to the Red Hare or Wu Zhui horses.</p>
  <p>The Wu Zhui horse and Red Hare were both high quality warhorses with a height of 3 metres. A normal wolf would not even dare to approach them.</p>
  <p>When an occasional flying steed would pass by in the air, the people around would all lament in envy.</p>
  <p>For many Xiantians, they did not have good steeds. They didn’t fancy low grade ones, so they would choose to not have any at all.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui and Wu-Shuang took a look around as they walked. Qing Shui’s gaze mostly landed on the beauties on the road as he lamented at how many there were in such a large place. Moreover, the standard of beauty was much higher than that of Hundred Miles City. While they didn’t compare to Wenren Wu-Shuang, the sight was sufficient enough to kill boredom.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui. Even if those ladies are beautiful, you can’t be salivating. Your image…”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui cooperatively wiped his mouth which caused Wu-Shuang to break into a light laughter. Even more people started to blatantly stare at the sight of this rare beauty.</p>
  <p>“Did you see how many people are looking at you? Their expressions seemed as though they wished to devour you. This makes me feel very uncomfortable. I’m doing this for you. If they dare look at my woman, then I shall look at theirs. I must take back what’s taken from me.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
  <p>“Who’s your woman? You know no shame.” Wu-Shuang nudged Qing Shui on the face.</p>
  <p>Wu-Shuang’s actions seemed as though they were flirting as a couple which caused many people around them to sigh. Those sighs were like melodious music to Qing Shui’s ears.</p>
  <p>“Go ahead and be green with envy. Be envious, be jealous. I enjoy it when you guys do that.” Qing Shui thought proudly.</p>
  <p>The two of them found an inn that seemed quite decent and had some food. They decided to head to Skysword Sect after a day of rest.</p>
  <p>Although they had entered Cang Lang Country, it would take them 10 days to half a month time to travel from the south side to the north end. It was a brilliant idea that they had asked around and heard that the Skysword Sect was not very far from where they were. They discovered that it would take a normal horse carriage about 2-3 days to arrive.</p>
  <p>Tonight was another night without sleep for Qing Shui. Obviously, he wouldn’t slack on his daily training. In this place where a person’s life was as insignificant as a blade of grass, one who had no powers would be faced with the possibility of being trampled to death.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, let’s take a look around the vicinity today and head for Skysword Sect tomorrow.” Wenren Wu-Shuang looked at Qing Shui lazily and said.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was left with no other choice. This peerless beauty who was unmatched in her generation had used the tone of a little girl. Her poised and graceful face had an expression of happiness, pleading, and coquettishness. Upon seeing this, Qing Shui nodded in agreement without giving it a second thought..</p>
  <p>It was Qing Shui’s turn to be led along by Wu-Shuang’s hand as they went through the streets. They took a look at everything, even the toys for children. However, they did not buy anything. Qing Shui could not help but look at Wu-Shuang’s stomach in suspicion.</p>
  <p>That gaze made Wu-Shuang blush all the way down to her neck. “What are you looking at? How dare you let your imagination run off like that?”</p>
  <p>“Wu-Shuang, what do you like? Elder brother will buy it for you.” Qing Shui saw that Wu-Shuang had been staring at a jade bangle for some time.</p>
  <p>“I just want the experience and not buy anything. I did not see much in the past, so I would like to enjoy what I couldn’t now.” Wenren Wu-Shuang did not bother with the fact that Qing Shui had acted like someone older while she was trying to recall past memories.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt very suppressed. He knew that Wu-Shuang had a difficult childhood and did not experience much back then. While she was saying it as if nothing had happened, anyone could sense the bitterness behind her words.</p>
  <p>“Wu-Shuang, shall I bring you around the entirety of Cang Lang Country before we head for the Skysword Sect?” Qing Shui said lightly.</p>
  <p>“Haha, there’s no need for that. We’ll head for the Skysword Sect in the afternoon. Thank you though!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose, “Women are really weird!”</p>
  <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui felt a strong presence from above. In addition, many people in the surroundings could not help but look upwards and let out sounds of lament, praise, sighing, and infatuation.</p>
  <p>A Golden Winged Thunder Condor flew past with its golden, sparkling body. When its wings were stretched out, they would be about 200 metres wide. Only its wings were in a golden color while its body was pitch black. The most unique thing about the beast was its silvery white “crown” that was on top of its head. The color contrast made its “crown” very conspicuous.</p>
  <p>After a glance of the Golden Winged Thunder Condor, Qing Shui’s gaze was attracted to the girl on top in ancient chinese clothing. He did not know how to describe the girl or rather, the lady.</p>
  <p>Her brows were like black dye. Her eyes were like glittery stars but still as dark as ink and very deep. That face seemed to have a look full of disdain for the world. Her flawless skin exuded a majestic and impressive beauty. It was as though he was comparing a drawing of a beauty to a magnificent landscape drawing. Comparing her to other women was simply an insult to her beauty.</p>
  <p>Her figure was slender and exquisite as she could make someone go crazy. As she stood on top of that strong demonic beast, her hair swayed around beside her ears. This made one feel as if he was in a dream.</p>
  <p>There was another woman who was on the same level as his goddess-like master!</p>
  <p> A clamor of discussion broke out in the surroundings but Qing Shui didn’t hear anything. His head was filled with the divine beauty and aura of that woman! </p>

 <p>“Qing Shui, let’s take a look around the vicinity today and head for Skysword Sect tomorrow.” Wenren Wu-Shuang looked at Qing Shui lazily and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was left with no other choice. This peerless beauty who was unmatched in her generation had used the tone of a little girl. Her poised and graceful face had an expression of happiness, pleading, and coquettishness. Upon seeing this, Qing Shui nodded in agreement without giving it a second thought..</p>
 <p>It was Qing Shui’s turn to be led along by Wu-Shuang’s hand as they went through the streets. They took a look at everything, even the toys for children. However, they did not buy anything. Qing Shui could not help but look at Wu-Shuang’s stomach in suspicion.</p>
 <p>That gaze made Wu-Shuang blush all the way down to her neck. “What are you looking at? How dare you let your imagination run off like that?”</p>
 <p>“Wu-Shuang, what do you like? Elder brother will buy it for you.” Qing Shui saw that Wu-Shuang had been staring at a jade bangle for some time.</p>
 <p>“I just want the experience and not buy anything. I did not see much in the past, so I would like to enjoy what I couldn’t now.” Wenren Wu-Shuang did not bother with the fact that Qing Shui had acted like someone older while she was trying to recall past memories.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt very suppressed. He knew that Wu-Shuang had a difficult childhood and did not experience much back then. While she was saying it as if nothing had happened, anyone could sense the bitterness behind her words.</p>
 <p>“Wu-Shuang, shall I bring you around the entirety of Cang Lang Country before we head for the Skysword Sect?” Qing Shui said lightly.</p>
 <p>“Haha, there’s no need for that. We’ll head for the Skysword Sect in the afternoon. Thank you though!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his nose, “Women are really weird!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui felt a strong presence from above. In addition, many people in the surroundings could not help but look upwards and let out sounds of lament, praise, sighing, and infatuation.</p>
 <p>A Golden Winged Thunder Condor flew past with its golden, sparkling body. When its wings were stretched out, they would be about 200 metres wide. Only its wings were in a golden color while its body was pitch black. The most unique thing about the beast was its silvery white “crown” that was on top of its head. The color contrast made its “crown” very conspicuous.</p>
 <p>After a glance of the Golden Winged Thunder Condor, Qing Shui’s gaze was attracted to the girl on top in ancient chinese clothing. He did not know how to describe the girl or rather, the lady.</p>
 <p>Her brows were like black dye. Her eyes were like glittery stars but still as dark as ink and very deep. That face seemed to have a look full of disdain for the world. Her flawless skin exuded a majestic and impressive beauty. It was as though he was comparing a drawing of a beauty to a magnificent landscape drawing. Comparing her to other women was simply an insult to her beauty.</p>
 <p>Her figure was slender and exquisite as she could make someone go crazy. As she stood on top of that strong demonic beast, her hair swayed around beside her ears. This made one feel as if he was in a dream.</p>
 <p>There was another woman who was on the same level as his goddess-like master!</p>
 <p> A clamor of discussion broke out in the surroundings but Qing Shui didn’t hear anything. His head was filled with the divine beauty and aura of that woman! </p>
