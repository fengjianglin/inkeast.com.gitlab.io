  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>AST 534</strong><span><strong>&nbsp;- Death of the Old Ancestor, Arrival of Trials and Hardships</strong></span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The following days were very peaceful, however, there were many people who came to congratulate Qing Shui. Most of them were people of virtue and prestige.<br><br>Some of the reputable family clans and small sects came as well, hoping to establish a relationship. If they were able to obtain protection from the Heavenly Palace, then it would be a matter that they would thank their ancestors for.<br><br>Thus, on the second day, there were still tons of people coming. Since the Old Ancestor was still around, Qing Shui intended to not show up and let the Old Ancestor deal with them.<br><br>However, the Old Ancestor said that since Qing Shui had already taken the position, this matter should be handled by himself. Despite this, Qing Shui did not want to deal with it.<br><br>Nevertheless, for the prosperity of the Heavenly Palace, Qing Shui could only force himself to do it, despite his reluctancy.<br><br>Despite Qing Shui’s youth, when he wore that garment made of Lunar Silk, he looked more mature. This was the result of his strength, his experience, and especially that sense of suppression he unconsciously evoked when others stared at him.</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>There were disciples that dealt with welcoming the guests, Qing Shui only had to stay at the entrance to the study and exchange a few greetings with the guest. After all, they were all cultivators, they had started from the same point and had to help each other …...<br><br>Even though there was no one showing up from Sword Tower, Qing Shui was not surprised. Of course, many of those who showed up had suspicions about Qing Shui’s strength, but Qing Shui was no obligated nor interested is proving his strength.<br><br>In their eyes, Qing Shui was definitely just a piece of trash!<br><br>The miraculous story of Qing Shui killing a few supreme elders had spread outside the Heavenly Palace. However, a large portion of people, even many in the Heavenly Palace, felt that it was a ruse by the Heavenly Palace, to turn Qing Shui into a legend</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1">[a]</a></sup><span>.</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Only those supreme elders who were in the great hall knew about the terror of this youth. They instructed their disciples on what to do, &nbsp;urged them to exercise restraint, and used Qing Shi to try and stimulate them.<br><br>…...<br><br>Sword Tower!<br><br>“The plot of that old fellow is not much, he is using those old fellows to boost the reputation of the one controlling the Heavenly Palace, this is just an extravagant embellishment that anyone can see through. Only, this is truly a strange move that exceeds all expectations. &nbsp;To use a youth, who once rocked the world, such as Qing Shui. A strange move indeed.” The Old Ancestor of Sword Tower laughed with a few other old men as he drank tea.<br><br>“Old Ancestor, I feel that we should still be careful, those people who had met Qing Shui felt that he gave off a strange feeling, they could not see any cultivation but they sensed an unexplainable suppression from him.” Respectfully said a man dressed in black, who looked as sturdy as an iron tower.<br><br>“Long Ying, you rarely take something so seriously, could it be that your Heavy Sword Tower is afraid of him?” the old man from the Tan Clan said to the man dressed in black.<br><br>“My Heavy Sword Tower is not afraid of him, unlike someone’s grandson, who was beaten till he became invalid for a year and had his woman taken away.” casually said the man dressed in black, causing the face of the old man from the Tan Clan to turn dark.<br><br>“Enough, you argue every time you meet, I did not call you here today to argue with each other.” Snorted the Old Ancestor from Sword Tower coldly.<br><br>The old man from the Tan Clan originally wanted to shout at the man known as Long Ying, but now he could only keep quiet!<br><br>“How is Tan Yang these days?” The Sword Tower Old Ancestor casually asked.<br><br>Hearing the Sword Tower Old Ancestor ask about his grandson, the old man from the Tan Clan was immediately radiant with delight. He happily said: “Yang`er is improving at a rapid pace, he is now a Peak Martial King with the strength of four countries.”<br><br>“Strength of four countries? So fast?” &nbsp;the Sword Tower Old Ancestor was at a loss for words.<br><br>“Indeed, Yang`er was &nbsp;stimulated by that Qing Shui kid. He actually awakened the rarely seen Silver Bloodline of the Tan Clan. Although it is not as good as the Golden Bloodline, it is not that much weaker. In addition to the Origin Returning Pill, his abilities have rapidly soared. I thank the Old Ancestor for his concern on behalf of Yang`er.” the old man from the Tan Clan said without restraint, then he looked at the man dressed in black.<br><br>“Good, Very Good!” the Sword Tower Old Ancestor seemed to be quite happy!<br><br>…...<br><br>Qing Shui only met with the people on the same level as the Old Ancestor. As for the rest, they were delegated to those below him, thus the number of people Qing Shui met was not many.<br><br>“The Patriarch is back!” Huoyun &nbsp;Liu-Li could not resist making fun of Qing Shui when she saw him.<br><br>“Is your butt itchy again?” Qing Shui laughed.</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Loathsome Qing Shui,</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2">[b]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt3">[c]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt4">[d]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;you dare!”</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“See if I dare!” Qing Shi laughed as he stretched his hands!</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“I don’t dare to anymore, please be gentle.” Huoyun Liu-Li hugged Qing Shui’s arms as she sent coquettish glances at Qing Shui with her sexy eyes. Her intoxicating eyelashes had the power to make men go crazy.</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Qing Shui: “......”</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>In a flash, ten days went by!</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>In the secret chambers!</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>There were numerous people in the secret chambers, Qing Shui, Fei Wuji, Cang Wuya, Bai Gui and many others. With one glance, Qing Shui could tell that these were the Old Ancestor’s most reliable and the only trustworthy people.</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Qing Shui, I can feel it, my time has come, I can finally meet her, and I can finally see my son.” The Old Ancestor laughed.</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Old Ancestor……” Qing Shui had a sour suffocating feeling in his heart.</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“I am happy, with you around, I feel assured. I can go in peace. Originally, I was worried about Wuji and the Heavenly Palace. Now, with the Heavenly Palace in your hands, it will surely prosper.” The Old Ancestor said as he held Qing Shui’s hands.</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Rest assured, I will do my best to manage everything.”</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Wuji, you must double your efforts in cultivation, Qing Shui would be able to sufficiently teach you and more. In the world of cultivation, strength comes first, it would not be shameful to ask him to teach you, the most important thing is to be able to live.</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Grandfather, I know……:</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Bai Ji, you are my youngest disciple, and also my most talented disciple. When you follow Qing Shui in the future, treat him like you treat me.</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“I will master!” Bai Ji said seriously as he cried as he knelt.</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Qing Shui now knew that Bai Gui was also known as Bai Ji!</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Wuya!”</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Master……”</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Now that we are at this point, I shall permit you to return!”</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Thank you master……” Cang Wuya cried as he knelt in front of the Old Ancestor.</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Hai!” The Old Ancestor let out a long sigh, his face looked depressed.</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Old Ancestor, is there anything bothering you?” Qing Shui asked out of concern.</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Indeed, I do not know how to face her or what to say to her, I killed our child with my own hands.” The Old Ancestor leaked out a tear.</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“My son was too lascivious, but he knew his boundaries, I only found out afterwards that they seduced my son, then came to the Heavenly Palace to cause trouble. This caused me to kill my son with my own hands. However, they did this out of fun only, I am not satisfied!” The Old Ancestor kept tearing up.</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Putong!”</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Qing Shui slowly knelt in front of the Old Ancestor, his life was saved by the Old Ancestor twice. One can not only kneel to his parents but to his benefactors as well!</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Will the Old Ancestor tell me who they were, I, Qing Shui, swear that as long as I’m alive, I will bring martial uncle Fei along. This debt of blood, will be repaid with blood, the heavens and earth will be my witness and I will not regret this!” Qing Shui slowly stooped down.</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Get up, get up, this old man thanks you in advance. It is the Eastern Palace Clan of the Southern Viewing Ministry Continent. Promise me, before becoming a fifth grade Martial Saint, do not go there. Wuji, you are a smart person ……”</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Finally, his voice got softer and softer, but his face had a smile full of satisfaction!</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The funeral was set to be seven days later!</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>On the second day, the news of the Old Ancestor passing away was disseminated!</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>There were some people in the Heavenly Palace who were anxious, but many of the other sects were incomparably happy, especially the Sword Tower! The Demon Beast Sect was especially happy as well.</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“He’s dead, It’s good that he is dead, Old fogey, you shall not be able to die peacefully, the day of you funeral, will be the day the Heavenly Palace will be massacred!”</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Sword Tower Old Ancestor looked upwards to the sky as hesaid this, his face filled with a sinister smile that could wither bones!</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Seven days passed in an instant!</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Today was the day of the Heavenly Palace Old Ancestor’s funeral. The ones wearing mourning clothes were the Old Ancestors disciples and grand disciples, but there were also many heavenly palace disciples. However, where was a limit on the number of people who could attend, or else there would be no space for people to go in and out of the funeral hall.</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>But more than half of the people of Heavenly Palace were wearing white!</span><sup><a href="#cmnt5">[e]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt6">[f]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt7">[g]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt8">[h]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt9">[i]</a></sup></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>[TL notes: White and black clothes are for mourning. White usually represent the "host" when they are the mourners. Black, or dull colors for those coming to pay respects]</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The grave was located in the back mountains, on a piece of precious land with good Feng Shui.</span></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Soon, it was late in the day, and the people who came to pay their respects came wave after wave. Those who came were all people who were very reputable, the job of greeting them fell onto Qing Shui’s shoulders.</span></span></span></p>

  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>That scream meant that the Sword Tower and the Heavenly Palace had shed all pretense of cordiality!</span></span></span></p>

 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>AST 534</strong><span><strong>&nbsp;- Death of the Old Ancestor, Arrival of Trials and Hardships</strong></span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The following days were very peaceful, however, there were many people who came to congratulate Qing Shui. Most of them were people of virtue and prestige.<br><br>Some of the reputable family clans and small sects came as well, hoping to establish a relationship. If they were able to obtain protection from the Heavenly Palace, then it would be a matter that they would thank their ancestors for.<br><br>Thus, on the second day, there were still tons of people coming. Since the Old Ancestor was still around, Qing Shui intended to not show up and let the Old Ancestor deal with them.<br><br>However, the Old Ancestor said that since Qing Shui had already taken the position, this matter should be handled by himself. Despite this, Qing Shui did not want to deal with it.<br><br>Nevertheless, for the prosperity of the Heavenly Palace, Qing Shui could only force himself to do it, despite his reluctancy.<br><br>Despite Qing Shui’s youth, when he wore that garment made of Lunar Silk, he looked more mature. This was the result of his strength, his experience, and especially that sense of suppression he unconsciously evoked when others stared at him.</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>There were disciples that dealt with welcoming the guests, Qing Shui only had to stay at the entrance to the study and exchange a few greetings with the guest. After all, they were all cultivators, they had started from the same point and had to help each other …...<br><br>Even though there was no one showing up from Sword Tower, Qing Shui was not surprised. Of course, many of those who showed up had suspicions about Qing Shui’s strength, but Qing Shui was no obligated nor interested is proving his strength.<br><br>In their eyes, Qing Shui was definitely just a piece of trash!<br><br>The miraculous story of Qing Shui killing a few supreme elders had spread outside the Heavenly Palace. However, a large portion of people, even many in the Heavenly Palace, felt that it was a ruse by the Heavenly Palace, to turn Qing Shui into a legend</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1">[a]</a></sup><span>.</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Only those supreme elders who were in the great hall knew about the terror of this youth. They instructed their disciples on what to do, &nbsp;urged them to exercise restraint, and used Qing Shi to try and stimulate them.<br><br>…...<br><br>Sword Tower!<br><br>“The plot of that old fellow is not much, he is using those old fellows to boost the reputation of the one controlling the Heavenly Palace, this is just an extravagant embellishment that anyone can see through. Only, this is truly a strange move that exceeds all expectations. &nbsp;To use a youth, who once rocked the world, such as Qing Shui. A strange move indeed.” The Old Ancestor of Sword Tower laughed with a few other old men as he drank tea.<br><br>“Old Ancestor, I feel that we should still be careful, those people who had met Qing Shui felt that he gave off a strange feeling, they could not see any cultivation but they sensed an unexplainable suppression from him.” Respectfully said a man dressed in black, who looked as sturdy as an iron tower.<br><br>“Long Ying, you rarely take something so seriously, could it be that your Heavy Sword Tower is afraid of him?” the old man from the Tan Clan said to the man dressed in black.<br><br>“My Heavy Sword Tower is not afraid of him, unlike someone’s grandson, who was beaten till he became invalid for a year and had his woman taken away.” casually said the man dressed in black, causing the face of the old man from the Tan Clan to turn dark.<br><br>“Enough, you argue every time you meet, I did not call you here today to argue with each other.” Snorted the Old Ancestor from Sword Tower coldly.<br><br>The old man from the Tan Clan originally wanted to shout at the man known as Long Ying, but now he could only keep quiet!<br><br>“How is Tan Yang these days?” The Sword Tower Old Ancestor casually asked.<br><br>Hearing the Sword Tower Old Ancestor ask about his grandson, the old man from the Tan Clan was immediately radiant with delight. He happily said: “Yang`er is improving at a rapid pace, he is now a Peak Martial King with the strength of four countries.”<br><br>“Strength of four countries? So fast?” &nbsp;the Sword Tower Old Ancestor was at a loss for words.<br><br>“Indeed, Yang`er was &nbsp;stimulated by that Qing Shui kid. He actually awakened the rarely seen Silver Bloodline of the Tan Clan. Although it is not as good as the Golden Bloodline, it is not that much weaker. In addition to the Origin Returning Pill, his abilities have rapidly soared. I thank the Old Ancestor for his concern on behalf of Yang`er.” the old man from the Tan Clan said without restraint, then he looked at the man dressed in black.<br><br>“Good, Very Good!” the Sword Tower Old Ancestor seemed to be quite happy!<br><br>…...<br><br>Qing Shui only met with the people on the same level as the Old Ancestor. As for the rest, they were delegated to those below him, thus the number of people Qing Shui met was not many.<br><br>“The Patriarch is back!” Huoyun &nbsp;Liu-Li could not resist making fun of Qing Shui when she saw him.<br><br>“Is your butt itchy again?” Qing Shui laughed.</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Loathsome Qing Shui,</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2">[b]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt3">[c]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt4">[d]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;you dare!”</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“See if I dare!” Qing Shi laughed as he stretched his hands!</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“I don’t dare to anymore, please be gentle.” Huoyun Liu-Li hugged Qing Shui’s arms as she sent coquettish glances at Qing Shui with her sexy eyes. Her intoxicating eyelashes had the power to make men go crazy.</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Qing Shui: “......”</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>In a flash, ten days went by!</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>In the secret chambers!</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>There were numerous people in the secret chambers, Qing Shui, Fei Wuji, Cang Wuya, Bai Gui and many others. With one glance, Qing Shui could tell that these were the Old Ancestor’s most reliable and the only trustworthy people.</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Qing Shui, I can feel it, my time has come, I can finally meet her, and I can finally see my son.” The Old Ancestor laughed.</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Old Ancestor……” Qing Shui had a sour suffocating feeling in his heart.</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“I am happy, with you around, I feel assured. I can go in peace. Originally, I was worried about Wuji and the Heavenly Palace. Now, with the Heavenly Palace in your hands, it will surely prosper.” The Old Ancestor said as he held Qing Shui’s hands.</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Rest assured, I will do my best to manage everything.”</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Wuji, you must double your efforts in cultivation, Qing Shui would be able to sufficiently teach you and more. In the world of cultivation, strength comes first, it would not be shameful to ask him to teach you, the most important thing is to be able to live.</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Grandfather, I know……:</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Bai Ji, you are my youngest disciple, and also my most talented disciple. When you follow Qing Shui in the future, treat him like you treat me.</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“I will master!” Bai Ji said seriously as he cried as he knelt.</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Qing Shui now knew that Bai Gui was also known as Bai Ji!</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Wuya!”</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Master……”</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Now that we are at this point, I shall permit you to return!”</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Thank you master……” Cang Wuya cried as he knelt in front of the Old Ancestor.</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Hai!” The Old Ancestor let out a long sigh, his face looked depressed.</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Old Ancestor, is there anything bothering you?” Qing Shui asked out of concern.</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Indeed, I do not know how to face her or what to say to her, I killed our child with my own hands.” The Old Ancestor leaked out a tear.</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“My son was too lascivious, but he knew his boundaries, I only found out afterwards that they seduced my son, then came to the Heavenly Palace to cause trouble. This caused me to kill my son with my own hands. However, they did this out of fun only, I am not satisfied!” The Old Ancestor kept tearing up.</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Putong!”</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Qing Shui slowly knelt in front of the Old Ancestor, his life was saved by the Old Ancestor twice. One can not only kneel to his parents but to his benefactors as well!</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Will the Old Ancestor tell me who they were, I, Qing Shui, swear that as long as I’m alive, I will bring martial uncle Fei along. This debt of blood, will be repaid with blood, the heavens and earth will be my witness and I will not regret this!” Qing Shui slowly stooped down.</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“Get up, get up, this old man thanks you in advance. It is the Eastern Palace Clan of the Southern Viewing Ministry Continent. Promise me, before becoming a fifth grade Martial Saint, do not go there. Wuji, you are a smart person ……”</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Finally, his voice got softer and softer, but his face had a smile full of satisfaction!</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The funeral was set to be seven days later!</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>On the second day, the news of the Old Ancestor passing away was disseminated!</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>There were some people in the Heavenly Palace who were anxious, but many of the other sects were incomparably happy, especially the Sword Tower! The Demon Beast Sect was especially happy as well.</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“He’s dead, It’s good that he is dead, Old fogey, you shall not be able to die peacefully, the day of you funeral, will be the day the Heavenly Palace will be massacred!”</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Sword Tower Old Ancestor looked upwards to the sky as hesaid this, his face filled with a sinister smile that could wither bones!</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Seven days passed in an instant!</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Today was the day of the Heavenly Palace Old Ancestor’s funeral. The ones wearing mourning clothes were the Old Ancestors disciples and grand disciples, but there were also many heavenly palace disciples. However, where was a limit on the number of people who could attend, or else there would be no space for people to go in and out of the funeral hall.</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>But more than half of the people of Heavenly Palace were wearing white!</span><sup><a href="#cmnt5">[e]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt6">[f]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt7">[g]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt8">[h]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt9">[i]</a></sup></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>[TL notes: White and black clothes are for mourning. White usually represent the "host" when they are the mourners. Black, or dull colors for those coming to pay respects]</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The grave was located in the back mountains, on a piece of precious land with good Feng Shui.</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Soon, it was late in the day, and the people who came to pay their respects came wave after wave. Those who came were all people who were very reputable, the job of greeting them fell onto Qing Shui’s shoulders.</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>“The Qin Clan arrives!”</span></span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Coming forward was the Qin Clan’s clan head, Qin Lang, and with him was three other old men!</span></span></span></p>
