 <p><strong>AST 745 - Luan Luan’s Ten Earth Devouring Mice, Peace</strong></p>
 <p>Even though Qing Shui knew that it was important for everyone to have their coming of age ceremony, keeping it quiet and staying low-keyed had a huge part to do with Qing Shui. Today, once the coming of age ceremony was done, Yu Chang would have been an adult.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t tell any outsiders about it except for a few people from Heavenly Palace. However, a lot of people turned up today and gave them a lot of presents. At the time when Luan Luan had her coming of age ceremony, not as many people turned up. However, Qing Shui had a feeling that it had a lot to do with last time. It was because they found out from last time that his children were already having their coming of age ceremony, that was why they wouldn’t want to miss out on Yu Chang’s coming of age ceremony.</p>
 <p>Do not hit the smiling guy’s face. Qing Shui naturally had to welcome them. Only by doing so would everyone be happy. Originally, Qing Shui didn’t really care about these things but he wasn’t against them either. It was still really great to have more people celebrating his children’s coming of age ceremonies. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have let people from Heavenly Palace attend it.</p>
 <p>After Yu Chang’s coming of age ceremony was done, Qing Shui let out a sigh of relief. He was worried that he couldn’t make it for her coming of age ceremony. Luckily, he managed to make it in time.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui remembered it all along.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, I’m going to be an adult in the future.” Yu Chang hugged Qing Shui and smiled happily.</p>
 <p>Yu Chang at sixteen years old looked a lot like Mingyue Gelou. She was only half a head shorter than Qing Shui at the moment and had exceptionally good looks and traits. Qing Shui looked at Yu Chang and Luan Luan, he was forced to be a father because of them…..</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was busy for the entire day. The visitors only left at mid-afternoon. Both Cang Wuya and Fei Wuji also came after new year. They stayed here for quite a few days.</p>
 <p>The construction of Heavenly Palace was complete. It was just that it was about half as big as before. Additionally, there were a hundred thousand fewer people in Heavenly Palace which from Qing Shui’s view point, was a really good thing. The originally huge number of people was a burden. Furthermore, it was more important to have talent rather than a huge number. When he had been to the Central Continent, there were no huge sects or autocratic clans that had as large a number of people as the Heavenly Palace did.</p>
 <p>At the time when Qing Shui arrived at Heavenly Palace, he thought that all large sects were like that. But so far, Heavenly Palace was the only one he saw which was like that. Hence, Qing Shui and Elder Ge discussed ways to reorganize Heavenly Palace. The remaining people could stay but in the future, there would be large changes in terms of recruiting members. Only people with outstanding skills would be given a chance to enter the Heavenly Palace. The rules from the past would be cancelled.</p>
 <p>In a short while, almost 90% of the population was gone. This way, the quality of management as well as cultivation would be a lot better than before. There were only about ten thousand people in Heavenly Palace’s nine halls.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>During this time, Qing Shui collected quite a lot of Tiger Vitality Pills and some other stuff. The others from Qing Clan got more of them before they managed to finish up their old ones. He even divided up the things from those tens of Interspatial Silk Sachets for them.</p>
 <p>The other thing was that merely Qing Clan members wouldn’t be able to finish the Rainbow Trout Fish once it was prepared as a dish. Even though the increase in strength wasn’t significant, over time a terrifying result would surface.</p>
 <p>There were quite a lot of fish and prawns, turtles, Rainbow Trout Fish and Golden Horn Firetail Fish in the newly built lake at the backyard of Qing Clan. He also threw in quite a lot of water from the pool in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. In any case, it would not be long before the water in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal filled itself back up.</p>
 <p>He would soon be going to Southern Viewing Continent to fulfill the promise he made with Elder Fei. But it seemed he would have to wait until next month. There was still more than half a month left. He would use this time to organize the things in Heavenly Palace and Qing Clan.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I don’t care, you have to bring me to Southern Viewing Continent this time.” Huoyun Liu-Li said once more because she knew that Qing Shui would be going to Southern Viewing Ministry Continent very soon.</p>
 <p>“Liu-Li, what’s wrong? You can’t hold it in?” Qing Shui smiled and looked at Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s words were really flirtish, making Huoyun Liu-Li quickly blush and looked at Qing Shui grumpily. She looked beautiful regardless of whether she was happy or angry. Giving her an unusual charm.</p>
 <p>“Alright, be a good girl, I will bring you to Southern Viewing Continent once I’m done with everything, alright?” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>“Is telling lies the only thing that you know? You told me before that you would bring me to Central Continent but you never did.” Huoyun Liu-Li’s eyes were already filled with tears.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stunned. He felt as if he had really promised her before but yet was unable to fulfill it. At that time, he was only saying it casually. It could be that he did mention to her that he would bring her along in the future, just not now.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui really didn’t want to bring them on a risky journey to Southern Viewing Continent. He rubbed her tears and told her slowly: “Stop crying, I’ll bring you there alright?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui said it really bitterly. He couldn’t get himself to reject her request after seeing her sad look.</p>
 <p>“Alright, I won’t go. Remember this, you owe me two trips now! You have to bring me along in the future. I know that my cultivation level is quite low but I’ll work hard. In order to be able to follow you around, I will cultivate hard.” Huoyun Liu-Li smiled with traces of tears on her face.</p>
 <p>“Alright alright, I will bring you there for sure.” Qing Shui let out a sigh of relief. At the same time, he also realized that Huoyun Liu-Li was testing him just now. She was a fair and considerate person, hence, she wouldn’t put him in a tough position. She just wanted to tell him that the words that he said to her meant a lot to her.</p>
 <p>Over the following days, not only did Qing Shui need to guide Qing Clan in their cultivation, he needed to go to Heavenly Palace to arrange the things in it. Most of the things in Heavenly Palace were being watched over by Elder Ge. Qing Shui was only there to roughly understand the situation.</p>
 <p>The inheritance of Heavenly Palace had to stay the same, the main hall had to be kept the same as well and some of the groups had to stay attached. These were the last words of the Old Ancestor. The other eight halls and Misty Hall had to stay the same with Di Chen looking after it. However, Yiye Jiange, Wenren Wushuang, Canghai Mingyue, Huoyun Liu-Li and Mingyue Gelou had all gone to Misty Hall to aid Di Chen.</p>
 <p>Even Luan Luan was someone from Misty Hall. The Misty Hall was already the strongest one among the Heavenly Palace's nine halls. Not long after, it might be strengthened even further. In the future, it might have a chance to impact the World of the Nine Continents with its name.</p>
 <p>Other than that, Qing Shui moved Qing Clan to Heavenly Palace. This way, he would be able to gather them at one spot to look after.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, look at the demonic beasts I tamed!”</p>
 <p>In the moment when Qing Shui was dreaming, Luan Luan’s voice came through.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned around and saw Luan Luan approaching him with ten demonic beasts. She had a really happy smile on her face accompanied by a bit of excitement. Upon seeing the demonic beasts behind her clearly, he also felt a sudden joy.</p>
 <p>The demonic beasts which Luan Luan tamed were actually a herd of Earth Devouring Mice.</p>
 <p>There were ten of them. Earth Devouring Mice could drill through earth and penetrate through rock. It was a foot long and had a silver colored body. It was the same family as the Four-Eared Shadow Mouse. Even their strength was almost the same, with the exception that it had the addition ability of drilling through earth and rock. The Earth Devouring Mouse was also known as the Ground Travelling Mouse. It was an outstanding existence in travelling through the ground.</p>
 <p>Earth Devouring Mice also possessed incredibly fast speed. The sharpness of its teeth and claws were comparable to that of the Four-Eared Shadow Mouse. It’s just that it was a bit inferior in speed. However, it could drill through earth, diamonds and can be used for sneak attacks. It was still really powerful. However, similarly to the Four-Eared Shadow Mouse, they were a terrifying force when they worked together as a group.</p>
 <p>Strength of a Peak Martial King. All of them had the strength of Peak Martial Kings!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately took out some Endurance Pellets and even some Spiritual Beast Pills from the Interspatial Silk Sachet and gave more than half of them to Luan Luan, making her so happy that she kissed Qing Shui’s cheek.</p>
 <p>This was how Luan Luan has been since she was young. Qing Shui remembered the time when he got a face full of her saliva from her kisses and in the blink of an eye, she was already all grown up.</p>
 <p>“Luan Luan, you have to treat these little guys well. In the future, they’re going to be really powerful. It would have been better if you could have more of them.” Qing Shui chuckled and looked at Luan Luan. This daughter of his was finally about to show her talent.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, I know.” Luan Luan happily embraced one of Qing Shui’s arms as she looked at the ten intelligent little guys.</p>
 <p>“Haha, these ten little guys could totally beat a Grade Ten Martial Saint in mountains and on the ground. If among them, there are three that achieve the strength of a Grade One Martial Saint, they would be able to even defeat a low Peak Martial Saint.” Qing Shui smiled and looked at Luan Luan.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan looked at Qing Shui in shock and only responded after a long time: “Is daddy telling the truth?”</p>
 <p>“Since when has daddy ever lied to you?”</p>
 <p>“That’s great! Unfortunately, there are too few of them.” Luan Luan complained.</p>
 <p>“The fewer, the better, it would have been dangerous if there had been more. You would lose focus on which demonic beasts you would tame if there are too many of them. And also, your spirit energy, it’s quite limited. If the difference in strength is too great, it would be really dangerous.” Qing Shui rubbed her head. Even though she possessed the Heart of Seven Orifices, it didn’t necessarily mean that she would be able to tame a magnificent army of beasts. When she attempted to tame demonic beasts which exceeded her by too much, there was a chance that it would fail. After all, the stronger a demonic beast, the more intelligence they have. Once she failed to tame them, there would be danger. Most of the demonic beasts would attack fiercely when they found out there were humans who wanted to tame them. However, Luan Luan, who possessed the Heart of Seven Orifices, could feel what the demonic beasts thought. Hence the reason why she could tame them more effectively. It’s just like making intimate friends.</p>
 <p>“When will I get demonic beasts that’s as powerful as daddy’s?” Luan Luan looked at Qing Shui and asked eagerly.</p>
 <p>“Quick, cultivate well and try to break through Martial Saint as soon as possible. By then, you will end up taming even more powerful demonic beasts. But you have to be careful, even though your talent in taming beasts is undisputable, you need to have a few powerful demonic beasts around you to protect yourself.” Qing Shui already knew that Luan Luan knew about all of this but he still couldn’t hold it and laughed.</p>
 <p>As he thought more about it, he began to laugh. Parents would often subconsciously nagged their children. They would always be worried about their children just like Qing Shui, he came to realize that he has started to be a bit naggy and finally understood why his mother was so concerned of him in the past.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, I know daddy.” Luan Luan laughed and walked towards Qing Clan while grabbing Qing Shui’s arm.</p>
 <p>Yu Chang inherited Mingyue Gelou’s talent. However, not all her meridians were cleared, only themajority of them. She had about eighty or 90% of her meridians cleared already.During this time, she had been consuming Meridians Clearing Pills to help her clear the rest. Qing Shui hoped that she would have comprehension abilities like that of Mingyue Gelou.</p>
 <p>Qing Zun and Qing Yin were still too young. Hence, Qing Shui would only let them dip in a bubbly medicinal bath and eat a few warm-natured spiritual fruits. This would help store up some spiritual energy in their bodies which would slowly be of use when they grew up.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, someone’s looking for you down there, he said he is Qing Shang from Qin Clan.” Qing Shui was practicing his fist at the courtyard when Luan Luan approached him.</p>
 <p>“Oh, let me go have a look!” Qing Shui smiled at Luan Luan and walked out when he was done speaking.</p>
 <p>It’s already past new year, it should be time for him to take over Qin Clan. Qing Shui never thought that he would personally send him an invitation card. This still made Qing Shui feel really happy deep down, this meant that he sincerely wished that Qing Shui would attend the ceremony.</p>
 <p>“Mister Qing!” Upon seeing Qing Shui, Qin Shang happily walked a few steps.</p>
 <p>“Is it time yet?” Qing Shui smiled as he welcomed him up. This was the waist of the Heavenly Palace mountain. Qing Clan wasn’t far away from here.</p>
