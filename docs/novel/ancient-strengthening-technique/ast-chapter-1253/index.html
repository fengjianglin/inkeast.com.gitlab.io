 <p><strong>AST 1253 - Out of Fighting Spirit, Prowess, She Can Travel Around The Nine Continents?</strong></p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui's words couldn’t be considered to be astonishing, it dealt quite a big blow to Tian Jianxian. The Lord Sect was his hope. Without it, he would have to start all over again. If the condition was just for him to help his brother, with the latter's talent, he would really be able to surpass him in the future. He would just need some time. Moreover, if his younger brother were to become the head of the Lord Sect, with the access to the best resources, his brother’s abilities would improve tremendously and would eventually surpass him in the future.</p>
 <p>Although Tian Jiange was his younger brother, Tian Jianxian didn't wish for his younger brother to surpass him. If that were to happen, he would no longer be the Tian Clan's clan head.</p>
 <p>"Seems like you're unwilling. Then let's fight. However, I can tell you upfront. If we were to battle, you'll regret it for life." Qing Shui's words were filled with great killing intent.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't wish to kill him nor cripple him with his own hands.</p>
 <p>Keeping him alive was Tian Jiange's motivation to advance. When the day where Tian Jiange had the capabilities to stomped Tian Jianxian down came, that would be the day that Tian Jiange would truly mature.</p>
 <p>A strength 3,000 suns was one juncture, 2,000 sun was a small juncture. People like Fu Yantian and Tian Jianxian would come to a stop at around 2,000 suns of strength. This juncture wasn't a great one, but it was neither insignificant. There were plenty of people who would get stuck here, never to attain a breakthrough in their entire lives. It was also considered normal to be stuck at this stage for 180 years.</p>
 <p>Fu Yantian and Tian Jianxian had been stuck here for at least 15 years!</p>
 <p>"I agree with your condition!" Tian Jianxian sighed. This step back was a thorn in his heart, but at least it wouldn't subject him to become a cripple. They say that a man would know when to yield and when not to. However, this act of yielding today required him to pay too high of a price.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn't surprised by such a result. He nodded and Tian Jianxian walked off dejectedly.</p>
 <p>"Coward. You don't even have the courage to fight it out."</p>
 <p>"Tian Jiange is really a crap. To think that he colluded with external parties to chase his own elder brother off his seat."</p>
 <p>"What's so strange about that? Tian Jianxian is the head of the Lord Sect, yet he didn't take much care of Tian Jiange either. They are both brothers. Tian Jianxian can't compare with Fu Yantian."</p>
 <p>"The Saint Child Band is over. I wonder what's going to be of the Lord Sect?"</p>
 <p>"It's said that Tian Jiange is on very good terms with Qing Shui. I just wonder if Qing Shui will take control over of the Lord Sect."</p>
 <p>"Since Qing Shui could defeat the Saint Child in a single move, do you think that he'll think much of the Lord Sect? If he wished to, even taking over the Heaven Secrets Academy will just be in a matter of time."</p>
 <p>"The Heaven Secrets Academy should be supportive of him. Otherwise, they wouldn't have made him the Guest Custodian. It seems like he really has the capabilities of being one."</p>
 <p>"That's right. It seems that the Breezing Wind Veranda will become powerful in the future. After today, the prowess of the Breezing Wind Veranda will change and there will be many people who want to join them."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stood on the Heaven Secrets Arena and looked at the three influences, including the Left Moon Hall. "Come on up. If you guys can win after joining forces, it will still count as your victory."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's words caused many people to draw in a cold gasp of air. However, they quickly understood that he wasn't just boasting. Someone who could confine the Saint Child with a single move would really be able to do something like this.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui suddenly took one step forward. He could tell that the three people didn't have much fighting spirit, but he still needed to do something. He circulated his strength to the maximum and swung his Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p>Bloodthirsty demonic vines!</p>
 <p>The huge bloodthirsty demonic vines were even more terrifying than before. Its huge branches were reddish-violet in color, as they soared into the air with densely packed sharp thorns which were over one foot long. When they swayed and made whizzing sounds, the auras they produced caused the blood from many people's faces to be drained. That tenacity and swaying force would even be able to entangle and crush metallic essence.</p>
 <p>When a person reached a certain level, he would be able to sense an estimated level of threat. Even the weaker people under the arena could sense how terrifying those bloodthirsty demonic vines were. The feeling was as if even a mountain could be crushed by those vines.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then tapped with his Big Dipper Sword, as he called out two more huge bloodthirsty demonic vines. This was also the greatest number which Qing Shui could call out for now. He was trying to display his prowess.</p>
 <p>"We admit defeat. State your conditions. If we can, we'll definitely agree to them."</p>
 <p>Although it appeared as if there had been no changes to the Saint Child Band, it could be said that it was over for them. The Lord Sect could also be considered to have changes in ownership. The people from the Left Moon Hall didn't know what would happen to them yet.</p>
 <p>However, they would probably not end up with a good ending. This was what the results for the losers were.</p>
 <p>"I don't have any conditions. You guys just need to be loyal to the Heaven Secrets Academy." Qing Shui said softly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt helpless as well. The Eldest Princess was still not up to par yet. She still required a bit more time as she still needed more progress. As long as he was around, there was nothing to fear.</p>
 <p>"We've always been loyal to the Heaven Secrets Academy."</p>
 <p>"Then that's fine. One more thing. I'm a member of the Breezing Wind Veranda. We'll let things today end here then!" After saying this, Qing Shui left slowly. When he said the last part, the three parties knew well what he meant.</p>
 <p>The things today had ended and this result wasn't beyond his expectations. It was because they were no longer on the same level. His spirit energy was unique and even without the Divine Nebula Formation, he would still be able to bind someone on the Saint Child's level.</p>
 <p>This time around, he left with the Eldest Princess and the others. Qing Shui's and the Breezing Wind Veranda's reputation had been spread out. Those with great judgment would be able to tell the relationship between Qing Shui and the Breezing Wind Veranda, and between Qing Shui and the Eldest Princess.</p>
 <p>This person, who was the most beautiful lady in the Heaven Secrets Academy, had never been tainted by anyone before. Even someone like the Saint Child had not been able to accomplish it. However right now, there seemed to be an inclination for her to be taken by someone. This made many people glared at Qing Shui's back view with great jealousy.</p>
 <p>The things here were considered to had ended today. Qing Shui planned to leave for a while. It should be tomorrow, but if it was later, it wouldn't exceed three days.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui let the ladies head back first while he flew toward the Heaven Secrets Courtyard.</p>
 <p>To Qing Shui, the Nine Palace Fog Formation was no challenge at all. After he entered, he saw that the two old men seemed to know that he would come.</p>
 <p>"Come, come. You came faster than we had expected." The old man wearing a golden dragon robe called Qing Shui over to take a seat.</p>
 <p>"They're too cowardly and don't even have the courage to fight a single battle." Qing Shui shook his head.</p>
 <p>"They've received too great of a blow and won't be able get over it within a short period of time. They might not even be able to get over from the blow their entire life. Their mental state isn't firm enough and this is also considered to be a test for them."</p>
 <p>"Oh, right. Qing Shui, are you going to leave?" The old man with the surname Cao smiled and said to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Mhm!"</p>
 <p>"When?"</p>
 <p>"I'm thinking of leaving tomorrow. It won't be later than three days."</p>
 <p>"Then be careful on your way. We won't be sending you off." The old man in golden dragon robe smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Thank you. Sir, you don't have to stand on ceremony with me. There's still something I have to get your advice on." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"What is it? Just say it. You don't have to stand on ceremony then either. If you don't mind, you can treat the two of us as your own family's seniors." The old man dressed in golden dragon robe now valued Qing Shui very highly.</p>
 <p>"I want to know about the Demon Lord." Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</p>
 <p>"The Demon Lord?" The two old men looked at Qing Shui in great astonishment.</p>
 <p>"Yes, I wonder if the two of you knows anything?" Qing Shui now spoke to them differently. It represented that the relationship between the three of them had gotten closer.</p>
 <p>"The Demon Lord isn't from the Western Oxhe Continent. We only know that she's the head of the Demon Lord Palace. She has made an enemy against all the righteous influences of an entire continent. They all say that she's a demon and we don't know the details either. The Western Oxhe Continent knows only the hearsays about her and they might not be accurate." The old man looked at Qing Shui and said slowly.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, you know the Demon Lord?" The old man with the surname Cao said in astonishment.</p>
 <p>"I broke the seal on her back in the five continents."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that there's no need to conceal this and thus said it outright. However, when he said this, the countenance of the two old men seemed to be a little weird.</p>
 <p>"We hope that you don't look for her before you've reached the strength of 10,000 suns. Remember what we have said. We won't do you harm. Otherwise, you'll be in great danger. Wait till you've become stronger. You'll then be able to hear from other people of her level on how to travel between the nine continents." The old man wearing a golden dragon robe sighed and said.</p>
 <p>"A strength of 10,000 suns? What level is that lady at? She can travel between the nine continents?" Qing Shui said in astonishment.</p>
 <p>"It's not good to know too much now. Remember what we've said. Work hard on getting stronger. In the future, the Heaven Secrets Academy will still have to rely on you. With power, everything else will be resolved."</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>"Father, are you really not going to bring me? Please bring me along." Qing Sha grabbed Qing Shui's arm and said dejectedly.</p>
 <p>"Haven't we spoken about this? If you don't cultivate, what will happen to you in the future? Moreover, I'll come back frequently."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui tried very hard and finally convinced Qing Sha.</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu and the Seventh Princess both gave their blessings.</p>
 <p>"Lass, you must listen to aunt." Qing Shui brought Qing Sha to the Eldest Princess and said.</p>
 <p>"Didn't you say that I must call her mother previously? Why has it changed to aunt?" Qing Sha asked Qing Shui, as she looked at him seriously.</p>
 <p>It was only then did Qing Shui realized that she had the potential to be a small demon. Her potential was slowly being developed.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess blushed as she grabbed Qing Sha. "Lass, you're teasing me as well now?"</p>
 <p>"Haha, I listen to Father. If Father isn't around, I'll listen to you." With that, Qing Sha looked at the two of them and left.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that the few of them already know that the relationship between himself and the Eldest Princess seemed to had changed. It was because he felt that even Qing Sha had noticed that. How could the others not realize?</p>
 <p>"Bon voyage."</p>
 <p>"You haven't given me my reward yet." Qing Shui smiled and looked at the Eldest Princess.</p>
 <p>"What reward? There's no reward." The Eldest Princess said unnaturally.</p>
 <p>"A man must be true to his words. How can you go back on your words?"</p>
 <p>"I'm not a gentleman, I'm a lady." The Eldest Princess smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Uh. If you don't give me a reward, I won't let you be a lady." Qing Shui looked at her and said seriously.</p>
 <p>"I'm a lady. What can I be if I'm not a lady?" The Eldest Princess didn't think much of it.</p>
 <p>"You can become a woman as well."</p>
 <p>Eldest Princess: "..."</p>
 <p>While she was stunned, Qing Shui kissed the Eldest Princess' red lips and sucked on the sweet nectar in her mouth greedily. It tasted even better than the Spring of Life. He had one hand around her beautiful waist while the other one reached into her twin peaks from the lower hem of her clothes.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess only had a short moment of oversight. When she regained her senses, Qing Shui's other hand had also reached under her clothes and was on her beautiful butt.</p>
 <p>It took her a lot of force to get away from Qing Shui's entangling mouth, one of her hands pressed down on the hand which he had on her butt, not letting him move. Her other hand was around his neck.</p>
 <p>"If you were to continue going overboard, I'll let you have your wish, but I'll disappear."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt very down. Why was it that all ladies liked to use this trick? He had no choice but to stop one of his hands. However, the hand which was at her twin peaks continued to move around. Qing Shui's lower half body once again turned into the state it was like the other time.</p>
 <p>Just like that, Qing Shui looked at that beauty and enjoyed its touch in great ecstasy.</p>
