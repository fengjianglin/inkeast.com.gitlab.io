 <p><b>AST 1349 - Puyang Qing Attained Breakthrough to False God, Qing Shui Benefited Once Again</b></p>
 <p><b>"I feel that this time around, it should work," Puyang Qing said confidently to Qing Shui.</b></p>
 <p><b>Qing Shui smiled and looked at Puyang Qing. This time around, Puyang Qing once again attempted a breakthrough from Martial Emperor to False God. He needed one type of thing or rather, something which could bring him to a certain level.</b></p>
 <p><b>Spring of Life!</b></p>
 <p><b>Or rather, things that had similar effects to the Spring of Life. For example, the Fruit of Life, Life Origin Grass, Flower of Life and the Sacred Leaf. Qing Shui hadn't expected that he had two such items. However, he wasn't planning on using the Flower of Life. It hadn't been easy for it to grow to the stage at which it was at right now.</b></p>
 <p><b>Puyang Qing had previously made multiple attempts to attain a breakthrough. Thankfully, he would get a tremendous takeaway each time around. Otherwise, he would probably have lost his confidence. Furthermore, this was a barrier that people would encounter at Peak Martial Emperor level. It wasn't that easy for one to break through.</b></p>
 <p><b>It should be about sufficient. The other time, Qing Shui felt that Puyang Qing should be able to attain a breakthrough in another month tops. RIght now, half a month had already passed by and if there weren't any accidents, he should be able to attain a breakthrough. A False God cultivator would be born with his help. Qing Shui was feeling very agitated.</b></p>
 <p><b>Having applied acupuncture on him for the past year. In addition to what he had done for him in the past it all added up to about a year in total. Puyang Qing's meridian channels had been reinforced by Qing Shui to a large extent. Furthermore, there were still the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellets and the Du Meridian Strengthening Pellets which had contributed significantly.</b></p>
 <p><b>The Ren Meridian Strengthening Pellets and Du Meridian Strengthening Pellet were effective even for that old lady from Puyang Clan, who was a False God cultivator. Therefore, Qing Shui felt very happy. There was another reason why he felt happy about it.</b></p>
 <p><b>Demon Lord!</b></p>
 <p><b>These two meridian strengthening pellets had been included in the things which Qing Shui had given to her. He hoped that she would use them. Very soon, he would be able to head to the continent's capital, which would make him closer to her and closer to the Demon Lord Palace.</b></p>
 <p><b>Puyang Qing started his attempt to break through the barrier. Qing Shui applied acupuncture on him to protect his internal organs so that he had less things to worry about and could focus on his attempt. Qing Shui also stayed behind him to use the power of the Shield Attack to help him in his attempt.</b></p>
 <p><b>One time, two times...</b></p>
 <p><b>Time trickled by and the barrier leading to False God started to loosen up, seeming as if it would be broken through at any moment. However, each time, it would still remain connected, refusing to break.</b></p>
 <p><b>Both of them were mentally prepared for this and had no intention to break through it immediately. Gradually, it became a cycle of charging forth, being repelled back, then to continue charging forth and then once again being repelled back.</b></p>
 <p><b>Boom!</b></p>
 <p><b>A stifled sound rang out in Puyang Qing's body and a hole was created in the barrier. In that instant, a terrifying gush of power exploded in his body.</b></p>
 <p><b>Thankfully, Qing Shui had helped him to protect his internal organs in advance and had also helped him to reinforce his meridian channels for such a long period of time. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to withstand that outburst of power.</b></p>
 <p><b>In the instant in which Puyang Qing attained his breakthrough, a hint of mysterious energy gushed into Qing Shui's body, following his meridian channels and charging toward his Dantian. Qing Shui felt anxious and activated his Nine Continents Mountain to block it.</b></p>
 <p><b>Boom!</b></p>
 <p><b>That pure energy was the power that belonged to False God cultivators and was the purest form of energy. Not only did it get past the Nine Continents Mountain, it continued to flow through his meridian channels and even reached where the golden pellet was at.</b></p>
 <p><b>The spinning golden pellet mysteriously absorbed this gush of power endlessly.</b></p>
 <p><b>When a cultivator attained a breakthrough to False God, the outburst of energy in that particular instant was very dangerous. Many people would have their skin and flesh in a battered state and some of the power would leak out. Some people's meridian channels could also burst or even break. If the ones which broke weren't the primary meridian channels, then there would only be a minor impact. However, if it was an important meridian channel, then the result wouldn't be good.</b></p>
 <p><b>Despite this, Puyang Qing still spewed out a mouthful of blood, another way in which some of his powers could be let out. In a sense, it was also considered to be a good thing for Puyang Qing that Qing Shui had managed to absorb some of the purest energy.</b></p>
 <p><b>However, Qing Shui wasn't sure if it was a good or bad thing. Very soon, he was sent flying back by that gush of force.</b></p>
 <p><b>Qing Shui knew that it was a success. With his help, not only did the old man, who was reaching the end of his life span, have his lifespan increased by a lot, he had even attained a breakthrough from the Martial Emperor realm to the False God realm.</b></p>
 <p><b>Qing Shui looked at the Puyang Qing who was trying to digest and absorb his new powers. They were high up in the air, deep within the clouds. There wouldn't be anyone who would disturb him. There was no longer any gravitational force in such a high place. However, there was air and spiritual Qi. Even ordinary people would be safe here.</b></p>
 <p><b>Puyang Qing would probably have to take at least half a day to for the elementary refinement at the False God level. This was a conservative estimation. There was't anyone to disturb them there. Furthermore, there were also other members in the Puyang Qing who were on guard.</b></p>
 <p><b>With nothing to do at the moment, Qing Shui sensed his Dantian and felt that the power contained in his golden pellet had increased by more than double. However, this was more like an increase in his endurance and not to his attacking power. If he could withstand about 24 hours of full power attack earlier, right now, he would be able to sustain for over 40 hours. This was the benefit that pure force had brought him.</b></p>
 <p><b>Even though that gush of force had gone through the Nine Continents Mountain, it didn't raise its grade. Qing Shui was still thinking previously that when Puyang Qing attained a breakthrough to the False God, that surge of force would be able to allow the Nine Continents Mountain to reach a new level. However, it was a pity that nothing had changed.</b></p>
 <p><b>In all, the benefit he received was still tremendous.</b></p>
 <p><b>The sky had already started to darken and Puyang Qing gradually opened his eyes. A hint of a gleam burst out from his eyes. This was due the fact that one who had just attained a breakthrough to the False God realm wouldn't be able to control their power. When Puyang Qing saw Qing Shui, he felt an indescribable feeling of happiness.</b></p>
 <p><b>"I shan't say more thanks. This old man hadn't many years left to begin with and hadn't held any hopes to be able to hit False God. All this was given by you," Puyang Qing said a little agitatedly.</b></p>
 <p><b>"Old Master, is there still a need for this between us? I don't have many friends in the Dancing Phoenix Continent. Although many people are very friendly to me, that's only because of my medical skills."</b></p>
 <p><b>"Back then, the reason I approached you was also because of your medical skills," Puyang Qing smiled and said.</b></p>
 <p><b>Qing Shui shook his head and said smiling, "That situation was different. Back then, my abilities or rather, the abilities that I had displayed wasn't sufficient to be taken seriously by you guys. Furthermore, Puyang Clan's reputation isn't something which other clans could be compared with. Right now, isn't it clear what everyone is like?"</b></p>
 <p><b>"Haha, so what if this old man has become a False God? There are many things that can be measured by other things, not just one's power. Puyang Clan will forever be your best friend. As long as you face trouble, no matter what it is, we'll face it together with you." Puyang Qing didn't say much. It was because sometimes, it would sound hypocritical when one said too much.</b></p>
 <p><b>...</b></p>
 <p><b>After returning to the Imperial Cuisine Hall, Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. It was time. After entering, Qing Shui didn't do anything but went deep into thorough, comprehending and allowing himself to immerse in experiencing. In the instant Puyang Qing attained a breakthrough to the False God level, Qing Shui had also sensed that the force had gushed forth explosively from beyond the barrier.</b></p>
 <p><b>This force had only gushed in from the Baihui Acupoint after the barrier had been broken through. It was a pity that there weren't any weird heavenly and earthly phenomena. When Puyang Clan's old lady had attained a breakthrough to the Grade Two False God, silvery white thunderbolts had struck from the sky. When most people attained a breakthrough to the False God level, there wouldn't be any heavenly and earthly phenomena. It might appear for some people but it would be rare. It could be said that only people with a strength of 500,000 sun would experience such phenomena when they attain a breakthrough to False God.</b></p>
 <p><b>Puyang Qing's strength hadn't reach 500,000 sun and after attaining the breakthrough, his strength immediately reached about 1.5 million sun. If a person that only had a strength of 300,000 sun were to attain a breakthrough, he would only reach a strength of one million. This was the difference between two people who had a strength of 300,000 sun and 500,000 sun respectively when they attained a breakthrough. This gap would become increasingly bigger as they continued to get stronger.</b></p>
 <p><b>When he came out from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, it was already the latter part of the night. When he returned to the living hall, he saw that Yuan Su hadn't rested yet and was drinking tea.</b></p>
 <p><b>"Be careful that you won't be able to fall asleep when you drink tea at such a late hour," Qing Shui said as he took a seat opposite her.</b></p>
 <p><b>Unknowingly, it had already been over half a year ever since Yuan Su had came.</b></p>
 <p><b>"I can't sleep anyway, so I decided to just get up and have some tea."</b></p>
 <p><b>Qing Shui poured himself a cup of tea as well.</b></p>
 <p><b>"Why aren't you sleeping either?" Yuan Su put down her tea cup and asked as she looked at Qing Shui.</b></p>
 <p><b>"I decided to come out to take a look since I woke up, then I saw you sitting here alone in a daze. Why? Is something troubling you or have you thought of someone?" For the past half a year or so, Qing Shui and Yuan Su had developed quite a good rapport with each other and Yuan Su was able to feel more free. At least, right now, the two of them were very good friends. This was especially when as time passed, the time the two of them had spent together was quite significant.</b></p>
 <p><b>However, even if they were together, they would only talk about some light hearted topics. They wouldn't even bring up the things in the past. This made it more at ease between them. During this period of time, Qing Shui would still head back once a month. There was once when Yuan Su had wanted Qing Shui to bring her back to take a look but it was a pity that Qing Shui didn't have the ability to do so yet.</b></p>
 <p><b>However, Qing Shui told her that there would be opportunities in the future. He didn't hide the facts about the Five Elements Divine Flag and told here that there would be chances for that in the future. This made Yuan Su feel very happy. Another thing was her own abilities. If she got strong enough, she would be able to go back by herself as well. It was just a pity that it would take so much time.</b></p>
 <p><b>"That young lady from Li Clan came to look for you in the day." Yuan Su didn't reply but smiled and changed the topic.</b></p>
 <p><b>"Oh? Did she say why she had come?"</b></p>
 <p><b>During this period of time, Qing Shui didn't have much contact with Li Yan. One reason was because Qing Shui was busy and she wasn't the lady he had thought of. She and the lady he knew were still largely different and thus, as time changed, Li Yan changed as well. She no longer had that impact from when they first met and gradually, didn't have that inclination either. In the past, Li Clan could still bring up the matter but now, they wouldn't bring it up from their side either.</b></p>
 <p><b>Qing Shui had once cured Li Clan's Old Master of his illness and Li Clan had given Qing Shui the Life and Death Needles. During this period of time, they were considered to be quite good friends. Furthermore, the benefits Qing Shui had brought Li Clan were quite tremendous. There was no reason for this except for the Life and Death Needles and also for that extremely similar appearance.</b></p>
 <p><b>"She didn't but she seems to like you," Yuan Su smiled and said.</b></p>
 <p><b>Qing Shui was stunned. At the beginning, he didn't notice that Li Yan liked him. He was the one who had some misconceptions when she saw her appearance. There were also quite a number of times when they had met and come into contact as well but she hadn't shown any signs at all. Qing Shui had already let go of these thoughts. It was best to leave things to its natural progression.</b></p>
 <p><b>"I don't think so. We've also known each other for very long."</b></p>
 <p><b>"I only said that she might like you. This is very normal. Mister Qing now has many people who like you and even more people who wish to marry their daughters to you!" Yuan Su said, seemingly jokingly.</b></p>
