 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">AST 2045 - Big Tiger, Treasure Basin</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unknowingly, a month had passed by. Qing Shui's Imperial Cuisine Hall and Yu Xixuan's restaurant were on track with Qing Shui occasionally giving Yu Xixuan spices and wine. Although it had only been a month, their reputation had spread out and even the cities around the Azure Rainbow City knew of the Imperial Cuisine Hall and the Jade Fragrant Restaurant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, due to the difference in time, the Jade Fragrant Restaurant's reputation seemed slightly greater than that of the Imperial Cuisine Hall. The Jade Fragrant Restaurant's management method was the same one it had used before, using tokens, as well as setting restrictions. The tokens were split into a few grades, and the people who had received tokens of the lowest grade could only visit the restaurant by themselves and not bring along other guests. Moreover, they could only visit once a week.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">People with a slightly higher grade token could bring a guest along and visit twice a week. The group with an even higher grade token could bring along two guests and visit three times a week. Right now, the highest grade tokens which had been given out could only allow one to bring along five guests at most and visit five times a week. There hadn’t been a person who could come every day yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui and Yu Xixuan had thought it through from the start. The purpose of the business wasn't to earn money, which was why they came up with such a system. This could allow them to build up their reputation at a faster pace. The price that the guests had to pay to enjoy the food here was too high anyway and ordinary people wouldn't come. Only wealthy people, cultivators, as well as people from aristocratic clans and sects could come.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What Qing Shui wanted to obtain was their influence. It was very important for them to satiate the taste buds of some people. The more these people nitpick about food, the further the reputation of the restaurant would be spread out. When that happened, the restaurant's influence would grow. People who come here could help spur the business for the Imperial Cuisine Hall and the reverse could apply as well. It wasn't just so. The Jade Fragrant Restaurant's main purpose was to gather information. Most of the people at the restaurant probed for information. It was easier to probe for information here than doing the same elsewhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Imperial Cuisine Hall's reputation was not comparable to the Jade Fragrant Restaurant's at the moment, its reputation in the Azure Rainbow City was very great. Furthermore, they had also provided free treatment to many people, building up a good name amongst ordinary people. There were many people who were in support of the Imperial Cuisine Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the month, Qing Shui hadn't provided any treatment to influential people. After all, one month was considered very short. Although there were people who were either sick or injured, they had their own physicians and Alchemists to attend to them. Therefore, they wouldn't go to the Imperial Cuisine Hall. Putting aside whether or not they trusted his medical skills, everyone knew that Qing Shui was strong and no one would dare to trouble such an expert unless they were at their wits' end and couldn't be cured. If that were to happen, they could at least give it a try. In other cases, they wouldn't look for Qing Shui as long as other people could treat their conditions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also why the Imperial Cuisine Hall's situation wasn't as good compared to the Jade Fragrant Restaurant's. People with tokens to the Jade Fragrant Restaurant would basically not give up on a chance to have a meal there, and they would want to bring guests along as well. The additional guests would also want to apply for the tokens and would check out on the conditions required.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Jade Fragrant Restaurant's customer flow was very low, with only a few people daily. However, with time, there would be more and more people coming as more and more tokens were issued. The way to obtain the tokens wasn't through paying money, but to use items to exchange. They could be interesting objects, medicinal herbs, or any other things. As long as the conditions were met, they would be able to get the tokens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn't unusual for them to be collecting medicinal herbs in exchange for the tokens. After all, everyone knew that the Jade Fragrant Restaurant and the Imperial Cuisine Hall were jointly operated. The Imperial Cuisine Hall required medicinal herbs and it was very easy for great clans to offer some good things. Qing Shui was the one who set these rules. In fact, he had actually wanted to get his hands on some treasures such as the Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda or ores. Right now, he was still short of one material for his flying sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Redcloud Grass, Tilted Moon Branch, and Lightning Fruit. Qing Shui wanted to see if he could get lucky and find them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even after people had exchanged for tokens at the Jade Fragrant Restaurant using the things they brought, they would still have to pay money to order the meal there. The lower the grade of the tokens, the more expensive the food would cost. On the contrary, The higher the grade of the tokens, the cheaper the food would be. If the grade of the tokens were high enough, one could possibly even eat at the Jade Fragrant Restaurant every day for free.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Other than that, they could also bring things for appraisals. As long as the requirements were fulfilled, one could enjoy free food at the Jade Fragrant Restaurant for a period of time. Even ordinary people could give it a try.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two days ago, Qing Shui had gotten a treasure from an ordinary person, a Treasure Basin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only did Qing Shui let that person become a Xiantian cultivator expert but the person was also hired to help out with odd jobs at the Imperial Cuisine Hall and given access to free food at the Jade Fragrant Restaurant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This ordinary person was called Big Tiger. He was over 30 years old, came from a very poor family, and was single. He was an honest man with ordinary looks. There was only his aging mother in his family and he had no women. His mother, who was plagued with illnesses, had received a free treatment from Qing Shui previously. Since then, her condition had improved. This time around, in order to thank Qing Shui, he had brought his family heirloom to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Big Tiger brought this item to Qing Shui, he felt a little embarrassed. After all, although it was his family heirloom, it wasn’t worth much to other people. He had thought of selling it before, but the money offered wasn't even enough to pay for a single meal. This was why he decided to give up on the thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, his ancestors had claimed that this was a treasure so Big Tiger decided to give it to Qing Shui. After all, it wasn't worth much money.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui saw it, he didn't appear very agitated. Its opening wasn't very big and was more like a vat. The most special thing about it was that there were many images of ingots on it. However, due to its old age, most people's first impression of it would be that it was dirty and would not want to touch it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Tiger had cleaned it many times, but it didn't help. One would get their hands dirty just from holding it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, when Qing Shui used the Heavenly Vision Technique on the Treasure Basin, he was stunned. No matter what its current state was, this object was definitely a treasure. However, it required a stimulation using a blood essence. Moreover, there were also strict requirements. This Treasure Basin was the same as Qing Shui's many other items and was a magic treasure. However, it would take time to find out what use this Treasure Basin had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't give it much thought back then and had asked Big Tiger if he was willing to work at the Imperial Cuisine Hall. Big Tiger was overjoyed and naturally agreed. Qing Shui even got Big Tiger to bring his mother over and gave the two of them a small courtyard to stay.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn't all. Seeing that Big Tiger didn't have much of a cultivation talent, Qing Shui gave him a Xiantian Golden Pellet, as well as a sum of money so that he could purchase clothes and some other things for his mother. They didn't have to fret over food here and could just eat the food from the restaurant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not all the food in the restaurant were made using the spices. Qing Shui wouldn't eat food with those spices on a daily basis. He might not even have a single meal with those spices for half a month. Good things mustn't be enjoyed every day for every meal. It would be a lot better to have one meal with the spices once in a long while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Tiger wanted to kowtow to Qing Shui on the spot but was stopped. "Big Tiger, I'm older than you. If you don't mind, you can call me Elder Brother."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Brother Qing, thank you." Big Tiger was elated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Work hard to learn things here. I'll look for some physicians to work here at the Imperial Cuisine Hall and they'll take time to teach you stuff. I'll also teach you some things. Make sure to learn them well." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Brother Qing, I'm slow on the uptake and I'm worried that I won't be able to learn them." Big Tiger rubbed his head and said straightforwardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You aren't any slower than others. Put in an effort in learning. Don't you wish to do well in life, get married, and have kids? Doesn't your mother want to see you have your own family?" Qing Shui denied his pessimism.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I want to do well in life. I also want to get married and have kids. But I'm afraid my mother won't have that much time to see that day." Big Tiger said with tears in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I can guarantee that your mother will definitely be able to see it. She'll also be able to see your children grow up and settle down with their jobs and families. I'm a physician. Trust me." Qing Shui assured and pat Big Tiger's shoulder.&nbsp;</span></p>
