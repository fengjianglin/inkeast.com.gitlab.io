 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After conversing for a while, Qing Shui looked at the sky and smiled, “I will go make something to eat. Why don’t you have a meal here instead?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was only trying to be polite since it was lunchtime after all. Of course, he was still used to the habit from his past life and could not miss three meals per day. Quite a contrast to the martial cultivators in the World of Nine Continents, they only had a meal once per day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because three meals were basically the same as one meal, he could go on without eating for dozens of days straight. Even so, one meal per day could guarantee a slight increase in his power, just like how he could gain more energy by eating more in his past life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, a meal per day could also ensure the cultivation of his vital organs. Just like sleeping, it could be regarded as a type of maintenance over one’s mental condition. Even a martial cultivator had to ensure that they had no less than an hour of sleep every single day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, it wasn’t an absolute rule. One could delay their sleep for the meantime should something happen unexpectedly. However, in most cases, one would have to sleep for a while, even a nap would suffice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought that the woman would excuse herself after he had said that. &nbsp;Regardless of the situation, he felt that she would never stay for a meal. Thus, he had only suggested it out of politeness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright then. After we’re done eating, I will bring you to the Phoenix God Organization for a tour.” replied the woman after considering his suggestion for a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was shocked. He then quickly curled a smile on his lips and nodded, “Alright. Wait for a moment, I will go make the preparations in a jiffy. Come inside and rest in the meantime.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This place was Qing Shui’s solitary courtyard. In normal days, Qing Shui would use this place to cultivate in peace, which was why the members of the Qing Clan would not come here to disturb him even if he had nothing to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if Qing Shui stayed at this place for several days, no one would come here to disturb him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui called Yehuang Guwu over to the courtyard. In any case, Yehuang Guwu was also a member of the Phoenix God Organization.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Gu`er, I have also joined the Phoenix God Organization.” Qing Shui revealed the news to Yehuang Guwu as they headed toward a small courtyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yehuang Guwu was surprised and looked at Qing Shui in disbelief. Qing Shui, on the other hand, took out the fine gold token with the word ‘guest’ inscribed on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah, you’ve really joined the Phoenix God Organization.” Yehuang Guwu seemed quite excited as she gazed at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The master of the Phoenix God Organization came and invited me to join the organization. However, she gave me absolute freedom. Even if the organization goes down in flame, I am allowed to stand aside and do nothing.” Qing Shui said, softly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah, how can there be such a foolish person? Oh, I understand now.” Yehuang Guwu suddenly realized something as she continued to look at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Understand what?” Qing Shui looked back at her with a grin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She is indeed a wise person who has definitely noticed how you really behaved. It’s fine as long as she’s able to make you join. She has certainly seen through you as a person who will not stand aside and do nothing in times of crisis.” Yehuang Guwu said as she came to realize the situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a swift manner, both of them managed to arrive in a small courtyard. Yehuang Guwu was even more startled than Qing Shui when she saw that woman. The woman was also stunned when she saw Yehuang Guwu but she quickly said in a calm voice, “You are also a member of the Phoenix God Organization.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How did you know?” Yehuang Guwu asked, still startled. Ever since she first joined the organization, she had never set her foot to that place before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Anyone who joins the Phoenix God Organization will have a portrait of their own. I have seen your portrait.” The woman replied, unhurriedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yehuang Guwu took out an Elder Token to show that she was a member of the Phoenix God Organization.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your power has grown rapidly. When you joined the Phoenix God Organization in the beginning, your powers weren’t strong enough. I remember this because you are a beautiful woman. Are you his woman?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman asked, softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, Yehuang Guwu’s power had grown too quick. At the current state, her powers were said to be amongst the top of the Phoenix God Organization.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s right. What should I call you? Are we well-matched together?” Yehuang Guwu smiled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am Shen Huang. Both of you are suited to each other, but you might be a bit unfortunate because of that.” The woman replied in a serious tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unexpectedly, Yehuang Guwu laughed at the response, “I see, you are quite humorous too!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was speechless. What kind of humor was this? However, he wasn’t angry at all. Instead, he said, “You two should talk for now. I will go make something for us to eat. It’ll be quick.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wanted to cook because he knew he would be able to make it quickly, and absolutely swift at that. After he said that, he quickly went into the kitchen without caring about the shocked expression on the woman’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman was shocked that such a powerful man like him would take the role of making a meal. In this world, as long as a man was in possession of a few riches or power, he would not go to the kitchen to cook something as it would be regarded as an act of incompetence. Moreover, it was the myth that a man would bring bad luck to himself should he do any sorts of kitchen work.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, Qing Shui did not believe in any of that. There was actually a lot of thing in the World of the Nine Continents that he did not believe in. Even so, in most families, men were considered breadwinners and women were homemakers, especially in an ordinary household as those with remarkable status would always have someone making meals for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was very quick in his cooking. In just a few minutes, he was able to cook up three vegetarian dishes, two meat dishes, two small bowls of soup, one bowl of fish soup, and one set of caudle, which was a type of soup that consisted of medicinal diet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman was also shocked when Qing Shui placed the dishes on the table in the room. To be honest, she was already flabbergasted even before the dishes were served because of the delightfully delicious aroma in the air. She had never smelled such an exquisite aroma in her entire life before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was a pure-hearted person. Even in terms of her meal intake, she would always eat vegetables and fruits. Basically, she would never eat meat. This woman had no idea when she last had meat either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui proceeded to open two pots of Plum Blossom Wine after he had served the dishes. From the sense of this woman’s aura, he felt that she would take a liking to this Plum Blossom Wine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Sister Feng, try these. Qing Shui’s culinary skills are definitely the best in this world.” Yehuang Guwu beamed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was taken aback by her words. Big Sister Feng? They actually managed to get on good terms with each other after he left them alone for a while. Nevertheless, both of them seemed quite destined to meet each other. Their names even had the word ‘Feng’ (Phoenix) in it. It should be known that those with this character in their names were considered rare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang nodded upon the invitation to sample the dishes. Both ladies were sitting across Qing Shui as he poured three cups of Plum Blossom Wine. The aroma of the wine had once again caught the woman by surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Divine wines! In her opinion, this wasn’t considered wine but an Immortal’s Drink.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This man was truly magical. Shen Huang did not ask him anything despite her curiosity. Even if she was caught by surprise, it was only for a few moments. Almost instantly, she regained her composure and continued to eat after drinking a cup of wine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both ladies were quite graceful as they ate their food. Their gestures weren’t fabricated or over the top. Regardless whether it was during his past life or his current life, Qing Shui had seen a lot of pretentious people acting as if they were nobles. In actuality, those people were very bad at it. Thus, they would be better off without a facade and should just act as natural as they could.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These two ladies, however, were different than those people. Their gestures were born and stemmed from their bones. Watching them eat could be a type of entertainment too.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang did not eat much before she stopped eating. Her action caused Qing Shui to harbor an admiration for this woman’s self-control. The woman lifted up her head and said to Qing Shui, “This is the best thing I’ve ever eaten.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you for the praise!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is not a praise, it’s a fact.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the best praise I’ve received. I am proud of it.” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang stopped talking after that. After a while, she began to speak, “Guwu, you should come too. You are the second chief of the Phoenix God Organization right now. You still have to go regardless.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yehuang Guwu nodded at her explanation and said, “Alright!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Deputy Seat was a sort of a weird way to address someone. In this world, it had the concept of being in the second place. Shen Huang should be in the Divine Seat, which would mean that she was in control of the organization. Deputy Seat was considered the highest position within the organization with the exception of Shen Huang.</span></p>
