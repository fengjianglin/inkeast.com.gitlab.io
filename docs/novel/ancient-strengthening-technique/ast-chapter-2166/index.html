 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time could prove everything. Within the timespan of just a few months, though unclear whether it had to do with the disappearance of Tantai Lingyan, Qing Shui had managed to earn the trust of the people of Divine Palace with what he was capable of and his attitude to take responsibilities and show empathy towards others. However, due to the disappearance of Tantai Lingyan, it was undeniable that the people of Divine Palace would have doubts on Qing Shui. But as time passed, the doubtfulness in their hearts was replaced by a sense of trust. Meanwhile, the topics regarding Tantai Lingyan had also slowly begun to calm down. There were things which one could never comprehend unless they witnessed it themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Certainly, it was not a matter of whether they were true or not. The main problem lied within the essence of the question itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Battle God Inheritor wouldn’t necessarily slaughter any Demon Lord Inheritors who came within their sights. This would only happen if the Demon Lord they encountered was evil and could potentially cause harm to others. Thinking about it from an honest perspective, both the Battle Gods and Demon Lords shared a mutual relationship with each other. Up to a certain extent, the existence of the former would represent the existence of the latter. This was what had been maintaining the balance of Heavenly Law.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The world was formed of many elements, male, female, good people, evil people, people who did good deeds, and people who held malicious intents towards others. Among all these people, only those that shared opposing relationships with each other would indirectly help each other grow. This was similar to the laws of the food chain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During this time, Qing Shui had also managed to save 2 Battle Gods from falling into their demise, Among those two, one was the Tiger Knife Battle God. Back then, when Qing Shui had been accused and doubted by the others, he had never intended to argue with them about it. In fact, he didn’t feel the need to. So long as he was innocent, it would be proven with time. With all of that being said, with the current realm Qing Shui had attained, none of these would matter as much to him anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without himself noticing, Qing Shui had been in the Divine Palace for a long period of time. By now, he had significantly boosted his strength. Thus, he felt that it would be a great idea to get Yin Tong and the others to join him to further strengthen the Divine Palace. Meanwhile, they would also get to enjoy the resources available inside the palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It didn’t take long for Qing Shui to go back and forth between these places. Thus, he made up his mind to go back. For the time being, the situation here could be said to have stabilized. By now, Zhang Yue was also already able to stand up on his own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will be heading out. Other than helping the patients diagnose their diseases, you mustn’t neglect studying more advanced medical expertise.” About this disciple of his, Qing Shui had no complaints about him. He was only a tad inferior to Qing Ci.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master, I will do as you say. Have a safe journey!” Zhang Yue said, feeling reluctant to part ways with Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui greeted the Senior Golden Battle God and the others. Without having to say, he also greeted Beihuang Fan and told her to stop by the Imperial Cuisine Hall more often. Before she left, he gave her a lot of ingredients. However, this woman was a vegetarian, though not an extreme one. She just happened to eat meat less often. At most, she would only consume seafood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Five Elements Divine Flag!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui arrived in Dazang City. Following on, he returned to Divine Cave situated in the Northern Ice Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was because he was ready to visit the girls in the North Sea. Given that Muyun Qingge was the Sun Shooting Battle God, it was unclear whether she would head off to the Divine Palace, thus, Qing Shui was here to confirm it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Tong, Lan Lingfeng, and the others, on the other hand, headed off to Linhai City. Considering how long it had been since they left home, they felt it necessary to check things out with their family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Tong and Ling Fei also went to the Lan Clan along with the Barbaric King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Tong, Lan Lingfeng had stayed in this Imperial Cuisine Hall for a long time. Naturally, they would want to visit Yu Niang and Tian Yi. Today, Qing Shui was on a separate journey with them. He told them to wait for him at the hall and after a while, he would go and look for them himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">North Sea!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As of now, the Sunset Sea King Palace was already inside the North Sea. It had been forever since he last came here. With Yiye Jiange and Qing Hanye’s current strength, they were strong enough to dominate an area. Thus, there was nothing much which he should worry about. Moreover, he had also made a request to the Great Confucian Empire to help look after them for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man of the Xia Clan possessed decent strength. The sole problem was that the Great Confucian Empire had yet to spread their power to the North Sea. If anything was to happen, they would most like be unable to provide major aids. Alternatively, he might be able to let the people of Sunset Sea King Palace hide inside the Great Confucian Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, Qing Shui was also only suggesting such an idea. He felt that it would make him feel more secure if he proposed it. If Sunset Sea King Palace decided not to move towards the deeper part of the sea, with their current strength, almost no forces around the area would have been able to shake the position of the palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Deep down, Qing Shui was so homesick that he wished that he could have arrived at the Sunset Sea King Palace right at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Qing Shui’s speed, it didn’t take him that long to arrive at Sunset Sea King Palace. He let out a sigh of relief upon seeing the Sunset Sea King Palace. It looked just the same as before. From here, he could tell that nothing really major had occurred during his absence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first thing, which came into his sight when he walked to the entrance, was a little brat. The brat looked just like a sculpture of art. Its beauty could be compared to that of a little girl, but yet Qing Shui was able to tell that he was a boy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Xiu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The brat seemed surprised to see Qing Shui. Having been separated for so long, he could no longer recognize Qing Shui. Though it might seem to have been forever since Qing Shui visited this place, actually, only two years had passed. By now, Qing Xiu was already 3 years old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xiu`Er!” At this moment, an unusually graceful voice came through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui moved his sight onto the woman approaching him. Coincidentally, the woman happened to be looking right back at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As usual, the woman still wore a snow-white plain garment. Her graceful figure was untainted by even a speck of dust. The gentle and refined temperament emitting from her was enough to cause a person to be obsessed with her. All along, she had always remained quiet, making people think that the word “angry” wasn’t in her dictionary. Her beauty was beyond comprehension and unmatched in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She looked surprised when she saw Qing Shui. But soon, her expression was replaced by a happy smile. The smile on her face made her look so beautiful to the point that it could drive a person nuts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mother!” Qing Xiu happily ran to Yiye Jiange as he saw her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange bent down to carry the little brat. Her eyes were filled with happiness which couldn’t be described in words. Initially, Qing Shui had also planned to hug the little brat, but he never expected that someone would interrupt him and did it in his place instead. Nevertheless, he still approached them happily and embraced them tightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You came!” Yiye Jiange smiled as she let out her hand to rub Qing Shui’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Jiange, I have missed you.” As Qing Shui moved forward to hug Yiye Jiange, he felt a kind of satisfaction which was beyond description.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xiu`Er, call daddy.” Yiye Jiange talked to Qing Xiu.</span></p>

Instead, he continued to bury his head into Yiye Jiange’s brace.</span></p>

The last time when he was here, Qing Xiu would still cling onto him. It seemed that now, a wall had built up between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui immediately took out some food and toys in an attempt to change the impression which the little brat had of him.</span></p>

He proceeded to hug each of them. Muyun Qingge in particular, rushed towards Qing Shui to hug him.</span></p>

The brat had a masculine figure, unlike Qing Hanye, whose figure leaned more towards being gentle and reserved. From his physique, Qing Shui could already sense the tremendous power within him. If he wasn’t mistaken, the brat would definitely be a genius among geniuses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, this child was born from the result of the fusion between Nine Ying and Nine Yang Bodies.</span></p>

This included talking about the Divine Palace. However, when saying about who he would bring along with him, he only mentioned Yin Tong and the others, with the exception of Muyun Qingge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, we have made all preparations to move the Sunset Sea King Palace closer to the deeper part of the North Sea. That place is actually very close to the area which you mentioned. However, one of them is on land, whereas the other one is inside the ocean.” At this moment, Qing Hanye spoke up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an indirect sense, the Dragonwolf Palace and Sunset Sea King Palace could be said to have merged into one, even though no agreements had been made between both parties.</span></p>

By then, Just change your title to the Sea King Palace and form an alliance with the Divine Palace.”</span></p>

At this moment, Muyun Qingge asked, “Can I stay in the Sea King Palace once I joined the Divine Palace?”</span></p>
