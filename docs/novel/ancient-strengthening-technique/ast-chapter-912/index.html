 <p><strong>AST 912 - Killing Start, Reversal of Qiankun</strong></p>
 <p>Killing weapon!</p>
 <p>Poison weapon!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out the extremely toxic Poison Dragon Dagger. Its surface had a layer of pitch black fog which was like ink. It was so shiny that it would make one shudder.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that he needed to end this battle quickly, and he must swiftly kill off a few of them. Otherwise, this would be a very tough fight. Most importantly, his opponents knew about formations.</p>
 <p>When Tianyu Liangyi saw the Poison Dragon Dagger in Qing Shui's hand, he was also astonished. From afar, he could sense how terrifying the poison was and even he had no confidence to go up against its toxic nature.</p>
 <p>The reason why Qing Shui took it out so early was so that he could apply mental pressure on his opponents, causing them to be on their guards and reveal all their hidden cards.</p>
 <p>Of course, this was not Qing Shui's only card.</p>
 <p>"Lang Yun, lead a group into the Formation Destroyer!" Tianyu Liangyi waved his hand and commanded.</p>
 <p>Immediately, an old man behind him led a team and dashed in. Another Formation Flag appeared in Qing Shui's hand and he pierced it into the eye of the formation right before him.</p>
 <p>After the group entered the formation, they were first at a loss and then started to move around in circles. Qing Shui didn't find this surprising. These people wouldn't be able to get out of the trap in a while.</p>
 <p>"Eldest Brother, 2nd Brother, the two of you should lead people to get rid of them." Qing Shui said softly. Although this was a battlefield, they were very serious. Qing Shui's expression was very grim.</p>
 <p>"Alright!"</p>
 <p>Dong Yan and Sun Yan led over 30 people and entered the Five Elements Minor Formation. The two of them each led over ten people, but at their level, this was the maximum number of people they could work with. If there were too many people, they wouldn't be able to coordinate well and the enemies would be able to break through them very easily.</p>
 <p>The positioning of the Five Elements Minor Formation was a circle, with the eye of the formation in the center. Dong Yan and Sun Yan stood in the center while the others formed a circle around them. When they were up against the enemies, they would always looked toward their front.</p>
 <p>Even if they were to be in deep trouble, they would be able to hang on for a short period of time or even get out of the fix.</p>
 <p>Duality Steps!</p>
 <p>The two teams performed the Duality Steps in the formation and while they appeared to be slightly clumsy, they were able to pull it off. After all, these people were still quite strong and their learning curve was better than ordinary people.</p>
 <p>The two teams dashed toward the opponents like two snakes, and when both parties came into contact, they quickly got into their formations.</p>
 <p>To the people outside, they were moving at the speed of snails and it was hard to tell what on earth they were doing. Only the people inside knew how dangerous the situation was, with the place filled with killing intent.</p>
 <p>Tianyu Liangyi was a very cautious person and he first sent out one team into the formation as a scout to check out its prowess. It would be even better if they were able to find out the method to break the formation.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also looked at the formation seriously. This first battle was very important and they couldn't afford to lose. They must keep the opponent's team in the formation, wiping them out.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't wish to let Mu Qing and the other 20 over people take action. However, he couldn't send the weakest teams either, and thus he let Dong Yan and Sun Yan to take action.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could clearly sense everything that was happening within the formation.</p>
 <p>The location they were fighting in was the sea, and they were all above the water's surface. However, tremendous gushing waves kept appearing in the surroundings and there would be an occasional appearance of a huge sea snake which would swallow one of them up.</p>
 <p>Of course, those who were swallowed were from the Sky Prison Sect.</p>
 <p>Dong Yan, Sun Yan, and the others knew the way to dodge such ‘semi-real’ things. The best way to dodge them would be to use the Duality Steps. The Duality Steps was also known as the Yin Yang Steps, and under this situation, everyone was basically half a step away from hell.</p>
 <p>If they weren't careful, they would be eternally doomed. They could dodge with the Duality Steps. Using the Duality Steps was like applying the right remedy to a disease and they were able to dodge even when they weren't fluent with the use of it yet. However, it would be different for those who didn't grasp the knacks of it.</p>
 <p>This was the danger of the formation's Killing Gate. After all, in terms of sheer numbers, they were far a match for the Sky Prison Sect and thus they would need to tap on the dangers within the formation.</p>
 <p>Otherwise, Qing Shui wouldn't have the confidence to let the 30 of them go against over 80 people.</p>
 <p>Sky Prison Sabre Formation!</p>
 <p>The people from the Sky Prison Sect quickly got into formation, standing in a curving arc before quickly dashing towards Dong Yan and Sun Yan.</p>
 <p>The people that Dong Yan and Sun Yan led formed an oval shape since they were not dealing with enemies who were coming in on them from all directions. They rapidly closed in on the people of the Sky Prison Sect.</p>
 <p>Both Dong Yan and Sun Yan stood in the center of the formation. Dong Yan's weapon was a scythe which Qing Shui had given to him. It had been left in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal for very long. The one which Qing Shui had given him was the Evil Dragon Tooth. The Psychotic Demon Scythe was still in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Sun Yan's weapon was a longsword which was as clear as the autumn water. It didn't look like an ordinary weapon either.</p>
 <p>Shield!</p>
 <p>The people from the Sky Prison Sect gathered to the front to put up their defenses, but Dong Yan and Sun Yan attacked ferociously like a venomous snake, killing two of them.</p>
 <p>Spin!</p>
 <p>The entire Five Elements Minor Formation started to spin. Although it was not fast, it immediately reflected the opponent's attacks, which left an indescribable feeling. Then, Dong Yan and Sun Yan attacked once again.</p>
 <p>Swoosh!</p>
 <p>A huge, towering wave gushed forth. Dong Yan and Sun Yan led their team to dodge it with ease. Such a situation was already normal to them in the practices they had been through.</p>
 <p>Seeing that their opponents were scattered from their formation by the towering wave, Dong Yan and Sun Yan didn't let this chance slip away from them. They once again dashed over while in the Five Elements Minor Formation, focusing their powers and killing people easily as if they were cutting up vegetables.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>From the outside, it was hard to see the actual situation within the formation. Only those who had a certain level of mastery in formations or cultivators who were extremely strong would be able to sense something. Otherwise, from the outside, it would only seem as if both parties were moving around in the formation.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, Dong Yan and Sun Yan led the 30 people and appeared once again before everyone. However, the rest of the people had all disappeared. The formation was still intact.</p>
 <p>The people who had came out were extremely agitated. After all, the ones whom they had killed were the people from the Sky Prison Sect who were in their formations. In the past, they would have never even dared to think of pulling off something like this, but to think that they had succeeded just now.</p>
 <p>In the past, formations were a legendary existence. None of them had expected to be able to create formations and kill their enemies one day.</p>
 <p>Tianyu Liangyi looked at the scene before him and frowned. He had not expected that this young man would be able to put up such a top notch formation. It seemed that he had to be the one to lead the team in.</p>
 <p>"Everyone enter the formation! Do not spread out, get into formation and advance! Everyone follow my lead!" After saying that, Tianyu Liangyi took the lead and dashed in. The other people didn't dare to have any delays either and all of them quickly followed after.</p>
 <p>Seeing that every single member of their opponents had entered the formation, Qing Shui frowned. He had planned on slowly reducing their numbers this way. However, it seemed like it was impossible.</p>
 <p>"Miss, I'll create an opening for you. You lead your men in and go for the kill." Looking at the formation, Qing Shui said to Mu Qing, not even turning his head.</p>
 <p>"Alright!"</p>
 <p>"As for the others, don't stay too far away from us. Act according to the circumstance. Coordinate well while following my commands. Don't panic. If the situation is grave, then enter the Killing Gate to get yourself out of the fix." Qing Shui said slowly before taking out a formation flag and threw it towards Tianyu Liangyi who was in the formation.</p>
 <p>It was because the formation flag there had been destroyed.</p>
 <p>"Miss, lead your team and wait at the Qian position. The others set up formation at the Gate of Illusion." Qing Shui gave it some thought and said before planting three formation flags at the Qian position.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then threw at least another ten formation flags into the formation, separating two of the teams. He then continued to replace the formation flags which had been destroyed.</p>
 <p>There were only the old men and Mu Fengyang left with Qing Shui. Mu Qian followed Mu Qing's team since he was most suited for the eye of the formation.</p>
 <p>"Sir, let's go in and kill!" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Alright!" The Mu Clan's old man appeared to be very calm, but at this moment, his eyes were very bright.</p>
 <p>Before they left, Qing Shui threw in the formation flag he was holding, hoping to stop the enemies for a longer time before he entered the formation together with the Mu Clan's old men.</p>
 <p>They appeared directly before Tianyu Liangyi and the others. Amidst his opponents' astonishment, the formation flag in Qing Shui's hand landed three meters before him. Suddenly, the Spiritual Qi in the formation went into havoc, as if the entire world had gone into a state of chaos.</p>
 <p>Reversal of Qiankun！</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and disappeared before the opponents' astonished gaze. At the same time, the Sky Prison Sect's 2nd Sovereign and a team of people in black formation attire also disappeared.</p>
 <p>"Not good! 2nd Brother is in danger! Everyone, follow me!" Tianyu Liangyi's countenance finally changed. It was only now that he realized how terrifying the young man was.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and the old men from the Mu Clan appeared in another location together with Sky Prison Sect's 2nd Sovereign and a team of about 100 people in the Sky Prison Sabre Formation.</p>
 <p>Their opponents were over ten times more in numbers compared to Qing Shui's side. However, the people from the Sky Prison Sect had gone pale. Even the countenance of the 2nd Sovereign, who was wearing a green attire, had also turned slightly pale.</p>
 <p>"Into formation!" The old man wearing green bellowed out to the people behind him and entered the formation as well. He was slightly anxious since the young man was too eerie. Furthermore, Old man Mu was there as well.</p>
 <p>He didn't have the confidence to take on Old man Mu alone, and might even have some concerns since Old man Mu was a Demon Refiner.</p>
 <p>The old man in green stood in the eye of the formation and the other 100 of them were like a single entity. Qing Shui had initially planned on using the Mighty Elephant Stomp to break their formation, but it was now useless.</p>
 <p>"Young man, let me have a go. I wonder if this works against formations."</p>
 <p>Mu Clan's old man said, sending out some powder before saying, "Stop your breath!"</p>
 <p>The people opposite smelled a faint acidic scent and tried to stop the powder, but it was already too late.</p>
 <p>"Ah, I can't move my arm!"</p>
 <p>"The same for my leg!"</p>
 <p>"..."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. It seemed that this was a type of powder from refining demon. He had wanted to use the Frosted Iron Balls tempered with poison to break the enemy's formation with a Twin Dragon Explosion. Although such a formation was very powerful, it was defenseless against attacks like poison powder.</p>
 <p>It could be said to be a great flaw.</p>
 <p>In a short instant, the Sky Prison Sabre Formation was broken through. However, that old man in green was fine. It was just that right now, while glaring at Mu Clan's old man, he was now holding onto a huge sabre that was like an anti-cavalry sabre that was used to slice off the legs of horses.</p>
