 <p><strong>Chapter 523 Punishment.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 523 - Punishment</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">‘Guardian’ was a passive ability, it automatically activated when receiving a strong attack. Although when under the status of ‘Guardian’, you were not able to attack anyone, it was at least the bane of users of ambush attacks or certain strange techniques.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just a plain shirt had taken Qing Shui half a month to make but it had been worth it. The Quad-color Rainbow Art of Forging had caused the attribute it bestowed to undergo a major increase, it also resulted in the attribute being changed. This was very useful to those who were strong but useless to regular people…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This caused Qing Shui to be confused, but after thinking for a while, a regular person couldn’t have good things either. Having good things would incur the envy of others, causing the person to get into trouble, maybe even causing his death.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When time was almost up, Qing Shui left the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. It was in the middle of the night outside. Qing Shui lay down on his bed, unable to fall asleep, his troubled heart could not calm down.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Chen was about to leave!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was also the issue of Huoyun Liu-Li finding out about the deed between Canghai Mingyue and himself, this matter had caused Qing Shui much anxiety. If she had not known about it, it would have been better. However, it was not that Qing Shui was afraid of her knowing, but now the nature of the problem is different.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If Qing Shui was Huoyun Liu-Li, he would have definitely been very disappointed. It was a kind of mental state, Qing Shui could understand it very well, it would explain why she had changed so much these few days.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Shui observed that she seemed to have let it go, she was a very proud woman. She behaved like this because she liked him, and will probably feel that way only to him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If she was still like who she was before, she might feel that she was unwanted, cheap goods left on the shelf…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui got up, left the room and headed to Huoyun Liu-Li’s room. He had not known earlier if he could just stand still there, but now he found that he could not. This led Qing Shui to realize how important Huoyun Liu-Li was in his heart.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the door, the door that she said she would keep open for him, it was tightly locked. When Qing Shui gave it a gentle push, he found that it was indeed locked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not know that if she’d locked it in the past, but it was locked now. Qing Shui felt nervous in his heart, all the memories he’d had of Huoyun Liu-Li flashed through his mind.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Knock knock knock!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gently knocked on the door!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The door was actually opened very quickly. The one who had opened the door was Huoyun Liu-Li, she was in her nightgown, her hazy sleepy eyes had a kind of languid splendor and elegance.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She was startled when she saw Qing Shui, but she still smiled and said, “It is already so late, why are you here?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’m here to see if you left the door open for me,” Qing Shui did his best to keep the atmosphere lighted hearted.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It is already very late, stop messing around, is there anything you need?” Huoyun Liu-Li’s eyebrows dropped down.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s heart was in pain when he saw Huoyun Liu-Li’s appearance. He was distressed and he could feel his chest tighten, but Qing Shui knew that this women loved him, thus Qing Shui would not second guess anything else.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ah!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui hugged Huoyou Liu-Li in a flash and closed the doors.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, release me!” Huoyun Liu-Li cried out in fear before calming down.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’m not letting go!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui said that, he kissed those tiny lips. He picked up her sexy body and headed towards the violet bed. With one hand, he loosened the buttons on her shirt and he kissed her face… her lips… her nose… her neck… violently.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If you want it, I’ll give it to you, but in the future, we will have nothing to do with each other anymore,” Huoyun Liu-Li said quietly, her tranquil and calm tone caused Qing Shui to smile bitterly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You knew about it already?” Qing Shui asked in agony, despite knowing the answer already.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Do you feel that I am very cheap? That I have no sense of honor and shame, that I would shamelessly get involved with you…” Huoyun Liu-Li slowly said, but her tears were continuously falling like pearls on a necklace with a broken string.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt cold sweat appear on his forehead, “Liu-Li, it is my fault, I am stupid and I did not understand you. I did not know how to tell you that I love you, that I was actually coming for you that night but I went into the wrong room, so…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui believed that Canghai Mingyue knew that he’d came to the wrong room, he had even admitted it. Furthermore, he did truly love them, Now that things have gotten this far, Qing Shui could only admit to it all, this way it would be more persuasive.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stood at the bedside, embracing an extraordinarily beautiful woman, but her face was full of tears. Her mouth was tightly shut as she looked at Qing Shui without saying a word.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“My dear lady, I was wrong, say the word, what can I do so that you won’t be angry at me any longer…” Qing Shui looked at this woman in agony, the woman who was very important to him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I want to punish you!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Just say it, as long as I can do it, I definitely will do it,” Qing Shui quickly said, he became happier upon the turn of events.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Cuddle with me tonight, but you are not to do anything. If you do anything to me tonight, I will leave you forever,” Huoyun Liu-Li bit her lips as she said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui initially thought that it would be some impossible task, wasn’t it just cuddling a beauty without being able to do anything? He hurriedly agreed and then place her on the bed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Help me remove my clothes…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was startled when he’d heard Huoyun Liu-Li’s words, her body heating up. After observing for a while, he’d noticed that she was biting her lips, she did not seem like she was joking.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He slowly peeled off her clothing, leaving only her undergarments, her exposed skin was sparkling and translucent. It was exquisite, she was fair beyond belief, giving off an enchanting glow.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Her figure was very similar to Canghai Mingyue, they both had perfect and gentle curvatures. Their chests were not massive, but had a perfect bamboo shoot shape to it, they were plump and perky, causing anyone who saw them to drool.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She had a smooth belly and a tight waist, there was no trace of any excess flesh. Her perfectly rounded perky butt was accentuated by her panties, creating a wonderful scene.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Her perfectly straight, long, well-proportioned, sexy legs were snow white, ending with ten toes the size of beans, looking very dainty and sexy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Huoyun Liu-Li pushed Qing Shui onto the bed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui wanted to take action, even his body reacted, but Huoyun Liu-Li words caused him to stop. He knew that this was her way of punishing him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You are not to move, regardless of what I do.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She undid Qing Shui clothes with her jade-like hands, when she removed his clothes there were the sound of clothes rustling. Qing Shui felt the blood rush up his head, it was a pity that all he could do was to remind himself not to do anything.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Very soon, Qing Shui was only left with his underpants, then Huoyun Liu-Li buried herself in Qing Shui’s embrace, there was a lot of skin contact, causing Qing Shui to feel tortured while being aroused.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“We will be sleeping like that, till morning!” Huoyun Liu-Li buried herself deeper in Qing Shui’s embrace and closed her eyes, soon there were sounds of breathing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“She fell asleep just like that? How am I going to sleep? Am I that harmless?” Qing Shui bitterly looked at the extraordinary beauty that he cannot touch.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui embraced her waist and thought of a story; a man and a woman were on the same bed, the women drew a line in the middle of the bed, saying if he crossed that line, then he was a beast.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The man did not want to be a beast, and thus just lied there without moving, when it was morning, the woman told the man that he was worse than a beast.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui wanted to be a beast, but he did not dare to take the risk. After all, when Qing Shui thought about the situation in her shoes, she would be very very hurt, even suspecting whether if he liked her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not dare to move her, he just let her lie on top of him. Their skin contact caused Qing Shui’s to feel hot. Qing Shui was puzzled, did she not feel panicked at all? Could she be faking sleep…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly moved his hands down her waist, he observed her peaceful expression then stopped. Instead, he only lightly kissed her forehead.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui just laid like that for 4 hours, immersing himself into his sea of consciousness, he shut his eyes. If anyone saw him, they would think that he was sleeping.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Looking at the many supplementary techniques in his sea of consciousness, Qing Shui just revised through them since he had nothing to do. The Deer Cantering had already long reached the Great Perfection Stage and had been integrated into the Cloudmist Steps.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Tiger Form and Bear Form were also in the Great Perfection Stage. During these long periods of time, he had been slowly improving, just that the pace was akin to that of the snails.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This most important part of the Ape Form was the Back Connecting Fist. It was a pity that Qing Shui was stuck in the peak of the small success stage, he was just a short distance away from the large success stage.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Crane Form was a footwork technique as well, it had also been integrated into the Cloudmist Steps.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Looking at these few forms, Qing Shui thought of a lot of things. The most important thing were the murals such as Tiger's Mount, The White Crane Spread it’s Wings, as well as those furnitures.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now, he had already cultivated till the Elephant form, but Qing Shui knew that the later Dragon Form, Pheonix Form, Roc Form would take years to cultivate. With just the Elephant form alone, Qing Shui did not know how long it would take to cultivate it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had only grasped the Diamond Qi and the Mighty Elephant Stomp to the Large Success Stage. To reach the Great Perfection Stage, Qing Shui felt that the conditions would be extremely harsh, furthermore, there was still more to learn about the Elephant form.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Within his sea of consciousness, Qing Shui looked at the drawing of the giant elephants again. What was the level of strength of these huge golden elephants? Qing Shui did not know, he was sure that it was at the Martial Saint level at the very least.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I wonder when the Diamond Gigantic Elephant will break through again,” Qing Shui eagerly thought. If he’d had a Martial Saint Level demonic beast to battle for him, it would be very strong.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt some movements in his embrace. Knowing that Huoyun Liu-Li was waking up, Qing Shui left his sea of consciousness and opened his eyes, looking at Huoyun Liu-Li who was lying on him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that a woman was the prettiest the moment when she’d just woken up, her hair slightly messy and her eyes sleepy. Most importantly was that she was laying on a bed…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Huoyun Liu-Li noticed that Qing Shui had woken up, she smiled, her sexy charm caused Qing Shui to shiver!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“My lady, can you forgive me now!” Qing Shui hugged her waist as he said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You still want me to forgive you after you taken advantage of me?” Huoyun Liu-Li blinked her sexy lashes at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stared wordlessly at this charming women, he knew that she was no longer angry, he had achieved his goal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Then come over to my room tonight and take advantage of me”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“In your dreams, now let go of me, I want to get out of bed. It would be bad if anyone sees you walking out of my room.” Huoyun Liu-Li laughed as she used her hands to push Qing Shui’s chest.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Give me a kiss and I will go!” Qing Shui thinking that there was no time to do anything anyway.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li got distracted for a while, her face flushed red, then she closed her eyes and kissed Qing Shui’s cheek.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“So this girl was actually this shy!”</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Just a plain shirt had taken Qing Shui half a month to make but it had been worth it. The Quad-color Rainbow Art of Forging had caused the attribute it bestowed to undergo a major increase, it also resulted in the attribute being changed. This was very useful to those who were strong but useless to regular people…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This caused Qing Shui to be confused, but after thinking for a while, a regular person couldn’t have good things either. Having good things would incur the envy of others, causing the person to get into trouble, maybe even causing his death.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When time was almost up, Qing Shui left the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. It was in the middle of the night outside. Qing Shui lay down on his bed, unable to fall asleep, his troubled heart could not calm down.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Di Chen was about to leave!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was also the issue of Huoyun Liu-Li finding out about the deed between Canghai Mingyue and himself, this matter had caused Qing Shui much anxiety. If she had not known about it, it would have been better. However, it was not that Qing Shui was afraid of her knowing, but now the nature of the problem is different.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If Qing Shui was Huoyun Liu-Li, he would have definitely been very disappointed. It was a kind of mental state, Qing Shui could understand it very well, it would explain why she had changed so much these few days.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although Qing Shui observed that she seemed to have let it go, she was a very proud woman. She behaved like this because she liked him, and will probably feel that way only to him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If she was still like who she was before, she might feel that she was unwanted, cheap goods left on the shelf…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui got up, left the room and headed to Huoyun Liu-Li’s room. He had not known earlier if he could just stand still there, but now he found that he could not. This led Qing Shui to realize how important Huoyun Liu-Li was in his heart.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the door, the door that she said she would keep open for him, it was tightly locked. When Qing Shui gave it a gentle push, he found that it was indeed locked.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not know that if she’d locked it in the past, but it was locked now. Qing Shui felt nervous in his heart, all the memories he’d had of Huoyun Liu-Li flashed through his mind.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Knock knock knock!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gently knocked on the door!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The door was actually opened very quickly. The one who had opened the door was Huoyun Liu-Li, she was in her nightgown, her hazy sleepy eyes had a kind of languid splendor and elegance.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She was startled when she saw Qing Shui, but she still smiled and said, “It is already so late, why are you here?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’m here to see if you left the door open for me,” Qing Shui did his best to keep the atmosphere lighted hearted.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It is already very late, stop messing around, is there anything you need?” Huoyun Liu-Li’s eyebrows dropped down.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s heart was in pain when he saw Huoyun Liu-Li’s appearance. He was distressed and he could feel his chest tighten, but Qing Shui knew that this women loved him, thus Qing Shui would not second guess anything else.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ah!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui hugged Huoyou Liu-Li in a flash and closed the doors.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, release me!” Huoyun Liu-Li cried out in fear before calming down.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’m not letting go!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui said that, he kissed those tiny lips. He picked up her sexy body and headed towards the violet bed. With one hand, he loosened the buttons on her shirt and he kissed her face… her lips… her nose… her neck… violently.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“If you want it, I’ll give it to you, but in the future, we will have nothing to do with each other anymore,” Huoyun Liu-Li said quietly, her tranquil and calm tone caused Qing Shui to smile bitterly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You knew about it already?” Qing Shui asked in agony, despite knowing the answer already.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Do you feel that I am very cheap? That I have no sense of honor and shame, that I would shamelessly get involved with you…” Huoyun Liu-Li slowly said, but her tears were continuously falling like pearls on a necklace with a broken string.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt cold sweat appear on his forehead, “Liu-Li, it is my fault, I am stupid and I did not understand you. I did not know how to tell you that I love you, that I was actually coming for you that night but I went into the wrong room, so…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui believed that Canghai Mingyue knew that he’d came to the wrong room, he had even admitted it. Furthermore, he did truly love them, Now that things have gotten this far, Qing Shui could only admit to it all, this way it would be more persuasive.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stood at the bedside, embracing an extraordinarily beautiful woman, but her face was full of tears. Her mouth was tightly shut as she looked at Qing Shui without saying a word.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“My dear lady, I was wrong, say the word, what can I do so that you won’t be angry at me any longer…” Qing Shui looked at this woman in agony, the woman who was very important to him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I want to punish you!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Just say it, as long as I can do it, I definitely will do it,” Qing Shui quickly said, he became happier upon the turn of events.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Cuddle with me tonight, but you are not to do anything. If you do anything to me tonight, I will leave you forever,” Huoyun Liu-Li bit her lips as she said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui initially thought that it would be some impossible task, wasn’t it just cuddling a beauty without being able to do anything? He hurriedly agreed and then place her on the bed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Help me remove my clothes…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was startled when he’d heard Huoyun Liu-Li’s words, her body heating up. After observing for a while, he’d noticed that she was biting her lips, she did not seem like she was joking.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He slowly peeled off her clothing, leaving only her undergarments, her exposed skin was sparkling and translucent. It was exquisite, she was fair beyond belief, giving off an enchanting glow.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Her figure was very similar to Canghai Mingyue, they both had perfect and gentle curvatures. Their chests were not massive, but had a perfect bamboo shoot shape to it, they were plump and perky, causing anyone who saw them to drool.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She had a smooth belly and a tight waist, there was no trace of any excess flesh. Her perfectly rounded perky butt was accentuated by her panties, creating a wonderful scene.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Her perfectly straight, long, well-proportioned, sexy legs were snow white, ending with ten toes the size of beans, looking very dainty and sexy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, Huoyun Liu-Li pushed Qing Shui onto the bed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui wanted to take action, even his body reacted, but Huoyun Liu-Li words caused him to stop. He knew that this was her way of punishing him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You are not to move, regardless of what I do.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She undid Qing Shui clothes with her jade-like hands, when she removed his clothes there were the sound of clothes rustling. Qing Shui felt the blood rush up his head, it was a pity that all he could do was to remind himself not to do anything.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Very soon, Qing Shui was only left with his underpants, then Huoyun Liu-Li buried herself in Qing Shui’s embrace, there was a lot of skin contact, causing Qing Shui to feel tortured while being aroused.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“We will be sleeping like that, till morning!” Huoyun Liu-Li buried herself deeper in Qing Shui’s embrace and closed her eyes, soon there were sounds of breathing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“She fell asleep just like that? How am I going to sleep? Am I that harmless?” Qing Shui bitterly looked at the extraordinary beauty that he cannot touch.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui embraced her waist and thought of a story; a man and a woman were on the same bed, the women drew a line in the middle of the bed, saying if he crossed that line, then he was a beast.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The man did not want to be a beast, and thus just lied there without moving, when it was morning, the woman told the man that he was worse than a beast.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui wanted to be a beast, but he did not dare to take the risk. After all, when Qing Shui thought about the situation in her shoes, she would be very very hurt, even suspecting whether if he liked her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not dare to move her, he just let her lie on top of him. Their skin contact caused Qing Shui’s to feel hot. Qing Shui was puzzled, did she not feel panicked at all? Could she be faking sleep…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly moved his hands down her waist, he observed her peaceful expression then stopped. Instead, he only lightly kissed her forehead.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui just laid like that for 4 hours, immersing himself into his sea of consciousness, he shut his eyes. If anyone saw him, they would think that he was sleeping.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Looking at the many supplementary techniques in his sea of consciousness, Qing Shui just revised through them since he had nothing to do. The Deer Cantering had already long reached the Great Perfection Stage and had been integrated into the Cloudmist Steps.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Tiger Form and Bear Form were also in the Great Perfection Stage. During these long periods of time, he had been slowly improving, just that the pace was akin to that of the snails.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This most important part of the Ape Form was the Back Connecting Fist. It was a pity that Qing Shui was stuck in the peak of the small success stage, he was just a short distance away from the large success stage.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Crane Form was a footwork technique as well, it had also been integrated into the Cloudmist Steps.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Looking at these few forms, Qing Shui thought of a lot of things. The most important thing were the murals such as Tiger's Mount, The White Crane Spread it’s Wings, as well as those furnitures.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now, he had already cultivated till the Elephant form, but Qing Shui knew that the later Dragon Form, Pheonix Form, Roc Form would take years to cultivate. With just the Elephant form alone, Qing Shui did not know how long it would take to cultivate it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had only grasped the Diamond Qi and the Mighty Elephant Stomp to the Large Success Stage. To reach the Great Perfection Stage, Qing Shui felt that the conditions would be extremely harsh, furthermore, there was still more to learn about the Elephant form.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Within his sea of consciousness, Qing Shui looked at the drawing of the giant elephants again. What was the level of strength of these huge golden elephants? Qing Shui did not know, he was sure that it was at the Martial Saint level at the very least.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I wonder when the Diamond Gigantic Elephant will break through again,” Qing Shui eagerly thought. If he’d had a Martial Saint Level demonic beast to battle for him, it would be very strong.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt some movements in his embrace. Knowing that Huoyun Liu-Li was waking up, Qing Shui left his sea of consciousness and opened his eyes, looking at Huoyun Liu-Li who was lying on him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that a woman was the prettiest the moment when she’d just woken up, her hair slightly messy and her eyes sleepy. Most importantly was that she was laying on a bed…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Huoyun Liu-Li noticed that Qing Shui had woken up, she smiled, her sexy charm caused Qing Shui to shiver!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“My lady, can you forgive me now!” Qing Shui hugged her waist as he said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You still want me to forgive you after you taken advantage of me?” Huoyun Liu-Li blinked her sexy lashes at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stared wordlessly at this charming women, he knew that she was no longer angry, he had achieved his goal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Then come over to my room tonight and take advantage of me”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“In your dreams, now let go of me, I want to get out of bed. It would be bad if anyone sees you walking out of my room.” Huoyun Liu-Li laughed as she used her hands to push Qing Shui’s chest.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Give me a kiss and I will go!” Qing Shui thinking that there was no time to do anything anyway.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li got distracted for a while, her face flushed red, then she closed her eyes and kissed Qing Shui’s cheek.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“So this girl was actually this shy!”</p>
