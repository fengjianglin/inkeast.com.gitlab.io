 <p><strong>AST 1433 - Battle God Statue, Charging Through the Formation</strong></p>
 <p>Regarding that man, Qing Shui had no recollection of him. If it was not because of his mother, that man would not be significant. In his previous life, he had parents that loved him, as well as an older brother and sister. Coming here, his mother was the most important to him. Afterwards, he got an older sister, his own women, and children.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, what are you thinking about?” Hua Rumei looked at Qing Shui who seemed like his soul had parted with him and thus, hurriedly woke him up. This sort of state was not a good thing.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head and smiled, “Nothing, I was just too into my thoughts.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui left his thoughts behind, any idea before meeting that man was not a certainty. If any forces took actions against the Demon Lord Palace, he would not mind wiping them out as long as he had the power.</p>
 <p>Everyone was spread out. Forces that had a good relationship with each other stayed together. Qing Shui and his group stopped a little bit away. Everyone wanted the treasures within the Divine Shrine, yet no one wanted to be the first one to dip their toes into the water.</p>
 <p>However, there would always be someone who would try. At this very moment, a silhouette had rushed into the fray. Many watched as the silhouette rushed up directly to the giant divine statue when suddenly, a giant Dragon Spear swung down fiercely and the sky was filled with Dragon Spear shadows.</p>
 <p>The one who rushed up was also not just some small fry. He took out something that looked like a tree branch and with one sweep, a circle had formed around him. The man was at the center of the circle, and with this, he passed through the shadow images of the Dragon Spear.</p>
 <p>When everyone thought that this person could rush through, the giant stone statue spun the Dragon Spear in its hand. The spear was like a giant stone snake that sucked the man into its vortex.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>An explosion resounded. The person from before had disappeared and the stone statue returned to being inactive. The people that were not on stage were all shocked, but after a while, they started to discuss with each other.</p>
 <p>“These many people and only three have passed thru the stone statue. Now there’s no movement, the rest of the people have become broken corpses.”</p>
 <p>“You’re right. Many people are now thinking about ideas like dog-eat-dog, but this type of loss cannot be taken by everyone. This Battle God Statue is a big obstacle, its power is immense and its attacks are continuous. The only way to pass thru it is to rush inside, there’s no way to dodge. Perhaps, one can try to destroy the Battle God Statue.”</p>
 <p>The Battle God Statue’s strength was powerful, but it was not invincible. The material of the Battle God Statue was special and would not be easily damaged, let alone be destroyed. Otherwise, these people would have destroyed it already.</p>
 <p>After the person died, no one wanted to attempt again. Qing Shui was not in a hurry, he knew that the Ancient Divine Shrine was not something easy to break through as the Ancient Fire Snake had already told him this.</p>
 <p>“We already have a few people in there, do you guys not want to enter?”</p>
 <p>At this time, an outspoken and straightforward voice was heard.</p>
 <p>That voice came from a slightly-old elder that represented the Justice Alliance. His body was straight and he wore plain white clothes, as he gave off a scholarly air. His body emitted a type of natural energy.</p>
 <p>Within the Justice Alliance, there were still people who were Justice Warriors. However, there are still hypocrites hidden within the group, some of those Justice Warriors were left in the dark by the lies of those pretenders.</p>
 <p>This person belonged to the Sword Heart Pavilion. The Sword Heart Pavilion was a formidable sect within the Soaring Dragon Continent. Their specialization was on the interaction between the heart and the sword. This sect focused on the heart of the sword, the forms were not as important as long as the heart was one with the sword.</p>
 <p>The Sword Heart Pavilion was reliant on the sword. A powerful member of the Sword Heart Pavilion could annihilate the world with one sword, however, it was not certain whether the Sword Heart Pavilion had such a person.</p>
 <p>The Demon Lord didn’t even turn her head, however, the Divine Beast Sect had an elder walk out saying, “To have so many people here, but only three people have managed to enter. Is this really something to brag about?”</p>
 <p>The elder’s words were provoking. They already knew that only three people from the Justice Alliance had managed to enter, thus he made such a statement.</p>
 <p>“You, you… If you have the ability, how about you send three people up as well. Don’t whine when even one of your men can’t get in. You will just lose face on the entire continent,” the elder that was being shamed by the Divine Beast Sect said angrily.</p>
 <p>“Of course, we will go. However, we have to rest first since we just arrived,” the Divine Beast Sect elder laughed as he said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui observed the surrounding. When he looked up, he could see glimpses of the divine shrine within the clouds. This Battle God Mountain had a strong pressure Qi which made people especially uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>In reality, his objective for coming here had already been accomplished. The battle with the Dragon Palace had been victorious and the people here already knew it. In terms of the Ancient Divine Shrine, they did not care as much. Both the Justice Alliance and the Evil Powers were here, they would result in large losses. In the end, only the one who obtains the treasures would be the winner, everyone else was a loser without anything to show.</p>
 <p>Now that they were here, they could at least try their luck. Most of them hoped to get something and decided to go here. Even when there were already three people inside, they could not see them. Thus, they don’t know if it was true or not, and for all they know it could also be a rumor.</p>
 <p>“What should we do? Do we want to give it a try?”</p>
 <p>A group of people discussed as they gathered with the Divine Best Sect elder as the head.</p>
 <p>“You have already seen how formidable the Battle God Statue is. There were already dozens of formidable martial artist who died in its hands,” an eerier old man said. He was the head of the Wild Ghost Valley. He looked tall and thin to the bone and his green-colored eyes carried a gloomy expression.</p>
 <p>“Then what should we do?”</p>
 <p>The Divine Beast Sect’s elder sighed as he said.</p>
 <p>“The Battle God Statue is dependent on formation techniques. If you want to pass thru it, then you have to be an expert that specializes in formation techniques,” the elder from the Wild Ghost Valley exclaimed.</p>
 <p>“Elder Li, I heard that Mister Qing was an expert on formation techniques. Do you think he can get past?” One of the Lu brothers spoke at this time.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. He now understood, the Wild Ghost Valley and Divine Beast Sect were echoing one another to provoke him to go. Although this method was lame, it was somewhat effective.</p>
 <p>People looked towards Qing Shui and the Demon Lord Palace, everyone knew that the Demon Lord Palace specializes in formation techniques. The Demon Lord Palace was also the head of the Four Great Evil Powers, if they didn’t make a move this time, it wouldn’t go well with the others.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui laughed and said, “I think my knowledge in formation techniques is quite strong, but to break through the formation before us will be quite difficult. I need two more people to cooperate with me. Perhaps the Lu Brothers would not mind manning up and joining me?”</p>
 <p>The Lu Brothers cursed in their hearts, this guy was courting death. Even in death, he wanted to take them with him.</p>
 <p>“Brother Qing, you jest. Us brothers should set formations with the rest of the people in the sect, perhaps it would be better to find someone from the Demon Lord Palace. Your cooperation with each other will be better,” The man only appeared to smile on the surface as he said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew this would be the result. He laughed and said, “That’s alright, you don’t want to man up.”</p>
 <p>“You… you…” The Lu Brothers were angered to the point of changing colors.</p>
 <p>“We will see if you are a real man or not,” the Lu Brothers said angrily.</p>
 <p>“Relax, real men don’t do things that don’t have balls.” Qing Shui laughed and said.</p>
 <p>This line was rude enough that the Lu Brothers shut their mouths right away. Qing Shui just said that the two Lu brothers had no balls.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, you’re so bad.” Shen Ling arrived at Qing Shui’s side and laughed.</p>
 <p>This woman would try to be beside Qing Shui at any chance that she got.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was too uncomfortable to say anything about this and he couldn’t just send her away. The Demon Lord would also not call him, especially when she had no feelings towards him or who he was with.</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei and Zhan Yu were always together. If they found an opportunity, they would call Qing Shui away but they could not do that every time.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui found an excuse to leave and to talk to the Demon Lord and Hua Rumei.</p>
 <p>“We still need to go up there and check. Which one of you would like to go? We still need one person to stay and handle things here,” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“I’ll go!” Hua Rumei said without any hesitation.</p>
 <p>“I’ll go instead. You should be careful here, there should not be anything happening tho.” the Demon Lord walked two steps forward and said.</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei thought for a bit and nodded, “Qing Shui, be careful okay. Also, take good care of the Palace Lord.”</p>
 <p>“Relax, no one will be able to hurt her, even the stone statue cannot,” Qing Shui laughed. He walked out from in between Hua Rumei’s charming expression and Demon Lord’s calm demeanor.</p>
 <p>“I have observed for a bit before. Use the Eight Trigrams Steps to dodge and the northeast location as your basis. If you can’t dodge, move to the northeast position, if rushing go to the northwest position, then retreat to the southeast position.” Qing Shui thought for a bit and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui finished talking and rushed out without waiting for the Demon Lord’s reply. The Demon Lord did not dare to be careless, she immediately rushed forward to follow Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The spiritual pressure was overwhelming the further up they got.</p>
 <p>“Look, those are people from the Four Great Evil Powers. There is the Demon Lord, but who is that man?”</p>
 <p>“The Demon Lord had never been together with a man before.”</p>
 <p>“What a beautiful woman. It’s unfortunate that she is so cold, cool, and elegant. Not many men could take that on.”</p>
 <p>“To win a smile from that woman, even death was worth it.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The Battle God Statue directly thrust its Dragon Spear towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s silhouette did not stop. The Nine Continents Mountain had already met the Dragon Spear as he had rushed towards the entrance.</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>The Dragon Spear had directly sent the Nine Continents Mountain flying, then it smashed towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>At this time, the Demon Lord rushed up.</p>
 <p>“Quickly run inside. Remember what I told you, use the Eight Trigrams Step!” Qing Shui said to the Demon Lord without turning his head.</p>
 <p>The Demon Lord had wanted to block the Dragon Spear with Qing Shui. However, as she heard Qing Shui’s words, she stepped towards the northwest position and thought about Qing Shui’s instructions before rushing forward.</p>
 <p>The stone statue swept again and the sky was once again filled with Dragon Spear shadow.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Step, Replacing Sky and Sun!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was the king of the Nine Palace, he was quite adept when it came to dodging attacks. He swept his hand out and the Bloodthirsty Demon Vines rushed out then wrapped around the Battle God Statue.</p>
 <p>Gold, Water, Wood, Fire, and Earth. Earth was weak against Wood, the Battle God Statue was of the Earth element and its strength was debuffed by 20%. This was the restraining power of the Five Elements, this was why the Five Elements Divine Refining Technique was so strong.</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used his Emperor’s Qi on the Battle God Statue directly, and it was successful. The Emperor’s Qi was definitely tyrannical. Afterwards, he buffed himself and debuffed the statue with Heavenly Talisman. In addition, he also used Phoenix Battle Intent, directly reducing the Battle God Statue’s strength in half. His abilities were terrifying.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the statue waved its hand and a giant Stone Dragon appeared from the Dragon Spear. It spat out large piles of magma, it almost looked like a landslide to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The Demon Lord had already passed the Battle God Statue. Qing Shui observed her and thought the timing was right.</p>
 <p>Great Reversal!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui directly used this ability on the Battle God Statue.</p>
