 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though Qing Shui wasn’t doing it with much force, he was still hugging her tightly. Because the Vampiric Empress was in so shock, she had her cherry lips slightly opened. This only gave Qing Shui all the more convenience to put his tongue into her mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time the Vampiric Empress came back to her senses, Qing Shui had already broken through all the barriers and even sucked on her soft tongue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The kiss didn’t last that long, but it felt like an eternity. By the time Qing Shui moved away from her slightly swollen lips, she felt like she was unable to stand steadily. Luckily, Qing Shui embraced her just in time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Qing Shui was still a bit nervous. After all, the Vampiric Empress was an unusual woman. If she were to get mad after being forcefully kissed by him, it would be perfectly normal. He was already ready for the woman to hit him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Vampiric Empress didn’t seem to be angry about it. She grudgingly looked at Qing Shui, “Just because we had a daughter, you still want to do this, even though you don’t like me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who said that I don’t like you? I like beautiful women and you’re very attractive.” Qing Shui said in a serious tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can sense that, but aren’t you afraid that I might get angry?” The Vampiric Empress let out a sigh.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am. That was a decision I made after careful considerations. You don’t know how many scenarios I have thought about. Can you give me some encouragement for the brave act I did just now?” Qing Shui said in an awkward tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s words made the Vampiric Empress quite upset. He had treated her like this and yet he still expected herself to encourage him even more?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She shot Qing Shui a glare. But as she did so, her already red face looked even more flirtish than before. This caused Qing Shui to once again attempt a sneak attack at her and gave her an even more violent kiss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, it wouldn’t be a lie to say that the Vampiric Empress had fallen completely into his trap. But most importantly, she wasn’t actually angry. The feeling of experiencing something entirely new added on with the anxious state she was currently at made her felt as if she was in a dream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Qing Shui gently kissed her. After that, he was able to feel her responding back slowly. There were things which didn’t need to be taught as it could be learned by oneself. Though she was still quite clumsy at the moment, Qing Shui still felt very excited by it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time Qing Shui let go of her, a silvery bright string of fluid was pulled out between their lips. When the Vampiric Empress saw it, for a moment, she felt very embarrassed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How was it?” Qing Shui looked at the Vampiric Empress whom he had already regarded to be his woman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?” The Vampiric Empress asked in a softer voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How does it feel?” Qing Shui smiled and asked again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It doesn’t feel good.” The Vampiric Empress was very straightforward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui once again stuck his lips onto hers and felt the soft sensation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How about now?” Qing Shui smiled and asked once again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“... It felt good.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well then, let’s give it one more try!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At night, Qing Shui didn’t go to the exterior part of the valley. Of course, it was impossible for the Vampiric Empress who just gave birth to do anything with him. It was not just in terms of her body but also that it was unlikely that she would engage with him in it even if she was in perfect health in the first place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nearby, there was another bedroom. It was also another one of the Vampiric Empress’ bedroom. It was relatively smaller than the other one. That room could be considered as her true bedroom. However, she didn’t know why she had allowed Qing Shui to stay in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui kissed her, she didn’t try to actually repel him. Though she was a bit anxious, she was also excited about it. When she thought about the experience, she would feel intense heat running across her face. Initially, she thought that she would never fall for anybody. However, Qing Shui, who was her nemesis appeared. Despite all that, everything still turned out for the best.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui walked into the room nearby. The room was half the size of the room located outside. Its size was similar to that of a woman’s lady chamber from his previous incarnation. It was about three meters tall and four meters wide. Just like before, the room looked very clean. But all of a sudden, Qing Shui noticed something and froze in shock. He looked so surprised that words couldn’t describe his expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a drawing on the wall. It was the drawing of the Vampiric Empress. She wore a blood red long dress and her face looked cold yet elegant. Slender and elegant, she was like a fairy. She was bare-footed as she stood in the middle of the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Portraits of Beauty!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Never did Qing Shui think that the final piece of Portrait of Beauty would actually be here. Furthermore, it was the Vampiric Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It took him quite a while to come back to his senses. It wasn’t that the Vampiric Empress couldn’t be compared to the other women from the Portraits of Beauty. On the contrary, she wasn’t in the slightest inferior to them. Initially, Qing Shui had expected the person to be Qing Hanye or Yehuang Guwu. It could maybe even be Yuan Su, Sheng Jun, or Sheng Huang. He wouldn’t be surprised if the last woman was one of them. But for the last person to be the Vampiric Empress, it was simply out of his expectations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was intensively observing at the portrait on the wall. Naturally, he wouldn’t make a mistake. This was certainly the twelfth Portraits of Beauty. Logically speaking, this should be the last one, the last portrait which the Art Maestro had made.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without himself noticing, the Vampiric Empress was already standing behind him. She didn’t say anything when she noticed him lost in thoughts while looking at her own portrait.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This portrait was drawn by a generous old man for me. He said that I was born with an unusual physique and that I was bound to be wealthy in the future.” The Vampiric Empress looked back to the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? The Art Maestro is still alive?” Qing Shui was getting more and more surprised. He had even started to sound higher-pitched than usual.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Art Maestro? The old man possessed immeasurable strength. It was many times higher than an ordinary Martial Saint.” The Vampiric Empress also looked back at Qing Shui in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seems that he might still be alive. Thousand of years ago, or maybe even longer, he might really still be a Martial Saint. It is hard to say how strong exactly he is currently. It wouldn’t be impossible if he got even stronger than Divine Grade Warriors.” Qing Shui felt that things were getting more and more mysterious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s wrong? Do you happen to know the old man?” The Vampiric Empress asked Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have only lived fewer than a hundred years. It’s impossible for me to know him personally.” Qing Shui shook his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have also lived for fewer than a hundred years and yet, I have managed to meet him.” The Vampiric Empress argued back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought about it and realized that she had a point. Nevertheless, he chuckled and said, “Ah, who would have thought that my darling would actually turn out to be so young.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are so disgusting.” The Vampiric Empress was dumbfounded by the way Qing Shui had called her. She had never once had a normal expression on her face today. It was always seen to be blushing all along.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even with that said, deep down, she felt unusually happy. No matter what, she was still a woman. Though she might have criticized it to be disgusting, she was still delighted to hear that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was not the first time Qing Shui had been so cheesy with the woman he loved. But as it turned out, the number of times he had actually acted this way wasn’t really that common neither. However, he made sure that all of his women knew he treasured them dearly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I would like to have this painting.” Qing Shui turned around and asked for the Vampiric Empress’ permission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that so? In that case, I shall give you the painting.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since it was Qing Shui who wanted it, she would give it without questions. If it had been anyone else, she would never give it no matter what the person had to exchange.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled as he took down the portrait. He carefully examined it. He then spotted the words on top of the portrait. He was confident that this was the twelfth portrait.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t need to look at the painting too much. The real thing is right beside you.” The Vampiric Empress teased.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui kept it in his realm before he went on to embrace the Vampiric Empress. After the warm scene, he carried her to her bed and covered her with the blanket. He only went back to his room after kissing her and the little lass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While laying down on the soft bed, Qing Shui’s heart had been stirred up by the last Portrait of Beauty. He was really happy about it. It was as if fate itself had guided him to this. Such a coincidence had led him to gather all twelve of the Portraits of Beauty.&nbsp;</span></p>
