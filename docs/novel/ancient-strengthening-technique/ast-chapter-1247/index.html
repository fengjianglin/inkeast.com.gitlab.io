 <p><strong>AST 1247- Do You Believe in Love?</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui was looking at the abilities of the Jade Emperor Queen Bee. He realized that there wasn’t really anything which it was particularly strong at. Even though its strength had increased quite a lot, unfortunately, to him, its biggest use was to carry out pollination, not its combat prowess. With this tiny strength of it, for a long time, it was impossible that it would be useful in the battles to come.</p>
 <p>It had the ability to summon insects within a hundred li. It might be able to turn into an existence which could help search for tracks of certain things. Hence, Qing Shui felt that it might be useful in some aspects.</p>
 <p>Looking at the formation of these two Spiritual Medicinal Beasts, Qing Shui felt a lot more relieved for now. The Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal would have even stronger life force because of these two little medicinal beasts. Everything here would undergo changes. This was a virtuous cycle.</p>
 <p>Once he obtained another Spiritual Beast Pill again, he would let the Golden Medicinal Turtle consume it. Actually, it could also in a way be considered a Spiritual Medicinal Beast, it was just that it seemed like due to the lack of use of a Spiritual Beast Pill, it was stuck at the same level and was left unable to ascend in grade. Furthermore, it also only benefited aquatic creatures.</p>
 <p>The seeds which he planted seemed to have grown as it had been a few days in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Additionally, because of the spiritual qi within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, the seed could germinate on that very day. Now, they were already a foot high and they were all precious medicinal herbs with multiple colors. As Qing Shui looked at these, he felt relieved. These were all his assets.</p>
 <p>By the time Qing Shui came out, not much time had passed in the outside world. It wasn’t really too late for him to have dinner now. The girls were preparing the dishes. But it seemed like they had also just managed to finish.</p>
 <p>“You’re out. We were just about to go look for you.” The Seventh Princess smiled and walked over when she saw Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The dishes on the table were piping hot and smelled really fragrant. At the moment when Qing Shui came out of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he hadn’t eaten anything. Merely smelling it, he already felt very tempted to eat. He sat down and looked at the dishes that were considered decent, “You did well.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui ate almost half of the dishes on the table. As long as the dishes were all cooked and not salty to the point of making people cry or diluted to the point it became tasteless, it would have tasted even better than those made by skilled chefs. The girls still felt a sense of accomplishment eating the dishes which they prepared themselves. However, they were aware that it had to do with the ingredients and seasonings.</p>
 <p>They were used to drinking tea after eating. Hence, they all sat in the courtyard drinking tea. Qing Shui remembered the One and Two Yang Pills. Even though these things wouldn’t help him increase his strength much, to Qing Sha, Yang Qingyu as well as the Seventh Princess, they were already like an elixir kind of spiritual medicine.</p>
 <p>Of course, both Qing Shui and Eldest Princess singesting them would also bring about decent effects. Ten One Yang Pills along with ten Two Yang Pills. That’s a strength equivalent of thirty sun. Three hundred thousand nimbus. Unfortunately, he didn’t have the Three Yang Pills, otherwise, it would have been even better. It was just that he wondered if the Yang Pills which came afterwards were the same as those at the beginning.</p>
 <p>This time, they didn’t really ask much when Qing Shui gave them the pills.Eldest Princess on the other hand, she looked at Qing Shui in doubt. Despite this, she still remained silent.</p>
 <p>Qing Sha as well as the Seventh Princess and Yan Jinyu immediately consumed them. As soon as they did, all of them experienced a significant increase in their strength. The three girls said that they wanted to stabilize their power and went back to cultivate, leaving behind only Qing Shui and Eldest Princess drinking tea with each other.</p>
 <p>“Has the Heaven Secrets Academy given you good stuff?” Eldest Princess looked at Qing Shui and smiled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out the key, “Yeah, they gave me a hidden treasure room.”</p>
 <p>Eldest Princess revealed a surprised expression. She said in quite a surprised tone, “The Heaven Secrets Academy actually gave you a hidden treasure room. Normally, only people at my master’s level would get one.”</p>
 <p>“Actually, there wasn’t much stuff in there. There were only things like One Yang Pills and Two Yang Pills. Oh and also, there was a bit of Yang Stone in it,” Qing Shui said after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, a man who is never content is like a snake trying to swallow an elephant. The One and Two Yang Pills are already considered to be extremely precious objects. This is also why the Heaven Secrets Academy has so many powerful disciples. So long as they achieved Grade One State Master, they would think of a thousand methods to just get their hands on the One Yang Pill. That would help them immediately turn into a Grade Three State Master. As if the One Yang Pill was something which could be obtained so easily.” Eldest Princess shook her head and looked at Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p>That’s also true. Qing Shui had also thought about it before. It might seem like he could obtain the One and Two Yang Pills fairly easily, this also somehow had to do with him being himself. If it had been other people, it would have very likely been extremely hard for them. Particularly the people who needed it, just like Yan Jinyu, it was way too difficult for her to get one a One Yang Pill.</p>
 <p>“When I refine the Three or Four Yang Pills, I will leave a portion of them for you,” Qing Shui stated.</p>
 <p>“It’s good that you have these kinds of intentions. But do you know that as you progress forward, the Yang Pill will get harder and harder to refine? Especially after Three Yang Pill, the Four Yang Pill is a cut-off point. It’s way too hard to refine them.” Eldest Princess smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Why do you not believe me? I never lie,” Qing Shui said while laughing.</p>
 <p>“If this came out of someone else’s mouth, I wouldn’t believe it. But if it comes from you, even my own opinion will begin to waver,” Eldest Princess said seriously.</p>
 <p>“Oh, so I also have this kind of charisma. Sister Su, if I were to say that in the future, you are going to cry and scream about becoming my wife, will you believe me?”</p>
 <p>“Believe my ass.” Eldest Princess only hesitated for a moment and straight away extended her hand and knocked Qing Shui’s head. However, she smiled while doing so.</p>
 <p>Of course, Qing Shui purposely let her knock his head. Otherwise, it would have been really easy for him to dodge it.</p>
 <p>“I’m just kidding. Sister Su, don’t you realize that you have gotten even more beautiful now? It’s always said that women look really good when they smile. With one smile, they’re already able to topple cities. With another, they may even end up toppling countries.”</p>
 <p>“You little brat, you are getting more and more daring. Now you even dare to flirt with me.” Eldest Princess glared at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Of course I won’t dare to do so. Oh yeah, Sister Su, cultivate hard! In the future, the Heaven Secrets Academy may very well end up within your grasp.”</p>
 <p>“Did you promise the headmaster anything?” Eldest Princess looked into Qing Shui’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“No, what can I commit myself to with this low strength of mine?” Qing Shui said calmly.</p>
 <p>“You look really serious when you lie……” Eldest Princess looked at Qing Shui and smiled.</p>
 <p>“Really?”</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>“Actually I lied. I promised him that I would save Heaven Secrets Academy when it’s in crisis in the future. Do you believe me?”</p>
 <p>“I do!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, “......”</p>
 <p>“I have Nine Yang Acupuncture and Nine Yang Finger Technique. They can both help raise cultivation. Sister Su, would you like to try?</p>
 <p>“Really?” Eldest Princess looked at Qing Shui with doubt.</p>
 <p>“Naturally. It’s just that I have to interact with Sister Su’s body.</p>
 <p>Eldest Princess remained silent.</p>
 <p>“Sister Su, are you not getting married?” Qing Shui smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>A sharp light flashed across Eldest Princess’ eyes. She looked at Qing Shui like she wanted to see through him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui on the other hand, smiled and looked at her. He wasn’t panicked in the slightest.</p>
 <p>“Alright, say it, what shall I do?” Eldest Princess shook her head and regained her composure.</p>
 <p>“Both of my hands need to be in contact with your back. I just learned these acupuncture techniques and skills,” Qing Shui said a bit embarrassedly.</p>
 <p>“You are using me as an experimental subject!” Eldest Princess smiled.</p>
 <p>“I’m confident!”</p>
 <p>“How much of my strength can it raise?” Eldest Princess seemed to be curious.</p>
 <p>“It mainly increases your hidden potential and helps make your cultivation speed faster. However, it can also increase your strength by as much as 5%, right away.” Qing Shui said carefully after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>5% is already quite a lot. If one possessed strength worth three hundred sun, 5% would mean fifteen sun. It was even more powerful than ten One Yang Pills. The most important part was it helped raise hidden potential.</p>
 <p>All this while, Eldest princess was hesitating. Qing Shui looked at her and smiled, “Don’t worry, there’s no need to strip off your clothes!”</p>
 <p>“Ah!” Eldest Princess blushed. She looked at Qing Shui angrily.</p>
 <p>“But it’s a bit offensive that my hands needed to touch your back through your shirt.” The reason why Qing Shui dared to make this statement was because prior to this, he had already hugged her before. He had already interacted with her soft breasts through her clothes before. It was also because of this that Qing Shui felt that it might work.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing Qing Shui’s thoughts, Eldest Princess was also thinking about similar things. She wasn’t lying when she said that she hadn’t planned to get married in the past. Even now, she still harbored these kinds of thoughts. Martial prowess was what she was after. Only with that would she be able to secure everything which belonged to her. If she had this kind of martial prowess in the past, her mother wouldn’t have died…..</p>
 <p>“Go, let’s try it in my room. Just treat me as a wimpy kid……” Qing Shui did this in order to help her relax.</p>
 <p>The main thing Qing Shui was concerned about was Qing Sha. He didn’t want to bring Qing Sha along when he left. He wanted to wait for Eldest Princess to grow a bit stronger. Other than that, he also wanted to let the headmasters witness his improvement one more time so as to let them have peace of mind. Only then would they sincerely treat the Eldest Princess. This way, Qing Sha and Yan Jinyu would be safe here.</p>
 <p>Regarding Eldest Princess, it was perfectly normal for beautiful women to attract men, let alone her being so exceptional amongst the female sex. It was impossible for an ordinary man to not harbor any thoughts.</p>
 <p>In any case, Qing Shui didn’t actually think of going after her. At least for now, he didn’t have this kind of intention. He needed to think about his own women. Besides, it was very unlikely that Eldest Princess would want to share a man with other women.</p>
 <p>This was the first time Qing Shui stayed in the same room with Eldest Princess. This was Qing Shui’s room. Luckily, everything here was all new. Normally, he wouldn’t sleep on the bed. He spent all of his time within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>It was already nighttime or maybe, it could also be said that it was already late at night.</p>
 <p>“How about tomorrow? It’s already quite late today.” Eldest Princess seemed to be a bit panicked and got cold feet. (Wanted to retreat because she felt nervous)</p>
 <p>“Could it be that you’re scared that you may not be able to control yourself and end up eating me up?” Qing Shui looked at Eldest Princess seriously.</p>
 <p>“A filthy mouth can never utter a decent language. It seems like you are looking for a beating!” Eldest Princess pulled Qing Shui’s ear. She noticed that she had actually gotten used to the way Qing Shui talked. In the past, she wouldn’t have even thought about this. These kinds of changes actually made her felt a bit helpless.</p>
 <p>This was already the second time Qing Shui got pulled by her. However, he extended his hand and embraced her waist, “Sister Su, are you feeling lonely?”</p>
 <p>Initially, Eldest Princess wanted to push away Qing Shui. However, she realized that he was actually only gently grabbing her waist. He really didn’t go overboard. Besides, if it had already happened once before, one could subconsciously approve of a kind of behaviour. Furthermore, the question which he asked also stunned her.</p>
 <p>“Lonely?” Suddenly, Eldest Princess realized that she didn’t really know how she should answer this question. She didn’t even know if she was feeling that way. The reason being that she was already used to it. She didn’t know how long it has been since she last thought of this question.</p>
 <p>She put both of her hands on Qing Shui’s shoulders and looked at Qing Shui, “I don’t know, I’m already used to it.”</p>
 <p>“Sister Su, have you ever had a kind of feeling like… You have something on your mind, yet you don’t know who you should talk to about it?” Qing Shui asked with a smile. He was looking at the face which was almost within his reach. Within her beautiful eyes, there were traces of tiredness and loneliness. That was a kind of expression which couldn’t be expressed in words. Qing Shui felt a bit sorry for her.</p>
 <p>“What do you want to talk about?” Eldest Princess knew that the reason why this brat talked to her like this was to let her feel more relaxed. He wasn’t actually trying to take advantage of her.</p>
 <p>“Do you believe in love?” When Qing Shui asked this question, he felt a bit like a huckster who was trying to lie to a young girl except the girl he was trying to lie to was actually a mature woman.</p>
