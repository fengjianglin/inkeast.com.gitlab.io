 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 262 How Much Is He Carrying On His Shoulders? Sword of the third wave.</strong></p>
  <p>She slightly leaned over Qing Shui as her heart beated furiously. Suddenly, she felt her hand being grabbed and panicked. She noticed that Qing Shui’s brows were furrowed and his eyes were tightly shut as he grabbed onto her hand.</p>
  <p>“Mother, wait a little longer, wait a little longer… I’ll bring you to Yan City!”</p>
  <p>As Canghai Mingyue heard Qing Shui’s sleep talk in this painful tone, she felt very sad. To have her hand held by Qing Shui and being called ‘mother’ made her turn red in embarrassment, even if it was only sleep talk.</p>
  <p>“Mother, your son is useless to not be able to bring you to flatten Yan Clan after so long…”</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue saw that Qing Shui, who was sleeping, had glittering tears at the corner of his eyes.</p>
  <p>To think that he wanted to flatten the Yan Clan…</p>
  <p>Although Qing Shui had grabbed her hand, she did not shake it off. Feeling pained, she reached out her other hand to grab onto Qing Shui’s hand, spreading some warmth to him. Maybe he would appear weak only in his dreams.</p>
  <p>“Liu-Li, Liu-Li, you must wake up…”</p>
  <p>“Master, one day, I’ll accompany you to Lion King’s Ridge to seek justice to be served. Before the lass turns 30 years old, I’ll find a solution to her Seven Apertures Mystical Heart…”</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue heard Qing Shui’s sleep talk and mumbling here and there. She was surprised and wondered what kind of man he was that he would have so many problems stored in heart and so many burdens on his shoulders.</p>
  <p>“Mingyue, Mingyue, I…”</p>
  <p>Hearing Qing Shui calling her name, Canghai Mingyue felt a little agitated. However, he did not say anything before falling into deep sleep again.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue let out a sigh and, at the same time, felt a sense of relief!</p>
  <p>Time passed by quietly while she sat beside Qing Shui, who was holding her hand. The sun was already setting outside. Four hours had almost passed by.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui gradually opened his eyes. He had dreamt of many people in his dreams. Suddenly, he saw Canghai Mingyue sitting besides him, in a daze. Dressed in plain clothes, there was an indescribable beauty to her.</p>
  <p>It was only then did he realize that he was still holding onto one of her hands tightly. The soft feeling was very wonderful, but no matter how hard it was to part with it, he still gradually let go.</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue smiled and looked towards Qing Shui when she felt that her hand was released. Qing Shui saw the thin blanket on him. It had a similar fragrance to Canghai Mingyue’s.</p>
  <p>“Thank you!” Qing Shui sat up.</p>
  <p>“Why do you need to say thanks? Do you loathe me?” Canghai Mingyue asked in disappointment. She had yet to walk out of her own guilt. While there was no need for her to feel guilty for this event, Huoyun Liu-Li ultimately had gotten hurt because of her. She would rather that she was the one lying there.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui looked at the crestfallen Canghai Mingyue and took up the courage to pinch her stout nose. That tender feeling made Qing Shui stunned for a second. “Alright, stop blaming yourself. We’re all on the same side. Let’s pray that Liu-Li will recover soon.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui walked into Huoyun Liu-Li’s bedroom and saw that everything was purple in color, even her sleepwear. Earlier, Qing Shui did not pay any heed to the surroundings.</p>
  <p>He then used the Saintly Hands to gently pat, rub, and knead her body, channeling the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique into her body as he built up her body’s foundation, strengthened her constitution, and stimulated her body’s deep potential.</p>
  <p>He then continued four hours of “Duo Cultivation”, after which Qing Shui felt that Huoyun Liu-Li’s body was already starting to regain a bit of its vitality.</p>
  <p>Only when the sky turned dark did Qing Shui stop. He smiled. Huoyun Liu-Li’s life was now safe, but it was hard to tell if she would be able to wake up.</p>
  <p>In the Immortal Sword Sect!</p>
  <p>“Two idiots….” The middle-aged man dressed in purple bellowed loudly.</p>
  <p>“Sovereign, who did you say did it? Canghai?” A burly middle-aged man who was like a metal tower asked, unconcerned.</p>
  <p>“Dead in Bloody Street. Who would know who did it? To think that they were done in. It wasn’t done by that Canghai b*stard. They did not leave the Canghai residence.” At the mention of this, Immortal Sword Sect’s Sovereign could not help but start cursing.</p>
  <p>At that moment, a young man around the age of thirty years old came in, wearing clothes that commoners wore. He appeared extremely ordinary.</p>
  <p>“Sovereign, we found out the truth!” The young man bowed and said. His voice was so ordinary that there was not a hint of uniqueness to it. Even if after a person had listened to it for a few times, it would still be hard to remember his voice.</p>
  <p>“Speak!” The middle-aged man dressed in purple twitched his brows and said.</p>
  <p>The two rows of elderly men with various hues of gray and white hair had also perked up their ears and looked toward that ordinary young man.</p>
  <p>“It’s that young man who came to Canghai residence who did it!”</p>
  <p>“What?”</p>
  <p>“What?”</p>
  <p>“…”</p>
  <p>“Speak in more detail, don’t leave out anything!” The middle-aged man dressed in purple hollered, his eyes wide open in fury.</p>
  <p>The young man spoke tirelessly, as if he had seen it with his own eyes. He shared the story roughly, causing all of the Immortal Sword Sect’s elders to gasp a breath of cold air.</p>
  <p>The young man left!</p>
  <p>“We can’t let this person stay alive, we can’t let this person stay alive!” This was Immortal Sword Sect’s Sovereign’s immediate conclusion.</p>
  <p>“Sovereign, we must definitely eliminate this person; if not, the Immortal Sword Sect will not be able to survive past twenty years.” An old man with a strong build said affirmatively. He had a pair of spirited eyes.</p>
  <p>“Twenty years? Elder Zhuge is being too conservative.” Immortal Sword Sect’s Sovereign smiled bitterly and said.</p>
  <p>“How would it be possible for a young, inexperienced chap be able to eradicate our Immortal Sword Sect?” An old man with triangular shaped eyes said in disdain.</p>
  <p>“Fool!”</p>
  <p>A deep and low voice came, giving a heart-throbbing feeling.</p>
  <p>“Old Ancestor!”</p>
  <p>Everyone in the hall bowed to the old man who had suddenly appeared. The old man was in a suit of white clothes, and his hair was let down such that it was even covering his eyes. Occasionally, his white, hollow right eye could be seen through his swaying hair.</p>
  <p>“Without me, just that young chap alone would be able to wipe off all of you within five years time.” The old man walked up to stand beside the Immortal Sword Sect’s Sovereign and snorted.</p>
  <p>“Old Ancestor, should we eradicate them completely?” Immortal Sword Sect’s Sovereign bent down slightly and asked.</p>
  <p>“This is but of course. Chi Er, send down the instructions. Those who have come across those people from Canghai’s residence! So long as they leave the Southern Pass from today onwards, have them disappear. You yourself will prepare to head to Canghai’s residence when the time comes. Have a good look at the my battle with Canghai- it should be very beneficial for your cultivation.”</p>
  <p>“As Old Ancestor commands!”</p>
  <p>The old man had long disappeared from the hall!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui used a thin blanket on the bed to cover Huoyun Liu-Li’s lower body all the way to her chest. He then walked out slowly and saw that Canghai Mingyue had been standing at the door for four hours.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, I’m feeling very upset!” Canghai Mingyue said softly when Qing Shui walked to her.</p>
  <p>“Everyone is very upset. Liu-Li will be very happy when she wakes up. She’s willing to do anything for you out of her own free will. Only when you’re fine would she be happy.” Qing Shui smiled and looked at that frown of hers.</p>
  <p>“I’ll come take a look at her at a later time, about four hours later. You should go have some rest!” Qing Shui’s hands twitched, but he put them down and left.</p>
  <p>Back in his room, Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, falling asleep after lying down on the bed in the realm. He was too exhausted. He could not afford to rest in the time outside, so he went back to the realm to take a break.</p>
  <p>He slept for one whole day. After he woke up, he gradually performed a set of Taichi slowly because of the magnitude of his injuries. His body was beyond sturdy because he had been cultivating the Ancient Strengthening Technique. The healing rate was unbelievable. Moreover, the image of Yin-Yang in his mind kept on tempering and recuperating his bones, muscles, and veins.</p>
  <p>Although he was impaled through the stomach, he had already gradually recovered after half a day. Qing Shui knew that he had about half a month’s time each time in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, and his wounds would have long recovered by then, even though it would be only four hours outside. It was only because he had this heaven-defying treasure that he would dare take this risk.</p>
  <p>After waking up, Qing Shui felt more comfortable, and his injuries had mostly healed. Qing Shui planned to devote the next day to cultivating the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
  <p>The walnut-sized drop in the dantian did not get any larger after breaking through to the 90th cycle- it just seemed more compact, and some golden colored spots had appeared. The spots were the size of the tip of a needle, and were very bright!</p>
  <p>A majestic force rose from his dantian. That strong power felt very comfortable. The stream of Qi that was slow but seemingly impetuous circulated in the wide but firm meridian channels.</p>
  <p>Some golden spots appeared on the yellow Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. When the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique circulated through his injuries, these golden spots would enter the injured areas of his body and heal them.</p>
  <p>After breaking through to the 90th cycle, Qing Shui felt that his powers had soared and entered the accumulating phase. Upon reaching the 99th cycle, his powers would be accumulated to a horrifying degree.</p>
  <p>After cultivating the Ancient Strengthening Technique the whole day and healing his injuries with the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, Qing Shui had already almost healed completely. It only took one day! He was long used to this. In the past, he would never believe that he would only take less than two days to recover a hole in his stomach.</p>
  <p>Picking up the Big Dipper Sword, Qing Shui started to practice his sword techniques, trying to find that feeling back when he had performed the Sword of the third wave. Qing Shui was so agitated back then that he had incorporated the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm into his sword technique.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui performed the Basic Sword Techniques over and over again. Having comprehended the profoundness of the Basic Sword Techniques, each sword swing was consecutively more solid than the last, as if the swing was like returning to nature’s simplicity. Each sword swing was direct and agile.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui recalled the feeling when he had used the Sword of the third wave. Back then he had just seen Huoyun Liu-Li’s injuries. The fury that he had experienced at that moment had allowed him to break through the obstacle to the 90th cycle.</p>
  <p>Just when that power had reached its pinnacle, he succeeded in performing the Sword of the third wave!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui seemed to have grasped something, but yet it seemed to be slipping through his hands!</p>
  <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui thought of the Tiger Form!</p>
  <p>“Mmmm!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui suddenly used his left hand to perform the Tiger Form, gradually raising his aura before he repeatedly performed the Tiger’s Mount, gradually bringing the energy and aura in his body to its peak.</p>
  <p>At that moment, the Big Dipper Sword was thrust out!</p>
  <p>Sword of the third wave!</p>
  <p>“So it’s like this!” Qing Shui was overjoyed, and continued with a series of thrusts. After some time, Qing Shui performed the Sword of the third wave once again, feeling very satisfied when he was able to strike out with raging power.</p>
  <p>Taking a small break, Qing Shui made a pot of All Aspect Nourishment Soup in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, and even extracted a drop of blood from the Golden Medicinal Turtle to add it to the soup.</p>
  <p>He continued to cook it until there were about two bowls worth of soup before he drank them all. Then, he continued to cultivate the Ancient Strengthening Technique. When he completed the 90 cycles, he felt especially comfortable, as if he had just took a cold water bath in the scorching summer.</p>
  <p>After allowing his body to fully recuperate and completing his usual assignments, it was about time for Qing Shui to leave the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He washed up and changed into a clean set of clothes. He had stored quite a number of clothes in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p>The moment before Qing Shui left the realm, Qing Shui caught a glance of the vibrant Flower of Life! Qing Shui’s heart skipped a beat…</p>

 <p>Qing Shui walked into Huoyun Liu-Li’s bedroom and saw that everything was purple in color, even her sleepwear. Earlier, Qing Shui did not pay any heed to the surroundings.</p>
 <p>He then used the Saintly Hands to gently pat, rub, and knead her body, channeling the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique into her body as he built up her body’s foundation, strengthened her constitution, and stimulated her body’s deep potential.</p>
 <p>He then continued four hours of “Duo Cultivation”, after which Qing Shui felt that Huoyun Liu-Li’s body was already starting to regain a bit of its vitality.</p>
 <p>Only when the sky turned dark did Qing Shui stop. He smiled. Huoyun Liu-Li’s life was now safe, but it was hard to tell if she would be able to wake up.</p>
 <p>In the Immortal Sword Sect!</p>
 <p>“Two idiots….” The middle-aged man dressed in purple bellowed loudly.</p>
 <p>“Sovereign, who did you say did it? Canghai?” A burly middle-aged man who was like a metal tower asked, unconcerned.</p>
 <p>“Dead in Bloody Street. Who would know who did it? To think that they were done in. It wasn’t done by that Canghai b*stard. They did not leave the Canghai residence.” At the mention of this, Immortal Sword Sect’s Sovereign could not help but start cursing.</p>
 <p>At that moment, a young man around the age of thirty years old came in, wearing clothes that commoners wore. He appeared extremely ordinary.</p>
 <p>“Sovereign, we found out the truth!” The young man bowed and said. His voice was so ordinary that there was not a hint of uniqueness to it. Even if after a person had listened to it for a few times, it would still be hard to remember his voice.</p>
 <p>“Speak!” The middle-aged man dressed in purple twitched his brows and said.</p>
 <p>The two rows of elderly men with various hues of gray and white hair had also perked up their ears and looked toward that ordinary young man.</p>
 <p>“It’s that young man who came to Canghai residence who did it!”</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>“…”</p>
 <p>“Speak in more detail, don’t leave out anything!” The middle-aged man dressed in purple hollered, his eyes wide open in fury.</p>
 <p>The young man spoke tirelessly, as if he had seen it with his own eyes. He shared the story roughly, causing all of the Immortal Sword Sect’s elders to gasp a breath of cold air.</p>
 <p>The young man left!</p>
 <p>“We can’t let this person stay alive, we can’t let this person stay alive!” This was Immortal Sword Sect’s Sovereign’s immediate conclusion.</p>
 <p>“Sovereign, we must definitely eliminate this person; if not, the Immortal Sword Sect will not be able to survive past twenty years.” An old man with a strong build said affirmatively. He had a pair of spirited eyes.</p>
 <p>“Twenty years? Elder Zhuge is being too conservative.” Immortal Sword Sect’s Sovereign smiled bitterly and said.</p>
 <p>“How would it be possible for a young, inexperienced chap be able to eradicate our Immortal Sword Sect?” An old man with triangular shaped eyes said in disdain.</p>
 <p>“Fool!”</p>
 <p>A deep and low voice came, giving a heart-throbbing feeling.</p>
 <p>“Old Ancestor!”</p>
 <p>Everyone in the hall bowed to the old man who had suddenly appeared. The old man was in a suit of white clothes, and his hair was let down such that it was even covering his eyes. Occasionally, his white, hollow right eye could be seen through his swaying hair.</p>
 <p>“Without me, just that young chap alone would be able to wipe off all of you within five years time.” The old man walked up to stand beside the Immortal Sword Sect’s Sovereign and snorted.</p>
 <p>“Old Ancestor, should we eradicate them completely?” Immortal Sword Sect’s Sovereign bent down slightly and asked.</p>
 <p>“This is but of course. Chi Er, send down the instructions. Those who have come across those people from Canghai’s residence! So long as they leave the Southern Pass from today onwards, have them disappear. You yourself will prepare to head to Canghai’s residence when the time comes. Have a good look at the my battle with Canghai- it should be very beneficial for your cultivation.”</p>
 <p>“As Old Ancestor commands!”</p>
 <p>The old man had long disappeared from the hall!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used a thin blanket on the bed to cover Huoyun Liu-Li’s lower body all the way to her chest. He then walked out slowly and saw that Canghai Mingyue had been standing at the door for four hours.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I’m feeling very upset!” Canghai Mingyue said softly when Qing Shui walked to her.</p>
 <p>“Everyone is very upset. Liu-Li will be very happy when she wakes up. She’s willing to do anything for you out of her own free will. Only when you’re fine would she be happy.” Qing Shui smiled and looked at that frown of hers.</p>
 <p>“I’ll come take a look at her at a later time, about four hours later. You should go have some rest!” Qing Shui’s hands twitched, but he put them down and left.</p>
 <p>Back in his room, Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, falling asleep after lying down on the bed in the realm. He was too exhausted. He could not afford to rest in the time outside, so he went back to the realm to take a break.</p>
 <p>He slept for one whole day. After he woke up, he gradually performed a set of Taichi slowly because of the magnitude of his injuries. His body was beyond sturdy because he had been cultivating the Ancient Strengthening Technique. The healing rate was unbelievable. Moreover, the image of Yin-Yang in his mind kept on tempering and recuperating his bones, muscles, and veins.</p>
 <p>Although he was impaled through the stomach, he had already gradually recovered after half a day. Qing Shui knew that he had about half a month’s time each time in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, and his wounds would have long recovered by then, even though it would be only four hours outside. It was only because he had this heaven-defying treasure that he would dare take this risk.</p>
 <p>After waking up, Qing Shui felt more comfortable, and his injuries had mostly healed. Qing Shui planned to devote the next day to cultivating the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
 <p>The walnut-sized drop in the dantian did not get any larger after breaking through to the 90th cycle- it just seemed more compact, and some golden colored spots had appeared. The spots were the size of the tip of a needle, and were very bright!</p>
 <p>A majestic force rose from his dantian. That strong power felt very comfortable. The stream of Qi that was slow but seemingly impetuous circulated in the wide but firm meridian channels.</p>
 <p>Some golden spots appeared on the yellow Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. When the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique circulated through his injuries, these golden spots would enter the injured areas of his body and heal them.</p>
 <p>After breaking through to the 90th cycle, Qing Shui felt that his powers had soared and entered the accumulating phase. Upon reaching the 99th cycle, his powers would be accumulated to a horrifying degree.</p>
 <p>After cultivating the Ancient Strengthening Technique the whole day and healing his injuries with the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, Qing Shui had already almost healed completely. It only took one day! He was long used to this. In the past, he would never believe that he would only take less than two days to recover a hole in his stomach.</p>
 <p>Picking up the Big Dipper Sword, Qing Shui started to practice his sword techniques, trying to find that feeling back when he had performed the Sword of the third wave. Qing Shui was so agitated back then that he had incorporated the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palm into his sword technique.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui performed the Basic Sword Techniques over and over again. Having comprehended the profoundness of the Basic Sword Techniques, each sword swing was consecutively more solid than the last, as if the swing was like returning to nature’s simplicity. Each sword swing was direct and agile.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui recalled the feeling when he had used the Sword of the third wave. Back then he had just seen Huoyun Liu-Li’s injuries. The fury that he had experienced at that moment had allowed him to break through the obstacle to the 90th cycle.</p>
 <p>Just when that power had reached its pinnacle, he succeeded in performing the Sword of the third wave!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui seemed to have grasped something, but yet it seemed to be slipping through his hands!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui thought of the Tiger Form!</p>
 <p>“Mmmm!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui suddenly used his left hand to perform the Tiger Form, gradually raising his aura before he repeatedly performed the Tiger’s Mount, gradually bringing the energy and aura in his body to its peak.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the Big Dipper Sword was thrust out!</p>
 <p>Sword of the third wave!</p>
 <p>“So it’s like this!” Qing Shui was overjoyed, and continued with a series of thrusts. After some time, Qing Shui performed the Sword of the third wave once again, feeling very satisfied when he was able to strike out with raging power.</p>
 <p>Taking a small break, Qing Shui made a pot of All Aspect Nourishment Soup in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, and even extracted a drop of blood from the Golden Medicinal Turtle to add it to the soup.</p>
 <p>He continued to cook it until there were about two bowls worth of soup before he drank them all. Then, he continued to cultivate the Ancient Strengthening Technique. When he completed the 90 cycles, he felt especially comfortable, as if he had just took a cold water bath in the scorching summer.</p>
 <p>After allowing his body to fully recuperate and completing his usual assignments, it was about time for Qing Shui to leave the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He washed up and changed into a clean set of clothes. He had stored quite a number of clothes in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>The moment before Qing Shui left the realm, Qing Shui caught a glance of the vibrant Flower of Life! Qing Shui’s heart skipped a beat…</p>
