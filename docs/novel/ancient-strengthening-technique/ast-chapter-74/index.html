  <p><strong>AST 0074 – Heavenly Eye Technique and Holy Sacred Hands Technique</strong></p>
  <p><span style>When he returned back to the Qing Clan, Qing Shui saw Qing Yi was feeding the fishes and the turtles in the pond. Looking at the peaceful look on Qing Yi’s face, Qing Shui felt a sense of satisfaction in his heart.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Hearing footsteps approaching, a smile broke out on her face as Qing Yi raised her head and saw that it was Qing Shui. “Qing Shui, come here! Look at the size of these fishes, what happened? I didn’t seem to see them yesterday.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmm, I think yesterday the fishes were hiding beneath the water plants. However, what happened to the other smaller fishes and prawns? The black fish have a ferocious nature, and seem to be capable of eating anything, and growing at a rapid rate. I suspect that the other smaller fishes must have been eaten by them.” Qing Shui deduced.</span></p>
  <p><span style>These black fish, although bigger than the small fishes, were only at the size of a palm. When the black fish grew slightly larger inside his spatial realm, Qing Shui would sneakily transfer them out when they grew to the size of a palm. As for foot-long black fish, Qing Shui no longer dared to transfer them. They would eat everything they could see!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmm, that may be so, there are too many water plants. However, wouldn’t all the other small fishes and prawns be eaten by those black fish?” Qing Yi asked, as worry clouded her face.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If this continues, then a few days later we would have nothing left except black fish and turtles!” Qing Shui had long anticipated this result, after all the same thing happened inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“No worries, I will go and buy more of them in the future. Let’s try out the taste of some of the bigger fish.” Qing Shui already knew the taste, but he wanted to find an opportunity to give Qing Yi a chance to taste them too. Although the black fish have not grown to a satisfactory size, they were already big enough to be eaten.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hmm they are still too small. There is no hurry, if you want to eat, we can buy them outside.” Qing Yi said, smilingly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“There are so many of them in the pond, it doesn’t matter if they are a bit smaller in size, I can guarantee that those fish sold outside wouldn’t be as tasty as these,” Qing Shui laughed, as he directly caught a few fish.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Enough, enough!” Qing Yi called out, stopping Qing Shui, who was intending to catch a few more fish.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui knew that Qing Yi’s cooking skills were among the cream of the crop. He licked his lips, as he knew that in the future even without him saying anything, there would be something delicious for dinner every night.</span></p>
  <p><span style>——-</span></p>
  <p><span style>The sound of the chopsticks on the dinner table clicked at a speed that left Qing Shui astounded. He bitterly looked at his bowl of rice and his uncle Qing Hu, and Qing Shan and Qing Shi beside him who were devouring the fish with gusto.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I have never eaten such a delicious fish, it tastes even better than what we had at the Yu He Inn!” Qing Hu rubbed his belly and mentioned with satisfaction, as Qing Shan and Qing Shi both rapidly nodded their heads in agreement.</span></p>
  <p><span style>During the night, Qing Shui once again entered inside his spatial realm. He sighed, thinking that this place was still the best. Another day had passed, and the foot-long black fish had stopped growing in size, the only difference was that the luster of their scales were even brighter, while the turtles on the other hand, grew slightly bigger and increasingly nimble.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui could finally let himself relax. Initially he thought that the black fish would continue to grow in size, and if that had been the case, then he would have no solutions for it. After all the size of the crystal pond in his spatial realm was limited too.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As for the turtles, in normal circumstances, they would already enjoy a long lifespan. In this world of the nine continents, there were many wild beasts, ferocious beasts and even desolate beasts, who died of old age before they could form their demonic cores at the age of 500. Only beasts which could meet certain fortuitous events, such as consuming various spiritual herbs and fruits to extend their lifespans, or creatures such as turtles and tortoises. It was extremely tough to evolve into a demonic beast.</span></p>
  <p><span style>That was why, Qing Shui had no worries that the fish would evolve into demonic beasts. It was even harder for beasts to reach the Xiantian state, tougher even than ascending the heavens. As for the black turtles, there were various records of turtles over 1,000 years old, but still couldn’t even be considered at the desolate level. There was no guarantee that beasts would evolve and form their core after 500 years.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However for meat of turtles, the older they were, the more nourishing they would be! That was why Qing Shui had no qualms about rearing them till they are a few hundred years old, or even above 1,000 years old, so he could taste their meat.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Legend has it that the meat from demonic beasts were the tastiest, but those who had really tasted it, could be counted on one hand. Qing Shui felt an itch in his heart. In the future when he was strong enough, he would definitely hunt a few demonic beasts in order to taste their flesh.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Inside the spatial realm, there were many techniques for Qing Shui to focus his training upon. However, he wasn’t the slightest bit concerned. After all, what he had was nearly unlimited time.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When he was hungry, he would simply grill a fish, when he was tired, he would drink some water and take a rest. He had even moved a bed inside the spatial realm. Other than that, Qing Shui also discovered that the spatial realm was capable of keeping even seasoning ingredients fresh, and thus, he had moved a large quantity of salt and other seasoning ingredients to be stored inside the spatial realm. After all, seasoning was like the joy of life, food with no seasoning added, would only be 2nd grade at best, dull and tasteless.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Primordial Fire!” Qing Shui extended both his palms, and on the surface of both palms were tiny grey-colored embers, rotating around. Using that flame, Qing Shui slowly grilled the fishes. </span></p>
  <p><span style>The primordial fire saps his energy level too quickly. Qing Shui could only maintain the Yin-Yang Flame for about four hours. After all, he was only at the 3rd layer of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Sitting down inside the spatial realm contently, after his hunger had been sated, Qing Shui once again tidied up all the information that was unlocked after his breakthrough. To his immense surprise, he discovered two other techniques – Heavenly Vision Technique, and Holy Sacred Hands! </span></p>
  <p><span style>After studying the content of both techniques, Qing Shui discovered that the techniques were medical-based. For the Heavenly Vision Technique, when he activated the Qi from the Ancient Strengthening Technique, then it would grant him an “x-ray” kind of vision, where he could peer at the inner organs and mystical energy channels in the human body in order to pinpoint the area of injury or problem easily.</span></p>
  <p><span style>While the Holy Sacred Hands, was able to set bones, increase the accuracy of his hand movements, and increase his speed and agility. Other than that, when this technique was activated, Qing Shui could infuse his hands with the Qi from the Ancient Strengthening Technique, and transfer it to the patient’s body, giving the patient’s body immense benefits.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was already numbed from the discoveries. Merely just unlocking Alchemy would already be sufficient to last him for his life time. To think that now, there were two other innate techniques that could be used in conjunction, increasing his medical skills. Each one of them caused Qing Shui to tremble in anticipation, the Ancient Strengthening Technique was truly the best indeed!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Unlocking Alchemy through enlightenment, could it be that the other greyed-out sections in his sea of consciousness could only be unlocked after even more bouts of enlightenment?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Enlightenment! Peering into the way of the Heavens! When would it be again before he could experience another one?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Luckily for Qing Shui, both the basics of the Heavenly Vision and the Holy Sacred Hands techniques were extremely easy to be proficient in. All of the techniques had the same concept, they were all dependent on the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</span></p>
  <p><span style>What a pity that his strength was only at the 3rd Layer. If he broke through to the 4th, without a doubt, Qing Shui knew that he would definitely step inside the realm of Xiantian!</span></p>
