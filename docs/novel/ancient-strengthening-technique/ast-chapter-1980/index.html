 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman did not expect Qing Shui to help her. She only told Qing Shui her condition since she already troubled Qing Shui. Therefore, it was just a reckless act out of hopelessness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She just let it all out as a way of relief. After all, she never mentioned it to anyone, as a woman in despair she didn’t even bother about it anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui realized that she was a cultivator after listening to her, but he did not know how powerful she was. Qing Shui asked after thinking, “What level is your previous cultivation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman did not expect Qing Shui’s question. Still, she replied, “I was previously at the Peak False God level, but I practiced the Yin-Yang Finger. It is an evil technique. Even the low leveled Divine warriors were not comparable to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In that case, you should have a great speed,” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Yin-yang Reversal Steps coupled with the Yin-yang Finger is considered as a superior move, they are a perfect match,” The woman explained precisely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What about this. I will help you recover your strength and you can stay here for some time or get a place nearby. Just don’t be too far away from me. I fear that I can’t make it on time if there was something happening. Other than that, the clinic will be opening tomorrow, you should come too!” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can recover my cultivation!? I’ll surely come tomorrow,” The woman startled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you have the cultivation previously, I suppose I could help.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui signaled the woman to reach her hand out and he checked her pulse. The woman had fair skin; she was a temperamental beauty. She was indeed pretty. Thus, her aura was outstanding at the first glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman had empty Dantian. Her meridians were broken like two big leaks on a pipe, the water could only leak out instead of moving forward. Hence, she could no longer focus her Qi in the Dantian and form a cyclone. She could be considered as a disabled person if she could not retain her Origin Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, Qing Shui helped to connect her broken meridians. With his Saintly Hands and Force of Rebirth, he healed her meridians completely in no time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Next, he helped to draw her Qi. Qing Shui used the Strength Infusion and his energy as the inducer to enter the Dantian directly. The long-term abandoned Dantian regained moisture like a spring source. It began its normal function and produced Origin Qi continuously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that he had succeeded. Though it seemed simple, he needed to recover many other body functions besides connecting her broken meridians. Otherwise, she would not regain her strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman gathered her strength again in front of Qing Shui. Time flew gradually. In an hour’s time, the woman recovered. Currently, she was almost at the level of Divinity and her power was greater than before her cultivation was destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman was astonished, she started to believe in anything Qing Shui said before. As he said, he could guarantee her safety and he was not an ordinary man. She believed it now. ‘Every cloud has a silver lining’, it sparked a new hope for her desperation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was spellbound after looking at her. Her appearance changed as her strength recovered. The change was slight and strange, but it was obvious like the transformation of plain white to multicolor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman’s aura became more prominent and even her face became more lively. She looked very beautiful and approachable. Thus, Qing Shui understood why the Lang Clan had destroyed her cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was a beauty who could ruin the whole nation. She needed no charm and amorous appearances to attain that level. Any man would be attracted just by seeing her at the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was impressed by the man who hurt her. This man must be extremely cruel to be able to do that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sir, how can I repay your favor?” said the woman seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, “There are three floors here, the third floor is your bedroom and the second floor is mine. If you want to repay the favor, just help me out in my shop for a while.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman was startled, she did not expect Qing Shui to say that. She knew Qing Shui intended to help her and nodded happily, “Thanks, thanks!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re welcome and no worries. This is maybe a destiny. It’s already so magical that you have to meet me in this big world. After all, there are so many people in it. It seemed like a fate that we have this bond. Are you perhaps interested in the Art of Healing?” Qing Shui asked after thinking for a bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m now already half a doctor for my son’s sake. I’ve been learning about the Art of Healing for a few years.” replied the woman enthusiastically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had a rough plan after listening to her. Thus, he asked her some medical-related questions, he started with several simple questions and then some harder ones. He realized that the woman had a great talent in this subject.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui asked about many herbs subsequently and she was able to answer their names, uses, ages, contraindications, and combinations. Her memory was incredible and she was extremely brilliant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took his booklet out. Besides his experience, there were justifications of many illnesses and treatments stated. The booklet was amazingly precious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Memorize these. Since you already have a good foundation. After this, I will teach you something and you can start seeing patients and save lives,” Qing Shui said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This, this, why are you so nice to me?” said the woman after a brief hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was pleased, “Alright, I did it so that you can help me. After all, I’m alone here, it will probably be very busy after the opening of the clinic. By that time, I can’t manage this place alone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, the woman remained silent and kept it in her heart. Some things were not to be forgotten for the entire life, it could be either a good or bad thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

He was as respectful as usual to Qing Shui, he looks like a smart man with sharp eyes. He knew Qing Shui’s terrific strength after the previous fight. In fact, he had yet to meet someone who could push him into desperation. The Shang Clan might have this ability, but he was not qualified to speak with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was delighted to see Lang Ci, or else, it was too lonely and quiet here. Qing Shui did not inform the Northern Underworld Immortal Palace and Luan Luan, as it was unnecessary. He did not bother about others’ opinion and needed no one to support him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was good to be lonely, he was not afraid because of his strength and ability!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman woke up early too, but the little boy was not awake yet. Lang Ci saw the woman and secretly showed his big thumb to Qing Shui. However, after a moment, Lang Ci changed his expression instantly, “Lady Lang…”</span></p>
