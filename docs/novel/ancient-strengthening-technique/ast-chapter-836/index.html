 <p><strong>AST 836 - Bringing the fight to their doors, A bunch of degenerates</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Yun Duan. He was aroused to see that sort of docile look on a matured and elegant woman like her.</p>
 <p>She was the most beautiful woman in Heavenly Beast City, even Long Lingyun could not compare to her. Yet, Qing Shui was more amazed by the fate between the both of them. Without the events at Heavenly Palace, he wondered what would have happen today.</p>
 <p>Fate is an amazing and mysterious thing. One cannot see or touch it. It only amazes a person at times, like in this moment.</p>
 <p>Seeing the uncharacteristically bashful Yun Duan, Qing Shui averted his gaze. The others have already noticed their ambiguous relationship. They knew that it was the first time that the beautiful young lady of the Yun Clan actually showed such a docile expression to a man.</p>
 <p>“Let’s not delay. Let’s go to Hu Wei Adventure Guild now!” Qing Shui said softly, looking at Yun Duan regaining her composure.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, Hu Wei...”</p>
 <p>“Trust me!” Qing Shui said gently. With a single gesture, his Fire Bird appeared in the sky. Many people were shocked by the ear-piercing call from the huge Fire Bird. The clear sound from the Fire Bird was much more awe-inspiring and regal than any other average demonic beast.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, Auntie, I will bring Yun Duan to Hu Wei Adventure Guild and put an end to things. You don’t have to worry. I won’t let anything happen to your daughter,” Qing Shui said to the scholarly-looking middle-aged man and his wife, smiling.</p>
 <p>“Okay. Auntie won’t stop you and won’t try to dissuade you but please be careful.” There were tears of happiness on his beautiful wife’s face. She said this looking at Qing Shui joyfully.</p>
 <p>After acknowledging the others with a nod, Qing Shui held Yun Duan’s snow-white wrist and leaped up into the sky, riding his Fire Bird. Yun Duan could not help trembling a little.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could not help feeling that women are a marvel. Even though they were not familiar with each other they have had sexual contact after all. Despite the years that have passed, he could stir her emotions just by holding her wrist.</p>
 <p>He did not know whether he should be happy or crestfallen. Normally, in this situation, one would feel nervous and embarrassed, not knowing whether the other party would accept or reject them. But he felt anxious because he had such emotions when he thought about what she said previously.</p>
 <p>It turned out that he also had feelings for her!</p>
 <p>If he thought about it carefully, he did long for her woefully but occasionally he would think of her and even have the impulse to look for her.</p>
 <p>Yun Duan gave Qing Shui the directions and his Fire Bird stretched out its wings and disappeared from the sight of the crowd.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Yun Duan stood side by side on his Fire Bird’s back. A breeze blew as their sleeves fluttered behind them. Yun Duan’s dress danced in the wind, making her elegant refined face even more poised and graceful.</p>
 <p>“Thank you!” Yun Duan said to Qing Shui again.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned to look at the woman standing close to him. In the past, they parted ways injuring each other. Yet, when they met again, they seemed to cherish the feelings between them.</p>
 <p>“You said that many times. Just take it as if I owe you a favor. Actually, I think of you too. I don’t know why but I always felt that I owed you something and I just want to see that you are living well.” Qing Shui smiled as he looked to the distance.</p>
 <p>Hearing Qing Shui’s words, Yun Duan smiled, showing the gentle curve of her lips which was extremely alluring.</p>
 <p>“You’ve matured!” Yun Duan said looking at Qing SHui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned for a moment before he smiled, “You’ve also matured a lot from that time.”</p>
 <p>“Am I old now?” Yun Duan asked softly, she sounded slightly anxious. She was indeed older than Qing Shui so she was a little worried about it. Even though she could still be considered young she could not help feeling a little awkward.</p>
 <p>“No. How can the most beautiful woman in Heavenly Beast city get old? When everything is over, I’ll give you something, it will extend your youthful looks another 30 years.” Qing Shui laughed lightheartedly.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, you are so powerful now. There is no one in Heavenly Palace stronger than you. Remembering the time when you were fighting with those rich brats seems so long ago.” Yun Duan had an indescribable feeling remember those past events.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, it’s there.”</p>
 <p>Just when Qing Shui was about to speak, Yun Duan pointed at the compound in a distance which looked similar to Cloud Adventurer Guild.</p>
 <p>“Let’s get down here.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not stay on his Fire Bird but pulled Yun Duan with him as they jumped down towards Hu Wei Adventure Guild. He purposely held her jade-like hand tightly.</p>
 <p>When they were in mid-air, Yun Duan looked at the unforgettable man by her side. She already trusted that he would bring her luck. She did not need fame and money but she did not know if he knew what she wanted.</p>
 <p>His Fire Bird called out loudly, quickly alerting multiple members in Hu Wei Adventurer Guild. When Qing Shui landed in the inner courtyard, many people had appeared near them.</p>
 <p>“Quick, inform the head, they are from Cloud Adventurer Guild. Just tell him that Yun Duan has arrived.”</p>
 <p>“Why didn’t Great Elder return?”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Yun Duan stood in the middle of the courtyard looking at the people who surrounded them. When Qing Shui observed their strength, he knew that they were just a common mob, so he wanted to wait for the core members of Hu Wei Adventurer Guild.</p>
 <p>“Lady Yun Duan, you can’t wait to get married so you came early to our Hu Wei Adventurer Guild, right?”</p>
 <p>After a short time, over ten people approached them from a distance. They were all about the age of Hu Yuanqing. They were probably the grandchildren of the Hu Clan.</p>
 <p>“Second brother, Grandfather is really too much. He is already so old and he has so many women. Now he won’t even give up on the most beautiful woman in Heavenly Beast City? I feel angry even as his grandson,” a sloppy looking man said.</p>
 <p>“Seventh brother, Grandfather is only marrying this woman as a strategic measure. Besides, elder brother was killed by this woman. Do you think she will have a good life living here,” the Second Brother taunted as he looked at Yun Duan.</p>
 <p>“So Second brother, you are saying that even if she is Grandfather’s wife in name, she is just a prisoner? Hehe…”the young man in red laughed.</p>
 <p>“What should we do if that woman commits suicide here at Hu Wei Adventurer Guild?” the seventh brother said worriedly.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. She won’t have a chance. She won’t die, since she had already agreed to join us, it means that she is afraid that we will deal with her family and the members of Cloud Adventurer Guild. We just need to use her family against her and she’ll do whatever we want,” the man said schemingly.</p>
 <p>From their conversation, Qing Shui felt that the man who was called second brother was a core member. A cruel smile flashed across his face as Yun Duan fumed. It was spine chilling to think what would have happened without Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the men in front of him. They looked refined but they were just beasts with human skins. With a flick of his sleeve, he shot out a Coldsteel Needle. Even though it was a little far, that man could not dodge with the level of his current abilities.</p>
 <p>The man did not even notice. He only felt a cold sensation on his forehead and immediately lost consciousness. The others only realized that something was wrong when the man fell to the ground.</p>
 <p>“Second brother is dead!”</p>
 <p>“They killed Second Brother!”</p>
 <p>A stream of fresh blood poured from the middle of his forehead and just like that the man died.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>At this time, all the people suddenly felt chilled to the bone. They had not even noticed when the opponent attacked and their brother was killed. Furthermore, that man was the strongest among them. It was obvious that the young man in front of them was the culprit, since Yun Duan wouldn’t dare to do that and she did not have the ability to do so.</p>
 <p>Since he came here to kill, it was not necessary to spare the group of degenerates in front of him. Qing Shui lifted both arms and a sharp boom rang out in the air.</p>
 <p>The youths of the Hu Clan immediately died, without even one survivor.</p>
 <p>At the same time, ten elders ran out. When they saw their dead younger family members sprawled out everywhere. They rushed at Qing Shui and Yun Duan furiously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui acted like nothing had happened. He looked at the old man who resembled Hu Wenlong. That man was also tall and muscular but he lacked the aggression that Hu Wenlong possessed and instead had a shrewdness. There were many others who also resembled Hu Wenlong.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, the person leading them is the head of the Hu Wei Adventurer Guild, Hu Yunlong. Four of the others are his brothers. They are all the elders of Hu Wei Adventurer Guild. Usually they don’t involve themselves with the matters of the Guild,” Yun Duan informed Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Within a city like Heavenly Beast City, it was quite a feat that there were people with such capabilities. Since the place was quite remote and near Tiger Gorge mountain, there were pros and cons. It wasn’t a remarkable place so they don’t get attacked by other powerful enemies.</p>
 <p>“You want to marry Yun Duan?” Qing SHui looked at Hu Yunlong and said calmly.</p>
 <p>“Brat, don’t you know that this is Hu Wei Adventurer Guild?” Hu Yunlong glared at Qing Shui saying in a solemn voice. He was already very mad but he did not rush over to cut his opponent down because he thought that it would be too easy on that young man.</p>
 <p>“Of course! Not only do I know but I will crush this place. That useless Hu Wenlong has already been killed by me.” Qing Shui laughed, looking back at Hu Yunlong.</p>
 <p>The members of the Hu Clan were dumbfounded when they heard what Qing Shui said. This was like a bolt from the blue. They didn’t believe it at first but then they thought about the fact that Hu Wenlong had not returned. It could be that they had missed each other but if so why did these two people have the guts to be here?</p>
 <p>Boom! Boom!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s Fire Bird shot out its Nether Fireball and started burning the buildings. The raging fire and the sound of crumbling buildings caused chaos. There were many people in Hu Wei Adventurer Guild, with the buildings falling apart, a crowd started to surround them yet no one dared to get close.</p>
 <p>Just then, a middle-aged man ran anxiously in front of Hu Yunlong and whispered a few words. Hu Yunlong’s face immediately turned as white as a sheet, he looked at Qing Shui as if he was seeing his nightmares come alive.</p>
