 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that what he said was too good to be true. After all, the Great Confucian Empire would not be unconcerned after such a huge humiliation. Even if there were only a few Masters of the Great Confucian left, they would not let it go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young man, What do you think about my previous suggestion?” The leading old man spoke calmly. It was not gentle but very serious and yet, it did not sound imposing. In fact, it was comforting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took a look at the surrounding. It was the middle of the sky, the countryside residences below extended boundlessly. Most of them were houses arranged orderly. It was a phenomenon of natural progress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui retorted back at the old man, “The Great Confucian Empire was worse than I expected. I have no interest in the Great Confucian Empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man was not surprised by Qing Shui’s reply as a rare smile crept on his face, “What you said was indeed the truth. The Great Confucian Empire is actually divided into three sects. The one you killed belonged to one sect. Three of us belong to one sect, and another sect between us and them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cheng Yuan, they had just killed my elder brother. What do you mean by that? Aren’t you afraid that the Fox Wolf Immortal Master would get involved with this?” The injured Grand State Master Tai Zhai roared in rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do I need you to tell me what to do? The Fox Wolf Immortal Master is your master. That is none of my business. Go seek revenge from this young man if you can.” The old man was expressionless, but it was obvious that he was irritated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Regardless of our own positions, we are from the Great Confucian Empire. You are now being hostile to your own kind by colluding with the enemies.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Taizhai Zhu, don’t be petty on me. It doesn’t work. The Little Prince believes me. On the other hand, Do you really think that the Fox Wolf Immortal Master has the full authority in the Great Confucian Empire? How ridiculous.” The old man seemed to despise his arrogant and bossy manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fine. I will surely inform the Fox Wolf Immortal Master about today’s incident. Hopefully, the Little Prince can defend you by then. Let’s go,” Taizhai Zhu planned to leave after finishing his line resolutely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did I allow you to leave?” Qing Shui called out abruptly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Taizhai Zhu shivered and turned around to look at Qing Shui. Keeping the same expression, he said, “What, you want to take my life?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It would only take the slightest effort to kill you. As it stands, you came to murder me today. It would be too easy if I were to let you go.” Qing Shui stared at Taizhai Zhu with a cold gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bastard, you’ve already killed my eldest brother. Don’t get too ahead of yourself. I would certainly come back for justice in the future.” Said Taizhai Zhu while trembling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that so? In that case, why don’t I settle this matter today instead of waiting for you to come back? I have other things to do in the future.” Qing Shui’s eyes lit up with a burning desire to murder. He dashed toward Taizhai Zhu at once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew very well that they were completely at feud now after killing Taizhai Zhu’s eldest brother. Besides, it was clear that these two brothers were not up to any good. They would go all means to reach their goals. Also, they were capable warriors. Qing Shui felt uneasy to let this man live.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not encourage anyone to be ruthless but he was not against it at the same time. Under special occasions, it was necessary to kill to be the last one standing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a malicious bastard, trying to kill me. Cheng Yuan, do you really intend to watch this happen as he kills our men from the Great Confucian Empire? Even if we don’t get along, we are unanimous against the outsiders. If today’s incident reaches the Great Emperor, not even the Little Prince could defend you.” Taizhai Zhu yelled loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Cheng Yuan’s expression had finally changed. In split seconds, he appeared between Qing Shui and Taizhai Zhu. Taizhai Zhu was right. They were all from the Great Confucian Empire no matter what. Though opposing each other, the force behind them was the only justification. The Great Emperor would not want this to happen. Internal conflicts were fine, but this situation was not allowed in the presence of outsiders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young man, what do you think of my previous suggestion? The Great Confucian Empire is not as unbearable as you thought. It will only benefit you to join the Great Confucian Empire. Besides, your movement will not be restricted and you can enjoy convenience in this area that you can’t imagine.” Cheng Yuan seemed to have a preference for Qing Shui and tried to persuade him to the best of his ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old man, why would you defend this kind of man?” Qing Shui ignored Cheng Yuan’s question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I actually want him to die as well, but not now. For my sake, everything will be settled if you can join the Great Confucian Empire. You don’t have to worry about your friends’ safety. You are currently strong, but still far behind and cannot go against the Great Confucian Empire all alone.” Cheng Yuan was straightforward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui clearly knew the eminence of the Great Confucian Empire. Or else, it would not take a leading role in this region. An Empire that was stronger than the Immortal Sect, it was nothing weaker than the Immortal Palace as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui recalled the Five Tiger Immortal Sect. He wondered if the Five Tiger Immortal Sect could be compared to the Immortal Palace. Maybe, he was capable of handling Tantai Lingyan’s affair but unfortunately, he could not find the location of the Five Tiger Immortal Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old man, I really don’t think so. You are not the chief of the Great Confucian Empire. If you were the chief, I might consider. However, you’re not. I am really not interested,” Qing Shui shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not want to join any force at the present. Though the forces he joined were not absolutely strong, they were like an eagle spreading wings and soaring up high. They would certainly be one of the rulers in the sky someday.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was confident. Without forming his own sect, he was the Patriarch of the Heavenly Palace. Both Sunset Sea King Palace and Dragonwolf Palace were associated with Qing Shui but those were not considered his own sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s forces were fully formed but still far behind the Great Confucian Empire’s level. However, together with the few women, Qing Shui had gathered enough strength. He would be able to take charge soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I understand. What about this, young man? You can take a few days to consider the proposal. Let’s stop here for today, alright?” Cheng Yuan said after a brief moment of thoughts. He knew that he could not force Qing Shui as it would only bring the opposite outcome. Cheng Yuan thought he had a good intuition and that this young man definitely had a great future potential.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded after thinking for a while, “Sure. I’ll think about it, old man.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought it would be for the best to avoid the irreconcilable adversaries with the Great Confucian Empire for the time being, regardless of the upcoming situation. Besides, Qing Shui trusted the three actual Masters of Great Confucian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was an internal conflict in the flourishing Great Confucian Empire currently. As Cheng Yuan said earlier, the Great Confucian Empire was divided into three sects, the Fox Wolf Immortal Master, the Little Prince, and another unnamed one. It would not be easy to stand a place between these two men. From the admiration and respect of the Taizhai brothers to the Fox Wolf Immortal Master, Qing Shui knew that he was no piece of cake. To be able to match with such a person, the Little Prince and another man would surely be tough as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
