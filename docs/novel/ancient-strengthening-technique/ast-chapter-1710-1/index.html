 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Wavemoon Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. He didn’t know much about them but he had heard of them often. Because the Watermoon Cavern and the Wavemoon Clan were equally famous, they certainly had strength and were the strongest in this part of the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally just the Watermoon Cavern had already made Qing Shui’s hands tied. However, his current strength had increased a lot by almost five times. If he were to face the Watermoon Cavern, it wouldn’t be as bad as it went before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait a minute!” Qing Shui looked at the young man who was coming over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, what is it?” the young man was watching Qing Shui. His face was serene and his expression as calm as water. if Qing Shui hadn’t seen the shift in his expression as he caught sight of the three women, he would have thought that this man was just like water and rock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not sure what you meant with your previous comment. Why are you thanking me for no apparent reason?” Qing Shui asked immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no way that Qing Shui did not have known what the young man meant, but he didn’t like watching this man being a pirate with such “elegance”. He needed to make that man show his ugly side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man was amazed. Of course, he didn’t think that Qing Shui knew nothing about what he meant. He also knew what Qing Shui was fishing for with this statement. It was just that he didn’t understand how Qing Shui was able to continue speaking like before, after he had mentioned the Wavemoon Clan. It was something that made him do a double take. Perhaps it was because he was accomplished, or because of the women around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A young man needs to understand how to adapt to circumstances, and not embarrass themselves.” The young man said elegantly to Qing Shui, his face showing the traces of a confident smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui heard what the young man said, he turned his head at the three women beside him, smiling. it seemed that the man facing him thought that he wasn’t worthy of the women beside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, then what you’re saying is that you’re trying to be a pirate for the Wavemoon Clan.” Qing Shui smirked at this man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man’s face color changed. It was an obvious fact that the Wavemoon Clan was respected greatly by him. Pretty much anyone in this region would show respect to anyone that mentions the Wavemoon Clan. He was the direct descendant of the Clan, holding an important position in it. With great natural gifts, it was even possible for him to take over the clan some day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young one, I hope you know the consequences of what you said. You won’t be able to take it.” Although the young man shrunk his forehead, he still said this with poise, but the coldness in his eyes had already created a want for killing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only himself knew that the reason he activated his bloodthirst wasn’t solely because of the insult against the Wavemoon Clan. Of course, that alone was enough. At least it was to him, but the true reason was the three women, and that was the best excuse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui naturally saw through this facade and knew that the way things were going won’t be good. He wasn’t one to be afraid of trouble, especially when his opponent put a strong focus on his women. That was something that couldn’t be tolerated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, you’re one of those weaklings that rely on a name. Everything that comes out of your mouth is the Wavemoon Clan. I don’t even know what you really are without the Wavemoon Clan.” Qing Shui said this without giving any ground, and to someone who was very insecure about themselves, it was extremely effective.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this instant, the complex of the young man’s face changed. From when he was little to now, even his own elders never talked to him like this. In addition, even among people on his own level, he was considered to be extremely strong. Despite so, people like him had a weakness in their hearts. It was that they couldn’t reject their family when they needed help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it were someone normal then they wouldn’t have had a reaction. After all, he didn’t think about people with a cultivation realm lower than his, but he felt that Qing Shui wasn’t someone normal. Through this conversation, he was able to discern that this bloodsoaked young man had reached his success now through many toils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that someone without a rich background wouldn’t acknowledge someone like himself, who was helped by his own background. Anyone would be willing to be admitted, especially those people that were affirmed through their success. The use of a clan wasn’t something to be taken lightly, but the most important was that they worked for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who do you think you are, being so impudent? You’re just a frog at the bottom of a well. Did you really think that just because you did something, you have the right to disregard everyone else? Today, I will show you how weak you really are.” The young man stared at Qing Shui confidently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui laughed, saying: “Alright. Now you look like a man.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sir, this person is really weird. Maybe…” The old man in front said this with worry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seventh Uncle, I have the freedom to do this,” The young man quickly interrupted the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man was a little disgusted by Qing Shui’s behavior. Now that he was being made fun of by Qing Shui and the old man treating him like a child, as though he were not a match for this young man, he was a little unhappy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the old man called the Seventh Uncle wanted to say something, another old man stopped him by reaching his arm out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man was called Huang Wu and was a descendant of the Wavemoon Clan’s Huang Kuilang. This Huang Wu was the youngest of Huang Kuilang’s grandchildren, who was a very talented individual, and one of the forerunners of the Wavemoon Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, whether you come out or not it doesn’t matter. If you lose, someone behind you would show their face and maybe even come all the way.” Qing Shui’s words shattered the thoughts of the young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because Qing Shui knew this man had an ulterior motive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry, you can’t win.” Claimed Huang Wu</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What if I do?” Qing Shui smiled at Huang Wu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We shall leave and will not hinder you in any way.” Huang Wu said after some thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From his standpoint, he was already giving up a lot in this way. If it were up to a Qing Shui from before, he wouldn’t have let him get off that easily. However, at this time he didn’t feel like negotiating, and nodded: “I hope you can do what you say, lest you bring shame to the Wavemoon Clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was still some pressure needed for his big ego.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew, that in the first place, if Huang Wu lost and embarrassed the Wavemoon Clan, they would come back. He was just hoping that it wouldn’t be today and that this one engagement wouldn’t make them his enemy. Whenever that happened, he didn’t like the feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui couldn’t think of another option. Sometimes it was like this, his surroundings arousing the envy of others, no matter if it was a treasure or a beautiful person. Another one was if someone needed to go through Qing Shui before they could continue racing to the top and tried to make you a stepping stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re also underestimating the Wavemoon Clan.” Anyone could make bold claims. Sometimes, it didn’t matter what you said, as long as you could silence your opponent forever, then matters like this would be resolved. and wouldn’t continue. No one else would even know what had happened or what had been said.</span></p>
