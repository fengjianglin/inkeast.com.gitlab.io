 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn’t the first time that Qing Shui had heard of the Titan Ox. If they really ran into one, they could only blame their luck. However, he was still filled with anticipation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These Blackfire Demon Oxen weren’t much of a threat to the two of them. They merely had superiority in terms of numbers. The two of them guarded as they sped along with great speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t kill any because there were simply too many and the smell of blood would drive the whole herd crazy. It would better serve their purpose if they merely defended and left this area in haste.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui held onto Qin Qing’s hand and used the Nine Continent Steps to traverse a great distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui flashed by, evading the oxen skillfully. In the distance, he could see the silhouette of a majestic mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sister Qin, have you come here before?” Qing Shui asked as they walked side by side. This place was very tranquil, covered with a variety of plants and flowers. Some rare medical herbs could be seen here and there as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn’t by chance. It was normal for such places to have valuable and rare herbs. This was also the reason why the demonic beasts here were so strong. With heavenly treasures and earthly ingredients, although they weren’t in abundance, the demonic beasts would still have a chance to obtain them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No. The furthest I’ve been to was the Poison Dragon Pool.” Qin Qing smiled. She struggled a bit trying to slip her hand out of Qing Shui’s hold but she didn’t succeed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In that case, how do you know there are valuable materials here?” Qing Shui held her hand even tighter, as though afraid she would slip out of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing was also somewhat helpless, but she didn’t really object to Qing Shui holding her hand as he didn’t do anything outrageous. She would just put up a front and tried to struggle a little but soon let it be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“An old man told me before his death. I once helped him before and he suggested to come back once I had enough strength.” Qin Qing lightly replied and when her thoughts were cast back in the past, she felt a little melancholic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t say anything. He only used his strength and held her hand slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go, we will find the Titan Ox Mountain based on memories and go for a look!” Qin Qing’s countenance returned back to normal as she pulled Qing Shui ahead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they could see the silhouette of the mountain in the distance, it was still very far away. After some time, Qing Shui noticed that Qin Qing was still allowing him to hold her hand. Hence, he couldn’t be bothered to use the Nine Continent Steps and chose to slowly walk there while enjoying the scenery. This was also a type of satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing actually felt a contradiction in her heart. She could clearly sense that Qing Shui was in love with her. He also treated her very well and would take care of her even during combat. He was very capable and even had a good personality...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing sighed, as she had no way to suppress the last bit of resistance in her heart. Many times she thought she might as well just marry him and get things over with but she was still reluctant to share him with other women.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this world, it was very normal for a man to have several women. Only the most ordinary of men would have one woman and that woman wouldn’t be a beautiful one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a man like Qing Shui, Qin Qing felt that even if he had no other women now, he would eventually have more women sooner or later. Women would rush like a moth to the flame for such an outstanding man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sister Qin, I had a strange dream. Do you want to hear it?” Qing Shui could sense the conflict in Qin Qing’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sure. Tell me about it.” Qin Qing cleared her mind as she spoke gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I dreamt that I was in a strange world. In that world, ordinary humans were everywhere. There were no demonic beasts, no cultivators, and it was a world ruled by science. The countries in that world were similar to the dynasties here. And in that world, every man could only marry one woman. If they married more, that would be a crime. I dreamt that you were my wife in that world, and you were really happy…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui mixed in truth and lies, as he spoke of a scenario common in his past life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The world you dreamt of sounds really wonderful.” Qin Qing smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, I had this dream a long time ago. This is why I found you so familiar the first time I laid my eyes on you. Have you ever dreamt about me?” Qing Shui laughed, but his tone was serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No!” Qin Qing decisively replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A very long time ago, when I was still living in a small mountain village in the Greencloud Continent….I was unable to cultivate when I was little. I couldn’t even run without feeling pain. At that time, you wouldn’t know how much envy I felt when I saw the other children being able to cultivate. I wasn’t afraid of pain or suffering, but Heavens wouldn’t even give me a chance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing quietly listened. She didn’t interrupt. She was also curious about Qing Shui’s past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Luckily, the Heavens weren’t that cruel to me after that. Things changed and I was able to cultivate. It was then that I determined I wanted to be better than ordinary people and have a happy family. At that time, I was content with what I had and I didn’t really have many wishes. Now, I also know how to be content with the things I have but sometimes, things get out of control and I can’t help myself. It’s as the saying goes, once a man has strength, he would grow ambitious and forget the feeling of contentment.” Qing Shui shook his head as he sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Qing Shui didn’t stretch his hand out, Qin Qing would completely have no idea what his intentions were. From seeing his expression, she knew that he wasn’t lying and he was speaking from his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But she had no way of understanding all of this. Love is a selfish thing, and it wasn’t like everybody would have to get married if they fell in love with someone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But to men, things were different. Many men were creatures of carnal instinct, placing sex first. They were visual creatures and only after the initial bout of attraction would they slowly begin to love, As for women, they needed time to bask in love bit by bit, as the emotion grew more intense with time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In this life, it’s impossible for me to change my heart. However, I don’t wish to give up on you. Am I being very greedy?” Qing Shui helplessly sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhm, you are very greedy.” Qin Qing smiled. She had a casual and carefree expression on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You said in the past that I have a chance with you. Is this true?” Qing Shui asked hurriedly. In actuality, he was a little muddled. He was still holding her hand even now. A woman like her allowing a man to hold her hands had actually already spoken volumes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But those in the thick of things couldn’t see the situation as clearly as those outside of it. He wasn’t a narcissist and didn’t think that he was very outstanding. He only felt that he was above average.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, it’s false. I lied to you. I don’t like a man who cannot be devoted.” Qin Qing smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui couldn’t tell her intentions and didn’t even know if what she said was real or not. But Qing Shui couldn’t help feeling a sense of failure when he heard that she wouldn’t like a man who couldn’t be devoted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If there were other reasons, he would do his best to change. But this was something he could not change; he already had other women before her and it was impossible for him to forsake them. He wouldn’t force her as well. He smiled at Qin Qing and didn’t say anything but slowly let go of her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing suddenly felt that this man was slowly drifting away. At this instant, she actually panicked. She felt that once he let go of her hand completely, she might truly lose him forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And just as Qing Shui’s hand was about to let go of her, Qin Qing suddenly held it tightly. “Were you not afraid that I would run away earlier? Why are you letting go of your hand now then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Earlier Qing Shui indeed had the intention to give up his love for her. It was tough for him to make this decision and he only made it after considering many things. He was unwilling to do so but love cannot be forced. Hence, he gritted his teeth and prepared to do what he felt was right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he felt Qin Qing grabbing his hand of her own volition, his heart suddenly felt warm. It felt like he just came back from Death’s Door. Staring at the beautiful woman before him, he replied, “Do you know how much resolution I must have had, in order to make that earlier decision of letting go of your hand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know and I don’t want to know. I suddenly just felt like I want you to hold on to me forever. I feel very conflicted...Qing Shui, can you promise me that we will let nature takes its course? Don’t force me, but don’t let go of my hand either, okay…?” Qin Qing seriously spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui laughed as he nodded. He also didn’t wish to let go of her hand. “Sorry about earlier, and unless you don’t allow me to hold your hand, I would never let you go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“En, okay. Let’s go to the Titan Ox Mountain and take a look!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After she spoke, Qin Qing pulled Qing Shui along and flew forth with extreme speed. Qing Shui looked at Qin Qing whose hair fluttered about in the wind; she seemed just like a celestial from the Heavens. His heart was calm and sometimes he couldn’t help but wonder why he was such a bastard. He already had so many women yet he couldn’t stop wanting more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After some time, Qing Shui discovered that this Titan Ox Mountain was actually in the shape of a ferocious ox prostrated on the ground. In addition, it also gave off the feeling that it was like a crouching tiger, ready to pounce on its prey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although this was just a mountain, it radiated overwhelming pressure and as time flowed by, Qing Shui even felt his strength slowly being suppressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, Nature Energy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But in the next moment, Qing Shui discovered there was something wrong with his body. A surge of tyrannical energy then quickly circulated around his body, completely unbidden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Frenzied Bull Strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Initially, all this energy should have been infused into the seven-colored pellet. The Frenzied Bull Strength hadn’t evolved for a very long time, but it suddenly erupted forth with such power now. There was a faint sense that he had just broken through a barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, only the energy from the Frenzied Bull Strength was being circulated and there weren’t many changes. Qing Shui stared at the Titan Ox Mountain, feeling that the surge of energy earlier had something to do with this mountain or something hidden in its depths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing who was holding on to Qing Shui’s hand naturally could also sense that burst of energy. She didn’t ask what was going on and continued pulling him towards the mountain, although she slowed the speed of their advancement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The deeper they headed in, the heavier the pressure felt. It was as if they were carrying a mountain on their backs. Although they could still endure it now, the pressure was continuously increasing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After walking near only did Qing Shui realized that this mountain was actually a gigantic palace hall. For a moment, he couldn’t tell whether this mountain was natural or forged by man. This uncanny workmanship felt like the work of the heavens yet there were some crude parts that seemed to be forged by the clumsy hands of men as well.</span></p>
