Instead of stepping back, it once again charged towards Qing Shui. Qing Shui quickly formed a Buddha Seal with both his hands and shot it out towards the beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beng!</span></p>

Both of its eyes looked lifeless as if it had become stupid. At this moment, the Dragon Slaying Beast leaped onto it and scratched the opponent’s body with its claws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An ear-piercing sonorous noise came through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was surprised that the sharp claws of the Dragon Slaying Beast didn’t manage to cut through the enemy’s skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most powerful traits of the Dragon Slaying Beast laid in its sharp teeth and the horn that was on the top of its head; its claws came after that. Prior to this, Qing Shui was afraid that he might really kill the opponent; thus, he only let the Dragon Slaying Beast use its claws. However, he never expected for its claws to only leave a shallow wound on the beast’s body; it didn’t even bleed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such formidable defensive prowess!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt that he liked this brat more and more. Actually, prior to this, Qing Shui could let the Dragon Slaying Beast pierce through the beast’s throat while it was feeling dizzy. Or rather, he could also let it pierce its eyes with its horn and the battle would have ended right away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could confirm that there would be no problem for the Dragon Slaying Beast to pierce through this beast with its long horn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui tried out the Buddha Ultimate Art and realized that it was nice and very useful. The demonic beast that was currently in front of him seemed to have gotten even more furious. As soon as it moved, it immediately dealt a heavy strike to the Dragon Slaying Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beng!</span></p>

It got blown away without any chance to fight back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qing Shui wasn’t worried that the Dragon Slaying Beast would be in danger. The ability of the Dragon Slaying Beast to resist against attacks was definitely not inferior in the slightest to the beast in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Art of Pursuing!</span></p>

Its strength had been reduced by more than 50%. (Dragon Slaying Beast suppressed dragon tribes, the effect of Emperor’s Qi further stacked with the Buddha Wisdom Seal) It was likely that by now, its strength was inferior to the two young ladies. Most importantly, it lost its once formidable speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two young ladies didn’t know what to say. The demonic beast which they could supposedly only look up to at the beginning, how much of its power had been taken away by this man? It had become inferior to even themselves? So much that they even began to feel that they could challenge the beast in a one-on-one battle?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know you are able to understand me. How about this? Follow me from now on.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hou-hou!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The beast was very furious. By now, Qing Shui was already able to suppress it. Dragon-capturing Hands, Buddha Ultimate Art, and now, he even unleashed the Nine Continents Mountain. After absorbing the Buddha Light Treasure Qi and also the Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda, Qing Shui’s Nine Continents Mountain had now achieved a strength worth seventeen billion Dao Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Adding on the Shield Attack ability from the Nine Continents Mountain, it immediately pushed the demonic beast to the point it could only step back. However, Qing Shui realized that even the Nine Continents Mountain was unable to hurt the beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two girls didn’t know what to say anymore by the time they saw Qing Shui’s Nine Continents Mountain. They knew that if he had used this artifact while he was on the platform, he could have blown his opponents out of the stage instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took out an Ancient Demonic Fruit and the remains of a fish which he ate from the realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Follow me. Not only can I help to make you more powerful, but you can also enjoy nice food and drinks. In the future, I will try to help you find a beautiful woman. Oh sorry, let me correct myself, a beautiful female beast.” Qing Shui continued to seduce it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, the two girls were already speechless. To think that there were times when this man would also be so crafty. Who would have thought that he would even lie to demonic beasts?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, deep down, the two girls also wanted to attempt tricking it… Unfortunately, they weren’t strong enough to do that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For every time their fists crossed, Qing Shui would try to seduce him once. Certainly, it was Qing Shui who was hitting the demonic beast most of the time. He had already eaten two fishes and a chicken leg. By now, Qing Shui could already see the demonic beast’s saliva dripping onto the ground. Deep down, it was already starting to feel as if it was playing a game.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Letting the beast voluntarily take the Supreme Sacred Beast Pill would be a lot better than forcing it to eat it. This would influence whether or not it could continue breaking through in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also why Qing Shui didn’t mind taking all the troubles to bait the enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui casually tossed a fish to the demonic beast. The demonic beast swallowed it immediately before looking at Qing Shui again with excitement. By now, they had also stopped fighting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that this demonic beast, which had yet to reach its adulthood, was just like a child. The reason why it was so lively was a part of its basic instinct. As long as he could find his opponent’s weakness, it would be very easy to lure it over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How’s it? Follow me. I won’t mistreat you. You have seen it for yourself, you don’t stand a chance against me. You won’t sustain any losses as humans live quite a short life. After you live with me for about a hundred years, freedom will once again be yours.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Once you follow me, I can let you eat as much of that delicious food as you want.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can enable your strength to increase by at least two times.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eventually, the two girls looked at the demonic beast in shock. It was eating the medicinal pills which Qing Shui fed to it. After that, they saw the demonic beast running around Qing Shui warm-heartedly. This caused the two girls to feel extremely envious of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui immediately let the demonic beast take the Fortune Golden Pellet, Quintuple Portion Medicine, and the Ancient Demonic Fruit. This Spiritual Beast was very terrifying; its physique was very powerful, which was also why Qing Shui dared to let it take multiple medicines continuously to increase its strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most importantly, this was the internal part of the Spiritual Land. They could potentially run into trouble at any times, so letting this beast increase its strength was also for safety purposes. After all, Qing Shui feared that he might not be able to take care of even himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time this demonic beast let out a loud roar, its body had already enlarged by about one-third of its original size. Qing Shui revealed a satisfied smile. Even Qing Shui was no longer able to sense the huge guy’s current strength. He estimated it to be roughly around fifty billion Dao Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, Qing Shui had also found out about the species of this demonic beast. It was the Fire Kirin Emperor. However, Qing Shui decided to call it Little Rin from now on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, Little Rin’s figure seemed to be a lot bigger than the Dragon Slaying Beast. However, strictly speaking, its body size could be considered small. For example, in comparison to the Violet Flame Ice Snow Beast which Xicheng Tianlong owned; it was a few times bigger than Qing Shui’s Little Rin. However, Qing Shui knew that one slap from Little Rin would be enough to slap the huge fella to death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We haven’t checked out the cave.” Qing Shui seemed to have forgotten about the cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he said that, the two young ladies looked towards the cave with excitement. No dangerous aura seemed to be present in it. Little Rin, who on the other hand had just broken through, seemed very impulsive as it had already gone outside. Qing Shui could have called it back with his consciousness, but he didn’t do so. Since he was very happy, he might as well let the little brat come out and misbehave around the area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cave was average in size with a circular path. Other than the cave entrance which was dusty, the internal part of the cave seemed quite clean. While observing around the cave, the surroundings looked as bright as jade. From time to time, they could see a huge pole acting as the cave’s support.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt that even without the huge pole, the cave wouldn’t collapse. These huge poles seemed like they were just for decorations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The huge pole was very thick. Qing Shui estimated it to have a diameter of ten meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It doesn’t seem like there is going to be anything around here.” Yu Xixuan said after walking for a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Could this place be the place where Little Rin lived?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I believe this place was made by men.” Beiming Xue said while observing the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked around and sort of agreed with her. If the cave was truly man made, this must mean that a person once lived here before. However, what kind of people would actually stay here? And Little Rin, what kind of relationship did Little Rin have with this person?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph? There is a person in front.” Qing Shui said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two young ladies’ hearts thumped. Even though they might be powerful, at the end of the day, they were still women. They would still feel a bit scared to see a person appearing here out of nowhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they no longer felt scared after seeing properly. It was a skeleton wearing a suit of armor; it was standing there motionless. There was a huge axe in his hand that was still looking very shiny.</span></p>
