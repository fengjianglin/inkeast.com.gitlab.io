 <p><strong>AST 1394 - Enraged Hellfire Phoenix, No One Left Alive</strong></p>
 <p>The huge explosive sound created panic for the surrounding people. As though they were ordinary people feeling the shockwave of a huge explosion, the jet black Underworld Fireball exploded into a gray void.</p>
 <p>The elder disappeared, instant death. The overwhelming might stunned Qing Shui, however it was not shocking for the Hellfire Phoenix. This was its power; its normal level of power.</p>
 <p>Thus, Hellfire Phoenix changed targets to a different elder.</p>
 <p>Underworld Fireball</p>
 <p>The elder that was targeted started to panic, he cried out loud, “Left Custodian, save me!”</p>
 <p>After this session of attacks, Che Clan’s members were more than half dead or injured. Three of the strongest four members of the Che Clan were dead. At this time, the elder did not care about saving face, he hollered out loud for help.</p>
 <p>Ice Congelation!</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, the elder dressed in azure phoenix clothing acted. His body did not move, but he freely waved his hand, a pillar of water shot out with lightning speed. In the blink of an eye, it had reached the Underworld Fireball.</p>
 <p>Poof!</p>
 <p>A dull noise resounded. The Underworld Fireball exploded again in midair. Qing Shui was stunned, this Left Custodian had quite the battle sense. He quickly found the method to counter the Underworld Fireball.</p>
 <p>The Che Clan elder from before backed down. It would seem that others followed suit in retreating. Close to a hundred arrived as a battalion, now only fifty or so remained. However, those that remained were all formidable martial artists. This was Che Clan’s False God martial artists. They were the entire foundation of the Che Clan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked towards the elder in the azure phoenix clothes. The elder gave off a mysterious feeling, it made Qing Shui, who possessed the Hellfire Phoenix, feel nervous.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>If not for Qing Shui’s communication with the Hellfire Phoenix within his consciousness to calm it down, it would have probably rushed into battle.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Dance’s Left Custodian’s heart was already a mess. Right now, he must remain calm. He calmly looked over at Qing Shui and slowly walked out.</p>
 <p>“Mr. Qing, what a showing you have displayed. At this point, there is already no going back. If I restrain your beast, how will you fight?” The elder’s voice was calm but carried with a force that could pierce the soul. It was an imposing feeling, similar to psychological attacks.</p>
 <p>“Restrain? You think you can restrain my beast?” Qing Shui laughed at the elder.</p>
 <p>Left Custodian looked at Qing Shui seriously, “Then I shall try, maybe I can!”</p>
 <p>After the elder finished speaking, he moved both his hands and cast immediately.</p>
 <p>Unlimited Ice!</p>
 <p>Sure Kill Heavenly Technique!</p>
 <p>Hellfire Phoenix spread its wings, Phoenix Heart!</p>
 <p>Fire Bird did not have a trump card but its body was smoking with a thick black flame, the entire sky was being roasted. He had never thought that the Phoenix Heart had this effect.</p>
 <p>Debuff!</p>
 <p>At the same time, Qing Shui was under the influence of the debuff. He did not know whether his attack was before or after the influence of the debuff.</p>
 <p>Underworld Fireball</p>
 <p>Underworld Fireball</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Fire Bird’s body was engulfed by azure ice, even the Underworld Fireballs that the Hellfire Phoenix blasted out were engulfed in azure ice!</p>
 <p>Seeing the Hellfire Phoenix being sealed in ice, Qing Shui started to panic. If the elder attacked him, he may have a hard time holding the elder off. The only saving grace was that he was still in Shadowless Paragon form.</p>
 <p>Golden Sword!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui directed the Golden Sword towards the Left Custodian.</p>
 <p>“Too weak!”</p>
 <p>The Left Custodian shook his head while allowing the Golden Sword to attack his own body, there was no damage.</p>
 <p>“How’s this? You lost your beast, your battle technique has been sealed, I don’t know what else you can bring to the fight. If you don’t have any more tricks up your sleeve, it will be my turn,” Left Custodian looked at Qing Shui and said calmly.</p>
 <p>He had a preference of killing people when they were in despair. To make his enemies hopelessly fall into despair, just like what he was doing against Qing Shui. To seal off critical battle techniques as well as battle changing beasts, had it been anyone else, they would have died with a grudge.</p>
 <p>“Make your move, you can’t kill me.”</p>
 <p>Once Qing Shui finished his sentence, he quickly blinked next to the Hellfire Phoenix that was sealed. Qing Shui moved his hand and the Primordial Flame Dragon Whip appeared.</p>
 <p>Water Subdues fire!</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui’s fire was not normal fire, it was Primordial Flames!</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>The whip struck a large chunk of ice and immediately a small crack formed. At this rate, it would take several hundred strikes before the ice would break.</p>
 <p>“Since you’re in a hurry to die, I will send you on your way!”</p>
 <p>Ice Dragon Slash!</p>
 <p>This was a second Sure Kill Heavenly Technique!</p>
 <p>This Left Custodian has strength that exceeded 20 million sun……</p>
 <p>Though after being debuffed by Qing Shui he only had a strength of 17 million sun, he was still able to use Sure Kill Heavenly Techniques. Right now, all he wanted was to kill Qing Shui in one hit.</p>
 <p>Left Custodian’s battle techniques were all speed type, this distance could be closed instantaneously.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>A golden light aura appeared briefly, at this time, Qing Shui also used the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines. He knew that the Paragon Golden Armor would block the fatal strike, since he had not used it today.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s silhouette few outwards but suddenly rushed back. At the same time, the giant Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines was like a giant towering tree that frantically sprang out, tangling the Left Custodian in place.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, bang bang bang… …</p>
 <p>A series of loud explosions resounded!</p>
 <p>Roar……</p>
 <p>Hellfire Phoenix’s previously blasted Underworld Fireballs exploded. The ice that was in the surroundings was blown to smithereens. The high-pitched roar was indication that the Hellfire Phoenix was enraged.</p>
 <p>Phoenix’s dignity was despised and trampled upon!</p>
 <p>Its body was blazing with Underworld Fire, with a reverberating sharp cry, it then consecutively fired dozens of Underworld Fireballs chained like beads towards the Left Custodian that was trapped within the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was a bit surprised that Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines could trap the Left Custodian in such a short amount of time. Though the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines were on the verge of collapsing, with the strength and toughness that were intertwined several times on the Left Custodian, it should still be able to trap him for a bit.</p>
 <p>Moreover, Qing Shui knew that the Hellfire Phoenix was enraged. He had never thought an enraged Hellfire Phoenix could fire off Underworld Fireballs consecutively like that.</p>
 <p>Had the attack started with this, what would the result have been?</p>
 <p>Pop pop pop…..</p>
 <p>Bang bang bang…..</p>
 <p>A series of giant explosions could be heard. Everything, including the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines, was shattered into smithereens in the explosions.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui stared blankly in front of him, the formidable Left Custodian died just like that. He had used two Sure Kill Heavenly Techniques. Would a death like this be considered good-for-nothing?</p>
 <p>The enraged Hellfire Phoenix did not stop at killing the Left Custodian, it dove into the center of a dozen men with its body blazing with Underworld Fire. The death of the Left Custodian had not sunk in for those people yet as the Hellfire Phoenix bulldozed through them. Already a third of them disappeared from this attack.</p>
 <p>Not only was the Hellfire Phoenix’s flame attack amazing, its body was also durable. Moreover, the Underworld Fire on its body was equally terrifying. Its horrifying speed and power combined with the Underworld Fire on its body was not something that these mortals could take.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Another blast of Underworld Fireballs appeared, it immediately locked onto the elder that was saved by the Left Custodian. The elder looked on with eyes of hopelessness as he was engulfed by the Underworld Fireball.</p>
 <p>By the time the Hellfire Phoenix stopped, there was no one from the Che Clan left. The cool and elegant Hellfire Phoenix stopped in midair, frequently letting out roars into the sky.</p>
 <p>The entire world became silent.</p>
 <p>Everything was over just like that. It all sank in for Qing Shui. This was the formidable ability of the Hellfire Phoenix, he had been careless to let it be sealed. Even in that situation, it had saved itself by blasting several Underworld Fireballs to break the seal.</p>
 <p>“Perhaps this is the legendary Black Phoenix?” the people below said after things started to sink in.</p>
 <p>“It probably is, even if it isn’t, it is no different from it.”</p>
 <p>“Che Clan is done for, to be done in just like that, being a superior clan and yet it was so fragile.”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. That’s why it is better to keep a low-profile. The Che Clan was too arrogant, this was karma!”</p>
 <p>“Qing Miraculous Physician is so young and yet so formidable. Can’t judge a book by its cover. No one would have thought before that a man so young could wipe out the entire Che Clan.”</p>
 <p>“Indeed, even the Left Custodian could do nothing!”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui retrieved the Hellfire Phoenix and walked towards Yehuang Guwu. Qing Shui, the two ladies, Tianhe Renmo and the Yun couple walked down from the top floor of the Imperial Cuisine Hall.</p>
 <p>By the time reality had sunk in, they were still disbelieving. They slowly made their way back to the Cuisine Hall. Yun Yijian was especially confused. Qing Shui had no need for assistance from Cloud Flutter. His strength could not be stopped by anyone.</p>
 <p>He did not know that before combining forces that Qing Shui’s Fire Bird had not evolved into the Hellfire Phoenix yet. If it had been the Hellfire Phoenix, it was uncertain whether Qing Shui would need assistance from Cloud Flutter.</p>
 <p>The Yun couple was also here, the Imperial Cuisine Hall was not open today.</p>
 <p>After cleaning up a bit, Qing Shui reappeared. All the others appeared to have calmed down a bit, the most at ease was Tianhe Renmo. Even Yehuang Guwu could not believe that Qing Shui could be as fearsome as this.</p>
 <p>They could only rejoice, knowing Qing Shui was this formidable, with exhilaration even. If it had been the other result they would not be able to accept it. The current result was the best result, everyone here could only wish Qing Shui was formidable.</p>
 <p>On another note, Qing Shui did not know if it was due to the death of the elder or his own body’s special constitution but the power that sealed Phoenix Finger disappeared. Qing Shui could use Phoenix Finger again.</p>
 <p>“Younger brother was this amazing,” Yun Yijian said with a bit of embarrassment.</p>
 <p>This woman was also a stunning beauty and looked at Qing Shui strangely. She was stronger than her husband but was far weaker than Qing Shui. Earlier, she had felt that she was not comparable to this young man, but she had not thought the difference was this huge. Now, the difference was comparable to being light years apart.</p>
 <p>“You were this amazing. You made me worry for this long,” Yuan Su said with a light smile, she said this with ease.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu only smiled without saying anything.</p>
 <p>Tianhe Renmo and the Yun couple seemed to have seen through it but did not say anymore. They continued to drink. Qing Shui had taken out several jars of wine when they sat together, now that the massacre was over, they could drink some more.</p>
 <p>“Well I also did not know I was this amazing, I had originally been worried as well,” Qing Shui said while smiling at Yuan Su.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su’s intent was clear to him, Yehuang Guwu had told him. He could clearly feel it now, but he had told Yuan Su, that the two of them would follow to flow of fate. If they were meant to be, everything would just fall into place and they would end up together.</p>
 <p>“Liar, but I like it, you bring surprises to people. What do you intend to do now?”</p>
 <p>“Let’s rest for two days then decide. I’m not sure what Phoenix Dance will do. They lost a Left Custodian. This Left Custodian was probably from a powerful clan. There could be quite a few visitors coming for me,” Qing Shui said while being a bit helpless. Clans usually build relationships by marrying into other clans, affecting one part of the relationship could trigger a network of clans to act. He was not sure whether he was in over his head or whether the slaughter would continue.</p>
