 <p><strong>Chapter 562 The strength of Seven Stars City! Meeting the aristocratic clan Qianyu Clan in Xing Hai Country!.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 562 - The strength of Seven Stars City! Meeting the aristocratic clan Qianyu Clan in Xing Hai Country!</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Being able to meet an old friend in a foreign place, Qing Shui felt that it was really something special and unforgettable. No wonder it was included as one of the three happiest moments in a person’s life. There must be a reason behind why people said that it was comparable to the occasions when one got married or passed a test with flying colors.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a feeling which came from deep within his heart.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’m good, so you made it to Central Continent.” Qianyu Qingqing smiled as she looked at Qing Shui. Her beautiful eyes were shining clearly with a happy expression.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Back then when Qianyu Qingqing left, Qing Shui still remembered her telling him to visit the Qianyu Clan to look for her if he ever made it to Central Continent. Who would have thought that he would run into her as soon as he stepped into the Central Continent?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Your house is in Xing Hai Country?” Qing Shui smiled and looked at Qianyu Qingqing. The girl had already let go of Qing Shui. She was looking curiously at the incomparably beautiful woman beside Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Qing was only surprised for a while. Very quickly, her expression went back to normal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Big brother, is this my sister-in-law? She’s so beautiful!” The girl asked as she looked at Qing Shui and Di Qing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No, little brat, stop making random guesses.” Qing Shui smiled as he pinched the little girl’s nose.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Di Qing, on the other hand, remained calm and collected as she shot a glance at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I haven’t even thanked you for treating Little Fei. Who is this? Why don’t we head to the Qianyu Clan together so that I’ll be able to treat you guys properly?” Qianyu Qingqing looked at the two and smiled once again.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Her name is Di Qing. I think it will be better if we don’t go to your house. In any case, we can’t really stay here for too long anyway……” Qing Shui’s priority was to send Di Qing to her house.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“But you guys came here from so far away. Or are you guys just looking down on me and not treating me like a friend?” Qianyu Qingqing looked at Qing Shui happily.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Big brother! Sister rarely tries so hard to get a man to come to her house.” Qianyu Feifei laughed happily.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You damned brat! What kind of nonsense are you speaking!”Qianyu Qingqing she turned around and glared at Qianyu Feifei.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui laughed awkwardly. Since Qianyu Qingqing had put it this way, it would be hard for Qing Shui to reject it. After all, it’s true that he was only able to make it here after traveling a few millions miles. This could be considered as a kind of fate.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At that time, Qianyu Qingqing had traveled a few million miles to Green Cloud Continent with Qianyu Feifei who was only five to six years old. When she was there, not only was she able to meet him, he even managed to help cure Qianyu Feifei. And now, after ten years, he too similarly traveled to Central Continent and to one’s surprise, he actually got to meet her again as soon as he arrived!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even Qing Shui who had never believed in fate was starting to feel convinced that it really existed between him and this girl.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Fate was indeed a really strange thing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, why don’t we go!” Di Qing smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s original plan was to send Di Qing home as quickly as possible and his mission would have been considered accomplished. However, it wasn’t his choice to run into this kind of incident. Hence, he nodded his head: “Sorry for disturbing.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Don’t mention it, I don’t feel disturbed at all. Every single one of my family members are really looking forward to meeting you.” Qianyu Feifei laughed joyfully.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yeah yeah, even our little princess from Qianyu clan was treated by you.” Qianyu Qingqing twisted Qianyu Feifei’s face and smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When she mentioned this, it made Qing Shui remembered the time when Qianyu Qingqing brought Qianyu Feifei alone and passed through the million miles of desolated land to Green Cloud Continent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui couldn’t hold in his curiosity. He used his spiritual sense to sense Qianyu Qingqing’s strength.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Peak Martial King Grade!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With around four countries worth of strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui didn’t know if Qianyu Qingqing had a mount with her. If she had only relied on this kind of strength, it shouldn’t be possible for her to make it through the million miles of desolated land peacefully. Therefore, Qing Shui felt that she might have had a formidable mount or some kind of unique treasures. For example, she might have something which was similar to the Soulshake Bell. Perhaps, it might be even stronger than Qing Shui’s current Soulshake Bell.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After a while, a long luxurious beast cart stopped in front of Qing Shui and his companions.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Young lady!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Uncle Dong! Please bring us home!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui, Di Qing, Qianyu Qingqing and Qianyu Feifei climbed inside the beast cart which appeared really comfortable.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The beast cart was really steady as it drove along the level and wide road. There were no signs of it shaking. The internal compartment of the beast cart was also considerably wide. It was just like a room. The small windows on both sides of the cart were left open. They were able to see the buildings and large beast carts that were rapidly passing by from time to time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, what’s your purpose for coming to the Central Continent? Is there anything I can help you with?” Qianyu Qingqing sat opposite to Qing Shui and Di Qing and asked casually.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Nothing much, I’m just here to take a look at the world. I’ll also be staying here for quite a while.”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Oh, if that’s the case, why don’t you stay in my house for a period of time?” Qianyu Qingqing smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, big brother, there are a lot of empty rooms in our house. Furthermore, only sister and I are living in her courtyard.” said Qianyu Feifei happily.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qianyu Qingqing seemed like she wanted to say something, but she didn’t open her mouth.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After a more than hour long ride, they had already traveled about a thousand miles. Qing Shui was already used to this kind of beast cart. Its speed was as fast as the wind.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At this moment, the style of the buildings outside had changed completely. It was as if the entire place was filled with pavilions, manors and bejeweled jade palaces.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Di Qing, I still don’t know which country your house is located in yet!” Qing Shui suddenly thought of Di Qing’s clan. He only knew that it was in the Central Continent but he didn’t know which part of the continent it was in.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Seven Stars Country!” Di Qing said joyfully.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Di Qing, are you a member of the Di Clan from Seven Stars Country?” Qianyu Qingqing glanced towards Di Qing and said in shock.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yeah!” Di Qing smiled and answered her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Wow, so Sister Qing is actually someone from the Seven Star Country! Furthermore, you are even one of the members of one of the Seven Stars, the Di Clan, and I thought that Sister Di Qing was also from Green Cloud Continent just like big brother.” Qianyu Feifei said happily.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“One of the Seven Stars, Di Clan?” Qing Shui glanced towards Qianyu Feifei in confusion. Qing Shui was aware that the easiest way for him to dig deeper into this topic would be to ask this little girl herself.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The Seven Stars Country is the name of the country. But actually, the Seven Stars in the term ‘Seven Stars Country’ represents the seven sects and aristocratic clans which have had really long histories. They are the Di Clan, the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord and the Medicine Sect.” Qianyu Feifei explained eagerly, which gave the impression that she was really happy to be able to answer Qing Shui’s questions.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time, Qing Shui had finally come to know that both Di Clan and the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord were from Seven Star Country. Furthermore, he also felt that the country itself shouldn’t be too far away from Xing Hai Country.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was also a place called the Village of Longevity. Despite being a village, it was capable of being included as one of the Seven Stars in Seven Stars Country. This made Qing Shui suspect that there must be something extraordinary about it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Longevity should be the main aspect of this village. Any places that could prolong one’s life span would definitely have an abundant spiritual energy. It would be a place with an outstanding ecosystem. Other than being able to prolong one’s life and grow valuable crops, places like these were also really suitable for cultivating.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hence, it wasn’t really unexpected for the village to be named as one of the Seven Stars.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Actually, there was still one more possibility. It could be that the villagers currently residing in the village weren’t actually the original villagers. Maybe formidable warriors slowly mixed into the village after they discovered the place or they just kicked the original villagers out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The possibility of the latter happening was a bit higher. As for when it happened, it could be millions of years before or even longer. But if it was something which happened within a million years, he should be able to find it in historical books or some unofficial histories. In any case, the people currently residing in the Village of Longevity should have been people who had lived there for more than a million years. Hence, it’s unnecessary to think about whether they were the original villagers.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In addition, Qing Shui found the Village of Longevity quite familiar. After all, the name of the village was mentioned countless times in his previous incarnations. In fact, he had even come across it countless times while he was in the virtual world.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After yet another half an hour, the beast cart came to a stop.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Young lady, we’re here!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui and his companions got out of the beast cart one by one.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The first thing that filled their vision was an extremely luxurious manor. It was even more luxurious than the one in Hai Clan. Moreover, the area of the land was also a lot larger. Perhaps, it might be because there were really few people in Hai Clan.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The manor was located in the south. In front of it was an extremely wide road. The black jade colored large door looked fairly luxurious too. The huge door was more than ten meters tall and twenty meters wide. Below the door were two armored men. Both of them exuded sharp and valiant auras.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Young lady! You can’t bring strangers home!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The person who took the lead was a middle-aged man wearing an armor. He bowed his head to greet Qianyu Qingqing. The man had a well-proportioned body. He exuded an inexpressible aura.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that it wasn’t just the people who were tall and burly that were scary. Often, the truly terrifying warriors who had achieved an extremely powerful level would only have a well-proportioned build. They tended to look really pleasant and gentle. Even if they had been tall and brawny, they would still manage to maintain a well-shaped body overall.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But the look the man gave when he looked at Qianyu Qingqing made Qing Shui feel really weird. It felt like he was looking at a servant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“One of my really good friends!” Qianyu Qingqing answered a bit grumpily.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You dog! Since when did you have the right to question my sister! Piss off if you still want to live!” Qianyu Feifei lashed out at the man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was really puzzled. Qianyu Qingqing and Qianyu Feifei were siblings, so why would they get treated so differently? Qing Shui looked towards the middle-aged man with doubts.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After getting lashed out at by Qianyu Feifei, the man retreated with a ‘tail’ between his legs. This made Qing Shui feel all the more suspicious. But since this was something which happened in the Qianyu Clan, he felt that it wasn’t his place to ask. Nor did he find it necessary to do so.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As soon as they stepped into Qianyu Clan, the first thing which the saw was a fake mountain in the distance. The fake mountain was surrounded by water. It was a really enormous man-made lake.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There were three bridges above the man-made lake to let people pass. To the west of the lake was an entire area filled with maples trees and green bamboo trees, making the place look really romantic and elegant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qianyu Qingqing! The clan had set up the law before to not let any men in! What are you doing now? Trying to ignore the rules?” A loud voice suddenly rang.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qianyu Ji! Since when did you have the rights to accuse my sister?” Quanyu Feifei knitted her brows as she asked the men who were approaching them from far away.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that he really should have rejected Qianyu Qingqing’s request at this time. Just what was happening?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Since things had taken such a turn of events, Qing Shui looked towards the young man who was heading towards them. The man was more than thirty years old. He wore a white colored satin and possessed a pair of bright and sharp eyes. His nose was quite straight. His face looked pale and was cleanly-shaved, giving off a fresh and clean feeling. He was a man with an outstanding appearance.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Feifei, I just don’t understand, why are you trying to defend her? She isn’t even really blood-related to us……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Shut up, she is my sister, we are both from the same mother. Dad mentioned before that he would punish anyone who dared to mention this again according to the house law. Have you forgotten about it?” Qianyu Feifei looked at Qianyu Ji indifferently.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qianyu Ji gave an awkward smile: “Feifei, I don’t mean it that way. Hasn’t father mentioned before? The females in Qianyu Clan are not allowed to bring men back on their own.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hmph! You think I don’t know what you mean? At the time when father met my mother, she was already pregnant with my sister! But despite that, father still loved mother! He even treated sister like his own daughter, do you seriously think that you are in a higher position than my sister in the Qianyu Clan?” Qianyu Feifei looked at Qianyu Ji disdainfully.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qianyu Ji was stunned. He quickly changed his arguments and muttered secretly: “You’re the little liar that father spoils the most. As for Qianyu Qingqing, eventually, she will just turn out to be a marriage tool for the clan.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Wow, look at this, both Qingqing and Feifei are here too!” said a clear and bright voice that could lighten up people’s mood.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother He is here!” When Qianyu Feifei saw that man, she looked particularly happy. Qianyu Ji, on the other hand, ran away with his tail between his legs.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the man who was not in the least bit inferior to Qianyu Ji yet was exuding an aura much stronger than his. He was really surprised at the fact that Qianyu Clan had really good genes. Each of them looked extraordinarily good.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qingqing, who are these two?” The man looked at Qianyu Qingqing with a smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This is the person who cured Feifei at the time when I went to Green Cloud Continent. Since we met him today, I invited him to our house.” Qianyu Qingqing still maintained a neutral expression. Since the beginning, there were no changes at all.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You should have done it earlier. So it’s you who saved my little sister. Actually, father had wanted to go to Green Cloud Continent to meet you so that he could thank you properly. It’s just that he is always busy, that’s why he wasn’t really able to take out some time to do so. Since you have come to Central Continent, you must give the Qianyu Clan an opportunity to properly express their gratitude.” The man laughed in joy. The way he spoke was really friendly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I have forgotten to introduce myself! My name is Qianyu He!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother He, you can call me Qing Shui!” Qing Shui responded.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Shui, believe it or not, I have got really good instincts. I have a feeling that we will get along really well. As soon as I met you, I already felt really comfortable. I hope that in the future, we will be able to support each other.” Qianyu He looked at Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I wouldn’t mind as long as Brother He is fine with it.” Qing Shui smiled and responded.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Of course I won’t! Let’s go! I believe the clan dinner is ready!” Qianyu He happily informed Qing Shui and Di Qing. He even passionately walked with them shoulder to shoulder towards the main hall.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had a feeling like he was amidst the fog and mist. He just wanted to relax here for one day and a half before leaving. Not long after they started walking, they could already see a handsome middle-aged man and a few other males and females behind him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could already tell that the courteous looking middle-aged man was their father. They just looked way too alike. Unfortunately, Qianyu Ji and Qianyu He didn’t look as elegant as this man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mister, since you have saved my little daughter, I, Qianyu Dingjun will definitely thank you properly.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was shocked with how well-informed the Qianyu Clan was. The news about him had been passed on so quickly even though it had only been a while since he arrived.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Feifei addresses me as big brother, as for senior Qianyu, you can just call me Qing Shui.” Qing Shui smiled and told the unpredictable middle-aged man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“If that’s the case, Qing Shui, you can call me Uncle Jun if you don’t mind.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui greets Uncle Jun.” Qing Shui naturally wouldn’t let off such a good opportunity since he just arrived in Central Continent. From the moment he met this middle-aged man, he could already tell that Qianyu Clan was an aristocratic clan. If there had been a Seven Star system in the Xing Hai Country as well, the Qianyu Clan should be able to make it into such a list.</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 562 - The strength of Seven Stars City! Meeting the aristocratic clan Qianyu Clan in Xing Hai Country!</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Being able to meet an old friend in a foreign place, Qing Shui felt that it was really something special and unforgettable. No wonder it was included as one of the three happiest moments in a person’s life. There must be a reason behind why people said that it was comparable to the occasions when one got married or passed a test with flying colors.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was a feeling which came from deep within his heart.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’m good, so you made it to Central Continent.” Qianyu Qingqing smiled as she looked at Qing Shui. Her beautiful eyes were shining clearly with a happy expression.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Back then when Qianyu Qingqing left, Qing Shui still remembered her telling him to visit the Qianyu Clan to look for her if he ever made it to Central Continent. Who would have thought that he would run into her as soon as he stepped into the Central Continent?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Your house is in Xing Hai Country?” Qing Shui smiled and looked at Qianyu Qingqing. The girl had already let go of Qing Shui. She was looking curiously at the incomparably beautiful woman beside Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Di Qing was only surprised for a while. Very quickly, her expression went back to normal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Big brother, is this my sister-in-law? She’s so beautiful!” The girl asked as she looked at Qing Shui and Di Qing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No, little brat, stop making random guesses.” Qing Shui smiled as he pinched the little girl’s nose.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Di Qing, on the other hand, remained calm and collected as she shot a glance at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I haven’t even thanked you for treating Little Fei. Who is this? Why don’t we head to the Qianyu Clan together so that I’ll be able to treat you guys properly?” Qianyu Qingqing looked at the two and smiled once again.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Her name is Di Qing. I think it will be better if we don’t go to your house. In any case, we can’t really stay here for too long anyway……” Qing Shui’s priority was to send Di Qing to her house.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“But you guys came here from so far away. Or are you guys just looking down on me and not treating me like a friend?” Qianyu Qingqing looked at Qing Shui happily.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Big brother! Sister rarely tries so hard to get a man to come to her house.” Qianyu Feifei laughed happily.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You damned brat! What kind of nonsense are you speaking!”Qianyu Qingqing she turned around and glared at Qianyu Feifei.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui laughed awkwardly. Since Qianyu Qingqing had put it this way, it would be hard for Qing Shui to reject it. After all, it’s true that he was only able to make it here after traveling a few millions miles. This could be considered as a kind of fate.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At that time, Qianyu Qingqing had traveled a few million miles to Green Cloud Continent with Qianyu Feifei who was only five to six years old. When she was there, not only was she able to meet him, he even managed to help cure Qianyu Feifei. And now, after ten years, he too similarly traveled to Central Continent and to one’s surprise, he actually got to meet her again as soon as he arrived!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even Qing Shui who had never believed in fate was starting to feel convinced that it really existed between him and this girl.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Fate was indeed a really strange thing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, why don’t we go!” Di Qing smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s original plan was to send Di Qing home as quickly as possible and his mission would have been considered accomplished. However, it wasn’t his choice to run into this kind of incident. Hence, he nodded his head: “Sorry for disturbing.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Don’t mention it, I don’t feel disturbed at all. Every single one of my family members are really looking forward to meeting you.” Qianyu Feifei laughed joyfully.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yeah yeah, even our little princess from Qianyu clan was treated by you.” Qianyu Qingqing twisted Qianyu Feifei’s face and smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When she mentioned this, it made Qing Shui remembered the time when Qianyu Qingqing brought Qianyu Feifei alone and passed through the million miles of desolated land to Green Cloud Continent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui couldn’t hold in his curiosity. He used his spiritual sense to sense Qianyu Qingqing’s strength.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Peak Martial King Grade!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With around four countries worth of strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui didn’t know if Qianyu Qingqing had a mount with her. If she had only relied on this kind of strength, it shouldn’t be possible for her to make it through the million miles of desolated land peacefully. Therefore, Qing Shui felt that she might have had a formidable mount or some kind of unique treasures. For example, she might have something which was similar to the Soulshake Bell. Perhaps, it might be even stronger than Qing Shui’s current Soulshake Bell.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After a while, a long luxurious beast cart stopped in front of Qing Shui and his companions.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Young lady!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Uncle Dong! Please bring us home!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui, Di Qing, Qianyu Qingqing and Qianyu Feifei climbed inside the beast cart which appeared really comfortable.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The beast cart was really steady as it drove along the level and wide road. There were no signs of it shaking. The internal compartment of the beast cart was also considerably wide. It was just like a room. The small windows on both sides of the cart were left open. They were able to see the buildings and large beast carts that were rapidly passing by from time to time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, what’s your purpose for coming to the Central Continent? Is there anything I can help you with?” Qianyu Qingqing sat opposite to Qing Shui and Di Qing and asked casually.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Nothing much, I’m just here to take a look at the world. I’ll also be staying here for quite a while.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Oh, if that’s the case, why don’t you stay in my house for a period of time?” Qianyu Qingqing smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yeah, big brother, there are a lot of empty rooms in our house. Furthermore, only sister and I are living in her courtyard.” said Qianyu Feifei happily.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qianyu Qingqing seemed like she wanted to say something, but she didn’t open her mouth.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After a more than hour long ride, they had already traveled about a thousand miles. Qing Shui was already used to this kind of beast cart. Its speed was as fast as the wind.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At this moment, the style of the buildings outside had changed completely. It was as if the entire place was filled with pavilions, manors and bejeweled jade palaces.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Di Qing, I still don’t know which country your house is located in yet!” Qing Shui suddenly thought of Di Qing’s clan. He only knew that it was in the Central Continent but he didn’t know which part of the continent it was in.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Seven Stars Country!” Di Qing said joyfully.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Di Qing, are you a member of the Di Clan from Seven Stars Country?” Qianyu Qingqing glanced towards Di Qing and said in shock.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yeah!” Di Qing smiled and answered her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Wow, so Sister Qing is actually someone from the Seven Star Country! Furthermore, you are even one of the members of one of the Seven Stars, the Di Clan, and I thought that Sister Di Qing was also from Green Cloud Continent just like big brother.” Qianyu Feifei said happily.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“One of the Seven Stars, Di Clan?” Qing Shui glanced towards Qianyu Feifei in confusion. Qing Shui was aware that the easiest way for him to dig deeper into this topic would be to ask this little girl herself.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The Seven Stars Country is the name of the country. But actually, the Seven Stars in the term ‘Seven Stars Country’ represents the seven sects and aristocratic clans which have had really long histories. They are the Di Clan, the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord and the Medicine Sect.” Qianyu Feifei explained eagerly, which gave the impression that she was really happy to be able to answer Qing Shui’s questions.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time, Qing Shui had finally come to know that both Di Clan and the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord were from Seven Star Country. Furthermore, he also felt that the country itself shouldn’t be too far away from Xing Hai Country.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was also a place called the Village of Longevity. Despite being a village, it was capable of being included as one of the Seven Stars in Seven Stars Country. This made Qing Shui suspect that there must be something extraordinary about it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Longevity should be the main aspect of this village. Any places that could prolong one’s life span would definitely have an abundant spiritual energy. It would be a place with an outstanding ecosystem. Other than being able to prolong one’s life and grow valuable crops, places like these were also really suitable for cultivating.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hence, it wasn’t really unexpected for the village to be named as one of the Seven Stars.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Actually, there was still one more possibility. It could be that the villagers currently residing in the village weren’t actually the original villagers. Maybe formidable warriors slowly mixed into the village after they discovered the place or they just kicked the original villagers out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The possibility of the latter happening was a bit higher. As for when it happened, it could be millions of years before or even longer. But if it was something which happened within a million years, he should be able to find it in historical books or some unofficial histories. In any case, the people currently residing in the Village of Longevity should have been people who had lived there for more than a million years. Hence, it’s unnecessary to think about whether they were the original villagers.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In addition, Qing Shui found the Village of Longevity quite familiar. After all, the name of the village was mentioned countless times in his previous incarnations. In fact, he had even come across it countless times while he was in the virtual world.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After yet another half an hour, the beast cart came to a stop.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Young lady, we’re here!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui and his companions got out of the beast cart one by one.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The first thing that filled their vision was an extremely luxurious manor. It was even more luxurious than the one in Hai Clan. Moreover, the area of the land was also a lot larger. Perhaps, it might be because there were really few people in Hai Clan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The manor was located in the south. In front of it was an extremely wide road. The black jade colored large door looked fairly luxurious too. The huge door was more than ten meters tall and twenty meters wide. Below the door were two armored men. Both of them exuded sharp and valiant auras.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Young lady! You can’t bring strangers home!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The person who took the lead was a middle-aged man wearing an armor. He bowed his head to greet Qianyu Qingqing. The man had a well-proportioned body. He exuded an inexpressible aura.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that it wasn’t just the people who were tall and burly that were scary. Often, the truly terrifying warriors who had achieved an extremely powerful level would only have a well-proportioned build. They tended to look really pleasant and gentle. Even if they had been tall and brawny, they would still manage to maintain a well-shaped body overall.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But the look the man gave when he looked at Qianyu Qingqing made Qing Shui feel really weird. It felt like he was looking at a servant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“One of my really good friends!” Qianyu Qingqing answered a bit grumpily.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You dog! Since when did you have the right to question my sister! Piss off if you still want to live!” Qianyu Feifei lashed out at the man.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was really puzzled. Qianyu Qingqing and Qianyu Feifei were siblings, so why would they get treated so differently? Qing Shui looked towards the middle-aged man with doubts.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After getting lashed out at by Qianyu Feifei, the man retreated with a ‘tail’ between his legs. This made Qing Shui feel all the more suspicious. But since this was something which happened in the Qianyu Clan, he felt that it wasn’t his place to ask. Nor did he find it necessary to do so.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As soon as they stepped into Qianyu Clan, the first thing which the saw was a fake mountain in the distance. The fake mountain was surrounded by water. It was a really enormous man-made lake.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There were three bridges above the man-made lake to let people pass. To the west of the lake was an entire area filled with maples trees and green bamboo trees, making the place look really romantic and elegant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qianyu Qingqing! The clan had set up the law before to not let any men in! What are you doing now? Trying to ignore the rules?” A loud voice suddenly rang.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qianyu Ji! Since when did you have the rights to accuse my sister?” Quanyu Feifei knitted her brows as she asked the men who were approaching them from far away.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that he really should have rejected Qianyu Qingqing’s request at this time. Just what was happening?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Since things had taken such a turn of events, Qing Shui looked towards the young man who was heading towards them. The man was more than thirty years old. He wore a white colored satin and possessed a pair of bright and sharp eyes. His nose was quite straight. His face looked pale and was cleanly-shaved, giving off a fresh and clean feeling. He was a man with an outstanding appearance.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Feifei, I just don’t understand, why are you trying to defend her? She isn’t even really blood-related to us……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Shut up, she is my sister, we are both from the same mother. Dad mentioned before that he would punish anyone who dared to mention this again according to the house law. Have you forgotten about it?” Qianyu Feifei looked at Qianyu Ji indifferently.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qianyu Ji gave an awkward smile: “Feifei, I don’t mean it that way. Hasn’t father mentioned before? The females in Qianyu Clan are not allowed to bring men back on their own.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hmph! You think I don’t know what you mean? At the time when father met my mother, she was already pregnant with my sister! But despite that, father still loved mother! He even treated sister like his own daughter, do you seriously think that you are in a higher position than my sister in the Qianyu Clan?” Qianyu Feifei looked at Qianyu Ji disdainfully.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qianyu Ji was stunned. He quickly changed his arguments and muttered secretly: “You’re the little liar that father spoils the most. As for Qianyu Qingqing, eventually, she will just turn out to be a marriage tool for the clan.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Wow, look at this, both Qingqing and Feifei are here too!” said a clear and bright voice that could lighten up people’s mood.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother He is here!” When Qianyu Feifei saw that man, she looked particularly happy. Qianyu Ji, on the other hand, ran away with his tail between his legs.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at the man who was not in the least bit inferior to Qianyu Ji yet was exuding an aura much stronger than his. He was really surprised at the fact that Qianyu Clan had really good genes. Each of them looked extraordinarily good.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qingqing, who are these two?” The man looked at Qianyu Qingqing with a smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This is the person who cured Feifei at the time when I went to Green Cloud Continent. Since we met him today, I invited him to our house.” Qianyu Qingqing still maintained a neutral expression. Since the beginning, there were no changes at all.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You should have done it earlier. So it’s you who saved my little sister. Actually, father had wanted to go to Green Cloud Continent to meet you so that he could thank you properly. It’s just that he is always busy, that’s why he wasn’t really able to take out some time to do so. Since you have come to Central Continent, you must give the Qianyu Clan an opportunity to properly express their gratitude.” The man laughed in joy. The way he spoke was really friendly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I have forgotten to introduce myself! My name is Qianyu He!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother He, you can call me Qing Shui!” Qing Shui responded.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Shui, believe it or not, I have got really good instincts. I have a feeling that we will get along really well. As soon as I met you, I already felt really comfortable. I hope that in the future, we will be able to support each other.” Qianyu He looked at Qing Shui with a smile.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I wouldn’t mind as long as Brother He is fine with it.” Qing Shui smiled and responded.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Of course I won’t! Let’s go! I believe the clan dinner is ready!” Qianyu He happily informed Qing Shui and Di Qing. He even passionately walked with them shoulder to shoulder towards the main hall.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had a feeling like he was amidst the fog and mist. He just wanted to relax here for one day and a half before leaving. Not long after they started walking, they could already see a handsome middle-aged man and a few other males and females behind him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could already tell that the courteous looking middle-aged man was their father. They just looked way too alike. Unfortunately, Qianyu Ji and Qianyu He didn’t look as elegant as this man.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mister, since you have saved my little daughter, I, Qianyu Dingjun will definitely thank you properly.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was shocked with how well-informed the Qianyu Clan was. The news about him had been passed on so quickly even though it had only been a while since he arrived.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Feifei addresses me as big brother, as for senior Qianyu, you can just call me Qing Shui.” Qing Shui smiled and told the unpredictable middle-aged man.</p>
