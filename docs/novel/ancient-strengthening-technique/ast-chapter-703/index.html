 <p><strong>AST 703 - Explosive increase in abilities, Tempering</strong></p>
 <p>The previous few times, Qing Shui controlled his body to undergo the pressure of tempering his bones and muscles. He also made sure not to get injured in the process. However, now he could not care so much about that anymore, he had to secure his life first.</p>
 <p>Ka Cha!</p>
 <p>His other shoulder was broken too, Qing Shui closed his eyes, his whole body had already been covered in blood, his sweat had long ago been mixed with his blood.</p>
 <p>Ka Cha…… rib bone!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt like giving up a little, he had to endure the attacks of that huge energy and a huge pain, these he could endure, after all, he had once cultivated [Ancient Book of "Rebirth"]. He had experienced an extreme pain, thus Qing Shui felt this pain was nothing compared to that.</p>
 <p>Ka Cha…...</p>
 <p>The final rib was broken as well, for every broken rib, Qing Shui’s energy would be focused, at the same time, because of his cultivation of [Ancient Book of "Rebirth"], the pain would release even more of Qing Shui’s potential.</p>
 <p>Ka Cha!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s chest caved in, his sternum was broken. Just at this moment, Qing Shui’s body emitted a faint golden glow.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>There was a faint sound coming from Qing Shui’s body. His body, which originally suffered intense pain felt a soothing sensation, it was so comfortable, that Qing Shui nearly fell asleep, but he knew that he can't let himself relax at this moment.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui realized, that his abilities had already broken through his original grade, this was not strange, his strength increased tremendously and the medicinal strength of the Everlasting Pellet was more or less completely absorbed. He knew that with complete absorption of the pill's medicinal strength, the most dangerous moment had passed.</p>
 <p>After that, Qing Shui started to slowly retreat, step by step……</p>
 <p>Time slowly flowed on, soon it was noon. Qing Shui had retreated almost to the entrance of the palace by now, then he slowly sat down in a crossed-legged position.</p>
 <p>The Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique slowly healed Qing Shui’s injuries, the Yin-Yang Image also did the same. His injuries seemed heavy but this was nothing to him, those were just some broken bones.</p>
 <p>The explosive energy in his body circulated rapidly, it slowly achieved a certain balance. The newly increased energy merged with the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique gradually, turning into Qing Shui’s personal energy.</p>
 <p>Ka Ka…...</p>
 <p>There was a radiance that appeared and the sound of his bones healing. Qing Shui opened both of his eyes, there was a smile on his face, the absorption of the Everlasting Pellet was complete.</p>
 <p>Most of the injuries on his body were healed, this was one of the after effects of the Everlasting Pellet, it recovered the body’s injuries. This kind of healing was very potent, of course, it was not as strong as the so-called Great Revitalizing Pellet, after all, the Everlasting Pellet was a medicinal pill used for increasing abilities.</p>
 <p>Each person may only take one Everlasting Pellet in their entire life!</p>
 <p>At the last instant, Qing Shui’s Zhongfu acupoint emitted a bright glow, following that, his Upper Dantian subtly changed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui remembered, that the Everlasting Pellet had another effect of opening the Zhongfu acupoint.</p>
 <p>Feeling the level of abilities in his body, Qing Shui laughed. That kind of joy is indescribable, the abilities of his body were raised by 1500 countries.</p>
 <p>To be precise, his abilities had increased by slightly more than 600 countries. Actually, Qing Shui felt that this increase had something to do with the opening of the Zhongfu acupoint because Qing Shui discovered that the appearance of the Upper Dantian seemed to look stronger.</p>
 <p>The Heavenly Dan was in the Zhongfu acupoint. When the Zhongfu acupoint was opened, its capacity increased causing the Heavenly Dan to grow stronger. Qing Shui felt that the Everlasting Pellet had increased his abilities by at least 600 countries.</p>
 <p>What made Qing Shui happy was, that the value of his defense was even more perverse than ever before, his body’s defense had actually achieved the level of 3000 countries. However, it was still less than one fold of his precious defense. All in all, Qing Shui had managed to absorb about 80% of the pill's medicinal strength, such a result was considered relatively high.</p>
 <p>Finally, he could stop worrying, he could now boldly do a lot of things. Qing Shui felt very relaxed at this moment.</p>
 <p>In this instant, his whole body seemed to have become lighter, as though he had lost a huge burden.</p>
 <p>The strength of his body’s attack achieved 1500 countries, his body had the defense of 3000 countries. With the Grand Perfection Stage Diamond Qi, he automatically had an increase of one fold of strength. With the Grand Perfection Stage Diamond Protection, he automatically had an increase of one fold of defense. With the Grand Perfection Stage Diamond Crossing Rivers, he automatically had an increase of one fold of speed.</p>
 <p>Under the effects of these three heaven-defying passive techniques, during normal circumstances, Qing Shui had the strength of 3000 countries and the defense of 6000 countries.</p>
 <p>Adding 50% increase in abilities by Nature Energy, adding 30% increase in abilities by State of Immovable as Mountains, adding 30% increase in abilities by Frenzied Bull's Strength, adding 30% increase in strength by Heavenly Thunder Slash, adding 20% increase in strength by Shield Attack, adding the increase from the Big Dipper Sword, Violet Gold Divine Shield, and Heavenly Talismans, Qing Shui had the a little more than the strength of 8200 countries and a little more than the defense of 10000 countries.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, this was under the condition of not using the Seven Star Armored Vest and Godly Armor Shield, thinking of this, Qing Shui was very excited!</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>Entering the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he refreshed himself before cultivating and consolidating his strength. The injuries, that he already had, recovered under his perverse recovery abilities.</p>
 <p>Taichi Fist!</p>
 <p>He consolidated the abilities of his body before slowly getting used to his new level of abilities. Qing Shui spent most of his time in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal tempering himself.</p>
 <p>This time, Qing Shui discovered his previous passion anew, when he was very tired, he would rest for a while before going back to his tempering, to familiarize himself with the abilities of his body.</p>
 <p>The Ancient Strengthening Technique had actually already converted this increase in abilities to Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, all he needed to do now was to familiarize himself with it to a minute level, to the point where he can precisely utilize his full strength.</p>
 <p>When it was almost time, he exited the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p>It was already getting dark outside but the two of them hung a few Light Stones. He slowly made his way outside and saw Hai Dongqing standing at the entrance, guarding it.</p>
 <p>When she turned her head to look at Qing Shui, she was shocked, but she recovered her wits quickly. Qing Shui’s aura actually had a subtle change during this half day period.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not realize that with his increase in strength and the releasing of his burdens, he seemed even more natural, casual, and relaxed, there was also a little dedication and dominance.</p>
 <p>“How was it?” Hai Dongqing asked gently, she could tell from Qing Shui’s face that it probably went really well.</p>
 <p>“Great, thank you!” Qing Shui said this sincerely. If she did not bring him here, it would be very difficult to look for the Immortal Fox Blood. He would probably spend lots of time trying to find it or even not be able to find it at all, possibly resulting in him missing out on the Everlasting Pellet.</p>
 <p>At the same time, he was grateful to Yuan Su, without the Vital Essence Pill recipe she gave him, all of this might have been for naught.</p>
 <p>“You don’t have to thank me, I’m the one that has to say thank you!” Hai Dongqing said.</p>
 <p>“One month later, I will accompany you to return, we will face your problem together. I promise that you will not feel wronged.” Qing Shui thought about the affairs of the Hai Clan, about her appearance when she was completely disheartened and lacking in vitality. If it was not for the people closest to her, who left the Greencloud Continent to come over, given her character, she would object to such arrangements, even to the point of death.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing looked at Qing Shui, looking at his serious expression and his tone, which indicated that it was not out of courtesy, she felt a little flustered. She felt like crying when she heard this man talking about the huge burden that she had to carry.</p>
 <p>She once dreamt that there would be someone who would say this to her but she knew that it was impossible. It would never be possible, she did not have any friends, even if she had any, they would not have the ability to say such words.</p>
 <p>Now, the man who said them had not even come in contact with her for very long. The first time was for only about 15 minutes, they spoke during the second time they met but it was not for long, this was the third time and it was only for slightly more than ten days.</p>
 <p>For her to meet him, she originally felt that it was fate. Furthermore, it happened in Cold Ice City, the chances of her meeting someone she knew from Greencloud Continent were minuscule. In such a big world, for the two of them to even exchange a sentence could already be considered fate because the number of people one could know in their life was limited. For him to purchase the Hai Clan villa in the Greencloud Continent was already a kind of fate, thus from then on, she was able to relax and chat with this likable man.</p>
 <p>After that incident, she thought that they were people from two different worlds, if they did not purposely look for each other, they might have never met again. However, when she saw Qing Shui in Cold Ice City, she was incredibly happy, it was a miraculous meeting of fate. Thus, she put aside her reservations and invited Qing Shui and even took the initiative to help him find the Immortal Fox, maybe it was because she was feeling very depressed.</p>
 <p>She never thought that the person who would say such words to her was him, she never thought that anyone would ever say such words. She did not understand her own feelings right now, she only knew that she was almost unable to control her tears any longer.</p>
 <p>No matter how staunch she was, she was still a woman, she needed someone to dote on her, to care for her. No matter how strong she was, she still had her weak moments.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, listen to me, don’t get involved in this matter.” Hai Dongqing looked at Qing Shui and smiled as she said it seriously.</p>
 <p>“Are you afraid that I am not their opponent, that I would implicate the Hai Clan?” Qing Shui gently smiled.</p>
 <p>“What are you saying! I just don’t want you to endanger yourself, don’t give me any more hope.” Hai Dongqing gently said, her tone had an indescribable fluctuation.</p>
 <p>“Do you not believe in me or are you not willing to let me help you?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t know!” Hai Dongqing flung her head aside and looked away into the distance, her usual wise gaze seemed to turn a little bewildered.</p>
 <p>“I do not have any other motives, I just want to help you because you have been of tremendous help to me.” Qing Shui gently said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s words actually caused Hai Dongqing to become speechless because she felt, that she had taken huge advantage of him during this trip. However, now he said that he could help her. Maybe she did help him, but she did not feel that she was of much help.</p>
 <p>“Perhaps in his heart, that was considered a great help.” Hai Dongqing sighed to herself.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui said that he would help her, she was not as joyful as she had imagined she would be. Because she felt that he still was not able to defeat those people in battle.</p>
 <p>“Alright, don't’ think too much of it, we will stay here and cultivate here properly for this month before going back. Trust me, I will not take any risks lightly. If it would just end up in me sacrificing myself, I would not do it. Just me dying would be a small matter, but if I end up dragging you guys with me, I would never find peace in death.” Qing Shui said this as thought he was joking.</p>
