 <p><strong>AST 594 - Dew of the Raining Star Flower, No worries for the future</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui stretched his hands and patted the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, feeling very happy in his heart. Maybe because they heard some movements but there were people coming out after a short while.</p>
 <p>“Brother Shui, you have returned!” Qing Bei, who came out first, saw Qing Shui and happily ran over.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Bei, there were no problems at home right?” Qing Shui watched Qing Bei hug his arm without and restraint, just like when she was young. This caused Qing Shui to feel that he had stolen Qing Hu’s place.</p>
 <p>“There were no problems, but there are many visitors. The two elders you mentioned the last time have brought their families here for more than a month already.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, that’s good!”</p>
 <p>“Father!”</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>Qing Zun and Qing Yin were almost two years old and they seem bigger than when before he left. Qing Shui had not seen them for more than seven months, he had missed them.</p>
 <p>He carried one in each of his hands and kissed both their rosy cheeks, causing the two young fellows to laugh without stop.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue, Huoyun Liu-Li, and the others came out as well. Canghai Mingyue had to watch over the two kids, although they did not end up in any trouble, she was worried that they might bump into things……</p>
 <p>Qing Yi was chatting with the two women as they walked out. At that moment, Qing Shui noticed the lady wearing a veil, he could recognize that she was the icy lady he met at Flowerfruit Mountain.</p>
 <p>Then he shifted his gaze to the woman beside her, who was also dressed in a deep blue dress. She was mature, demure, elegant and poised. She had a astounding figure and she gave off an air that could cause men to go be crazy.</p>
 <p>“You must be Qing Shui!” The woman’s voice was pleasing and had an attractive quality to it, it was a pleasure just to listen to her voice.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s expression did not change a single bit, however, on the inside, he was incomparably shocked. Qing Shui had discovered that the strength of this woman felt exceptionally terrifying, even Qianyu Dingjun and Nian Feng’s grandfather seem to be inferior to her.</p>
 <p>“You are?” Qing Shui did not reply to her but instead looked suspiciously at this woman who could definitely be classified as an absolute beauty. There were many individuals in the World of the Nine Continents, naturally, there would be no lack of beautiful women. However, women with her looks and temperament were hard to find.</p>
 <p>“I am Yu Ruyan, of the Central Continent. Thank you for saving my daughter, as well as saving me. I am here today to thank you.” The woman maintained a faint and light smile on her face. With one look, she could tell that Qing Shui has many merits. After staying in the Qing Clan, she now knew that the young man known as Qing Shui was the soul of the Qing Clan and also knew quite a lot of things about him.</p>
 <p>The woman’s words made Qing Shui feel astonished, although he had vaguely guessed it, but when he heard it with his own ears, it still seemed hard to believe. This woman was actually the mother of the icy lady, furthermore, she was still so young…...</p>
 <p>“So it was elder, there was not much effort involved. If you did not mention it, I would have forgotten about it.” Qing Shui hurriedly smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“Sister, you have such a good son.” Yu Ruyan smiled at Qing Yi.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan’s address caused Qing Shui to be petrified for a while, then he looked that that icy lady wearing the veil. He realized that the eyes that were exposed were looking curiously at Qing Shui, it was a clear and chilly look.</p>
 <p>“Mother, what is going on?” Qing Shui looked at Qing Yi bewilderedly.</p>
 <p>“We feel that our two families hit it off quite well, thus we decided to address each other as sisters. This is just how we address each other, you can call me by my name or you can address me as Aunt Yun.” Yun Ruyan answered on Qing Yi’s behalf when she saw that Qing Yi seemed to be at a lost for words.</p>
 <p>“Oh, Yu Ruyan right, I know that you are very strong. However, I do not like you, do you understand what I mean??” Qing Shui said after he frowned and hesitated for a while.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s words caused many people to feel that it was inconceivable, even Duanmu Lingshuang and especially Yu Ruyan. It had been many years since someone had said something like that to her.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui……” Qing Yi felt that she might have done something wrong and looked guiltily at Qing Shui. Her son already had a lot of worries to deal with already, yet she gave him some additional problems.</p>
 <p>“Mother, it’s fine, I just do not want you to get cheated.” Qing Shui smiled at Qing Yi.</p>
 <p>Qing Yi actually wanted to know why too. This woman, who could cause a Grade Four Martial Saint be fearful of and be deferential to her, said that she hit it off with her. Who would believe that? However, she knew that her son had saved them before, thus they said that they hit it off, they had made it clear that they were here because of her son.</p>
 <p>“Sir Qing, can I say a few words.” Yu Ruyan’s expression did not have too great a change.</p>
 <p>“We did not come with any bad intentions, the kindness that sire has shown to my Duanmu Clan is something that we can never repay. I can tell they Sir Qing is a person that will never forget the kindness shown to him. I, Yu Ruyan, am also the same. Take it as me coming here with a sincere heart. I have no other motive for addressing your mother as a sister. I have very little friends, or to rephrase this, I do not have many close friends, however, I will treat your mother as one of my best friends. However, the matter of you saving me cannot be overlooked. I would admit that without you as the middleman, I would not be here today. Everything that happens, happens for a reason. I wonder if Sir Qing would be able to forgive this little lady for this offense……”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui never thought that with her status, she would be able to say such words, he could not help but smile and said “Forgiveness does not matter, I have never expected any repayments from you. Even if the person I want to save was an ordinary person, I would still help them. Even if a person I did not want to save is extremely wealthy or someone that has a lot of prestige, I would not even save them no matter what.”</p>
 <p>“I know, but you cannot just ignore the good will of the person you saved!”</p>
 <p>Duanmu Lingshuang stood at a side and frowned at this unreasonable man. Why did her mother have to put up with such a person, although you saved her, you can’t behave like this…….</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, Lady Duanmu does not have any malicious intents.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, an old man wearing silk clothes with white hair and a beard walked in, smiling at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Nian Lao? When did you get here?” Qing Shui quickly smiled and welcomed him.</p>
 <p>“He came at the same time as Ba Donghe!” Yu Ruyan smiled as she told him. It was better that she spoke of this matter rather than Nian Feng’s grandfather himself.</p>
 <p>“Many thanks, Nian Lao!” Qing Shui bowed respectfully to him. When he was fighting with Ba Donghe, he felt that there was something weird nearby. Now, he knew why.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was not stupid, this sentence from Yu Ruyan allowed Qing Shui to understand everything. Qing Shui was very grateful to Nian Lao in his heart.</p>
 <p>“There is no need to be courteous since I promised you the last time. I would of course do it, unless I lacked the strength.” Nian Lao happily smiled and walked to Yu Ruyan’s side with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, Lady Duanmu has no malicious intents. I know her personality very well, many of the people in the Central Continent knows it as well. She is a person that will never forget any kindness shown to her. You saved her life once, you can put down all the worries you have.” Nian Lao smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“I know that she does not have any malicious intents, a small character like me and the Qing Clan would not even enter her eyes. Just that, I don’t like this feeling.” Qing Shui laughed at himself.</p>
 <p>“Is Sir Qing still angry at me?” Yu Ruyan looked at this youth then looked at her daughter beside her.</p>
 <p>“No, it is just me being small-minded, sorry.” Qing Shui laughed. Actually, Qing Shui was not angry, he just did not like being pitied by these big clans. Qing Shui felt that Yu Ruyan was pitying the Qing Clan.</p>
 <p>From her words, you could tell what kind of person Yu Ruyan was, she had not expected this man to be so sensitive, to the point when it seemed like he was petty!</p>
 <p>Actually, there were no problems, with the appearance of Nian Lao, the matter got resolved in an even more peaceful manner. Qing Shui smiled at Qing Yi and said “Mother, sorry, I caused you to be trapped in the middle.”</p>
 <p>“You smelly brat, you scared me.” Qing Yi smiled as she rubbed Qing Shui’s head, then everyone headed towards the biggest living room in the Qing Clan.</p>
 <p>“Thank you!”</p>
 <p>While they were walking, Duanmu Lingshuang turned her head and said to Qing Shui, who was not far away.</p>
 <p>“I never thought that you would return, do you still remember the promise you made?” Qing Shui teased her.</p>
 <p>Duanmu Lingshuang was surprised. She then thought about the situation in Flowerfruit Mountain. Although the time they spent interacting with each other was short, but she would not forget that promise for as long as she lived.</p>
 <p>“Weren’t you just joking?” Duanmu Lingshuang said unnaturally.</p>
 <p>“Lingshuang, what did you promised? The promises you made should be fulfilled.” Yu Ruyan smiled, looking at Duanmu Lingshuang and Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Nothing……” Duanmu Lingshuang eyes were flustered, then she gave Qing Shui a complex look.</p>
 <p>“I was just joking with her, she said she would give me the big bird that she rode on.” Qing Shui said playfully.</p>
 <p>“That could be given to you.” Yu Ruyan smiled as she walked.</p>
 <p>“Oh, I was just joking, I have one already, I just did not expect the young miss to be so petty, and could not bear to give it up.” Qing Shui said clearly as he carried Qing Yin, who had run over.</p>
 <p>Duanmu Lingshuang was speechless and could only remain quiet, as long as Qing Shui did not speak of that matter, then it would be fine. Actually, she did not know that even if she wanted to say it, Qing Shui would not be willing to. He had decided not to get involved with any more women.</p>
 <p>After they entered the great hall, Yu Ruyan took out a bottle the size of a baby’s fist “This if for you, consider it a token of my appreciation.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that the other people of the Qing Clan had probably already accepted her gifts. He suspiciously looked at that bottle and asked “What does this do?”</p>
 <p>“Take it, Qing Shui. This is the ‘Dew of the Raining Star Flower’, it can clear the spirit, cleanse the bones and marrows, and strengthen blood vessels.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled as he received it. Regardless of the situation, this was a token of their appreciation. Furthermore, this woman was very strong and she addressed his mother as a sister. When put this way, if would cause anyone who wanted to take actions against the Qing Clan to have misgivings.</p>
 <p>“Thank you!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could not bring himself to call her Aunt Yu, neither did he have the intentions to. She seemed so young, it would feel weird to call her that. In his past life, Qing Shui was not good at flattery or currying favor with someone, it was still the same now.</p>
 <p>The two Martial Saints from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord had also arrived. Qing Shui respectfully gave them a bow “In the future, the Qing Clan will have to rely on you two elders.”</p>
 <p>The two Martial Saints quickly returned his greetings “As long as we are alive, we will not let harm befall the Qing Clan.”</p>
 <p>Of the two old men, one was called Wu Chengyi, the other was called Hong Luansong. They were both Grade Four Martial Saints, but they were still a distance away from the Great Perfection Stage.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Qing Shui also noticed that Wu Chengyi and Hong Luansong had a respectful expression when they saw Yu Ruyan, his felt relief in his heart.</p>
 <p>Now that Qing Shui was back, the two Martial Saints had already brought their families here for a month, and explained everything to him. Qing Shui let loose a sigh of relief, now there were two more Martial Saints protecting the clan.</p>
 <p>Three days later, Yu Ruyan and Duanmu Lingshuang left. In these three days, Qing Shui barely interacted with them. He would only interact with them when there was a meal together and everyone chatted.</p>
 <p>However, they knew that Qing Shui would be heading towards the Central Continent very soon, they repeatedly reminded Qing Shui to visit the Duanmu Clan after he arrived in the Central Continent!</p>
 <p>“Nian Lao, are you leaving as well? How about you leave after the end of the year? Then we can go together.” After a few more days, Nian Lao wanted to return to the Central Continent but Qing Shui tried to get him to stay.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt particularly grateful to this old man. Although he did not make a move but he did not reveal the things he did for Qing Shui. If Yu Ruyan did not see it, then he probably would not have known that he have been helping him from the dark.</p>
 <p>“I left my clan for about half a year already, it is time to go back. When you come to the Central Continent, we can meet again.” Nian Lao said in a straightforward manner.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw that he was determined, thus he rode his Fire Bird to see him off. They flew a few thousand miles away before he stopped, then watched as the golden rosefinch disappeared into the horizon.</p>
 <p>After he arrived back, half the morning had already passed. Qing Shui and the two Martial Saints, Elder Wu and Elder Hong, went to the secret chambers. Qing Shui was used to calling them elders.</p>
 <p>He first gave each of them a Small Revitalizing Pellet. The strength of the two elders were about 700 countries, but that didn’t include their techniques. At first, Qing Shui thought that the higher the cultivation, the stronger the pill. This thought was indeed correct, but there was a limit. A King Grade medicinal pill could only increase one’s strength by a maximum of five countries.</p>
