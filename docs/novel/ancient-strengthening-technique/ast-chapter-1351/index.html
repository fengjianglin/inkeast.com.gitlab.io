 <p><b>AST 1351 - Incomplete Alchemy Recipe, Yehuang Duxin, Super Profligate, Encounter</b></p>
 <p>After refining successfully, Qing Shui could not wait to open the Golden Flint Iron Cauldron. At the bottom of the cauldron, there were two snow-white medicinal pills that were each slightly bigger that the pad of one's thumb. They exuded a strong medicinal scent.</p>
 <p>To have two of them in one try was considered to be good. After all, it could only be taken by those who were Peak Martial Emperor or lower. By rights, Qing Shui wasn't considered Peak Martial Emperor yet, so he could still use it. If it was any later, he would probably not have the chance to eat it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui would be able to truly reach Peak Martial Emperor if he were to take one. However, he had a thought, which was to become a Peak Martial Emperor with a strength of 500,000 sun. If it could reach that, he would have gotten a great deal and could directly use the Origin Returning Pill to raise his power to a terrifying level.</p>
 <p>Those who were at Peak Martial Emperor could only take it once, so even if he were to reach Peak Martial Emperor, he could still take it again. This was how it should work out in theory.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't rush to take the pills but continued to refine. One would get a higher level of mastery as the number of attempts increased. From there, Qing Shui's success rate was excellent. It was a pity that although refining these didn't take much time, it took a lot of spirit energy, resulting in him having to rest after refining a few times. Most alchemists wouldn't be able to succeed just because of the spirit energy requirement.</p>
 <p>Going on and off, Qing Shui would cultivate to recover his power when he got tired and also take the time to study the other alchemy recipes and take turns refining different medicinal pills. This was what it was like for Yuan Su's alchemy recipes. They all took a lot of spirit energy in the process of refining.</p>
 <p>Origin Essence Pill, Divine Strength Pill…</p>
 <p>Qing Shui actually still had another medicinal pill which he hadn't let any other people try before, the Greencloud Up-step Pellet. The reason was because there was an unstable factor in the pill and it has a 1% chance of causing the person's meridian channels to break.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had taken the Greencloud Up-step Pellet before. The alchemy recipe he had gotten was an incomplete one. He didn't know what medicinal herbs it was lacking and thus substituted with other medicinal pills. This resulted in the Greencloud Up-step Pellets he created, having a 1% chance of breaking the user's meridian channels.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Qing Shui didn't continue to refine the pills thereafter. Although a 1% chance wasn't big, it would be unfortunate if that were to happen.</p>
 <p>No matter how powerful Qing Shui's medical skills were, it was still very hard for him to cure f broken meridian channels...</p>
 <p>Therefore, he wanted to see if there were any other solutions. If there really weren't any, he could only take the risk. 1% chance was still considered quite low. It might even be such that it wouldn't occur once in every 100 tries.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su. Qing Shui thought of Yuan Su. When he entered his room, he could still sense that her gaze was on him. He could let her take a look at the alchemy recipe for the Greencloud Up-step Pellet. She would definitely be able to help him complete the recipe.</p>
 <p>Thinking of this solution made Qing Shui very happy. If he could successfully refine the Greencloud Up-step Pellets, then the people around him would be able to gain immense power.</p>
 <p>The Greencloud Up-step Pellets were just like its name and could be taken by people of all levels. However, the effect would be different for each person.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui spent almost all of his time on refining demons and cultivation. Of course, he would also be tempering his magic treasures. For the past half a year or so, neither the Five Elements Divine Flag nor the other magic treasures he had, had gained an increment in their grades.</p>
 <p>After the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and his other demonic beasts had leveled up, the Spirit Gathering Lamp, Heaven Shaking Drum and the Coiled Dragon Statue were still effective. This let Qing Shui heave a sigh of relief. The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's attacking power was now close to that of a Peak Martial Emperor under the effect of the Heaven Shaking Drum. Of course, it was still a little away from the weakest of all Peak Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>With the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant's rate of progress, it would be able to reach Peak Martial Emperor very soon. When that happened, it would face a barrier from attaining a breakthrough. The Heaven and Earth Battle Beast would face its most crucial barrier.</p>
 <p>If it could cross the barrier, it would be able to truly become a Heaven and Earth Battle Beast, entering a whole new realm. If it couldn't get past it, it wouldn't be able to really enter the ancient battlefield.</p>
 <p>The next morning Qing Shui didn't wake up too early nor too late. After all, when he came out from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, the sky was already bright. He didn't even have the time to eat the medicinal pills he had refined. After some hesitation, Qing Shui still felt that it was better for him to head out first and then to decide what to do with them after he was back!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had no idea if Yuan Su slept that night. She was already up and was learning to cook. These were all snacks, side dishes and such from Qing Shui's Culinary Arts' repertoire. She was busy but enjoying herself.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw this cute side of hers, he could not help but smile. When Yuan Su saw Qing Shui, she felt a little embarrassed and threw him a slightly annoyed glance, "Do you want to eat? I'll make some for you."</p>
 <p>"Of course!" Qing Shui smiled and replied.</p>
 <p>Soulsearch lived at home with Li Ji but would come to the Imperial Cuisine Hall in the late morning. The Imperial Cuisine Hall's operating hours were neither too early nor too late but the timing at which they come to the Imperial Cuisine Hall could be very flexible.</p>
 <p>Very soon, Yuan Su brought out the dishes and placed them on the tea table.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sat there, sniffing the food while Yuan Su took a seat opposite him.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, have you heard? Yehuang Clan and Shui Clan seemed to be having some kind of disagreement." Yuan Su picked up a Jade Steamed Bun and took a bite after saying that.</p>
 <p>"Disagreement?" Qing Shui hadn't heard of it.</p>
 <p>"It seemed that Shui Clan has snatched Yehuang Clan's business. Many people said that they did it intentionally as a challenge to the Yehuang Clan," Yuan Su ate and said slowly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could still remember the Young Master from the event that had happened the other time. He had no idea what the members of Shui Clan were like.</p>
 <p>"Between Yehuang Clan and Shui Clan, which of them do you think is suitable to lead the Yehuang Country?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su blinked her beautiful eyes and looked at Qing Shui. "Both of them are suitable but both of them aren't suitable. They are the same. Do you want to know who's the one who has his eyes set on me?"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. He hadn't heard her mentioning this before.</p>
 <p>"Yehuang Duxin!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui frowned slightly, "Has he still been bothering you?"</p>
 <p>"He has. He came two days ago. He even said that even though I've become a physician of the Imperial Cuisine Hall, I can forget about escaping from him." When Yuan Su said this, she was in a state of self-mockery. In the end, she still had to tell this man and get his help. She was also willing to receive his help.</p>
 <p>From the name, Yehuang Duxin seemed to be from the Yehuang Clan's generation who went by the 'Du' name and was one generation senior to Yehuang Guwu. Qing Shui wondered which of them was Yehuang Guwu's inhumane father.</p>
 <p>"Did he say anything else?" Qing Shui felt that he should forget about leaving for the short term.</p>
 <p>"He said that he'll return in another few days and told me to consider becoming his 25th concubine..."</p>
 <p>"Damn it! When he comes, I'll make sure that he becomes impotent!" Qing Shui could not help but blurting out.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su blushed. She was an alchemist and naturally knew what Qing Shui was saying. Qing Shui's rough choice of words gave her a strange feeling and also made her feel a little happy.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui seemed to also have realized that he had said something wrong. He smiled awkwardly, "Don't worry. Whoever dares to make things hard for a member of our Imperial Cuisine Hall, I'll make sure that he regrets it."</p>
 <p>"I'm by myself here and can only look to you for help. But if you can't help me, then don't take the risk. After all, Yehuang Clan is a top notch power in the country," Yuan Su said softly.</p>
 <p>"You're my friend. No matter who the other party is, as long as they bully my friend, I'll have to stand up for my friend. In the worst case scenario, I'll bring you guys with me and leave directly. I won't let you be bullied," Qing Shui said, relaxed.</p>
 <p>"Thank you. I have a friend now." Yuan Su was honestly very thankful. Back when they were in the five continents, she knew that Qing Shui was definitely a man of his word and he would always be confident of backing up to the things he said.</p>
 <p>"I won't be leaving for now. Come, we'll head upstairs to try the medicinal pills. I also need your help to study something."</p>
 <p>"What is it?"</p>
 <p>"An incomplete alchemy recipe. I want to get your help to complete it."</p>
 <p>The Greencloud Up-step Pellet might not be the Greencloud Up-step Pellet which Qing Shui had taken before but was very similar, with similar effects. It didn't have a name either and thus he wasn't very concerned what its name was.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui said this, he passed the alchemy recipe to Yuan Su.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that the reason Yuan Su had told him about the matter earlier, was because there was no way she could run away from it. If there were still a chance of salvaging the situation, Yuan Su would definitely attempt it.</p>
 <p>Just then, someone knocked on the door. The person who came in was Yuan Long.</p>
 <p>"Sir, Miss Su, Young Master Yehuang wishes to meet Miss Su."</p>
 <p>"So fast? Mm, I've got it. Yuan Long, go and tell him that Miss Su will soon be there," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Miss Su..."</p>
 <p>"It's better for you to call me by my name. It's weird to have you calling me by this," Yuan Su threw a glance at Qing Shui and said.</p>
 <p>"Then let's go down and have a look to see what this Young Master Yehuang wants!" Qing Shui smiled and took the lead to head out.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui first saw Yehuang Duxin, he knew that this must be Yehuang Guwu's father, the birth father whom Yehuang Guwu didn't acknowledge to be her father. The two of them shared some similarities in their appearance.</p>
 <p>He was definitely a handsome man who appeared to have just reached middle-age, with a hint of maturity but yet also frivolousness. He sat there, exuding an aura and dignified disposition that one in power would have.</p>
 <p>He was a profligate son of the Yehuang Clan but was also a genius of the Yehuang Clan. He was a highly intelligent man and was also a super profligate in the Yehuang Country. He had a reputation even amongst the higher society of the few countries nearby. He was frivolous and lusty but also extremely vicious. Whenever he were to come across a beautiful lady, he would come up with various ways to get his hands on them. It could be using his identity, his looks or his powerful abilities. Before him, many ladies, married ladies and young ladies from wealthy families would be like moths who would fly toward the fire. They knew well what kind of person he was but yet couldn't control themselves.</p>
 <p>Before coming down, Qing Shui had gotten some understanding of Yehuang Duxin. And now that he had seen this man in person, he was even more convinced of the things he had been told earlier. This man was now considered one of the weakest Peak Martial Emperors. At his age, he would definitely be considered a great genius, throwing many people in his generation far behind.</p>
 <p>It was when Qing Shui was thinking about all this that he realized he himself was what people would find hard to accept. This man wouldn't even be able to fend off his Nine Continents Mountain. Right now, the attacks of the Nine Continents Mountain had reached about 290,000 sun and was at grade three. With three times Qing Shui's speed and that terrifying Shield Attack, Yehuang Duxin could only take a beating when he had a strength of 300,000 sun. The result would still be the same even if Yehuang Duxin's strength was several tens of thousands more.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was now very happy. He had an indescribable sense of superiority. There were a few other middle-aged men next to Yehuang Duxin but they were weaker in comparison. Qing Shui didn't even take a look at them and just took a seat with Yuan Su opposite them.</p>
 <p>"Hello, Mister Yehuang!" Qing Shui smiled and looked at this handsome man.</p>
 <p>"Hello, Physician Qing, Miss Yuan." Yehuang Duxin didn't stand up but his expression was very natural and graceful. It made one feel that he was born to be an aristocrat.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su didn't say anything but just looked at Qing Shui, smiling gently and then occasionally looked toward Yehuang Duxin.</p>
 <p>"What's your reason for looking for Miss Su? She's very busy." Seeing that the other party had held it in, Qing Shui decided to just go straight to the point. Even people who were uninvolved could tell what Qing Shui was trying to say.</p>
