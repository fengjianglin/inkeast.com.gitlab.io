 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled as he greeted Shui Yunfeng. He then invited him to take a seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In response, Shui Yunfeng nodded back at Qing Shui with a smile and thanked him before sitting down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Yunfeng had undergone significant changes. His attitude, as well as the fact that he thanked him, had already come to show that he changed a lot. This was also something which Qing Shui had wanted to see. This proved that the people who had received Holy Saint Inheritors shouldn’t be too wicked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After getting the alcohols ready, the two then proceeded to have a drink with each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, I understand that I have gone a bit overboard with what I did before. Thank you.” It seemed that Shui Yunfeng had finally managed to think things through. His family couldn’t survive without him. Even if Qing Shui had said that his disease was incurable, he knew that he still mustn’t die. He would also no longer challenge Qing Shui to a life-and-death battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though he might be young, he was still someone with a huge family. He had what he was supposed to have and did what he was supposed to do. A person’s life didn’t just consist of sex and only sex. Though it would be very regretful to lack such things in life, sometimes, this was just how life was meant to be. A person couldn’t just live for the sake of themselves. They still had responsibilities of their own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had never once closed his eyes since the time he went back. He had spent all his time pondering over this thing. Furthermore, after going back and finding peace for himself this time, he had also come to realize that most of his women still loved him. Aside from them, there were still his children. In fact, his women knew that without him, their life in the future would turn out to be very miserable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since he went back, he had had a long chat with his family. Now, he finally understood that in the past, he was actually the one reluctant to hear about things they said. He would often get impatient whenever someone mentioned it, as he found it to be a very shameful thing to discuss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of the earliest women which he met was the one who spoke crucial things to him for the most amount of times. That woman had always been very knowledgeable, as well as a generous person. Even at his most unstable state, he had never once gotten angry at her before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The return trip this time even made him felt like he finally saw the sun coming out of the blankets of cloud. This was why the first thing he spoke when he opened his mouth was words of gratitude. It came out deep down from his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I haven’t even helped you cure your disease yet. Thank me when I finish instead!” Qing Shui chuckled and said. After that, he once again poured him a cup of wine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, the reason I thanked you wasn’t for helping me cure my disease. You brought me out of the blind alley which I have been stuck in for many years. I know better than anyone that my wounds can never be cured.” Despite all that, Shui Yunfeng was still a bit gloomy speaking up to this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course, I understand well enough about the condition of your injuries. I would definitely not have said that unless I am certain up to an extent. Have some confidence in me!” Deep down, Qing Shui also felt really happy, seeing Shui Yunfeng like that,</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is it really curable?” Shui Yunfeng nervously asked. However, he also acted only a bit surprised as he had not been able to confirm Qing Shui’s statement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well then, why don’t we find the answer? You will find out whether it’s curable or not in a moment.” Qing Shui stood up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Yunfeng was amazed. There were even more surprises in his eyes now. He was very excited. Soon after, he stood up and said to Qing Shui, “Alright then. Let me give it a try. What do you need?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui shook his head, “I have already prepared the things that are necessary for the procedure. Let’s go into the room so that I can help you cure your wounds.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Yunfeng’s upper body was naked. Qing Shui prepared two boxes of Gold Needle. Despite all that, Shui Yunfeng was still a bit nervous. It was very easy for Qing Shui to kill him while they were in the middle of the treatment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But as he thought deeper into it, he understood that it was unlikely for this young man to kill him. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have wasted his own energy to talk him out of his problems. Let alone, he was also aware of what the young man was worried about. It wasn’t just merely because he was a Holy Saint Inheritor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another reason why he believed Qing Shui wouldn’t harm him was due to the intense righteous qi within the young man’s body. He couldn’t be more familiar with it. The reason being that the energy within Qing Shui’s body was even purer than his very own. He only lost in terms of the amount of energy he possessed within his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To Qing Shui, it wasn’t a hard task to cure this kind of wounds. However, Qing Shui also couldn’t afford to cure all of his wounds at once. After all, he hadn’t fully confirmed Shui Yunfeng’s identity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui tried to sense his body and felt that approximately thirty meridians within his body had snapped. For the time being, only two meridians were left unsnapped. It was precisely these two meridians that helped ensure he was at least still behave like a normal person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In comparison to other parts, the meridians here were a lot thinner. Once they snapped, or so much as got damaged, only a very few psychiatrists would actually be able to cure it. These meridians were very well-hidden. After all, it was not often that they would get wounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While injecting needles into Shui Yunfeng, Qing Shui also told him about ways to rotate his qi. The Gold Needles itself contained the Qi of Rebirth and Qing Shui still had his treasure, the Diamond Staff which helped boosted his Force of the Five Elements significantly. As a result, his Five Elements Compatibility Force would become many times more powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire treatment didn’t last long. Still, it still took a while. The treatment lasted about six hours. Qing Shui had managed to help him connect back eight of his meridians. Seeing that it had been done, he slowly came to a stop and took out the Gold Needles one by one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Yunfeng wiped off the sweat on his head. He, at that moment, was in a state of shock which even words couldn’t describe. Whether Qing Shui was able to cure him or not, he held the most authority to talk about it. No one could have felt even clearer than himself. He looked at Qing Shui with eyes that look like he was worshiping a god.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can roughly recover a third of them. You should restrict yourself during this time. If needed, you can release these restrictions, but keep in mind that the time of the next treatment will then have to be delayed even further. If you do restrict yourself, however, I can once again help you carry out a treatment after three months. You will be fully recovered by half a year.” Qing Shui smiled and said as he put back his Gold Needles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Yunfeng was very agitated. He was agitated to the extent he became a bit in disbelief. He was unable to even speak properly. It took him half a day to finally speak and that was all that he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are welcome. But you will still have to agree to the conditions which I say. This still applies even after all of these.” Qing Shui chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know! Don’t worry about it. Even if it really was incurable, I didn’t plan to continue forcing you to do the impossible. The things which you said before had helped me see through many things and regained my happiness. I was really startled by the surprise you gave me today.” For a moment, Shui Yunfeng felt as if the world has gotten a lot brighter. Now, he was able to see through many things which he used to mind a lot before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, he felt like he stopped caring as much about gaining benefits from others as before. He noticed that he now had become more generous than ever before. He couldn’t be bothered to argue for many things. Similarly, his view toward Qing Shui was also getting better and better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With such a formidable medical expertise, he must make sure that he made friends with Qing Shui, even if he might be stronger than him in terms of strength. Psychiatrist, formidable ones in particular, often held a very precious status across the continent.</span></p>

Prior to this, I am not sure how I ended up that way myself. I would like to make friends with you. You can ignore the benefits which I had taken into consideration when thinking about making friends with you. It does include the fact that you can help cure my wounds. However, the main reason why I want to get to know you more is that you helped become myself again and reminded me that I had children as well as families. If anything was to happen to me, they would all be done for.”</span></p>

There have been many cases in which two enemies make amends with each other and became friends. Once a fight is dismissed, the newborn friendship would instead be even stronger. Since you didn’t know me well at that time, it was understandable why you would react that way. I like making friends, especially true friends.”</span></p>

Yesterday was the first day when we truly came across each other. I hope that you won’t ponder too much over this. She possesses the Nine Ying Body. I am sure that you know better than anybody else.”</span></p>

He understood what Shui Yunfeng meant. In other words, even if he was given a chance to marry Qing Hanye now, he wouldn’t dare to do it. Prior to this, he was only seeing Qing Hanye as his final hope to cure his disease.</span></p>
