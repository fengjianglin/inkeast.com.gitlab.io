 <p><strong>Chapter 161 Double Joy Buddha Portrait.</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p><strong>AST 0161 – Double Joy Buddha Portrait</strong></p>
  <p>“Oh my, what a perverse technique!” Qing Shui involuntarily spoke with joy.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, are you speaking of something dirty again?” Wenren Wu-Shuang spoke lightly as she approached him.</p>
  <p>“Hehe, this technique is too horny and powerful. If one managed to cultivate this to the 9th level, he would be invincible. It’s a pity that it’s so tough to cultivate this.” Qing Shui lamented.</p>
  <p>Wu-shuang merely glanced at it a few times before she departed. She was afraid that her dainty hands would turn huge and burly if she were to master the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palms. For this reason, she had no interest in it. After rolling her eyes at Qing Shui, she returned back to her small chamber.</p>
  <p>For the first and second level, all a cultivator need was time. As long as one had time, one would be able to master the initial levels. For Qing Shui, he didn’t lack time at all. The method of circulating Qi in the third level was extremely obscure. Also, one’s cultivation base would need to be able to produce an extremely high level of Xiantian Qi.</p>
  <p>“Forget it. I will first cultivate the first two levels. Based on my current level of strength, if I could reach the 2nd level, my strength should increase by a huge amount.”</p>
  <p>In reality, there should be many 9th level cultivation arts and techniques throughout the nine continents. Normally, they wouldn’t be as mysterious as the Nine Waves Great Golden Buddha Palms. Not only could it augment one’s attack, but also he could even send out his attack later against his opponent. However, the attack of the first wave was virtually impossible to guard against.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui would sometimes wonder who that person was. To think that he actually possessed such a godly and mysterious technique was amazing. The man’s heritage should have originated from some ancient reclusive clan or great and powerful sect. After all, it would explain why he had such a treasure in his possession.</p>
  <p>Suddenly, he remembered that the Spring Palace Portrait still had a beast-skin paper within it and Qing Shui hurriedly withdrew it out.</p>
  <p>The beast-skin paper was only about the size of a palm. When Qing Shui touched the paper, he felt that the texture of the paper was extremely supple and contained a hint of warmth. Not only that, its material did not seem too bad either. Maybe, it was really formed from the skin of a demonic beast.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was wildly guessing, but after he saw the words on the beast-skin paper, he suddenly went speechless.</p>
  <p>“Heaven Yang Pill!”</p>
  <p>Bewildered, Qing Shui continue reading. Concoction Recipe: Heaven Yang Fruit, Fire Golden Tiger Penis, Silver Great Bull Penis, Icesnow Thunder Goat Penis, Demonic Snake Gallbladder…</p>
  <p>A pill to enhance Yang? (Male Sex Drive)</p>
  <p>Qing Shui was speechless. That sturdy and muscular man still had two more items aside from the Nine Waves Great Buddha Palms. He also had the Spring Palace Portrait as well as the Heaven Yang Pill…</p>
  <p>Not only was the first item on the recipe ‘Heaven Yang Fruit’ unknown to Qing Shui, but also the rest of the items surprisingly were 15 types of different demonic beast penises. Penises belonging to demonic beasts… One would most likely die first before they managed to castrate 15 different demonic beasts’ penises…..</p>
  <p>What exactly was a Heaven Yang Fruit?</p>
  <p>“Wu-shuang, what do you think this is?” Qing Shui had given her a set of Tiger Form Techniques. Currently, Wu-shuang was in a daze when she looked at the recipe. Abruptly, the helpless Qing Shui saw Wu-shuang execute the Tiger’s Roar and Tiger Tailwhip Kick.</p>
  <p>As Wu-shuang read the contents of the recipe, hints of redness could be seen on that pale, jade-like neck of hers.</p>
  <p>“Shameless thing.” She involuntarily scolded.</p>
  <p>“Wu-shuang, what is the Heaven Yang Fruit?” Qing Shui felt that this recipe may be useful. Naturally, he didn’t need that to boost his sex drive.</p>
  <p>“The Heaven Yang Fruit is a fruit of extreme Yang.” Wenren Wu-shuang somewhat unnaturally replied.</p>
  <p>“Can it be eaten?” Qing Shui managed to roughly guess 70-80% of the fruit’s function after hearing the name. But, he continued to ask to find out more information.</p>
  <p>“No, you can’t eat that. You definitely can’t eat that.” Wenren Wu-shuang replied in a fluster. That exquisite jade-like face was filled with panic.</p>
  <p>“I can’t eat that? Why?” Qing Shui puzzledly questioned. “Since it is a part of the main ingredient of a recipe, it should be able to be eaten, right?.”</p>
  <p>“Well…Once, there was someone who ate that. In the end, his c*ck exploded and died.” She finally replied with a bashful expression on her face. Wenren Wu-shuang was afraid that Qing Shui would be curious enough to experiment the fruit by eating it.</p>
  <p>After that, she lowered her head and dared not to look at Qing Shui. Qing Shui froze, “C*ck explosion? That powerful?”</p>
  <p>“Anyways, you can’t eat it. Stop talking about this.” The blushed countenance of Wenren Wu-Shuang had a pouting expression as a watery mist could be seen in her eyes.</p>
  <p>“Wu-shuang, I love how you look right now. Maybe one day, I would suffer a c*ck explosion because of you too.” Qing Shui helplessly glanced at the pitiful looking Wu-shuang.</p>
  <p>“If you don’t eat it, you would not suffer an… explosion.” Wu-shuang shyly replied, as she reminded Qing Shui again.</p>
  <p>“Everyday looking at a peerless beauty such as yourself, I’m able to see but unable to touch you. It’s like I’m eating the Heaven Yang Fruit everyday. Maybe my c*ck would explode one day because of you.”</p>
  <p>“No talking nonsense. Are you itching for a beating?” Wenren Wu-shuang seemed very unhappy with Qing Shui’s words.</p>
  <p>“Wu-shuang, let’s take a look at that book. You were very interested in it before. Hehe… Wait, don’t go!” Qing Shui brought out the book containing the Spring Palace Portrait as Wenren Wu-shuang ran away in a panic.</p>
  <p>“Naughty person, be more serious!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui snickered. The book containing the Spring Palace Portrait was only about 40 pages thick. Qing Shui felt that the man’s possessions shouldn’t be something ordinary. After all, the two other items he had obtained were all considered treasures. Thus, the value of this book shouldn’t be that low.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui flipped the pages open, and only saw pictures without any words. How vivid and life-like they were. Qing Shui calmed his heart as he looked at the many blood-surging pictures of the portrait. The man in the picture was a bald headed male, causing Qing Shui to think of a sinful monk that was enjoying the pleasures of women.</p>
  <p>There were two pictures on every page with a total of 72 techniques between man and woman. Qing Shui slowly read on. The last 8 pictures contained images of the woman taking his manhood into her mouth, holding his manhood between her breasts, and even taking his manhood in a place more shameful than her honey pot.</p>
  <p>After reading through the contents of the book for about four hours, Qing Shui was feeling extremely aroused as the thing in his pants stood up like a huge, erect tentage. Coincidentally, Wenren Wu-shuang walked out of her chamber and saw Qing Shui. She stood there dumbly for a moment before bashfully running back into her chamber for cover.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui bitterly laughed, “Damn it, I just lost all my face.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui shifted his gaze downwards, and studied his weapon. “The degree of my erection should be still okay, right…?”</p>
  <p>If those from the Buddhist Sect were to witness this scenario, they would surely all be dumbfounded. There would actually be someone who could actually endure his lust after he finished reading the «Joyous Divine Buddha Portrait». He wouldn’t go looking for women, and still maintained this level of clarity. This showed how great his spirit was compared to others.</p>
  <p>It was a pity that Qing Shui didn’t know that this was a supreme treasure from the Joyous Sect, «Joyous Divine Buddha Portrait». The portrait contained a divine skill within. Other than the ancestor of the sect, there was no one else that could decipher the secrets within.</p>
  <p>Despite the mystery, the Joyous Sect was still able to gain some insights regarding the cultivation techniques. They specifically required the joint union between a male and a female from it. This caused the power of their sect to rise exponentially. All those that could gain knowledge from this portrait would be considered a powerful cultivator.</p>
  <p>It’s a shame that the original book of the «Joyous Divine Buddha Portrait» was lost long ago. Currently, the book in the Joyous Sect’s hands was merely a copy. Who would have thought that after a series of fortunate coincidences , Qing Shui was able to obtain the «Joyous Divine Buddha Portrait» in the Cang Lang City?</p>
  <p>After being disturbed by Wu-shuang, Qing Shui no longer had any interest to continue reading it. Together with the Heaven Yang Divine Pill recipe and the Nine Waves Golden Buddha Palms Technique, he closed the book and kept all three of them inside his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>

The man in the picture was a bald headed male, causing Qing Shui to think of a sinful monk that was enjoying the pleasures of women.</p>
 <p>There were two pictures on every page with a total of 72 techniques between man and woman. Qing Shui slowly read on. The last 8 pictures contained images of the woman taking his manhood into her mouth, holding his manhood between her breasts, and even taking his manhood in a place more shameful than her honey pot.</p>
 <p>After reading through the contents of the book for about four hours, Qing Shui was feeling extremely aroused as the thing in his pants stood up like a huge, erect tentage. Coincidentally, Wenren Wu-shuang walked out of her chamber and saw Qing Shui. She stood there dumbly for a moment before bashfully running back into her chamber for cover.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui bitterly laughed, “Damn it, I just lost all my face.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shifted his gaze downwards, and studied his weapon. “The degree of my erection should be still okay, right…?”</p>
 <p>If those from the Buddhist Sect were to witness this scenario, they would surely all be dumbfounded. There would actually be someone who could actually endure his lust after he finished reading the «Joyous Divine Buddha Portrait». He wouldn’t go looking for women, and still maintained this level of clarity. This showed how great his spirit was compared to others.</p>
 <p>It was a pity that Qing Shui didn’t know that this was a supreme treasure from the Joyous Sect, «Joyous Divine Buddha Portrait». The portrait contained a divine skill within. Other than the ancestor of the sect, there was no one else that could decipher the secrets within.</p>
 <p>Despite the mystery, the Joyous Sect was still able to gain some insights regarding the cultivation techniques. They specifically required the joint union between a male and a female from it. This caused the power of their sect to rise exponentially. All those that could gain knowledge from this portrait would be considered a powerful cultivator.</p>
 <p>It’s a shame that the original book of the «Joyous Divine Buddha Portrait» was lost long ago. Currently, the book in the Joyous Sect’s hands was merely a copy. Who would have thought that after a series of fortunate coincidences , Qing Shui was able to obtain the «Joyous Divine Buddha Portrait» in the Cang Lang City?</p>
 <p>After being disturbed by Wu-shuang, Qing Shui no longer had any interest to continue reading it. Together with the Heaven Yang Divine Pill recipe and the Nine Waves Golden Buddha Palms Technique, he closed the book and kept all three of them inside his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
