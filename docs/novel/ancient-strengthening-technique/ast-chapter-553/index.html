  <p dir="ltr"><strong>553 - Two years later, Martial Saint Elder Ge</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Regrow the body……” Qing Shui had not thought that the World of the Nine Continents also had the Great Revitalizing Pellet, it was even a divine medicine that could regrow the body. His Great Revitalizing Pellet did not have such an effect, it could only heal some major wounds, then raise one’s strength by a little.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Could it be that the quality of the Great Revitalizing Pellet was not sufficient? Or was it because his Great Revitalizing Pellet was a different medicine from the World of the Nine Continents ‘Great Revitalizing Pellet?’ Qing Shui thought. One must know that the effect of regrowing the body was sufficient for it to become a legendary pill.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In this martial art prevalent world, there were many strong cultivators that were disabled or missing a limb. With the legendary Great Revitalizing Pellet, one could exchange it with them for anything they wanted.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mine can only heal some major wounds, the first pellet permanently raises strength by 20 %, and it temporarily raises strength by 100 % for 15 minutes.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hai Dongqing opened her small mouth in shock but she quickly closed it. However, her beautiful appearance in that moment caused Qing Shui’s heart to palpitate, thus he silently shifted his gaze away from her face.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Hai Dongqing saw Qing Shui’s expression, she relaxed. She hated men who looked at her ravenously or gutless men who would steal glances at her. Qing Shui had looked openly at her, but had controlled himself sufficiently. She did not hate this kind of feeling, she even felt that this youth, who did not have a thick skin, was quite interesting.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If Qing Shui knew what she thought, he would not mind using a wretched gaze to look at her. However, Qing Shui would subconsciously reject that, because Qing Shui did not want to get involved in any more relationships between man and woman.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I quite like these items of yours, I shall take advantage of you and ask for them all, is that alright?” said Hai Dongqing as she looked at the items in Qing Shui’s hands.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“These are things that you deserve in the first place. If everything is alright, then can we consider our transaction successful?” Qing Shui stood up and smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“En, hang on for a moment, I’ll go get the title deeds and the contracts for ownership transfer.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Very soon, the exchange was completed. Qing Shui was happy in his heart, he had never expected to be able to buy the Hai Clan’s villa. On the Ocean Blue Astral Road, this villa ranked among the top.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Furthermore, Qing Shui knew that this Ocean Blue Astral Road was related to the Hai Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’m leaving, we will meet again if fate allows it!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hai Dongqing smiled at Qing Shui and then left swiftly!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui watched as Hai Dongqing left, then he wandered around the Hai Clan’s villa. He visited every pavilion and discovered that all the furnitures were new. Qing Shui did not find this strange, this was a practice in the World of the Nine Continents. Things that were used before, the previous owners had to remove it or destroy it. They could not allow others to use the things they used before, and others would not want to use it either.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Originally, Qing Shui had intended to custom order some furniture, but it looked like he did not need to, he could just get them to directly move in.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After he looked around, Qing Shui locked up the big doors of the Hai Clan Villa, it seems that half the afternoon had passed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">#############</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Time went by in a flash! In a blink of an eye, two years passed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A peaceful two years!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Greencloud Continent City!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Clan!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The majestic Qing Clan, this used to be the Hai Clan’s Villa, but two years ago, it was bought by the Qing Clan, a rapidly developing family clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At first, there were some people who came to make trouble, but they were driven away by the Qing Clan members. The other party was a slightly famous second rate family clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The brainless second generation family head did not think about who stayed here in the past, could the people who bought the villa from the Hai Clan be ordinary?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They even spoke rudely, trying to take liberties with Mingyue Gelou, and got killed by her. When that clan found out that their descendants had died at the hands of a nameless family clan, they brought their people after finding out that the Qing Clan did not have any background.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a pity that Qing Shui was around and suppressed everyone. The Qing Clan rose up because of this disaster. This time, the Qing Clan was truly headed to becoming part of the upper echelons of the Greencloud Continent City.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the same time, almost everyone learned that the Qing Clan and the Heavenly Palace were very close, the young patriarch of the Heavenly Palace was a member of this Clan, in a short period of time, the Qing Clan became as busy as a market……&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everyone came to extend their congratulations including the large family clans of the Heavenly Palace, as well as the surrounding clans and sects. This was a good chance to establish a good relationship with the Qing Clan, no one would give it up. After finding out that the Qing Clan was in the medicinal herbs business, many big medicinal herb trading companies took the initiative to cooperate with the Qing Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When the reputation of one was great, others can rely on it for cover!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">All of these things were very normal, since they could not avoid it, they might as well enjoy it! Qing Shui spent most of his time staying in the newly established Qing Clan’s villa. Even if he had to go back to the Heavenly Palace, he would leave the Diamond Gigantic Elephant behind. Aside from doing business, the other Qing Clan members were bitterly training, especially Lin Zhanhan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was how the two years went by!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The changes in the Qing Clan were great, amongst the three generations, aside from those who did not want to cultivate, everyone had reached the Xiantian Realm. Qing Qing had achieved it as well, after Qing You.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">All these breakthroughs were the results of Qing Shui guiding them, in addition to the Spirit Concentrating Pill, Tiger Bone Soup, Snake Gall Soup, Bone Strengthening Pill, Constitution Nurturing Pill…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After reaching Xiantian, they directly joined the Heavenly Palace, because it was safer there. Finally, Qing Shui let Qing Shan take the Xiantian Golden Pellet. Qing Shan did not like cultivating, so after he reached &nbsp;Xiantian, he was already very happy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Under the effects of Qing Shui’s pills, Lin Zhanhan was now a Peak Martial King with the strength of four countries, he could be considered stronger than Cang Wuya by a little.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue has also more or less achieved the Peak Martial King and had started to accumulate strength!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li bitterly trained and was now a Grade One Martial King. She was the slowest one amongst them, even Wenren Wu-shuang, who had lost her memories, was now a Grade Five Martial King. Without any other way, Qing Shui let Wenren Wu-shuang eat every pill he had, he even helped her to cleanse her marrow and replace her vessels. In these two years, although she had not recovered her memories, but her eye-piercing blood-red hair had turned back to black.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She was now at least happy and got along with the others pretty well. In these few years, she now knew who were nice and sincere to her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In regards to Wenren Wu-shuang’s breakthrough to the 5th Grade of Martial King, Qing Shui was not surprised. This was because she was one of the women from the Portraits of Beauties. Amongst the women of the Portraits of Beauties, Qing Shui just realized that she was the weakest one.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In this two year period, Qing Bei had reached the 2nd grade of Xiantian. Luan Luan, who had dealt many blows to Qing Bei, had already reached the 5th grade of Xiantian. This almost thirteen year old girl, was now a beauty that could cause the fall of nations.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear’s improvements were not inferior to Luan Luan, Its height had increased by a meter, and its strength increased by more than one country.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was no longer anyone who would dare to anger the Qing Clan in the Greencloud Continent. Furthermore, the Qing Clan were unpretentious, they were not arrogant, and their public reputation was good.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Shui was rushing to the back mountain of Heavenly Palace!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Today was his last treatment for Elder Ge, whether he could recover his Martial Saint strength would be determined!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Elder Ge saw Qing Shui, he was a little excited. It had been almost three years since this youth had given him a chance to chase after his former glory.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Elder Ge!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui is here!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Let us begin!” Qing Shui smiled as he took out the Gold Needles. He sterilized the needles with the gray fire in his hands. In an instant, he caused the Gold Needles to turn back into the state it was when it was just made. Furthermore, since the Golden Essence material was a disinfectant, it would not be contaminated.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sure!” Elder Ge took a deep breath.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Don't be so nervous, it is just like the other times, just relax!” Qing Shui looked at Elder Ge’s tensed up muscles, he knew that this was caused by Elder Ge’s excitement and anxiousness.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Saintly Hands!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s hands turned transparent and sparkled like a crystal. In an instant, his hands gave off an overwhelming Spiritual Qi, then they directly landed on Elder Ge’s stout chest!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Pata!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s hands rapidly struck all over Elder Ge’s body, covering every acupoint and joint. His hands seemed as though they were rapidly dancing but they were not frantic or hurried.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He struck Elder Ge’s body more than a few thousand times, until there seemed to be a sparkling translucent Qi on Elder Ge’s body. Then Qing Shui suddenly pulled out a Gold Needle, which he had prepared earlier, and pierced it into Elder Ge’s Shanzhong acupoint.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Shanzhong acupoint was one of the largest acupoints in the human body, it was also known as the death acupoint. If Qing Shui was not accurate, it would be easy to cause serious injuries and even death.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui pierced this needle very steadily, its depth accurate to within millimeters.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Then he took out another Gold Needle and pierced it into the Tiantu acupoint!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Elder Ge’s body trembled!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not even seem to react to it, he took out another Gold Needle without any hesitation and accurately pierced it into Elder Ge’s Youmen acupoint!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yindu!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shiguan!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shangqu!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Zhongzhu!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Six Gold Needles pierced down, there was a layer of fine sweat on Qing Shui’s forehead, but he continued. Suddenly, Qing Shui swept his hands across the six Gold Needles, as though it was a zither.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Weng!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A soft hum rang out, the six Gold Needles were slightly trembling, the frequency was high but the range was small. If one observed carefully, one would notice that they were rotating slower than before.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Elder Ge’s body seemed to be getting cleansed, a fine black oily substance oozed out of his body, giving off an odd odor.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the Seven Stars Acupuncture Technique that Qing Shui practiced over the past two years, not only could it improve talent and constitution, but it could also easily cleanse the marrows. At this moment, Qing Shui watched Elder Ge’s changes without blinking, his hand held a Gold Needle.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel the Qi Force circulating in Elder Ge’s body with his spiritual sense. Silently, he cheered for Elder Ge in his heart.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Slowly, time went by, after the amount of time it takes to brew a pot of tea, Qing Shui squinted, then suddenly plunged the Gold Needle in his hand into the top of Elder Ge’s head.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was as fast as lightning!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Gold Needle was pierced stably into Elder Ge’s Chengguang acupoint!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In a few moments, the seven Gold Needles emitted a faint golden light, furthermore, it was getting brighter. At the same time, Qing Shui could feel a huge strength rising from Elder Ge’s body.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Chengguang acupoint was connected to the majestic Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The moment when the two types of strong Qi clashed against each other, Elder Ge’s whole body released a bright light which enveloped his entire body.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A strong aura of might was released in every direction, and a barely audible beast roar could be heard. This was the might that was released when one’s Qi had reached a certain standard.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Success, Martial Saint, it's a success……” Qing Shui smiled at Elder Ge, who was still wrapped in light.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">“I’m leaving, we will meet again if fate allows it!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hai Dongqing smiled at Qing Shui and then left swiftly!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui watched as Hai Dongqing left, then he wandered around the Hai Clan’s villa. He visited every pavilion and discovered that all the furnitures were new. Qing Shui did not find this strange, this was a practice in the World of the Nine Continents. Things that were used before, the previous owners had to remove it or destroy it. They could not allow others to use the things they used before, and others would not want to use it either.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Originally, Qing Shui had intended to custom order some furniture, but it looked like he did not need to, he could just get them to directly move in.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After he looked around, Qing Shui locked up the big doors of the Hai Clan Villa, it seems that half the afternoon had passed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">#############</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Time went by in a flash! In a blink of an eye, two years passed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A peaceful two years!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Greencloud Continent City!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Clan!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The majestic Qing Clan, this used to be the Hai Clan’s Villa, but two years ago, it was bought by the Qing Clan, a rapidly developing family clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At first, there were some people who came to make trouble, but they were driven away by the Qing Clan members. The other party was a slightly famous second rate family clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The brainless second generation family head did not think about who stayed here in the past, could the people who bought the villa from the Hai Clan be ordinary?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They even spoke rudely, trying to take liberties with Mingyue Gelou, and got killed by her. When that clan found out that their descendants had died at the hands of a nameless family clan, they brought their people after finding out that the Qing Clan did not have any background.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was a pity that Qing Shui was around and suppressed everyone. The Qing Clan rose up because of this disaster. This time, the Qing Clan was truly headed to becoming part of the upper echelons of the Greencloud Continent City.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the same time, almost everyone learned that the Qing Clan and the Heavenly Palace were very close, the young patriarch of the Heavenly Palace was a member of this Clan, in a short period of time, the Qing Clan became as busy as a market……&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everyone came to extend their congratulations including the large family clans of the Heavenly Palace, as well as the surrounding clans and sects. This was a good chance to establish a good relationship with the Qing Clan, no one would give it up. After finding out that the Qing Clan was in the medicinal herbs business, many big medicinal herb trading companies took the initiative to cooperate with the Qing Clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When the reputation of one was great, others can rely on it for cover!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">All of these things were very normal, since they could not avoid it, they might as well enjoy it! Qing Shui spent most of his time staying in the newly established Qing Clan’s villa. Even if he had to go back to the Heavenly Palace, he would leave the Diamond Gigantic Elephant behind. Aside from doing business, the other Qing Clan members were bitterly training, especially Lin Zhanhan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was how the two years went by!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The changes in the Qing Clan were great, amongst the three generations, aside from those who did not want to cultivate, everyone had reached the Xiantian Realm. Qing Qing had achieved it as well, after Qing You.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">All these breakthroughs were the results of Qing Shui guiding them, in addition to the Spirit Concentrating Pill, Tiger Bone Soup, Snake Gall Soup, Bone Strengthening Pill, Constitution Nurturing Pill…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After reaching Xiantian, they directly joined the Heavenly Palace, because it was safer there. Finally, Qing Shui let Qing Shan take the Xiantian Golden Pellet. Qing Shan did not like cultivating, so after he reached &nbsp;Xiantian, he was already very happy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Under the effects of Qing Shui’s pills, Lin Zhanhan was now a Peak Martial King with the strength of four countries, he could be considered stronger than Cang Wuya by a little.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue has also more or less achieved the Peak Martial King and had started to accumulate strength!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li bitterly trained and was now a Grade One Martial King. She was the slowest one amongst them, even Wenren Wu-shuang, who had lost her memories, was now a Grade Five Martial King. Without any other way, Qing Shui let Wenren Wu-shuang eat every pill he had, he even helped her to cleanse her marrow and replace her vessels. In these two years, although she had not recovered her memories, but her eye-piercing blood-red hair had turned back to black.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She was now at least happy and got along with the others pretty well. In these few years, she now knew who were nice and sincere to her.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In regards to Wenren Wu-shuang’s breakthrough to the 5th Grade of Martial King, Qing Shui was not surprised. This was because she was one of the women from the Portraits of Beauties. Amongst the women of the Portraits of Beauties, Qing Shui just realized that she was the weakest one.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In this two year period, Qing Bei had reached the 2nd grade of Xiantian. Luan Luan, who had dealt many blows to Qing Bei, had already reached the 5th grade of Xiantian. This almost thirteen year old girl, was now a beauty that could cause the fall of nations.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear’s improvements were not inferior to Luan Luan, Its height had increased by a meter, and its strength increased by more than one country.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was no longer anyone who would dare to anger the Qing Clan in the Greencloud Continent. Furthermore, the Qing Clan were unpretentious, they were not arrogant, and their public reputation was good.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Now, Qing Shui was rushing to the back mountain of Heavenly Palace!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Today was his last treatment for Elder Ge, whether he could recover his Martial Saint strength would be determined!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Elder Ge saw Qing Shui, he was a little excited. It had been almost three years since this youth had given him a chance to chase after his former glory.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Elder Ge!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui is here!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Let us begin!” Qing Shui smiled as he took out the Gold Needles. He sterilized the needles with the gray fire in his hands. In an instant, he caused the Gold Needles to turn back into the state it was when it was just made. Furthermore, since the Golden Essence material was a disinfectant, it would not be contaminated.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sure!” Elder Ge took a deep breath.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Don't be so nervous, it is just like the other times, just relax!” Qing Shui looked at Elder Ge’s tensed up muscles, he knew that this was caused by Elder Ge’s excitement and anxiousness.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Saintly Hands!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s hands turned transparent and sparkled like a crystal. In an instant, his hands gave off an overwhelming Spiritual Qi, then they directly landed on Elder Ge’s stout chest!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Pata!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s hands rapidly struck all over Elder Ge’s body, covering every acupoint and joint. His hands seemed as though they were rapidly dancing but they were not frantic or hurried.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He struck Elder Ge’s body more than a few thousand times, until there seemed to be a sparkling translucent Qi on Elder Ge’s body. Then Qing Shui suddenly pulled out a Gold Needle, which he had prepared earlier, and pierced it into Elder Ge’s Shanzhong acupoint.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Shanzhong acupoint was one of the largest acupoints in the human body, it was also known as the death acupoint. If Qing Shui was not accurate, it would be easy to cause serious injuries and even death.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui pierced this needle very steadily, its depth accurate to within millimeters.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Then he took out another Gold Needle and pierced it into the Tiantu acupoint!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Elder Ge’s body trembled!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not even seem to react to it, he took out another Gold Needle without any hesitation and accurately pierced it into Elder Ge’s Youmen acupoint!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yindu!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shiguan!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shangqu!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Zhongzhu!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Six Gold Needles pierced down, there was a layer of fine sweat on Qing Shui’s forehead, but he continued. Suddenly, Qing Shui swept his hands across the six Gold Needles, as though it was a zither.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Weng!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A soft hum rang out, the six Gold Needles were slightly trembling, the frequency was high but the range was small. If one observed carefully, one would notice that they were rotating slower than before.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Elder Ge’s body seemed to be getting cleansed, a fine black oily substance oozed out of his body, giving off an odd odor.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was the Seven Stars Acupuncture Technique that Qing Shui practiced over the past two years, not only could it improve talent and constitution, but it could also easily cleanse the marrows. At this moment, Qing Shui watched Elder Ge’s changes without blinking, his hand held a Gold Needle.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could feel the Qi Force circulating in Elder Ge’s body with his spiritual sense. Silently, he cheered for Elder Ge in his heart.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Slowly, time went by, after the amount of time it takes to brew a pot of tea, Qing Shui squinted, then suddenly plunged the Gold Needle in his hand into the top of Elder Ge’s head.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was as fast as lightning!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Gold Needle was pierced stably into Elder Ge’s Chengguang acupoint!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In a few moments, the seven Gold Needles emitted a faint golden light, furthermore, it was getting brighter. At the same time, Qing Shui could feel a huge strength rising from Elder Ge’s body.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Chengguang acupoint was connected to the majestic Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The moment when the two types of strong Qi clashed against each other, Elder Ge’s whole body released a bright light which enveloped his entire body.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A strong aura of might was released in every direction, and a barely audible beast roar could be heard. This was the might that was released when one’s Qi had reached a certain standard.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Success, Martial Saint, it's a success……” Qing Shui smiled at Elder Ge, who was still wrapped in light.</p>
