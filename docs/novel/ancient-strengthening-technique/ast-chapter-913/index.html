 <p><strong>AST 913 - Formation Destroyer, Coordination, The Valiant Mu Clan’s Old Man</strong></p>
 <p>The Mu Clan’s old man didn’t seem to be bothered at all by the other person’s gaze, and chuckled instead. “Sky Prison Sect’s Second Sovereign, you are afraid!”</p>
 <p>In Qing Shui’s palm was a 10,000 Years Frosted Iron Ball. Now that he had already broken through to Martial Emperor, it was naturally needless to discuss about his Hidden Weapons abilities further. Even for the Sky Prison Sect’s Second Sovereign’s strength, he could only evade at the mercy of Qing Shui’s hidden weapon.</p>
 <p>This was one of Qing Shui’s trump cards. The moment he used it, he would be killing his opponent.</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui suddenly stomped towards in front of him. An enormous wave of energy spread forward, together with a big wave of flying rocks could be seen streaking towards the front.</p>
 <p>“Make your move, old man!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t wait for his skill to take effect after he finished his sentence, he immediately activated his Fiery Golden Eyes and Emperor’s Qi before he dashed towards the old man in green attire. He could still sense the strength of the old man in green across him.</p>
 <p>Although he couldn’t exactly sense it, his strength should be about the same as the Mu Clan’s old man. Now that he had been weakened by Qing Shui, there was basically no hope left for him at all.</p>
 <p>The old man in green was startled. His face turned fierce as he brandished his broadsword and slashed towards the Mu Clan’s old man.</p>
 <p>While the Mu Clan’s old man dashed towards the old man in green, he took out a crystal card with one hand and tossed it towards the old man in green that was in front of him. Qing Shui didn’t manage to catch a good look at the crystal card either.</p>
 <p>Sluggish Bear Crystal Card!</p>
 <p>Additional effects - slow one’s reaction and half the speed of the target…..</p>
 <p>The crystal card in his other hand was slapped against himself. There was a wisp of a golden green smoke image depicted on it. It was a crystal card that could tremendously boost one’s speed.</p>
 <p>By the time the Mu Clan’s old man had dashed in front of the old man in green, he had a silver rod that was at least four meters long in his hand. Its thickness was about the size of an adult’s arm, but the handle part was slightly slimmer, about the size of a wrist.</p>
 <p>He struck down with his rod. Although that strike appeared very normal, it was grand and magnificent. An afterimage and a black shadow could be seen. That strike seemed like it was going to split the mountains open.</p>
 <p>The countenance of the old man in green greatly changed as he stopped dead in his tracks. He raised the broadsword in his hand with all his might to counter the rod because he realized that he wouldn’t be able to evade it at all. It felt as if his body was weighed down by a mountain.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The dull noise that rang out could make one feel especially awesome. The old man in green, that had been weakened by Qing Shui, was quickly beaten by the Mu Clan’s old man to the point that blood dripped out of the corner of his mouth.</p>
 <p>After that loud noise, the long rod was brought down once again in succession!</p>
 <p>Boom boom…..</p>
 <p>The pitiful old man in green had half of his body sunk into the stone surface beneath him. That final strike bashed the head of the old man in green. He could not do anything but to only have a helpless look on his face as he got finished by that single bash. There was nothing he could do.</p>
 <p>One with inferior strength and also an inferior speed could only be beaten...</p>
 <p>After the old man in green was taken care of, Qing Shui breathed out a sigh of relief. Among the people that came, only three of them were difficult to handle. Without those three, Qing Shui felt that the opponents wouldn’t be able to stand a chance against them because he was also knowledgeable in formation techniques.</p>
 <p>The corpses of the old man in green and the others disappeared very quickly. Qing Shui smiled at the old man from Mu Clan. “We are going to hold them off for a little while. Senior and the rest should have started moving.”</p>
 <p>……...</p>
 <p>At the same time, Mu Qing and two teams from the Sky Prison Sect Sabre Formation were fighting each other. However, Mu Qing’s side of more than twenty people was stronger. Mu Qian was also there and on top of that, he was also the eye of the formation.</p>
 <p>But there were also strong people among those two opposing teams - two of the eight Sky Prison Sect’s sovereigns. Their strengths were slightly stronger than the Sky Prison Sect’s Fifth Sovereign. Mu Qian’s strength was about the same as the Sky Prison Sect’s Fifth Sovereign so they still had a chance to fight back.</p>
 <p>Mu Qing stood by Mu Qian’s side. The opponents were currently attacking Mu Qian and the rest from both sides. They were not only outnumbered, but also at a disadvantage in strength.</p>
 <p>The two sides fought hand to hand and there was one casualty on the Mu Clan’s side. For formations like the Sky Prison Sect Sabre Formation and Five Elements Minor Formation, a few casualties wouldn’t affect the formation that much. Even so, this was still heart aching for the Mu Clan.</p>
 <p>These were all the older generation of the Mu Clan and this team were especially important to the current Mu Clan, even to the future of the Mu Clan.</p>
 <p>Two people were heavily injured again in succession. Although the casualties among the opponents were twice that of the Mu Clan, Mu Qian still issued a firm order to get into the Gate of Illusion.</p>
 <p>Poison beings!</p>
 <p>There were countless poison beings that would make one’s blood run cold here. Mu Qing’s face flushed crimson when she saw the poison beings here. They reminded her of the time when she first came here with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Not only she was no longer afraid of them, but also felt a little cordial.</p>
 <p>After Mu Qing and Mu Qian led the rest into the Gate of Illusion, they got into the formation immediately. The countless poison beings in the surroundings didn’t move. As long as some specific spots were not stepped on, these beings would remain stationary.</p>
 <p>The two sovereigns of the Sky Prison Sect clenched their teeth as they issued out the order to go after them. If they couldn’t even take care of the younger generations of the Mu Clan, they might as well retire immediately.</p>
 <p>They got into formation and entered the Gate of Illusion cautiously!</p>
 <p>This was the moment Mu Qing waited for and this was also what Qing Shui had told her before. She stomped both of her feet on an empty spot with all her might. This sent a large group of poison beings to rush towards the people of the Sky Prison Sect.</p>
 <p>Among them was a slippery poison mud python that was about 100 meters long. The entire body of this thing looked like a silt and appeared to be extremely sleek. Knives and swords were almost ineffective against it. It wasn’t only highly toxic, but also possessed great strength that made it very formidable.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, half of this place was a swamp. If anyone that wasn’t a powerful Martial Emperor got caught by it, they would be basically done for.</p>
 <p>Other than that, at least a hundred octopuses and poison beasts also rushed forward. The sight of the multi colored frogs drained the blood from the faces of some people. Just a little accident and they could get these poison beings sticking onto them. Some people hit or hack off those poison beings off their body with the Sky Prison Sabre.</p>
 <p>These half-real poison beings felt just like real ones and they could even kill. Even people who had knowledge about formations would be afraid. Those that didn’t know formations would be really scared to death, while those that knew formations would know that these things could kill.</p>
 <p>Just when their opponents were in chaos, Mu Qing led her people into a Five Elements Minor Formation and intersected the enemies’ Sky Prison Sabre Formation in a cross method. The lives of a few dozen men were taken away in a flash.</p>
 <p>The Duality Steps and Formation Techniques of the people that Mu Qing led were at the small success stage. They were able to move freely here and evade these troublesome poison beings. Most importantly, they could exploit these poison beings as an opportunity to massacre.</p>
 <p>In just a short amount of time, the number of their opponents were reduced by almost half. This greatly enraged the two sovereigns of the Sky Prison Sect, who had just calmed down not long ago. They couldn’t wait to slay their opponents down with their blades any longer.</p>
 <p>An enticing smile broke across Mu Qing’s face. Two little formation flags appeared in her hands before she waved her delicate hand!</p>
 <p>The two formation flags were planted on the both sides of the Sky Prison Sect’s groups. In just an instant, an alarmingly enormous wave emerged in the surroundings. Mu Qing was also surprised. She didn’t expect the effect to be this great. Qing Shui had told her that if they made it here, she must plant those two little formation flags on that location.</p>
 <p>That enormous wave that was like a gigantic tornado rose up from beneath the people of the Sky Prison Sect and immediately swallowed up the crowd.</p>
 <p>By the time everything went still, the people of the Mu Clan were once again surprised by the sight that greeted them. Only two dying sovereigns of the Sky Prison Sect remained while the rest had vanished. It would only be a matter of time before these two sovereigns of the Sky Prison Sect would die anyway.</p>
 <p>The two sovereigns that were slightly stronger than the Sky Prison Sect’s Fifth Sovereign stared at the people of the Mu Clan before they collapsed. Their eyes remained widely opened.</p>
 <p>Rumble!</p>
 <p>Just then, the formation shook. Mu Qing was startled, she knew that this formation had broken down. A gap had been opened in the formation that the Mu Clan was surrounding. Qing Shui’s handsome face flashed across her mind, oddly calming down her mind that had been chaotic.</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, everyone was exposed in front of their opponents. That moment shocked many, but some remained calm.</p>
 <p>Tianyu Liangyi wasn’t surprised, but he was grieving. It only took him a glance to know that the Second, Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Sovereign of the Sky Prison Sect were dead and the nearly 1000 people who were brought here had been reduced to only half.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was very calm too. However, he was extremely tensed up, just like a bow that had been pulled tautly back because the situation right now could very easily turn into a hopeless situation. Both parties were only about 50 meters apart from each other. They were simply too close to one another.</p>
 <p>“KILL!”</p>
 <p>Tianyu Liangyi suddenly yelled. He was dressed in gold and had a dazzling golden Sky Prison Sabre in his hand. He rushed towards Qing Shui and the Mu Clan’s old man. The Third Sovereign, who was dressed in a brown robe, also rushed towards them furiously.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the others also rushed towards them.</p>
 <p>Petal Rain Under the Skies!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly reacted. Without any hesitation, he performed the most destructive technique of his hidden weapons which was also the one that had the most chance to force his opponents back.</p>
 <p>The Mu Clan’s old man pushed Qing Shui away and slapped a card against his body. He performed a ‘A Horizontal River breaking the Current’ technique as the long rod in his hands struck down abruptly. The might of that bash was world shaking. He was able to perform all of this in just the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the old man with gratefulness in his heart, he was also able to catch a glimpse of that old man’s card. It was a crystal card that had a ‘gigantic tortoise shell’. Not only that, it was five-colored. Qing Shui knew that this card should be able to temporarily bring the old man’s defense to its peak.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s poison needle also struck its target. But a tinkling noise rang out, letting him, know that his Petal Rain Under the Skies didn’t work. However, it was able to obstruct the opponent's attacks.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was rushing into it a little. The opponents were also covered in cold sweat from being surprised by Qing Shui’s poison needles. If it wasn’t for the Sky Prison Sabre, they would have been in trouble. They were able to tell how terrifying those poison needles could be.</p>
 <p>While they were fighting, the rest also got into formations and prepared to fight. The moment when Qing Shui was pushed aside by the old man, he summoned all of his demonic beasts out without any hesitation.</p>
 <p>Since the formation had been broken now, the Duality Minutest Formation effect was gone. They would have to fight the enemies head on. For their side, they were clearly at a disadvantage so he would rather prefer some of his demonic beasts get injured.</p>
 <p>The surroundings were instantly filled with demonic beasts. There were countless Jade Emperor Bees, demonic spiders, birds and the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. There was also the Thunderous Beast, which was concealed on the ground. The Gold-Silver Colored Butterfly was also partly unnoticeable.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s action had completely made everyone dumbfounded on their spot. The people at the scene were all strong cultivators, and some were even top-notch cultivators. Even so, no one had ever seen a Beast Tamer that had this many demonic beasts…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui would not let his opponents have the chance to be amazed right now. The Five-Headed Demonic Spider had immediately lunged towards the weaker sovereign standing across it. Even among this many demonic spiders, the Five-Headed Demonic Spider was unstoppable. It rushed forward in just a flash and immediately dispatched a person - the Fourth Sovereign.</p>
