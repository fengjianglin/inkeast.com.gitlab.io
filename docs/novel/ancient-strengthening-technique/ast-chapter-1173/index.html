 <p><strong>AST 1173 - Five Elements Divine Refining Technique, Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines, Qing Shui Demonstrating His Prowess</strong></p>
 <p>Just like that, Qing Shui brought his great beauty around with him to look at the night scenery. Compared to the scenes in the day, the places seemed to be more beautiful at night. Of course, Qing Shui was also paying heed to those few spiritual senses that were locked onto them.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui purposely looked for places where there were more people. Although the crowd wouldn't stop them from taking action, they would definitely hesitate. For example, if he were to shout something like 'assassins targeting Yan Clan's Young Miss', they'd definitely panic.</p>
 <p>When midnight came, he would be able to use the Nine Continents Steps and when that happened, even if those people were extremely capable, there would be nothing they could do. However, right now, that was still slightly more than two hours away.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Qing Shui planned to wait until it was after 1 a.m. before he checked them out and saw if he could get any information. In the worst case scenario, they could just escape. In the blink of an eye, they would be able to reach the inner city and in half a day, they'd probably be able to reach Yan Clan.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, I'm a bit worried whether anything has happened at home," after they had walked for a while, Yan Jinyu said.</p>
 <p>"We'll head back after 1 a.m. Right now, we'll have to settle this first and see if we can get a hold of any information. It might be beneficial for Yan Clan," Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</p>
 <p>"Then let's bring them to a secluded place right now? I feel that these few spiritual senses are in no way weaker than mine. How are we going to fight?" Yan Jinyu smiled bitterly and said. She was wearing her bamboo hat but Qing Shui could still sense her tension.</p>
 <p>"We'll give it a try. In the worst case scenario, we can make our escape with the rings. There won't be any problems." A hint of battle flames twinkled in Qing Shui's eyes. He had grown a lot stronger and although the opponents had powerful spiritual senses, he still wanted to attempt to fight against them.</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu thought about it for very long and in the end, seemed to speak with great difficulty, "I'm worried for you!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. "There's no need to worry about me. Although my cultivation might not be strong, I'm quite good at protecting myself. I can help you as well. Alright, let's go and see who those people are."</p>
 <p>The two of them followed the crowd and headed for a more secluded spot and then flew toward the distance, where there was a small-scaled mountain range. Qing Shui and Yan Jinyu traveled at great speed, but they felt that those spiritual senses were also rapidly accelerating.</p>
 <p>On the top of a mountain, Qing Shui and Yan Jinyu were in midair, staring at the approaching spiritual senses. When they got close, they saw that there were four old men and two young men. One of them was wearing a bamboo hat but Qing Shui could recognize him at first glance. His spiritual sense was very sharp.</p>
 <p>"Yang Yicun, your name isn't the only thing which is special. Even your body shape is as well. You can take off that bamboo hat!" Qing Shui smiled and said directly before turning toward the elderly men.</p>
 <p>The few spiritual senses from earlier belonged to these few elderly men. Qing Yun sensed that they should be on par with Yan Jinyu when she was holding the Four Elements Greencloud Sword. There was nothing strange for the great clans in Yan City's outer city to have cultivators of such a level. It seemed that Yang Yicun held quite a significant position in the clan.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw this, he seemed to have sensed something. If Yang Clan had nothing planned against Yan Clan, Yang Yicun wouldn't dare to do something like this. It seemed that Yan Clan really was in danger this time.</p>
 <p>Yang Yicun gradually took off his bamboo hat and looked at Qing Shui with a predatory look, "Lad, why are you getting yourself involved in this? Could it be that you're interested in Miss Yan as well? Do you think you're deserving of her?"</p>
 <p>"Aren't you guys afraid that my father will wipe out your Yang Clan?" Yan Jinyu asked calmly, not directing her gaze toward anyone in particular.</p>
 <p>"Hahaha, Miss Yan, do you still think that you'll be able to leave today? No ladies whom I, Young Master Yang, have set my eyes on, are able to escape. As for your father, he can't even save himself now. Yan Clan will disappear very soon." When Yang Yicun said this, he sounded very proud. It was a craziness that would burst out after suppression.</p>
 <p>All along, Yang Clan had to be very careful around Yan Clan and every year, they would have to pay quite a lot of money and treasures as tribute. It was because Yan Clan was the owner of Yan City and all great clans would have to pay tribute to them while Yan Clan would have to pay to the royal family.</p>
 <p>"Do you think just Yang Clan alone would be able to go against our Yan Clan? Even if there were three Yan Clans, you wouldn't be a match for our Yan Clan. Stop your wishful thinking," Yan Jinyu continued calmly.</p>
 <p>"There's no need for you to try to agitate me. Of course, it's not just Yang Clan alone. You only need to remember that your clan will be gone very soon," Yang Yicun spoke with disdain.</p>
 <p>"There's no need to agitate you. If I were to capture you, I don't believe that you won't say a single word," Qing Shui looked at Yang Yicun and said, smiling.</p>
 <p>"Lad, the likes of you? You're better off thinking how you can die faster today!" Yang Yicun grinned and looked at Qing Shui, his eyes filled with malice and ridicule.</p>
 <p>The three old men stood in a triangular formation, surrounding Qing Shui and Yan Jinyu. The last elder stood before Yan Jinyu, seeming to be protecting him while prepared to handle any exigencies.</p>
 <p>"Sister, later on, there's no need to feel tense. I'll protect you. They don't wish to harm your life for now. We'll kill one of them first. There's no need to worry about me." Qing Shui instructed.</p>
 <p>"You must be careful!" Yan Jinyu had already brought out her Four Elements Greencloud Sword and had even activated her Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, on the other hand, had taken out his Big Dipper Sword while holding a coldsteel bead with his other hand.</p>
 <p>Right now, the aura Yan Jinyu was exuding caused the three elders to be a little taken aback. Next, with three loud roars, the three old men also activated their Demonic Beast Armor Manifestations.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also activated his Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation but it didn't cause much surprise. Qing Shui was able to conceal his abilities well and even those old men didn't think much of Qing Shui's cultivation but knew that it wasn't bad either. They could sense his abilities but it just wasn't accurate. However, they wouldn't expect that.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took one step and dashed toward one of the elders, concurrently letting out a huge bellow, "Do it!"</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps!</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui wasn't very strong, he had the advantage in his footwork and the amazing aspect of the Nine Palace.</p>
 <p>He headed right for one of the elders while Yan Jinyu swung her Four Elements Greencloud Sword and dashed toward another elder on the other side.</p>
 <p>The remaining elder wanted to take action but with Qing Shui's spiritual sense, the Nine Continents Mountain instantly appeared and tried to crash abruptly toward the old man, its speed quick as lightning.</p>
 <p>The Nine Continents Mountain's attacking prowess was slightly over 3,200 nimbus but its speed was very fast, causing its prowess to increase by a little as well.</p>
 <p>Although the old man was astonished, he returned the attack with his longsword!</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>Surprisingly, the old man retreated a step and the Nine Continents Mountain was also stopped in its tracks. However, it smashed down once again.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui made use of the Nine Palace positioning and managed to barely hold back the other old man. He then shook the tip of his sword!</p>
 <p>Tidal Cloud Waves Seal!</p>
 <p>Instantly, a huge spread of ocean appeared around him. Both himself and the old man were in the water. There were waves all around them.</p>
 <p>Roaming Dragon Steps！</p>
 <p>Amidst the waves, Qing Shui combined his Roaming Dragon Steps and the Nine Palace Steps. Although he was weaker, he managed to gain the upper hand. He lifted up his hand!</p>
 <p>Surging Waves Roaring Seas!</p>
 <p>Monstrous Wave!</p>
 <p>The water in the ocean immediately expanded and terrifying black whirlpools appeared around them. Right now, Qing Shui's Tidal Cloud Waves Seal had the strongest prowess.</p>
 <p>However, at this moment, the other elder had freed himself from the Nine Continents Mountain and was dashing toward Yan Jinyu.</p>
 <p>Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps, Great Reversal!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui ignored the old man who had been forced to be on the defense to save himself in the water and then exchanged positions with one of the two old men who were attacking Yan Jinyu together!</p>
 <p>His Emperor's Qi managed to weaken the strength of these old men by 20%. The fourth old man was standing slightly further away and wasn't affected. The Emperor's Qi could be used on multiple targets.</p>
 <p>The sudden change caused the old man who was in the midst of a fight with Yan Jinyu to be stunned. Even Yan Jinyu was stunned as well, but she immediately regained her composure. At this time, Qing Shui controlled the Nine Continents Mountain to attack from behind while he raised one of his hands.</p>
 <p>Tidal Cloud Waves Seal, Water Entanglement!</p>
 <p>Reduce speed, reduce reaction speed!</p>
 <p>The old man swayed for a moment and with the changes to the surroundings and the weakening effect from the Emperor's Qi, he was almost instantly pierced by Yan Jinyu in the chest with her sword. Next, the Nine Continents Mountain came smashing into him from the back. By the time he was sent flying, he had already died.</p>
 <p>From the beginning to the end, all this had happened in the time it took for only two blinks!</p>
 <p>The other two old men looked over with pale countenances. The old man who had died had already landed on the mountain peak below them, causing a deep sound to ring out as he landed. The sound was especially clear in such a quiet night sky.</p>
 <p>"Young man, we've underestimated you." The old man who hadn't taken any action till now spoke. He then turned to look at Yang Yicun, whose face had turned pale.</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu looked at Qing Shui in surprise. This man had already given her far too many surprises. Although he wasn't strong, he could move about with great ease. He had even managed to hold back a person and seemed to have gotten the upper hand. It seemed that he had still concealed his abilities or that she hadn't seen through him thoroughly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui waved his hand to call out the Thunderous Beast.</p>
 <p>"Old man, a prodigal son like this is not worth you losing your life for." Qing Shui looked at the old man calmly.</p>
 <p>"Young man, you seem to specialize in spirit energy. You shouldn't have used your full powers yet, right?" The old man who was standing in front of Yang Yicun seemed to still be extremely calm when he said this.</p>
 <p>"Alright, today, I'll show you my spirit energy!"</p>
 <p>With that, Qing Shui stopped his hand and pointed out with his Big Dipper Sword!</p>
 <p>Buddha Form Reveal, Buddha's True Eyes!</p>
 <p>Violet Lightning Strike!</p>
 <p>Violet Lightning Strike!</p>
 <p>The Thunderous Beast let out two rapid streams of Violet Lightning Strike, stunning the two old men who had been weakened by the Emperor's Qi on the spot. Almost concurrently, a series of strong tremors appeared below the two old men.</p>
 <p>"Damn it!" The old man waved his hand and sent a huge palm to grab the two old men.</p>
 <p>However, it was already too late. The violet bloodthirsty demonic vines had spurted out crazily, entangling the two old men in thick vines. The sharp barbed spikes that were one foot long flashed with a bloodthirsty cold gleam, twisted and entangled crazily.</p>
 <p>Nothing could be seen from the outside, nor were there any sounds coming from inside. There was only the swooshing sounds of the moving vines. There wasn't even a single drop of blood leaking out. The blood must have been absorbed by the bloodthirsty demonic vines!</p>
 <p>The huge palm grabbed onto the bloodthirsty demonic vines and broke one off. However, it seemed to quickly disappeared as if it had been electrocuted. When the bloodthirsty demonic vines disappeared, so did everything else. There was nothing left of the two old men.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui called back the Thunderous Beast. Right now, there was only the last old man left, together with Yang Yicun and the other man dressed in white clothes.</p>
 <p>The old man was really stunned. In just a short moment, two State Master level cultivators who had a strength of about 6,000 nimbus were destroyed just like that. What the old man didn't know was that the two of them had been weakened by Qing Shui's Emperor's Qi to be left with only about 4,500 nimbus of strength. Moreover, they were also paralyzed and both their spirit energy and body resistance were weakened. Qing Shui's spirit energy attacks could reach 4,300 nimbus and the bloodthirsty demonic vines were very terrifying as well. Even a person with a strength of 6,000 nimbus would have to be skinned even if they didn't die from the entanglement.</p>
