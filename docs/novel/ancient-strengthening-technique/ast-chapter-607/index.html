 <p><strong>AST 607 - Wang Clan As A Stepping Stone, Di Chen’s Intention (5)</strong></p>
 <p>Even for a Martial Saint like Wang Delong, he was still not able to withstand the remaining force after negating Qing Shui’s attack. Even though Wang Delong had used his saber to block Qing Shui’s sword, the huge force from the attack still affected Wang Delong in the end and caused fresh blood to be scattered in midair.</p>
 <p>[Author’s note: Explanation on how attack and defense work: Some people had asked me about this, it seemed that it was not explained very clearly before, thus here is a clearer explanation. When abilities are mentioned, such as the abilities of 100 countries, it referred to the attack, defense, speed, etc are all at the level of 100 countries. As for the interaction between attack and defense, when the weapons clashed against each other, the attacking strength will cancel out each other, causing the side with the stronger attacking strength to be reduced and the weaker one negated, this is where defense comes into play to defend against the leftover attacking force. Just like how regardless how much strength is put behind a rock, it would not be able to break a metal bead, this was the issue of defense, thus defense is very important. If you want to kill the opponent, you have to first overcome the opponent's attack then overcome his defense.]</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was also required to prepare his Critical Damage for a long time for it to deal a deadly blow. One had to know that the Critical Damage could not be used at any time, a certain amount of killing Qi had to be accumulated first before executing it.</p>
 <p>After a huge wave of energy directly shattered everything within his body, he had naturally lost his life. Qing Shui’s attack was like a metal ball while Wang Delong’s was like a rock; when they clashed, the rock could only crumble.</p>
 <p>He had the expression of dying with a remaining grievance. Wang Delong fell from the sky, the biggest backbone of the Wang Clan had perished. Qing Shui shifted his gaze towards the four old men on the Scarlet Eyed Snow Monarch Falcon.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the remaining four old men were using an inconceivable gaze to look at Qing Shui. Although they thought that the Wang Clan would perish and Wang Delong would die, they weren’t expecting for it to have been done by Qing Shui….</p>
 <p>Wang Delong, who was the strongest old man of the Wang Clan, used his words earlier to try and incite the youth into having a solo battle. The youth finally agreed, but the results were unexpected.</p>
 <p>The four old men looked to be in their sixties, they looked senile and seemed to be older than Wang Delong. After Wang Delong’s death, they seemed to become incomparably old and depressed.</p>
 <p>At this moment, “Young man, can we negotiate?” The second old man from the left said slowly.</p>
 <p>“Oh? Speak then.” Qing Shui did not have any cordial feelings towards these people. However since Wang Shunchang was dead, Wang Delong was also dead, and Wang Ruiyuan became crippled. Qing Shui’s anger had already been quenched.</p>
 <p>“The strength of the Wang Clan had already dwindled, disaster already had befallen onto the clan. Us four old men will kill ourselves, but could you leave the rest of them a path to life? Of course, we will give you the best things from Wang Clan, since the clan can no longer protect them anymore.” The old man looked at Qing Shui, he had already put down his pride.</p>
 <p>Although he did not feel comfortable doing so, he had no way to refute this. There were many people in Wang Clan, and Qing Shui couldn’t bear to kill them all. After all, he had already settled the grudge he had with the Wang Clan. This way, the Wang Clan wouldn’t be able to recover in the next few hundred years, perhaps not even for thousands of years.</p>
 <p>“You don’t have to worry about the Wang Clan looking to exact revenge on you, that would be impossible. Furthermore, do you even have to be worried? With your age and cultivation, people will fear you in the future, who would ever dare to stir up trouble with you?” The old man could see that Qing Shui was hesitating.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui!”</p>
 <p>Madam Duanmu shouted out to Qing Shui at this moment.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui returned to Madam Duanmu’s side. He was aware that this woman had an answer to his dilemma, so he wanted her opinion on this.</p>
 <p>“Madam!” Qing Shui respected this strong woman. Her being beautiful wasn’t the most important thing, it was the strength and the air she gave off.</p>
 <p>“Let them go, this will be beneficial for you in the central continent.” Madam Duanmu smiled at this outstanding youth. She liked every aspect of him, it’s just that her daughter’s character was too cold…</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was silent, he was thinking about all the pros and cons. How he would deal with the Wang Clan was a very tricky and complicated problem, one which would affect him in the Jade Sea Country capital city. If he were too ruthless, it would cause some of the clans to cower. However, there were two sides to everything, many people would be thinking of ways to get rid of him if he got into trouble.</p>
 <p>“You’re new to the Central Continent, being too ruthless with your methods will have an effect in your future developments. After seeing your methods, many people will try to avoid you, and those who are stronger might plot some despicable actions against you. Do you understand me?” Madam Duanmu looked at Qing Shui, her gaze had an indescribable glow to it.</p>
 <p>“I understand!” Qing Shui knew that Madam Duanmu was talking about inciting envy within others. A firm and vicious genius, and an extremely benevolent and friendly genius would both cause people to feel differently about them. The first would cause fear and jealousy, it could even cause them to think of ways to give him an early death.</p>
 <p>Although the latter would cause others to also be envious of them, they had other methods of protecting themselves; like joining a power or cooperating with others…</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, Wang Clan’s the pillar of support is already dead. Even if you let them off, they will still probably be swallowed up by some other power. Regardless of whoever it is, they will definitely extend their hand towards you and express some goodwill. You would have one more friend this way, the benefits are quite significant.” Madam Duanmu continued.</p>
 <p>“Thank you!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t expect that Madan Duanmu would think this far. Actually Qing Shui quite liked using brute force and solving any problems he had with his fists.</p>
 <p>However, if Madam Duanmu hadn’t shown up for today’s matter, there would’ve been another ending to this. Although he liked using brute force, his strength would be considered nothing in the Central Continent. The number of people who could defeat him was far too many.</p>
 <p>“You guys can go, don’t come and bother me anymore.” Qing Shui walked to the front of the old men and released them without saying too much. Releasing the Wang Clan was a great testimony to the many who were watching him and waiting to see what he would do.</p>
 <p>The group of old men looked at Qing Shui incredulously, and then looked at the distant Madam Duanmu. They couldn’t believe that the evil and vicious woman would actually advise Qing Shui to release them.</p>
 <p>The group of old men sighed. They bowed to Qing Shui before leaving on the Scarlet Eyed Snow Monarch Falcon.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui returned, Di Chen and the others came forward. Madam Duanmu couldn’t help but quietly cheer in her heart after looking at the girl on the Fire Bird’s back, what a fairy-like person.</p>
 <p>This place was very close to Qing Shui’s villa, so they arrived within a short period of time. Lan Tong and the others didn’t linger for long, they made their greetings and returned to their rooms. The sky wasn’t bright yet, so they were able to sleep for a little longer.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, Di Chen, Madam Duanmu, and Nian Yuyang came to the living room in the pavilion, it was brightly lighted with Light Stones. Qing Shui invited them to take a seat and brewed a pot of tea.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui brewed the tea leaves he had from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, it was the only tea leaves he had, but it was definitely very unique. Its light fragrance was very refreshing, just smelling it was a great enjoyment and even caused them to have a floating feeling.</p>
 <p>“Good tea, it has a unique taste. It actually even has the effects of refreshing the mind and cleansing the bones, definitely the best tea I’ve ever had.” Madam Duanmu said with a radiant face as she tasted it.</p>
 <p>“This is the tea that I prepared myself, I don’t really drink it much either. Since madam enjoys it so much, I’ll prepare some for you and will send it over in the future.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>“Thank you!” Madam Duanmu said unceremoniously.</p>
 <p>“There is no need to stand on ceremony. Madam, I’ve been meaning to ask you a question, I still can’t understand it regardless of how much I think about it.” Qing Shui thought about the earlier battle and couldn’t help but to ask.</p>
 <p>“Just ask away. As you said, there’s no need to stand on ceremony.” Madam Duanmu put down her teacup and raised her head to look at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>This woman smiled and frowned at the same time, giving off a mature air. It was a charm that originated from the depths of her bones, it had an air of enticement, dignity, elegance, and maturity.</p>
 <p>Even now, Qing Shui felt that she wasn’t Duanmu Lingshuang’s mother, it was difficult to associate the two of them together as mother and daughter.</p>
 <p>“Do the magnitude of abilities differ for above and below Grade 5 Martial Saint?” Qing Shui asked. Actually, Qing Shui was quite doubtful from the start, for each grade of Martial Saint, there was a difference in abilities of two hundred countries. This was plausible in the early grades, but the distance seemed to be getting shorter when it reached the later grades. The difference between a Grade 9 Martial Saint and a Grade 10 Martial Saint would be minuscule.</p>
 <p>“The difference in abilities for the earlier five grades differ by two hundred countries. For Grades 6 and 7, the difference is the abilities of five hundred countries. For Grades 8, 9, and 10, the difference is the abilities of one thousand countries. As for the peak of Martial Saint, I have no idea of how high it could be.” Madam Duanmu said as she smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was able to understand when heard this. He felt like he was enlightened, he didn’t understand it earlier after all. He looked at Nian Yuyang, but he only smiled and drank his tea.</p>
 <p>Using this, he calculated that a Grade 10 Martial Saint would have the abilities of five thousand countries….</p>
 <p>With his current strength, he would be killed instantly…Qing Shui looked at the unfathomable Madam Duanmu, he didn’t know how far the level of her abilities extended. He didn’t dare ask either, he was just especially curious.</p>
 <p>A person of a particular realm would come across people of similar realms. In the past, Qing Shui could barely see any Xiantian cultivators, but the things which couldn’t do or see in the past became simple now that he was in a different realm.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, when are you coming over to my place now that you’ve arrived at the Central Continent?” Madam Duanmu said as she looked at the brightening sky outside.</p>
 <p>“I will definitely go very soon. When that time comes, I hope Madam Duanmu won’t find me too troublesome.”</p>
 <p>“How could that happen? Just directly go to the Duanmu city of Zhongyuan Country, it should be easy to find. I’ll be leaving first, I’ve got to go.” Madam Duanmu and Yu Ruyan stood up and faced Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Nian Yuyang hurriedly stood up as well!</p>
 <p>“Madam, please wait!” Qing Shui hurried upstairs and entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He retrieved two big packs of prepared tea leaves and gave a bag to Yu Ruyan once he came out.</p>
 <p>“You really gave them to me.” Yu Ruyan smiled as she received it.</p>
 <p>Madam Duanmu left, Nian Yuyang also rose to take his leave. Qing Shui gave the remaining bag of tea leaves to Nian Yuyang, making him incomparably happy.</p>
 <p>This kind of thing couldn’t be bought with money. Furthermore, it was a piece of Qing Shui’s goodwill.</p>
 <p>The sky was already bright after he’d sent them off. Qing Shui just stayed in the courtyard to practice his Taichi Fist. Lan Tong and the rest came out soon after, they greeted Qing Shui and started to practice his fist techniques.</p>
 <p>They practiced the Back Connecting Fist which Qing Shui taught them, they could practice it with some maturity now.</p>
 <p>The following half month was rather peaceful; Qing Shui was very relaxed, he cultivated and meditated. He would normally guide Lan Tong and the others, and would sometimes research some cultivation topics with Di Chen.</p>
 <p>Aside from these, Qing Shui would go fishing in the Jade Sea. However, he was only ever able to catch small fish and prawns. Although, these were the special produce of the Jade Sea and could be considered very tasty. Qing Shui just directly threw many of them into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s and Di Chen’s relationship had gotten closer compared to the past since the last time they held hands, there wasn’t a major progress however. They didn’t even hold hands again, but they were much closer physically in their daily lives.</p>
 <p>They knew about each other’s intentions since they stayed under the same roof. One of them would get flustered and hide when their gazes met, even though there was no special meaning to them. It seemed to be an especially dubious relationship.</p>
 <p>It was a kind of feeling which appeared when they weren’t paying attention. Furthermore, they had good feelings for each other…</p>
 <p>It was another regular morning, and Qing Shui was preparing to go outside to take a walk. He saw a man come in when he got to the courtyard. He was about forty years old, but he was masculine and wild. He had a pair of bright eyes and a straight nose, he wasn’t handsome, but he had some special charm about him.</p>
