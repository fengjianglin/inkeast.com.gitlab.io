 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 424 - Strengthen Her Meridian Channels For Her, Charm That Could Cause The Fall of Cities</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Can we leave now?" The old man smiled as he looked towards Qing Shui and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"You can. By the way, let me tell you something. Remember, don't do things that you'll regret in the future. To be honest, I had planned to make all of you stay behind, but it's not necessary now. You guys also have important people around, so don't force me to eradicate everyone. Old sir, you should have greater foresight."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Too vicious!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Liu-Li, where is your Sister Mingyue?" Seeing that Canghai Mingyue was not around, Qing Shui reckoned that she must have gone out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li tossed Qing Shui a charming glance, smiled, and said, "Elder sister has gone out, saying that she's off to buy some things. Why? Do you miss her so much?"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui cast Huoyun Liu-Li a glance, speechless. Ever since he had met her, he had been teased by her on many occasions. He thought of how they had first met, to after when they got acquainted, and eventually ending up having a good impression towards each other...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Actually, Huoyun Liu-Li was very, very happy right now. Especially after hearing that line, "If even a single strand of Liu-Li's hair is touched, I'll turn Cloud Mist Sect upside-down", she had felt very warm inside.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She then recalled how Qing Shui had licked her ears previously. That strange feeling made her blush just by thinking about it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Old Yun, is that fellow really so terrifying? So much so that you're putting up with it to this extent?" One of the elders from Cloud Mist Sect, who was wearing luxurious clothes and had left earlier, frowned and asked.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Terrifying? He's not just terrifying! He's simply a demon! I'm putting up with it? No, this is bending down to him, giving in to him. He is not someone our Cloud Mist Sect can afford to offend. Remember to pass down the word – no one must go provoke him. Otherwise, I'll kill that person myself."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Oh, right, you badass. Why have you thought of coming to visit us? Thank goodness that you're here now. Earlier, elder sister was even prepared to die." Huoyun Liu-Li had started off with a tease, but when her words ended, she already felt like crying.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Everything is fine now, don't cry. These kinds of things will not happen again in the future." Qing Shui quickly pacified Huoyun Liu-Li and even forgot that she had teased him. Seeing how sad she was, Qing Shui also felt bad. Unknowingly, Qing Shui realized that she had already entered his heart.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The sound of a series of flapping wings rang out!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In just a moment, Canghai Mingyue quickly rushed over! When she saw Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-Li, she let out a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, why have you come?" Canghai Mingyue said happily after the relieved sigh.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui reckoned that she was also aware of what had happened earlier. Someone had probably told her about it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"The reason I've came here today is to return to the Heavenly Palace with you two."Qing Shui smiled as he looked at Canghai Mingyue. Memories of when they first met and the harrowing experiences they shared till now, flooded her brain. His connection with this woman felt very special, very satisfying.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Go back to Heavenly Palace? Okay!" Huoyun Liu-Li smiled and agreed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Are we leaving now?" Canghai Mingyue frowned, asking.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Let's stay here for a few days. The two of you can start to pack up. Why, Yueyue, is there any problem?" Seeing that Canghai Mingyue was frowning, Qing Shui asked, feeling puzzled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"It's nothing. It's just that I've found a place that's especially suited for me to cultivate. I feel that I'm about to attain a breakthrough soon." Canghai Mingyue replied softly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Breakthrough? That's good news! How about this, we'll leave when you've made the breakthrough. I'll see if there's anything I can help with." Qing Shui was overjoyed to hear that Canghai Mingyue was about to achieve a breakthrough.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She was a cultivator at the pinnacle of Xiantian, and if she succeeded in the breakthrough, she would be at the Martial King level. Qing Shui hoped that the ladies around him would all have a higher level of cultivation so that he could feel more at ease.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"It should be very soon!" Mentioning that she was about to undergo a breakthrough made Canghai Mingyue seem to be slightly on edge.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Yueyue, you need to be very prepared to breakthrough to the Martial King level. How about this, I'll help strengthen your meridian channels today..." After saying this, Qing Shui regretted it a little bit.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was not really remorse, but more-so that the process of strengthening her meridian channels required her to be wearing a thin layer of clothes, or nothing at all for optimal effect. The person carrying out the strengthening needed to unceasingly warm up the meridian channels of the person receiving it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui only thought of the benefits of strengthening the meridian channels, especially with his Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique, Nature Energy, Diamond Qi and that Saintly Hands... Therefore, there was no one who was more suitable than Qing Shui to help others to strengthen their meridian channels.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Usually, the reason for an unsuccessful breakthrough could be pinned on the fact that one's meridian channels were not strong enough, unable to endure the influx of Xiantian Qi, whereas charging through to the Martial King level was no trifling task. Therefore, it was very common for people to strengthen their meridian channels. Major clans and sects would tend to get their meridian channels strengthened by their elders, parents, and masters.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hearing that Qing Shui wanted to help her strengthen her meridian channels, Canghai Mingyue trembled slightly and looked seriously towards Qing Shui!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">That pitch black, profound gaze of hers, so charming as to cause the fall of cities, caused Qing Shui's heart to thump very quickly, and he started to blush too. He smiled awkwardly and said, "I was just joking."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt a bit awkward when he said this. Canghai Mingyue's gaze had actually made him feel panicked, or perhaps it was the inferiority from his heart rearing its ugly head.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even till now, Qing Shui had not the courage to take that one step forward when facing her. It was the inferiority ingrained into his bones from his previous life. While there was no need for him to feel inferior now, Qing Shui could only feel confident in the area of martial arts cultivation. But facing ladies like Canghai Mingyue and Misty Hall's Palace Mistress, especially the latter, before whom he had nothing of note to flaunt.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">While he could use other items, including the Plum Blossom Wine or alchemy, Qing Shui felt that it was not as satisfying as winning through martial arts.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's abilities were higher than Canghai Mingyue. Therefore, when before her, he would feel slightly more confident and at ease than whenever he faced Misty Hall's Palace Mistress.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Cultivators were confident, especially strong ones.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Pfft! Later come to my room and help me strengthen my meridian channels!" After saying that, she headed upstairs with the giggling Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was stunned for a moment before he broke into a smile. Initially, Qing Shui felt that there was no way that Canghai Mingyue would agree to this. After all, his hands would need to "touch" many spots all over her body, including her back, hands, arms, and legs!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui only headed up to the highest story of the building after staying downstairs for a moment, and into Canghai Mingyue's room, into the bedroom that had its door opened. Huoyun Liu-Li was also present. She was most likely here to boost the former’s courage...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Huoyun Liu-Li saw Qing Shui, she blinked her pair of sexy and charming eyes slyly towards him. Her long and beautiful eyes had an intoxicating, sensual appeal to them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui rubbed his nose awkwardly and looked towards Canghai Mingyue. This alone made Qing Shui's mind blank. She was wearing a black one-piece nightgown and looked so stunning that his mind blanked out for a moment.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Under Qing Shui's gaze, Canghai Mingyue lowered her head!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Elder sister, look at how his gaze is reflecting his desires to devour you! He's really such a lecher!" Huoyun Liu-Li's words, which carried a slight hint of jealousy, caused Qing Shui to regain his senses as he rubbed his nose, smiled bitterly, and made his way towards the bed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue was sitting on the bed, her legs stretched out and her arms dangling down! Her wonderful figure highlighted by that black-colored nightgown gave her a lethal quality of seduction, especially the rounded peaks under the nightgown!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui now began to feel that his blood was starting to boil. Canghai Mingyue's nightgown was not a tight fit, nor was it very loose. However, the perky peaks of hers unleashed a fatal charm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Her pitch-black long hair was draping down behind her, giving her an additional charm, a poised and unique feminine charm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He could smell a faint fragrance coming from her, and that beautiful neck, her wrists, and her hands appeared to be even more snow-white, as if they were shining like a piece of jade!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui slowly sat by the bed, reaching out his two hands. The air also appeared to be trembling a little, and if one took a closer look, one would be able to see a faint layer of fog on the surface of Qing Shui's hands.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Yueyue, can you put out your two hands?"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue lifted up her two hands, a bit embarrassed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's hands grabbed onto hers, and their connected hands caused Huoyun Liu-Li to be extremely shocked. She felt that it was such a beautiful scene, the feeling alone breathtaking.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue closed her eyes, while Qing Shui took in the sight of the beauty in front of him. However, with Huoyun Liu-Li beside them, Qing Shui had to keep his gaze restrained.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, occasionally, he would cast a casual glance towards the lethal peaks that seemed as if they would give him a wonderful feeling if he could have his way with them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui unwillingly closed his eyes!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nature Energy!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Diamond Qi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gradually circulated the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique, slowly channeling them into Canghai Mingyue's meridian channels, slowly encompassing the walls of her meridian channels, gradually progressing, as if layering it with color.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was an extremely exhausting process to help someone strengthen their meridian channels. Usually, most people would not do it unless it was for someone very close to them. The reason being that, while it was exhausting and depleted a lot of energy, the one on the receiving end would benefit greatly from it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Time passed by very slowly. After two hours had passed, Huoyun Liu-Li cast a glance at them and then stood up to head out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was almost done strengthening Canghai Mingyue's meridian channels.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">15 minutes later!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gradually opened his eyes. At the same time, Canghai Mingyue's long eyelashes, which were like the wings of small butterflies, fluttered twice before she gradually opened her beautiful eyes that as were bright as the stars and moon. The charm of her pitch-black and immeasurably deep eyes could easily cause the fall of countries and cities.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled for a moment before rolling up his sleeves. He then placed his fingertips on those tender arms of Canghai Mingyue under her shy gaze.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui finally knew what it felt like to be warm as jade...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With the enhancement from the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique, Nature Energy and Diamond Qi, the "Saintly Hands" gradually moved along her meridian channels, first strengthening the inner walls and then the external walls of every channel.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Her beautiful back!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The time spent on her back was very long. It was because Qing Shui wanted to channel in his Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique for a prolonged period of time, allowing them to flow to the meridian channels nearby. After all, there were some spots he could not touch...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was another four hours before Qing Shui stopped. Now, he only needed to treat her legs and feet. For the other areas, Qing Shui had already relied on the immense Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique, which means on the hands, arms and back, to spread out the Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique and strengthen the meridian channels of her torso.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The interior of the meridian channels were like a passageway, and the energy would not be lost. At most, they would only continue to flow along the channels. However, it was harder to strengthen the exterior of the meridian channels. It required directly touching the adjacent part of her body to more easily strengthen them.</p>
