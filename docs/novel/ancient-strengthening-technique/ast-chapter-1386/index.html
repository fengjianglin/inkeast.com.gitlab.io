 <p><strong>AST 1386 - Powerful Phoenix Finger, Complete Slaughter, Tianhe Renmo Arrived!</strong></p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu and Yuan Su came out. When they saw people smashing the hall, they didn’t hesitate to join in. It’s unknown whether their enemies were still alive or not. Yehuang Guwu wasn’t a person who would show mercy. She wouldn’t hesitate to act if she saw one after another of these arrogant and unreasonable people smashing the hall.</p>
 <p>Once Yehuang Guwu decided to attack with no restraint over her own strength, the only thing which awaited these people would be death. To put it simply, the chances of survival for these people were minute. A majority of them died on the spot.</p>
 <p>The people who entered Imperial Cuisine Hall to cause a ruckus were all classless bullies. The world didn’t lack people of this caliber. They were just bluntly following Che Clan’s order and smashing whatever places Che Clan told them to, which was what led to this kind of circumstances.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, only slightly more than ten people from Che Clan remained. The person taking the lead was a white-haired middle-aged man. He didn’t reveal any dramatic expression seeing the people getting beaten up and out of Imperial Cuisine Hall.</p>
 <p>“Young man, you are indeed really reckless. You are just seeking death.” While looking at Qing Shui, Che Yidao shook his head and said calmly.</p>
 <p>“You are such a good actor. It’s as thought, you guys are nothing but a bunch of disappointments to your clan. It’s precisely because of you people who always try to show off using Che Clan’s name that it ends up in bad reputation. It really leaves me to wonder how long more Che Clan can continue letting you people use its name.” Qing Shui despised people who used the name of their clan to find satisfaction the most.</p>
 <p>“You have truly underestimated Che Clan. Do you really think that Che Clan is a clan which you can stand up against?” Che Yidao unsheathed a blade as soon as he finished speaking.</p>
 <p>A fiery red bird was carved on top of the blade. The blade was two meters long and half a foot wide. Its handle was one inch long. From its appearance, it seemed really heavy. The blade was also shining with red light. The spiritual fluctuation on it also seemed unusually strong.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head, “ You are no match against me. It’s better for you to go back. I don’t feel like killing so many people.” Qing Shui shook his head. Che Yidao was really infuriated with the way he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Beware of my sword! Die! Firecloud Change!”</p>
 <p>Che Yidao charged out abruptly swinging the huge blade in his hand. Fire clouds that were about ten meters huge appeared around the blade. They were shaking very vigorously while they charged their way towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Water Wall!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately unleashed the Tidal Cloud Waves Seal and formed an enormous watery wall in front of himself.</p>
 <p>Peng!</p>
 <p>In the five elements, water owns fire. Unless the fire itself was very powerful, it’s unlikely to be able to suppress water. It would only suffer the fate of being suppressed instead. Once that happened, its prowess would be weakened by at least one time.</p>
 <p>A heavy noise of collision came through and the fire clouds disappeared entirely. Qing Shui’s current strength wasn’t something which Che Yidao could stop. Qing Shui didn’t intend to hesitate at all. He took a step forward.</p>
 <p>Golden Sword!</p>
 <p>A ray of golden light shot out towards Che Yidao. It was very fast. Che Yidao immediately, almost instinctively placed the massive sword in front of himself.</p>
 <p>Dang!</p>
 <p>A thunderous noise came through. Qing Shui managed to push back Che Yidao. Fresh blood started flowing down the corner of Che Yidao’s mouth. Despite the fact the fire suppress metal, Qing Shui was too fast. As soon as he extended his hand, yet another golden ray shot out. It’s just that this time, there were already two men standing in front of Che Yidao. They blocked Qing Shui’s golden sword with their weapons.</p>
 <p>“Wouldn’t it have been better if you guys come after me all at once from the very beginning? You would rather choose your face over your very life. It’s no wonder that you have such a hell of a life.” Qing Shui smiled and moved swiftly towards them.</p>
 <p>Both of the elderly men as well as Che Yidao got really infuriated at the moment when they heard what Qing Shui said. Prior to this, because Che Yidao got hurt, his face originally looked pale with there being a bit of redness on it. But now, his face has turned completely red.</p>
 <p>“Try out my finger technique!”</p>
 <p>As soon as Qing Shui finished speaking, he began to form a seal with his hands. He finished the complicated seals very quickly. After that, he disappeared immediately far away into the distance.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Step, Vanish!</p>
 <p>Peng!</p>
 <p>Following on, a heavy noise was heard. The elderly man on the left side immediately spurted out fresh blood and flew away backwards. The old man on the right side on the other hand, quickly stepped back and looked at Qing Shui in panic.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Finger, Single Finger!</p>
 <p>This was basically just a heavy finger strike. But under the influence of Phoenix Finger, it’s prowess was significantly increased. It immediately blew the old man backwards. Because the attack was directed towards the chest, even though the old man’s organs didn’t get damaged, he has still been heavily injured.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go together and kill him!” Chi Yidao roared with rage.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing Che Yidao’s roar, Qing Shui narrowed his eyes and focused his sight on Che Yidao. Against people who tried to kill him, Qing Shui has never once shown mercy before.</p>
 <p>The remaining people acted very quickly and immediately surrounded themselves around Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“You chose death yourself. Please don’t blame the others.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stared at Che Yidao and revealed a cruel smile on his face. After that, his figure started to become blurry.</p>
 <p>The only thing Che Yidao felt was a chill across his body. After that, he sensed an energy binding around himself. Following on, a bright finger seal appeared. The seal was really faint and resembled a phoenix that was opening up its wings to fly.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Finger, second finger!</p>
 <p>Shanzhong Acupoint!</p>
 <p>Ming!</p>
 <p>It was a sharp and clear bird’s screech. Although it didn’t sound really loud, it was sharp and clear. A bright seal the size slightly smaller than a fist was marked on Che Yidao’s chest.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Finger, Second Finger</p>
 <p>This was Qing Shui’s first time using the Phoenix Finger in a battle. At that instant, he felt as if his fingers were filled with bizarre strength. It’s as if he could penetrate a hole through the sky itself.</p>
 <p>Nothing different was seen from Che Yidao’s body. Despite this, he still fell.</p>
 <p>He died. The Phoenix Finger was very powerful. Let alone there was a huge gap between Qing Shui’s strength compared to Che Yidao. With Qing Shui’s current defense, even if he was to stand still and not do anything, Che Yidao would still be unable to kill him.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>After the breakthrough, the most powerful feature of Qing Shui was his resistance against attacks. It’s as if the Paragon Golden Armor has put on the toughest turtle shell on Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Che Yidao might not have been the strongest warrior among the people who came, he was their leader. His death has immediately caused the people present to feel like a host of dragons without a head. In the blink of an eye, there was already one death and one injured.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui eyed at the people who surrounded him. For a moment, they seemed to find themselves in a position where there was no room for them to advance or to retreat. But one of them didn’t</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smirked. He quickly disappeared and approached the person charging towards him with unusual footsteps.</p>
 <p>He continuously thrusted out the Phoenix Finger.</p>
 <p>It’s just that because there were a lot of people and Qing Shui was in the stage of practicing it, he still made a lot of mistakes. But the current him wasn’t worried that these people would hurt him. Hence, with nothing to worry about, he unleashed the Phoenix Fingers as much as he liked.</p>
 <p>This martial technique was very powerful and caused very deadly damage. But to use it, one would need to have powerful footworks and the ability to accurately point out the positions of each acupoints, meridians as well as blood veins. The hand techniques of the Phoenix Finger was also very complicated. Hence, it wasn’t really as useful as thought.</p>
 <p>Among the battle techniques, it’s always those with fast speed which would cause insufficient damage. As for those that caused deadly damages, they were easy to be interrupted due to their slow speed. The more powerful a battle technique was, the more shortcomings it would have. Even a divine technique was no exception. But they could be matched and be used together with some subsidiary techniques compatible to it.</p>
 <p>Even though he was unable to unleash the prowess which Phoenix Finger was supposed to have, with the amount of power he was able to draw out for now, it was still already enough to put these people in a tough situation. Once they got hit by it, things wouldn’t end well for them. They would immediately either get heavily injured or die.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui flew past like breezing cold wind. He struck the fiery red finer seal on one of the old men’s arm. As soon as he did so, that arm immediately hung down.</p>
 <p>Phoenix Finger could be used against people many times stronger than the user himself. It could be used against people and demonic beasts with very powerful resistance against attacks. Now, Qing Shui felt like he was practicing more. Hence, all of his finger seals were aimed at the less significant spots across the body of the people from Che Clan. He did so so that he could hit them more times.</p>
 <p>By the time Qing Shui stopped, there was no one left around him. The only thing he felt was that after unleashing the Phoenix Finger so many times, it has helped to raise the use of Phoenix Finger up to a powerful level.</p>
 <p>Against warriors with inferior strength, he could kill them instantly. But against powerful warriors, he wouldn’t be able to do so. He would need to accumulate his strength. For example, the Phoenix Finger, he would only be able to see its effect once he attacked the deadly acupoint, meridians or organs of the warrior a number or even more than ten times. The larger the gap of strength between them, the more times he would require to attack them.</p>
 <p>And now, the only thing Qing Shui wanted was a chance to practice his skills. His uses of the Phoenix Finger this time was very important. He has also benefited a lot from it. After that, he slowly lowered down his hands and looked for a few people to tidy up the place.</p>
 <p>There were people who were specially assigned to do this within the city. Hence, it didn’t really require Qing Shui to worry about it. They would burn all of the corpses or deliver them back to Che Clan. In any case, they would make sure to clean up the place. This was a very normal thing across the continent. It wouldn’t really cause influence to anything.</p>
 <p>“Miraculous Physician Qing is really powerful. That is a False God Warrior. He is the fundamental existence of the Che Clan branch. And he is gone just like this. Great, they are no longer able to serve even as a branch of Che Clan.”</p>
 <p>“Yeah but the Clan’s Head of Che Clan will definitely look for Miraculous Physician Qing. After all, the Che Clan branches are also considered to be a part of Che Clan. He has totally embarrassed Che Clan, they will definitely not tolerate this.”</p>
 <p>“*Sigh*, i wonder if Miraculous Physician Qing is going to be able to make it through. No clans would let Miraculous Physician Qing go if such a thing happened to any of them.”</p>
 <p>“But you don’t really have to worry about it. Miraculous Physician Qing isn’t an idiot. The fact that he dares to do such a thing already means that he has the ability to defend himself.”</p>
 <p>“True, why didn’t I think about that.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>While these people were talking, Qing Shui and the girls had already gotten up and made their way into Imperial Cuisine Hall.</p>
 <p>It was just that soon after, there was already someone looking for Qing Shui. The woman servant came up and informed him that a person by the name Tianhe Renmo had come.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui went down himself. The person he saw was indeed none other than Tianhe Renmo. Although it hadn’t been too long since they last met, he was able to feel something different upon meeting him again this time. He was able to tell right away once he began to carefully sense it.</p>
 <p>He had actually gone through one False God Tribulation and advanced to become Second Grade False God.</p>
 <p>But his foundation has gotten even more unstable. Luckily, the False God Tribulation for Grade One False God wasn’t particularly dangerous. Maybe he had used some kind of unique items to help him through his False God Tribulation.</p>
 <p>“Brother, let’s go up.”</p>
 <p>Tianhe Renmo nodded and smiled, “Alright!”</p>
 <p>“Brother, Che Clan will definitely come after you.” By that, Tianhe Renmo meant the clan’s head of Che Clan.</p>
 <p>Naturally, Qing Shui also knew about it, “Bring it on, I want to see how strong the Clan’s Head of Che Clan is.”</p>
 <p>“We will face him together as brothers.” Tianhe Renmo said in a sincere tone.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt quite touched when he saw the determined look in Tianhe Renmo’s eyes. Those eyes of his were filled with resolution like he was ready to die any second. From this, Qing Shui could tell that he definitely knew about how terrifying Che Clan was.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled, “Actually, big brother, you don’t have to involve yourself in it.”</p>
 <p>“Little brother, what are you saying? It’s my Martial Sect. My master can’t decide for things, nor did I have the power to change anything. Hence, the only thing I could do was to assist you,” Tianhe Renmo let out a sigh and said.</p>
 <p>“Brother, what are you talking about? You have done enough by being able to make it here. I am really happy to see you here.” Qing Shui didn’t mention anything about letting him leave. Actually, if the Martial Sect could be delayed for a few more days, he wouldn’t have had to make this kind of choice.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Tianhe Renmo prepared some food and drink and started eating with each other.</p>
 <p>“Congratulations brother, for making it through the False God Tribulation.” Qing Shui smiled as he congratulated Tianhe Renmo.</p>
 <p>“Thank you!” Tianhe Renmo didn’t speak more. He feared that Qing Shui would overthink things.</p>
 <p>“I’ve said before, when you travel of the sect, you have to come and find me. I have a pleasant surprise to give you.”</p>
