 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Lingfeng and the girls have all consumed the Poison Avoidance Pill. They were looking from afar. Qing Shui didn’t let them took part in the match. Not only were Lan Lingfeng and Yin Tong not strong enough, but even with the girls combined, it would still be insufficient to face off against the Grand State Master. Without a doubt, one mere move from the Grand State Master would be enough to defeat all of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui also didn’t tell them to leave first. He knew that if he really died in the battle, the other girls also wouldn’t be able to escape their fate. Hence, Qing Shui knew that he must win this match. With that being the case, naturally, he didn’t tell them to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luckily, Qing Shui still had the Dongfang State Master with him. The woman’s actual combat prowess might not be as good as his own, but without his Paragon Strike, his offensive prowess might not be comparable to the woman. Qing Shui’s truly formidable ability was his ability to control the situation of the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And now, the thing which Qing Shui would need to do was to boost the woman’s strength while at the same time reduce the opponent’s strength. With that, he might really be able to turn the tide of the battle. It was not entirely impossible. Though the woman’s strength might not be as powerful as the Grand State Master’s, Qing Shui was more confident with his own strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you confident that we can kill him? We are no longer left with any retreating routes. Have you made up your mind to kill him?” Qing Shui asked the woman. However, he didn’t look at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If I truly get the chance to kill him, I won’t hesitate to do so. The only problem now is, do we actually have the strength to do it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The words which the Grand State Master said previously naturally made the woman very angry. For someone like him, only his death could dissolve her hatred. The only problem was that it would be very hard to kill him. It was not that she wasn’t confident in herself, but it was because she knew how fearsome the Grand State Master could be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As long as you can make sure that your attacks have the intention to kill, we will have the hope of killing him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was able to roughly sense the woman’s strength. It should be worth around six million Dao Force. Without a doubt, this strength could definitely be regarded as formidable. Before this, she wasn’t this strong. Considering that she was inflicted with poisons before, it should be significantly lower than now, it might only be half of her current strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since she consumed Qing Shui’s Nine Yang Blood, not only did she successfully extracted out the poison, she even managed to break through from her limit and achieved her current realm. Her strength has increased by almost two folds, but when compared to the two realms, it didn’t really mean anything much. One thing that’s worth noting, it was very hard to go through another increase in the realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two barriers which the woman faced weren’t actually about the level of her Divine Grade. After all, it was impossible for a person to increase their Divine Grade level consecutively, let alone the difference between two level of Divine Grade wasn’t merely three million Dao Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A strength worth six million Dao Force has already greatly surpassed Qing Shui’s strength which was worth only four million Dao Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Grand State Master who stood opposite of them was even more formidable. His strength was worth almost seventeen million Dao Force, surpassing the woman’s strength by an entire ten million Dao Force. The strength of ten million Dao Force was like a gateway, many people’s progress halted there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With all that taken into consideration, the Grand State Master could definitely be considered as an outstanding genius. His strength has already reached a fearsome level. Two million Dao Force was the strength of a Fourth Level Divine Grade. A strength worth five million Dao Force was equivalent to the Fifth Level Divine Grade. For Sixth Level Divine Grade, one would need to achieve ten million Dao Force to achieve it. Finally, the Seventh Level Divine Grade would require one to break through fifty million Dao Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As of now, Qing Shui’s strength was worth almost four million Dao Force. It was calculated based on his offensive prowess. Whenever he unleashed his default attacks, that was how much his destructive prowess would be ranged around. But without a doubt, Qing Shui’s actual battle prowess was much more powerful than that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s strength was considered to be at the Fourth Level Divine Grade. The woman, on the other hand, was at the Fifth Level Divine Grade. Her strength was beyond six million Dao Force and very close to reach seven million Dao Force, which was about a ten million difference with the Grand State Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also why the woman was very helpless before. After all, the difference was too big.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn’t a question of whether or not she was confident with herself. When facing off against an absolute strength, it would be very hard for anyone to actually be confident. But when one was forced to a point of no retreat, he would have to give his utmost effort to resist against it, even if it was running his head against a brick wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason why Qing Shui was so daring wasn’t because he was just blindly being confident in himself. Though it might seem to be a huge gap in strength between him and the Grand State Master, his ability to resist against attacks was worth around forty million Dao Force. This was Qing Shui’s true assets. Though he might not be able to injure the opponent with his attacks, the opponent was also unlikely to injure him with his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if his opponent truly had a formidable sure-kill technique, Qing Shui still had his Divine Paragon Armor to block against it. In addition to that, Qing Shui has yet to unleash his abilities that weakened his opponents. Once he used it, the opponent’s strength would be reduced immediately by a huge chunk while there was still room for his strength to increase.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The time is almost up. If you are ready, I will make my move now.” The Grand State Master really enjoyed looking at the helpless expression of his opponents. At least from the Grand State Master’s perspective, that was how his opponents’ faces looked like. It showed that his opponents were trying their best to resist against him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am not ready yet, give me some time.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Battle God Halo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following on, he took out the Heavenly Talisman and tossed it on both himself and the woman. Of course, the Heavenly Talisman he took out was the one that helped increase his strength. Though it only boosted his strength by a bit, it was still better than nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Duality Pure Hearted Formation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This formation was used by two people. Actually, the Taichi Duality Formation was subdivided into many categories. Qing Shui found this one to be the most comfortable one since it didn’t require both users to know about it. As long as one of them knew how to use it, he or she would be able to increase the Diversion Force by 20%. Actually, the Diversion Force was the force which helped to decrease the damage caused by an opponent. It was just the same as the momentum and energy diversion principles of Taichi. In fact, they also originated from this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition to that, the Duality Pure-Hearted Formation was capable of resisting very powerful poisons. The formation could produce gas that helped neutralize the poisons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Adding all of that together, the woman’s and Qing Shui’s strength has increased by 50%. The woman’s strength immediately soared up to about ten million Dao Force. But because ten million Dao Force was a gateway, the woman’s strength could only reach the peak of nine million Dao Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Initially, her strength was worth around seven million Dao Force and now, it was almost ten million Dao Force…… Though it was still a huge difference compared to the Grand State Master’s strength that was worth around seventeen million Dao Force, it was already a much more desirable situation than before. She looked at the mysterious man in shock.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She thought back to the time when the two battled, this man hadn’t actually used this ability. The man’s strength now was worth around six million Dao Force. If he had used such ability before, her strength back then would have been totally inferior compared to his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hm… Interesting… To think that you are actually hiding such a fearsome supplementary ability up your sleeves.” The Grand State Master said in shock. He could sense the changes which the two underwent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Supplementary techniques were very powerful. For example, the Grand State Master who was currently standing in front of them, if his strength increased by 50%, he would have possessed a strength worth nearly twenty-six million Dao Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui revealed a weird smile when he heard what the Grand State Master said. After that, he immediately lifted up his hand and unleashed the Emperor’s Qi.</span></p>

The enemies which he encountered before this were all opponents whom he could beat easily. This time was an exception, the opponent he was about to face this time was a bit harder to deal with, at least it was safe to assume that he wasn’t really confident that he would win. He would need to unleash as much power as he could at a time like this.</span></p>
