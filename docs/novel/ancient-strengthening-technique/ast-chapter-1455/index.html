 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire battleground quieted down. The only thing that remained in the entire Sky Sun Sect was an empty house. There were also a few loyal Sky Sun Sect disciples who bravely charged towards Qing Shui’s group and attacked them. However, the only thing which awaited them was their demise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, there wasn’t a lot of people who died in this incident. The only people who died were the few core members of the Sky Sun Sect. Certainly, this wasn’t all of them as there would be others who were not currently in the sect. It was likely that they would leave far far away once they heard news about it. After all, the Sky Sun Sect was now gone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their first extermination of a sect could be considered to have gone on quite well. It was just that halfway through the fight, an unforeseen event took place. Without Qing Shui, Tantai Lingyan was bound to get hurt. Even worse, her own very life might even be at risk. The Sure-kill Heavenly Technique was very terrifying. Even after the old man was weakened, it was still so powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, the Sure-kill Heavenly Techniques were divided into 3 levels; level 3, level 6, and level 9 respectively. The Sure-kill Heavenly Technique that the old man possessed was definitely not ordinary or else, Qing Shui wouldn’t have needed to unleash the ability of the Paragon Golden Armor which enabled him to block a fatal strike once.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once the old man got weakened, his strength would just be slightly stronger than Hua Rumei and Zhan Yu. Initially, Qing Shui had thought that his three times defensive boost from the Paragon Golden Armor would be enough to block the attack. He thought that its ability to deflect against a fatal strike wouldn’t appear but to his surprise, it did.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the Golden Battle Halberd, Qing Shui’s Paragon Strike underwent a huge change. It was able to achieve a strength worth a 100 million and eight thousand sun. It was certainly very powerful but its only shortcoming was that it could only be used once a day. Furthermore, against a person like the Patriarch of Soaring Dragon Continent, it would still be a bit difficult for it to fatally injure him even after he was weakened. However, it didn’t mean that there was totally no chance for that to happen. After all, once an elderly with this level of strength got weakened, their remaining strength would be less than a 100 million and fifty million sun.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, Qing Shui didn’t use his Paragon Strike in the battle this time. Unless the situation was difficult, he wouldn’t rashly unleash his Sure-kill Heavenly Technique. Sure-kill Heavenly Technique would only be effective when it was used at the most crucial moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as the groups were about to leave, figures of huge demonic beasts appeared from far away and they were approaching them at a really fast speed. Qing Shui was a bit upset, who would come here at a time like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“People from the Great Sun Dynasty,” very quickly, Qing Shui already came down to a conclusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group who came was none other than the people from the Great Sun Dynasty, Qing Shui could tell just by looking at their attire. The people who traveled here were all elders and each of their attires had a scorching sun sewed on it. It was located at their sleeves, which made it less noticeable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui and his party moved their gazes toward the people who were coming near. There were a total of five of them. They immediately summoned back their demonic beasts and stopped at a spot not far away from Qing Shui’s group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aren’t you guys from the Demon Lord Palace? It’s quite surprising to see you guys here,” a relaxed appearance crossed the old man’s face as he spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old man, I suppose you guys are from the Great Sun Dynasty? Yes, we are from Demon Lord Palace and we have built a bit of grudge with the Sky Sun Sect. It was a sudden visit from us, hence, we didn’t manage to greet you guys. Do pardon us for this.” Qing Shui said in a formal tone, giving a face to the Great Sun Dynasty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s eyes turned bright. He moved on to watch Qing Shui before eyeing Tantai Lingyan. Zhan Yu and Hua Rumei also didn’t escape his sights. As he did so, the surprise in his eyes became even more obvious. After that, he said with a smile, “It’s alright. We only came here because we heard sounds of activities. After all, you guys were in the Great Sun Dynasty.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old man, the dynasties across the Soaring Dragon Continents are quite poor in terms of strength. Do the Great Sun Dynasty have plans to make a change to that situation?” Qing Shui said after he thought for a while.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite the fact that there were three great dynasties and countless smaller dynasties across the continent, the total strength of the dynasties as a whole was inferior to that of the aristocratic clans. Hence, as soon as they heard what Qing Shui had said, all their eyes turned bright, though only momentarily. Following on, they sighed and said, “If this was really possible, we would have managed to do it way earlier.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Strength was a factor that was the most difficult to change. It didn’t matter whether it was the strength of an individual, a sect, or a clan. Who wouldn’t want to be the strongest? Who wouldn’t want their clans and sect to be the strongest? These things weren’t something which could be accomplished just by thinking about it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The reason why the dynasties aren’t that strong is because they aren’t united. In terms of mindsets, the dynasties are very rough with it. The three great dynasties are almost equal in terms of power. Even if they have formed an alliance, they would still be reluctant to listen to one another.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man listened to what he said and nodded, “It’s precisely as you said. Could it be that you have thought of any good ideas?.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If possible, the three dynasties should sit down and have a talk with each other. I personally share some degree of relationships with the Great Yan Dynasty. The Great Yan Dynasty is willing to give up some of their stuff. As for you two dynasties, you guys can elect a person with good moral standing and reputation, and who is capable of convincing everyone to become the leader of the alliance. After that, each of the dynasties should also elect some elders to represent their dynasties. The same goes for the elders, they should also have good moral standings and reputation. They should be people with visions for the future, people who can see the big picture. What do you think?” Qing Shui suggested after thinking for a while.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was looking for allies. No matter what, he had established a secured relationship with the Great Yan Dynasty. He believed that he would also be able to make decisions to a certain degree. He was also confident that his accomplishments in the future would be on par with these three great dynasties. For now, he still needed the strength from the three great dynasties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have to go back and discuss this first. But I can tell the probability of going ahead is very large. Also, I would like to thank you guys for helping us to exterminate the Heavenly Yang Sect.” The old man sincerely smiled at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among the three dynasties, the number of experts in Great Sun was the most. But for peak-level supreme experts, Great Yan Dynasty has more of them. So, despite the low population in Great Yan, their position was very strong. The main thing was because Old Man Lu was there. If he wasn’t Great Yan would soon be surpassed by the other two dynasty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man invited Qing Shui and his party to the Great Sun Dynasty. He said that he wanted to treat them as guests, but Qing Shui rejected it. Qing Shui knew that there would be plenty of chances for them to do so once their alliance turned out to be successful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui and his party departed from the Great Sun Dynasty and advanced their way towards another target. This was just the beginning. At one point, Tantai Lingyan remembered those people very clearly. She intended to make them pay their debt little by little. Despite this, she was well aware that this was only a part of the truth. As for the remaining parts, she would have to seek for it from the mouth of the Patriarch of the Soaring Dragon Organization.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Twenty days!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At a blink of an eye, twenty days had passed. In these twenty days, Qing Shui and his group destroyed a total of six sects, two aristocratic clans, and an imperial clan. For a moment, it made the people from the Soaring Dragon Organization to feel anxious. Some of the clans and sects had even migrated themselves as a result.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Qing Shui and his party, they had returned to the Great Yan Dynasty. Yan Zhongqiu was also back. It has been twenty days, Qing Shui wondered if he could force the Patriarch of the Soaring Dragon Continent to show up as a result.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other thing was the Demon Lord Palace. It had become more well-known in the Soaring Dragon Continent. However, at the same time, the grudges which Demon Lord Palace had made with other parties had also begun to spread out. Hence, there were more people who had ill-feelings towards Demon Lord Palace than the good ones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, the only comment people had towards the Soaring Dragon Organization was that they were good. No one would dare talk bad about them in the public. But now, every time a person opened their mouth, a lot of the embarrassing things which the Soaring Dragon Organization had done would get exposed one by one. ‘For evil news ride fast, while good news baits later’, this outcome was a good thing for the Demon Lord Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Patriarch of the Soaring Dragon Organization was a very patient person. Until now, he still didn't have the intention to show up. On the other hand, the things regarding the three great dynasties forming an alliance went on really smoothly. What surprised the people was that the leader of the alliance was Old Man Lu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This surprised Qing Shui. The only person whom he could think of that was capable to persuade the two great dynasties was none other than Old Man Lu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Qing Shui and Tantai Lingyan didn’t mention anything about the Demon Lord Palace joining the alliance. This was due to the reputation of the Demon Lord Palace. Even if they were secretly allies, they would still have to draw a line between each other in public.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very quickly, news about the three great dynasties forming an alliance were already being passed on. The smaller dynasties that had always relied on the three great dynasties couldn’t be happier. ‘Unity is strength’, once the dynasties started working together, they would be just as big as the Soaring Dragon Organization.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui and the others decided to settle down in the backyard of the palace in the Great Yan Dynasty. Meanwhile, they were also waiting for the Patriarch of the Soaring Dragon Organization. The place where they stayed at was really secluded. At night, Qing Shui would go and cultivate inside the Realm of The Violet Jade Immortal. He would spend his mornings strolling around the yard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, do you think it will be better for us to act instead? Go and kill that old fart. Once he died, the entire Soaring Dragon Organization is bound to fall,” Hua Rumei said with a smile when she saw Qing Shui spacing out in the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We aren’t in a rush, let’s wait a little while longer. If they don’t come, we will go together with the old man. That way, it’s almost certain that our opponents will be annihilated. The possibility of us heading there isn’t really high. Furthermore, we will easily have casualties if we go there first.” Qing Shui said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It would have been so much better if there is a formation made specifically for four people which significantly boost their resistance towards attacks.” Hua Rumei said with enthusiasm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words suddenly crossed Qing Shui’s mind. He felt as if something else has grown within his Sea of Consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Hua Rumei was speaking, he felt as if something that resembled formations which he familiarized himself with were appearing in his mind. However, that also didn’t seem to be the case. It was something which felt even more like the Phoenix’s Battle Intent. Qing Shui couldn’t care less about Hua Rumei and he immediately went into his Sea of Consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Battle God’s Halo (Mutated)!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mutated?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui pondered over it and remembered that there seemed to be a thing that was known as the Battle God’s Halo at the Battle God’s Inheritance last time. At that time, it was only briefly introduced and didn’t provide a specific way to use it. In fact, Qing Shui didn’t even have an idea on where to start from. But now, it had evolved into a mutated Battle God’s Halo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned immediately as soon as he looked at it. Weren’t these the formations that he had always been familiar with?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heaven Covering Formation, Earth Loading Formation, Soaring Bird Formation, Flying Dragon Formation…..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were just a formation of sorts, a kind of form taken by the Halos and could be triggered instantly with no energy consumption. Not more than ten people could benefit from it at once. It would work if only one person was using it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This thing was too powerful and incredible!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This can be considered a powerful ancient formation from the primordial era. Now that the halo was mutated, Qing Shui hurriedly went to check the effects.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The amount of boost in strength wasn’t really significant, but it wasn’t that minor either. For instance, the Heaven Covering Formation, it increased his attack prowess by 20%. Unfortunately, he couldn’t get away from its side-effect which greatly reduces his speed. Furthermore, Qing Shui was also uncertain on whether the Heaven Covering Halo was effective. He also had the Earth Loading Halo which could help boost his defensive ability by 30%.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wake up, wake up, what are you thinking? Why do you have such a naughty smile on your face?” Hua Rumei extended her hand and used it to knock Qing Shui’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui woke up, he was still thinking about the effect of those Halos. The current Heavenly Talismans only boosted his strength by 10%. As for these Halos, they could boost at most 25% of his defensive strength. When combined with the 10% of his innate talent and the Phoenix’s Battle Intent respectively, it was would be very terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A 10% boost in his attack was really terrifying. Now, with the mutated Battle God’s Halo, it basically meant that the victor in the battle between Old Man Lu and the Soaring Dragon Organization had basically been decided.</span></p>
