 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Qing Shui didn’t know why Qingge blushed all of a sudden. But thinking back, he was also seduced by the mysterious woman. There was no way that Qingge would be seduced by the woman as well, or could there be other reasons why she was so lost in her thought?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The White Jade Battle King Crab was truly impressive. Furthermore, it also had a formidable technique to seduce both male and female. Usually, the seducing technique which women cultivated should only work against men. Opposite sex attracted each other, this was something which shouldn’t change under normal circumstances. Certainly, there might also be some people with a crooked mindset, who would go after things, which didn’t match the nature and normal people’s desire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Similarly, the White Jade Battle King Crab was also shocked to see that Qing Shui was able to snap out of her seductive technique. It was a fearsome ability, which she received when she mutated from a White Silver Battle King Crab. Most of the time, it would confuse the enemies and she would use the opening to finish them off. At times, she might even make them fight against each other.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at her. He hated being treated this way, even if she was a beautiful woman. His eyes turned cold, as he slowly raised the Golden Battle Halberd in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“Let me go, I will live my life serving under you.” Just as Qing Shui was about to make his move, the White Jade Battle King Crab spoke. She seemed reluctant when she was saying it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;She was aware, that if she couldn’t suggest anything, which could pique the opponent’s interest, she would be killed. She could sense the man’s intention to kill. If her seductive technique failed, it would mean that there was no way he could ever attract this man. The woman beside the man was even more beautiful than herself. She admitted that she couldn’t compare herself with the woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Muyun Qingge gave Qing Shui a strange look. As for Qing Shui, he seemed to have felt Muyun Qingge’s gaze. He rubbed his nose and said, “Qingge, feed her with this. After that, drop a drop of blood on her&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui gave Muyun Qingge the Sacred Beast Pill. It was used to tame demonic beasts. But now, the Sacred Beast Pill was already much stronger than its old version from the past. The quality of its ingredients had risen by a lot. Naturally, its final strength would also be significantly higher than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Muyun Qingge smiled and asked after a moment of hesitation, “You sure you won’t regret it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Qing Shui rubbed his nose, “Do I look that fragile to you? Back then, when I was up against you, I still managed to handle myself well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;When Muyun Qingge heard what Qing Shui said, she shot a glare at him. And then, she followed Qing Shui’s instruction and fed the White Jade Battle King Crab with the Sacred Beast Pill, then she dropped a drop of blood on her</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;A dazzling light shone. At the same time, a faint shadow of a White Jade Battle King Crab also went into Muyun Qingge’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;With that, the White Jade Battle King Crab would have recognized Muyun Qingge as her owner. Qing Shui didn’t have a choice, this was how cruel the World of the Nine Continent was. Hence, only through this procedure could he be at ease towards the White Jade Battle King Crab.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After recognizing its owner, the White Jade Battle King Crab hadn’t done anything unusual. Very quickly, it had already become really close with Muyun Qingge. Usually, she would stay in her human form, but she could only unleash her full potential when she was in her Beast Form. ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;After all that happened, this unexpected scenario eventually turned out quite well. After all, Muyun Qingge has managed to receive huge benefits from it. The White Jade Battle King Crab was very precious, as very few would actually go through this sort of mutation. After it mutated, it became incomparably powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Prior to this, although Qing Shui had made up his mind to kill her, but if he really did, he wouldn’t feel good deep down inside. He would also need to take into consideration, that he was now in the World of the Nine Continents and mustn’t show too much sympathy to his opponents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Qing Shui and Muyun Qingge, along with the current Bai Yu… The White Silver Battle King Crab was called Bai Yu. Qing Shui was already used to it. He walked into her cave and noticed that it was very clean, particularly her bedroom. It was basically just like a normal female bedroom, clean and tidy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Qing Shui didn’t really receive many things from here. Bai Yu had her own spatial stuff. Hence, whether she had any treasures or not, only Muyun Qingge would have known about it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was already quite late. Qing Shui planned to take a break. When it was almost time, he would leave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Qing Shui found a cave and settled down in it. After summoning a few of his demonic beasts, he went inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When inside of the realm, as usual, Qing Shui cultivated his Divine Wood Essence. He has been cultivating it for the past few days. Now, it has reached a crucial stage. If everything went on smoothly, he should be able to totally grasp the Divine Wood Essence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was standing in the middle of the air within the realm. All around him was circles after circles of woody vines. They were thick and strong. Even the most ordinary wood vine had the thickness of more than ten meters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Qing Shui’s increase in strength, the Five Elements Divine Refining Technique was already at a fearsome level. After all, it was required to bind and choke huge beasts to death, having this kind of thickness was perfectly normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Pu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;After a period of time, a slight yet clear noise came through. It sounded like certain acupoints have opened. The vines around Qing Shui underwent some changes. Even its outer appearance, also looked a lot different.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The thickness of the vine seemed to be almost the same. However, It's obvious that the vine was a lot darker now. The stripes around the vines were a few times more concentrated than before, giving people the impression that it was incomparably tough and strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Qing Shui waved his hand and soon thrust out his fist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;A force around ten thousand Dao Force had only managed to leave some light scratches on the surface. It was just like when a tree’s skin got peeled off. And this was one of the most ordinary vines which Qing Shui chose.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui then operated his mind and as he swung his hand, the vines around him immediately changed and turned into dark red Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines. Compared to those before, it was thicker and the aura which it emitted, felt as if it could swallow you whole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It changed…… The Divine Wood Essence has been successfully cultivated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt a sense of satisfaction as he looked at the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines which changed significantly from before. The thorns on top were even tougher and sharper now. Furthermore, its vitality has also gotten a lot stronger than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Paragon Strike!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Qing Shui struck the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines with all his might using the Golden Battle Halberd in his hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;This was Qing Shui’s all-out strike. Furthermore, it was also the Paragon Strike. An attack that’s almost worth five hundred thousand Dao Force combined with the unique ability of the Golden Battle Halberd and both landed at the same time on the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines.&nbsp;</span></p>

Hence, he didn’t hold back. He wanted to test if the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines was tough enough to withstand his all-out attack.&nbsp;</span></p>

He felt really happy looking at the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines totally unscathed. However, after seeing that his ultimate attack incapable of destroying the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines, he began to question himself, was it the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines that's too tough? or was it his attacks that he needed to improve on?&nbsp;</span></p>

As of now, Qing Shui’s attack could definitely be regarded as sufficiently strong. But now, since he successfully cultivated the Divine Wood Essence, Qing Shui could find no words to describe the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines other than it was crazy powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>

He found out that not only has it gotten a lot tougher, its ability to contract and sting its opponent had also improved by one fold.</span></p>

At the same time, Qing Shui’s vitality had also improved along with his Force of Rebirth and Acupuncture abilities. This could be considered as a chain reaction.&nbsp;</span></p>
