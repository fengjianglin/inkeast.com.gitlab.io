 <p><strong>Chapter 504 Raging Flame Cloud Leopard.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 504 - Raging Flame Cloud Leopard</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">A piercing shrill which caused Qing Shui's scalp to turn numb rang out, and then it quietened down. Qing Shui gradually drew out his shiny Big Dipper Sword!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This Tricolor Scorpion King was extremely poisonous, with powerful defenses. When ordinary Peak Martial King warriors came across it, they would have no choice but to run. Moreover, it also had many ‘underlings.’ However, Qing Shui did not sense the King's Aura that he had found on the Silver Wolf Queen.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The tricolors on the dead Tricolor Scorpion King gradually disappeared, revealing a crimson red shell. Because of the tricolors previously, he only found out that the Tricolor Scorpion King was also a crimson red colored scorpion. However the red was extremely translucent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui saw the arrow that was still pierced into the scorpion's back!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"What strong defenses. An armor made from this shell would definitely be very strong..."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The woman had also walked up to Qing Shui at this time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I'll take out the Core. You can bring it back and let that alchemist refine it. But if there's no effects or if there's any abnormalities, remember to give your mother the medicinal pill I gave you." Qing Shui said softly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I trust you. There's no need for this Core." the woman said calmly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"You really trust me so much?" Qing Shui smiled and looked at her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The woman nodded firmly!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled and did not say anything else. However, he still cut up the Tricolor Scorpion King's corpse, chunks by chunks.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Core was a crimson red and the size of two small fists. Qing Shui passed it to her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Take it. You had almost lost your life for this. I like woman with filial piety. Such women are the most beautiful."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The woman reached out her hand slowly and took it!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui then took apart the Tricolor Scorpion King's shell, its big tail, pedipalps, and its bones before storing them in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Let's go. I'll give you a lift out of the Flowerfruit Mountain!" Qing Shui said and headed outside.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The woman silently followed behind him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Basically, no one dared to ride a flying beast in the Flowerfruit Mountain since they would occasionally pass by powerful demonic beasts like the Divine Black Crow. Therefore, in comparison, it was safer to travel on land.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui led the woman to pass the Silver Wolf Queen's territory. At least this place was still safe!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The woman felt that it was strange that the countless "One Horned Silver Wolf" did not do anything towards Qing Shui. As she looked at him, she increasingly felt that this man was very mysterious.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was a one-day journey out of the Flowerfruit Mountain, and they left the Silver Wolf Queen's territory very quickly. It was good that the area was considered nearer towards the borders.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui arrived near that quiet valley, he felt that something was amiss. This feeling made him feel very uneasy, but he was not especially worried.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui soon discovered what it was. Tens of those tremendous fellows had already appeared. And judging by the situation, the numbers were still increasing!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mountain Giant Bear!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">With a height of three meters and a length of seven meters, its body looked as tough as a rock, and it had tremendous strength and thick defenses. The only thing was that its movements were a bit slow.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Not much later, a few hundreds of them had appeared!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt gloomy. He had not expected that they would come across such a situation when they were already almost out of the Flowerfruit Mountain!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui turned to looked at the woman and noticed that she was looking at the Mountain Giant Bears in the distance. Her expression was still the same, cold and uncaring.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not help but let his thoughts run astray, thinking if she could still be so calm and cool if they were to have sex...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He called out for the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. There was no other choice, they could only try to make a run for it!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Woman, get on!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui went up onto Diamond Gigantic Elephant. Even so, they were still not at a height comparable to those Mountain Giant Bear!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Sit here and don't move!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui got the woman to sit on top of the Overlord Storm! However, he soon fell into a short daze. The moment that woman sat on top of the Overlord Storm, she had unconsciously exuded a domineering aura which belonged to women.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was still in a daze. When Shi Qingzhuang was riding the Emberlion Steed, she looked very beautiful, her arrogance mixed in with her coolness. But now, this woman had brought this feeling of arrogance to an even greater height.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He pulled back his gaze and got the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to perform a Mighty Elephant Stomp towards the Mountain Giant Bears.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui charged in while waving his Violet Gold Divine Shield and Big Dipper Sword!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shield Attack!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Each of Qing Shui's attack brought down a group of the bears. Qing Shui's powers now was not something these Mountain Giant Bears could match!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shield Attack!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shield Attack!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui kept repeating the same action, progressing forward as one with his elephant. This was also why Qing Shui rode the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Otherwise, Qing Shui's Mighty Elephant Stomp was already much stronger than the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Under Qing Shui's brute force, each of his attack cleared up a big piece of space. The Diamond Gigantic Elephant charged on recklessly, its monstrous defenses allowed Qing Shui to unleash his tremendous strength without a care.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The woman sat on the Overlord Storm, looking on as Qing Shui continued to hit out with his giant shield, knocking down those Mountain Giant Bears again and again. This man would occasionally looked towards her and his surroundings. If he noticed that there were any Mountain Giant Bears near her, he would first knock down those.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the second man who showered her with so much love and protection. The first one was her father, but he had already left her forever... The woman stared at Qing Shui's back in a daze.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After all, Qing Shui's powers were surging now. The Mountain Giant Bears' powers were nothing compared to him. He had not even used his Emperor’s Qi!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He led the woman out of the Flowerfruit Mountain, and they rode on the Fire Bird for half a day before he gradually landed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Woman, you can go now. Be careful when you’re by yourself!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui said softly. As long as they had gotten out of the Flowerfruit Mountain, there were not many who were a match for her. Moreover, she still had her Ice Crane, a Peak Martial King level demonic beast.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Thank you!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the second time the woman said thanks to Qing Shui. Her tone was still very stiff and cold!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, to Qing Shui, it was much better than the first time she said it!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Go on!" Qing Shui smiled at the woman.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The woman hesitated for a moment before she got on her Ice Crane. She took a long look at Qing Shui before she left.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had thought of striking up a relationship with her clan but eventually dismissed this thought. He did not ask which continent she was from nor did he even asked for her name.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He watched on as the Ice Crane became increasingly smaller, and eventually disappeared out of his sight!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui believed that with his abilities, he would definitely reach the peak. Although he had saved her, he did not wish for her to feel burdened as he felt that she was already very tired.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Since he did not wish to have any connection with her, then it would be best to just let her leave in peace!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As for whether he had just been too much of a good person, Qing Shui decided not to think about it. He felt that an effect presupposes a cause, and that there would always be karma. He just took it as having done a good act.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not want to anything in return for this. What happened today made him recall the little girl back in Hundred Miles City who had helped him catch fishes and prawns.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It had been a few years since then. He wondered how she was now.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not feel that he was a very sentimental person. It might be because after his encounter with that little girl, he had told her to look for him in Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store if she were to need help. She would just need to give his name.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was very easy for the Qing Clan to help a girl like her. But till now, he did not know if she had been to Qing Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui then thought of two other people. A great beauty and a little beauty from Central Continent's Qianyu Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qianyu Qingqing...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Back then, Qing Shui thought that she was Qingqing!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">And that little girl, that mischievous lass!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui shook his head. He did not know why he had let his thoughts run wild. He did not know if he would go to the Qianyu Clan. Maybe he would when he went to Central Continent.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He took the Fire Bird back to the Flowerfruit Mountain. With the growth in his powers, Qing Shui should have no problem keeping himself safe in the Flowerfruit Mountain. With both the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and the Fire Bird, he had the greatest assurance for his life. However, he could only ride the Fire Bird occasionally in the Flowerfruit Mountain.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the mountain and forests, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was stronger with its monstrous defence. Moreover, to perform his strongest attack, he still needed to work with the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to become one with the elephant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Goddess Peak!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui recalled the scene of the piece of vegetation and the setting sun in the treasure map. He walked towards the inner areas of the Flowerfruit Mountain. However, Qing Shui found it hard to calm down. After all, the further west he went, he was heading deeper into the Flowerfruit Mountain.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If he were to come across Martial Saint level demonic beasts...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui hesitated!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But he still made the decision to take a look and just see!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A week passed by. Qing Shui did not panic and slowly headed deeper into the Flowerfruit Mountain. After walking no less than ten thousand li, Qing Shui lost count of how many powerful demonic beasts he had avoided. Under the situation where he did not use the Great Revitalizing Pellet, Qing Shui could afford to fight against one of them. However, the demonic beasts came in packs and there were also groups which came in numbers that were too big to count...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the massive Flowerfruit Mountain, Qing Shui realized how lucky he was to have found the 2nd treasure map. A weeks time caused him to lose hope completely. How could he possibly find the treasure in a mountain which spanned an area of a million li?!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Dong dong...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, an earth-shaking sound rang out, causing Qing Shui to frowned.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the sound of a group of large demonic beasts running about. It was coming from the back of the mountain before him!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui quickly went up and looked towards the direction the sound was coming from.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Raging Flame Cloud Leopard!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt slightly suppressed. To think that demonic beasts of such a level had appeared in such numbers. Qing Shui made up his mind to come search for the treasure map in the future.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Raging Flame Cloud Leopard, the fastest demonic beast in the Martial Saint level. A mature Raging Flame Cloud Leopard could have up to a 50 percent chance to become a perfect ten countries demonic beast. It would appear extremely powerful with a length of 20 meters, a height of &nbsp;meters, a streamlined and agile body with flames sprouting all over.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Their speed was also said to be the fastest. Amongst the demonic beasts of Martial Saint level or lower, they were the fastest. They would also be ranked in the top three as the most terrifying demonic beasts in the Flowerfruit Mountain. After all, they were also demonic beasts which lived in a big group.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui estimated that there were thousands of them, running with great power and speed along the valleys. To them, this speed was as if they were merely walking.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Squeak squeak...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just then, squeaking sounds came from the other end of the valley. When the Raging Flame Cloud Leopards heard this sound, most of them tensed up.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">What was it that caused so many powerful demonic beasts to treat it so seriously?</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui then took apart the Tricolor Scorpion King's shell, its big tail, pedipalps, and its bones before storing them in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Let's go. I'll give you a lift out of the Flowerfruit Mountain!" Qing Shui said and headed outside.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The woman silently followed behind him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Basically, no one dared to ride a flying beast in the Flowerfruit Mountain since they would occasionally pass by powerful demonic beasts like the Divine Black Crow. Therefore, in comparison, it was safer to travel on land.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui led the woman to pass the Silver Wolf Queen's territory. At least this place was still safe!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The woman felt that it was strange that the countless "One Horned Silver Wolf" did not do anything towards Qing Shui. As she looked at him, she increasingly felt that this man was very mysterious.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was a one-day journey out of the Flowerfruit Mountain, and they left the Silver Wolf Queen's territory very quickly. It was good that the area was considered nearer towards the borders.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui arrived near that quiet valley, he felt that something was amiss. This feeling made him feel very uneasy, but he was not especially worried.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui soon discovered what it was. Tens of those tremendous fellows had already appeared. And judging by the situation, the numbers were still increasing!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mountain Giant Bear!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">With a height of three meters and a length of seven meters, its body looked as tough as a rock, and it had tremendous strength and thick defenses. The only thing was that its movements were a bit slow.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Not much later, a few hundreds of them had appeared!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt gloomy. He had not expected that they would come across such a situation when they were already almost out of the Flowerfruit Mountain!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui turned to looked at the woman and noticed that she was looking at the Mountain Giant Bears in the distance. Her expression was still the same, cold and uncaring.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not help but let his thoughts run astray, thinking if she could still be so calm and cool if they were to have sex...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He called out for the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. There was no other choice, they could only try to make a run for it!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Woman, get on!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui went up onto Diamond Gigantic Elephant. Even so, they were still not at a height comparable to those Mountain Giant Bear!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Sit here and don't move!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui got the woman to sit on top of the Overlord Storm! However, he soon fell into a short daze. The moment that woman sat on top of the Overlord Storm, she had unconsciously exuded a domineering aura which belonged to women.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was still in a daze. When Shi Qingzhuang was riding the Emberlion Steed, she looked very beautiful, her arrogance mixed in with her coolness. But now, this woman had brought this feeling of arrogance to an even greater height.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He pulled back his gaze and got the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to perform a Mighty Elephant Stomp towards the Mountain Giant Bears.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui charged in while waving his Violet Gold Divine Shield and Big Dipper Sword!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shield Attack!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Each of Qing Shui's attack brought down a group of the bears. Qing Shui's powers now was not something these Mountain Giant Bears could match!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shield Attack!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shield Attack!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui kept repeating the same action, progressing forward as one with his elephant. This was also why Qing Shui rode the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Otherwise, Qing Shui's Mighty Elephant Stomp was already much stronger than the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Under Qing Shui's brute force, each of his attack cleared up a big piece of space. The Diamond Gigantic Elephant charged on recklessly, its monstrous defenses allowed Qing Shui to unleash his tremendous strength without a care.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The woman sat on the Overlord Storm, looking on as Qing Shui continued to hit out with his giant shield, knocking down those Mountain Giant Bears again and again. This man would occasionally looked towards her and his surroundings. If he noticed that there were any Mountain Giant Bears near her, he would first knock down those.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was the second man who showered her with so much love and protection. The first one was her father, but he had already left her forever... The woman stared at Qing Shui's back in a daze.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After all, Qing Shui's powers were surging now. The Mountain Giant Bears' powers were nothing compared to him. He had not even used his Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He led the woman out of the Flowerfruit Mountain, and they rode on the Fire Bird for half a day before he gradually landed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Woman, you can go now. Be careful when you’re by yourself!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui said softly. As long as they had gotten out of the Flowerfruit Mountain, there were not many who were a match for her. Moreover, she still had her Ice Crane, a Peak Martial King level demonic beast.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Thank you!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was the second time the woman said thanks to Qing Shui. Her tone was still very stiff and cold!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, to Qing Shui, it was much better than the first time she said it!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Go on!" Qing Shui smiled at the woman.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The woman hesitated for a moment before she got on her Ice Crane. She took a long look at Qing Shui before she left.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had thought of striking up a relationship with her clan but eventually dismissed this thought. He did not ask which continent she was from nor did he even asked for her name.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He watched on as the Ice Crane became increasingly smaller, and eventually disappeared out of his sight!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui believed that with his abilities, he would definitely reach the peak. Although he had saved her, he did not wish for her to feel burdened as he felt that she was already very tired.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Since he did not wish to have any connection with her, then it would be best to just let her leave in peace!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As for whether he had just been too much of a good person, Qing Shui decided not to think about it. He felt that an effect presupposes a cause, and that there would always be karma. He just took it as having done a good act.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not want to anything in return for this. What happened today made him recall the little girl back in Hundred Miles City who had helped him catch fishes and prawns.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It had been a few years since then. He wondered how she was now.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui did not feel that he was a very sentimental person. It might be because after his encounter with that little girl, he had told her to look for him in Qing Clan’s Medicinal Store if she were to need help. She would just need to give his name.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was very easy for the Qing Clan to help a girl like her. But till now, he did not know if she had been to Qing Clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui then thought of two other people. A great beauty and a little beauty from Central Continent's Qianyu Clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qianyu Qingqing...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Back then, Qing Shui thought that she was Qingqing!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">And that little girl, that mischievous lass!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui shook his head. He did not know why he had let his thoughts run wild. He did not know if he would go to the Qianyu Clan. Maybe he would when he went to Central Continent.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He took the Fire Bird back to the Flowerfruit Mountain. With the growth in his powers, Qing Shui should have no problem keeping himself safe in the Flowerfruit Mountain. With both the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and the Fire Bird, he had the greatest assurance for his life. However, he could only ride the Fire Bird occasionally in the Flowerfruit Mountain.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the mountain and forests, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was stronger with its monstrous defence. Moreover, to perform his strongest attack, he still needed to work with the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to become one with the elephant.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Goddess Peak!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui recalled the scene of the piece of vegetation and the setting sun in the treasure map. He walked towards the inner areas of the Flowerfruit Mountain. However, Qing Shui found it hard to calm down. After all, the further west he went, he was heading deeper into the Flowerfruit Mountain.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If he were to come across Martial Saint level demonic beasts...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui hesitated!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But he still made the decision to take a look and just see!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A week passed by. Qing Shui did not panic and slowly headed deeper into the Flowerfruit Mountain. After walking no less than ten thousand li, Qing Shui lost count of how many powerful demonic beasts he had avoided. Under the situation where he did not use the Great Revitalizing Pellet, Qing Shui could afford to fight against one of them. However, the demonic beasts came in packs and there were also groups which came in numbers that were too big to count...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the massive Flowerfruit Mountain, Qing Shui realized how lucky he was to have found the 2nd treasure map. A weeks time caused him to lose hope completely. How could he possibly find the treasure in a mountain which spanned an area of a million li?!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Dong dong...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, an earth-shaking sound rang out, causing Qing Shui to frowned.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was the sound of a group of large demonic beasts running about. It was coming from the back of the mountain before him!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui quickly went up and looked towards the direction the sound was coming from.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Raging Flame Cloud Leopard!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt slightly suppressed. To think that demonic beasts of such a level had appeared in such numbers. Qing Shui made up his mind to come search for the treasure map in the future.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Raging Flame Cloud Leopard, the fastest demonic beast in the Martial Saint level. A mature Raging Flame Cloud Leopard could have up to a 50 percent chance to become a perfect ten countries demonic beast. It would appear extremely powerful with a length of 20 meters, a height of &nbsp;meters, a streamlined and agile body with flames sprouting all over.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Their speed was also said to be the fastest. Amongst the demonic beasts of Martial Saint level or lower, they were the fastest. They would also be ranked in the top three as the most terrifying demonic beasts in the Flowerfruit Mountain. After all, they were also demonic beasts which lived in a big group.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui estimated that there were thousands of them, running with great power and speed along the valleys. To them, this speed was as if they were merely walking.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Squeak squeak...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just then, squeaking sounds came from the other end of the valley. When the Raging Flame Cloud Leopards heard this sound, most of them tensed up.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">What was it that caused so many powerful demonic beasts to treat it so seriously?</p>
