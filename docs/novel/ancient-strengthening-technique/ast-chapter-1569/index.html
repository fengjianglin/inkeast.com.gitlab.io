 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"He's always like that, so prideful. Don't mind him." Muyun Qingge smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seems Muyun Qingge has also made out the fact that the 3rd Palace Master doesn't like me</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">. He shook his head: "It doesn't matter what others say to me or how they look at me, I don't care about that."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Jiange?" Qing Shui's mind was occupied with only this and felt a bit impatient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"She's still cultivating. You see that place? Go by yourself and surprise her." Muyun Qingge smiled as she pointed towards a building in the north-east direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That place was an independent mountain manor, although it was far, its unique grace could be made out, seeming as if it was separated from the mundane world. He thanked her and quickly flew towards that direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Muyun Qingge stood there while watching his silhouette go farther away. For some reason, she shook her head and left towards another direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Who are you? Stop there!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The manor's entrance was guarded by two mermen of tall stature, they had a human appearance and were completely cyan in colour.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Merfolk don't have a gender at the time of their birth. As their consciousness awakens while growing into adulthood, a variation arises in their bodies causing a split-up between males and females. There were also mermen who preserved neutrality for their entire lives. As for gender-bending, it depended on their own will. To gender-bend, it took about a few months, at the very least, as long as 1-2 years. Merfolk can make this choice only once in their entire lifetime.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui directly took out the insignia Muyun Qingge gave him; the two guards hinted that he could pass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was also quite curious about these two mermen. According to the legends of his previous life, mermen were a powerful existence, along with the Azure Water Yaksha's and the Clam-men...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only, these two mermen didn't seem strong. Their appearance was that of a male’s and they looked pretty as mermen all essentially looked pretty. Only, considering their looks, they didn't seem to be from the mermen's imperial family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Water organisms such as Mermaids and Drakainas had a natural human height, but mermen approached humanity with regards to appearance quite exceptionally. Their spiritual intelligence was quite high, and the strength of the mermen's imperial family was quite terrible as they were proficient in the water-type heavenly techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were also Salamanders. They belonged to the spirit-type and were also one of the most awful existences in water. This made Qing Shui feel that the Salamanders here were different from those in his previous life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, there were Black Scales Mermen and many more; they could naturally assume a human form and were also closest to a human appearance. They were considered as high-level existences with high spiritual intelligence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui entered the manor. This manor wasn't small and was completely filled with pavilions and kiosks. Only, they all still retained their most natural style, making it seem as if the entire building was carved out of a huge stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cloudstone!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui passed through a courtyard. There was a huge Cloudstone placed there. It was quite exquisite, just like a stone dragon as it took over half the space in the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Qing Shui's gaze fell on the woman atop the stone dragon. Snow-white clothes, beautiful hair scattered over the shoulders, sitting there cross-legged as if she was meditating, but still possessing an extraordinary purity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt an indescribable feeling. This was his master and also his friend, but in his heart, she always held the same position as a wife.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had not seen her for 10 years. Qing Shui sighed with sorrow. As he was dazed, Yiye Jiange opened her eyes slightly, glancing towards Qing Shui's direction. When she looked at him, she was dazed, and closed her eyes as if she didn't dare to believe her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she opened her eyes again, Qing Shui was still standing there. He smiled towards her. She floated towards him and used her arm to directly hold Qing Shui, but she immediately retreated back in alarm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Who are you?" Yiye Jiange cried out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Master, don’t you remember me?" Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Aaahhh. It's really you. Qing Shui, I'm not dreaming, ri..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange looked at him in surprise, reaching out to feel his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I've finally found you." Qing Shui smiled and then hugged her, as if he was afraid she'd disappear if he let go. Yiye Jiange embraced his neck, gazing at him with happiness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I obtained an Drakaina inheritance and became a protector of this Sea King’s Palace. They all call me the 2nd Palace Master. Qing Shui, how did you come here?" Yiye Jiange was quite curious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It's quite a long story. Come, let's go over there. I'll tell you about it slowly." Qing Shui pulled her towards a nearby stone table.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange allowed him to lead her. Qing Shui's appearance freed her from anxiety. She believed he'd find her but didn't think it'd happen so soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui told her a simplified version of his journey. Yiye Jiange sat opposite to her, but their hands were still grabbing on to each other’s. She also sighed endlessly regarding the matters he encountered during his journey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui, you shouldn't have come. Right now, this place is a land of chaos." Thinking about the situation here, Yiye Jiange sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Maybe. But my arrival is unrelated to the chaos in this land. Anyways, if anyone bullies you or me, I'll just have to make sure they don't return to tell the tale." Qing Shui laughed as if he was making a joke, but she knew he wasn't.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange was very familiar with him and also knew about Qing Shui's abilities. Even if she has obtained an inheritance and had incomparably terrifying strength, she still felt that he possessed inconceivable abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange looked at him: "Your progress is so quick even though I haven't seen you for this long. I can't even look through you now."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Should I strip then? You might be able to see clearly then." Qing Shui gazed at that peerless mien with an unfathomable love.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Whatever words you speak, they are all indecent. Aren’t you afraid I'd run?" Yiye Jiange also didn't get angry. When she was with him, she understood how important this man was in her heart. His appearance was similar to a scorching sun in a hazy and cold sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Even if you run to the ends of the world, I'll get you back. Without you, I'd feel as if my heart has been ripped out." Qing Shui said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You still like to make me laugh. I like being made to do that." Yiye Jiange laughed. Her laugh was enough to bring down a country.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How did you arrive here? Did you fare well?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though Qing Shui had spoken with Muyun Qingge, he still wanted to hear Yiye Jiange's words. He had an unconditional trust towards her and he shared everything with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That Crystal Palace you had seen before once was actually a Drakaina Palace. I received the Drakaina inheritance from that place. In her inheritance, she expressed her longing and worry towards this Sea King’s Palace and hoped that I'd be able to help her guard this place."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Muyun Qingge is also a Drakaina?" Though he had already confirmed this, he still asked it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Yes, she's the most supreme existence of this Sea King’s Palace."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui originally thought that she was mermen but&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">didn't expect that she was a Drakaina. Drakainas were fewer compared to Mermen and were also more excelling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them spoke about the affairs of the Sea King’s Palace for a long time as they had words they wanted to say to each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Is everything alright at home?" Yiye Jiange had stayed at Qing family's home for quite long and also the place where her brother, sister-in-law, nephews, and nieces were at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"They are all fine, only that they miss you. I also missed you a lot." Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How much did you miss me?" Yiye Jiange asked a little naughtily. She had an indescribable allure right now, that graceful gentleness, where each of her movements were enough to make a person feel familiarity as well as inferior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"My heart ached whenever I thought about us. I wanted to see you, wanted to hug you, wanted to nibble at you and also wanted to unify my body with yours closely..." All the words Qing Shu spoke were true... It was just that those final words made her feel shy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Baddie, what are you saying?!" Yiye Jiange had let go of many things but, but she was still shy. And only this little man before her dared to act so wantonly towards her, making her feel shy as well as happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Did Master miss me?" Qing Shui looked at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're trying to make me angry on purpose, right?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How could I even be willing to do that? Otherwise, why don't you let me hear you call me 'Brother'?" Qing Shui said subtly</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're dead! You definitely need a spanking!" Yiye Jiange reached out to hit his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It feels really comfortable, do it harder..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his exaggerated yells, Yiye Jiange's face blushed as she covered his mouth. She really didn't have any other way to stop him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui pulled her into his embrace. He let out a breath feeling well at last. Yiye Jiange also didn't struggle, instead she used her arm to hug his neck softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at that blemish-less beautiful face as well as those slightly frenetic eyes, Qing Shui slowly moved forward and kissed her lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soft and delicate, as well as sweet. Yiye Jiange closed her eyes as her body stiffened a bit. Qing Shui could also sense her heartbeat quickening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Qing Shui was preparing to take the next step, footsteps hurried from outside along with a voice. Hearing it, he knew Muyun Qingge had come.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui released Yiye Jiange gloomily as he licked his lips, wishing to continue. Yiye Jiange felt shy as she looked at the expression filled with tease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Really tasty!" Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange had already left his embrace but her face still had a faint blush: "Scoundrel!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at Muyun Qingge as she walked over with a smile. Qing Shui could sense from her expression that something inconvenient had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The 3rd Palace Master has arranged a feast and especially invited us." Muyun Qingge said as she walked over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Qing Shui has come. I won't go!" Yiye Jiange smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I also don't want to go, but since I've returned back after a long time, accompany me. Qing Shui can also come." Muyun Qingge sat down and looked towards them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui understood something when he saw them both.</span></p>
