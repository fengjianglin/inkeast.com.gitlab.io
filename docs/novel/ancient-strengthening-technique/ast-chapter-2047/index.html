 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui would have never expected that he would see this person here. The Phoenix God Organization... Shouldn't she be in the Dancing Phoenix Continent? He hadn't thought of her the last time he went back. This person’s appearance had made Qing Shui extremely surprised. To think that he had almost forgotten about her existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at her in astonishment. It was until when she walked right up before him and noticing that graceful fragrance that he finally got back to his senses, "Why are you here?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I heard that an Imperial Cuisine Hall is set up here and wanted to take a look. I hadn't expected that it was really you. Now, why are you here?" Wearing snow-white clothes with the phoenix print, she exuded a sacred aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unsurpassed beauty of a generation... Qing Shui didn't know how to describe her better. He felt that this term was insufficient to describe her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn't have any tainted thoughts about her. It wasn't that he didn't harbor those thoughts, but that he was ashamed and felt unworthy, like a beggar standing before a noble. He had an urge to escape, a feeling of inferiority, and there was also unease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was now very strong, but hadn't expected this loser mindset of his was still around. It could be that she was too outstanding. This was despite the fact that they had come into contact in the past. Qing Shui had saved her before and helped her detoxify a powerful aphrodisiac. However, he hadn't used the most direct method and back then, Qing Shui even hated himself for having such great medical skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they didn't go all the way, he had embraced her and touched some sensitive parts of her body. However, these had happened a very long time ago and after having experienced so many things since then, he had almost forgotten about the existence of such an unparalleled beauty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"All the Imperial Cuisine Halls you’d encounter in the future will belong to me. I want to set up Imperial Cuisine Halls all over the world. Do you want to come and help me? I'll pay you a salary." Qing Shui jokingly proposed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I have neither any medical skills nor can I cook. Unfortunately, I can't help you." Shen Huang quickly declined his offer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her smile was graceful and transcendence, yet seemingly holy and dignified. Qing Shui was attracted to that smile for a moment, but he quickly turned his head and said, “Why don’t we go inside and take a look at the place I swindled?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You swindled it?" Shen Huang smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Every place I go to, I wouldn’t know the people there nor do I wish to fork out money. In the past, there would be people who didn't know any better and would come to offend me, get beaten up, and then bring out a manor as compensation. This time around, someone had gifted it. I promised them to save a person. How about it? Not a bad deal, right?" Qing Shui smiled casually and recalled his story as they walked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There'd be countless people who'd be willing to gift you houses if someone of your ability were to speak up. Is there still a need to swindle?" Shen Huang asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"They fail to appreciate what is good for them. Young Miss has a good sense of judgment."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You've become a glib talker now." Shen Huang smiled, not appearing to be unhappy. A hint of a heartfelt smile appeared on the corner of her lips. She was very happy to see Qing Shui. Very happy, indeed. She had always remembered this man who had saved her. If it wasn't for him, she would probably not be in this world anymore. She might have chosen to commit suicide back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Young Miss, Have anyone told you before that you look very pretty when you smile? You should smile more and think about happy things more often. This world is actually wonderful."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Have I ever said that the world isn't wonderful?" Shen Huang asked calmly, looking at Qing Shui with her beautiful eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You didn't, but would you dare to say that it is?" Qing Shui replied. His spiritual sense was very sensitive and he could tell that this woman harbored a feeling of detesting the world, unable to see the good of this world. She would stand outside and not join in with the rest of the world. Although the feeling that she was giving off wasn't as strong as Tantai Lingyan, her heart wouldn't lose out to Tantai Lingyan in the least.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I dare to!" Shen Huang said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You dare to what?" Qing Shui continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I dare to say that this world is wonderful." Shen Huang said calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Can you share with me the three reasons that make you feel blessed? I'll believe you if you can." Qing Shui looked at her and urged on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang was stunned by his words. "Then, do you feel blessed? Do you think that the world is wonderful?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Of course. My mood is like this fine weather. I feel that this world is very great and wonderful."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang also knew that Qing Shui had led a tough life, traveling around without stopping. She couldn't understand and asked, "Then give me three reasons."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Pay attention. There are too many of them. Does having many wives count?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Coarse, but alright. That will count as one." Shen Huang didn't object.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I have playful sons and beautiful daughters. Does this count?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It does."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I have parents, my grandfather, uncle, and other relatives. I feel very warm being near them and they are very close to me. I feel great bliss to be with them..." Qing Shui stopped after saying this. He suddenly realized that he said the wrong things. It was fine to say anything but family and parents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way." Qing Shui said awkwardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I know. That is actually the greatest source of happiness. Treat them well. Don't end up regretting when you can no longer see them anymore after they are no longer around. We can't turn back many things in life and that yearning feeling makes one's heart ache. You must treasure what you have now." Shen Huang said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui tugged at her sleeves softly. She trembled, but didn't try to get out or pull away. Moreover, Qing Shui didn't take her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You actually have a lot of things and there are many people of all kinds in this world. All of them face life strongly, having anticipation for the next day, that tomorrow will be better." Qing Shui saw that Shen Huang was feeling down and his heart ached. However, she wasn't his woman. Otherwise, he'd be able to give her a hug to let her know that he was around. Even if she had lost everything, he would still be there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, Qing Shui held onto her sleeves to tell her that she must be strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I won't do anything rash. If I did, I would no longer be here ever since that day. Are we friends?" Shen Huang asked seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded affirmatively. "Of course. I've always treated you as a good friend and felt proud to have a beautiful friend like you. It's a great honor for me, being able to tell this to others."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang smiled, "Thank you. Now, I also have a reason to believe that the world is wonderful."</span></p>

It was actually very hard for some people to have a friend. Shen Huang was someone like that. Right now, Qing Shui still felt that this woman was like a puzzle. It was because her strength had gotten mysterious again and even stronger than that Liu Dongsheng. This made Qing Shui very astonished, but he didn't ask any further.</span></p>

You must remember that you have me as a friend. No matter what happens in the future, you must remember that I'll stand on your side. No matter who dares to bully you, I'll seek revenge from them, no matter how strong they are." Qing Shui encouraged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It's no wonder you have so many women and all of them treat you so well." Shen Huang had a slight chuckle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You still haven't said why you're here." Qing Shui rubbed his nose, feeling a little embarrassed as he tried to change the topic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There's an influence in the Northern Blue Domain called Phoenix. My name here is called Phoenix." Shen Huang smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I realized that I'd never been able to see through you completely. You're always so mysterious. Can you tell me how far away I am from you at the moment?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm actually very, very close to you, but you had never realized it. You'll always be my friend. No matter what I'm called, you can always call me Young Miss. I'll forever be the Young Miss that belongs only to you." Shen Huang looked at Qing Shui and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Young Miss, there’s something I want to confess." Qing Shui looked at Shen Huang and said seriously.</span></p>
