 <p><strong>AST 709 - Hai Dongqing, Soul Control</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s sudden move had caused many people to be shocked, at that moment, there was deafening silence that surrounded them.</p>
 <p>Hai Tian’s eyes had a trace of magnificent vigor after he had witnessed what Qing Shui did. He smiled without restraint, as he felt happy for the remaining members of the Hai Clan.</p>
 <p>“You dared to kill my fifth brother! You dared kill the people of my Luo Clan! Kill him!” A seemingly middle-aged man ordered to the other people of the Luo Clan after he had shouted at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>The Luo Clan members wielded their weapons and rushed towards Qing Shui. Amongst these people, only the elder that he killed a while ago had a decent strength, the rest of them were not even worth a glance.</p>
 <p>The two people that the Luo Clan had sent were the brothers of the Luo Clan’s clan head. Qing Shui had already killed one, the one who spoke earlier was the youngest brother amongst the siblings.</p>
 <p>At this moment, everyone from the Luo Clan rushed towards Qing Shui!</p>
 <p>“Let's attack too and kill them!”</p>
 <p>“That’s right, kill them!” The Hai Clan members shouted angrily.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The remaining people saw that Qing Shui confronted the enemy alone and wanted to offer their help to him. However, before they could even join him, Qing Shui held them back. “Just observe first and hold the lines, there is no need for everyone to take action. Consider this as my gift to Miss Dongqing!”</p>
 <p>After that, Qing Shui became like a tiger amongst a flock of sheep, his hands moved around like butterflies. Every time he attacked, someone would die. This could no longer be considered as killing, instead, it was an art.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing stood there in a daze with tears in her eyes. She gazed at Qing Shui’s figure as it moved back and forth, her heart felt exceptionally tranquil and comforted.</p>
 <p>She felt like she was pampered, this was the first time she experienced this feeling in her whole life. He said that when he had found the Immortal Fox, he would give her a present. Now, she realized that the present was not the Medicinal Pills, instead, this was the present that he intended to give her.</p>
 <p>Within this 15 minutes, it became incredibly silent!</p>
 <p>“Brothers of the Hai Clan, please put all of their corpses on the carriage outside and find someone to send them to the Luo Clan.” Qing Shui said as he thought of last night. He remembered that the Luo Clan had wanted to kill him, and even said they would kill them all earlier. Thus, he decided to be more vicious. There was no need for him to maintain cordiality, if he kept silent, they might think that he was easy to bully.</p>
 <p>Now that he had the abilities, it was fine for him to be arrogant to a certain degree. In order to be arrogant, one must have the abilities to back himself up first, or else he would end up in trouble.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s words had caused the members of the Hai Clan to erupt into cheers, they felt very unpleasant when they had been suppressed by the enemies to their death. If it was not for their determination and wisdom, they might have ended up leaving just like the other people.</p>
 <p>Everyone from the Luo Clan was killed, not a single one was spared. At this moment, Qing Shui slowly walked to Hai Dongqing. When she saw Qing Shui, she started to cry as she could no longer held it in.</p>
 <p>However, a splendid smile was still on her face, it was a smile full of melancholy and charm. If one would ever see it, they would feel extremely heartbroken at first but, they would lather realize the joy she had inside of her heart.</p>
 <p>“Come, let’s go and check out the Tu Clan.” Qing Shui smiled at Hai Dongqing.</p>
 <p>However, Hai Dongqing just threw herself into Qing Shui’s embrace and could not help herself but to cry. During these days, she had been restrained to the extreme, then suddenly, she discovered someone who was willing to shoulder all of these for her.</p>
 <p>Especially when they came and she saw the carriages, she felt as if needles had pricked her heart. Although her expression did not change, she felt deep inside her that she was trapped at the boundaries of life and death.</p>
 <p>She hugged Qing Shui’s neck tightly, just like a drowning person holding onto someone who had saved her.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not expect this to happen, he always thought that she was a very resilient woman. But now he knew, that even a very resilient woman would have her weak moments, furthermore, she was still a girl.</p>
 <p>He gently patted the back of this devastatingly beautiful woman in his arms, he would be lying if Qing Shui denied did not have any feelings about it. However, Qing Shui had forced himself to not have any stray thoughts, he did his best to think of her helplessness and hesitations. This way, his thoughts would not go astray..</p>
 <p>“It’s already fine, if you keep crying like that then you won’t look pretty anymore……”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not know what to say, so he could only attempt to console Hai Dongqing in a half-joking manner.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing hugged Qing Shui tightly, as though she wanted to melt into his body. She did not know how much this had tested Qing Shui’s determination.</p>
 <p>That soft and flexible body was glued on to Qing Shui tightly. A faint fragrance had entered his nose while her breasts pressed onto to him, these provoked him to had some wicked thoughts and be restless. He could feel the emotions of Hai Dongqing, he just hugged her back tightly and made no sound, as he tried to gave her his warmth.</p>
 <p>After many breaths of time, Hai Dongqing gently pushed Qing Shui away, she blushed as she said: “Thank you!”</p>
 <p>“Feeling better?”</p>
 <p>“En, I’m fine now!”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“They indeed have fooled around with each other. If I was that man, even if I died, it would be worth it.” A youth amongst the Tu Clan members said in a daze as he watched Qing Shui and Hai Dongqing.</p>
 <p>“Stop being stupid. This kind of woman is trouble, a regular man would not be able to handle it.” An old man said as he shook his head and sighed.</p>
 <p>“I know, that's why I said that I would be satisfied if I could just have her for one day.” The youth answered while still in a daze.</p>
 <p>The old man shook his head speechlessly!</p>
 <p>“Fourth Uncle, do you think that the Luo Clan can bring this woman away?” Another youth asked the old man.</p>
 <p>“Stop brooding about those things, just think about whether if we are able to leave this place alive today.” The old man frowned even more.</p>
 <p>“Would he attack us, the Tu Clan?” The youth looked incredulously at the old man.</p>
 <p>“Why wouldn’t he dare?” The old man shook his head and turned away, as he looked towards Qing Shui and Hai Dongqing, who had walked towards them.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the Hai Clan disciples who had moved the corpses of the Luo Clan members returned. Every one of them had an excited expression, as what had happened earlier made them all feel hot-blooded .</p>
 <p>“Sir and Miss, we have completed the task that was ordered.” A middle-aged Hai Clan male had bowed and said.</p>
 <p>“Great, wait for me to finish off the members of the Tu Clan first. If the Luo Clan’s old man does not come out, then we will go to the Luo Clan.” Qing Shui smiled and nodded gently at the middle-aged man.</p>
 <p>“We will obey Sir’s instructions!” The middle-aged man withdrew happily after he replied.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Hai Dongqing walked over to the Tu Clan members in a composed manner. He smiled gently at them, this smile had caused many of the Tu Clan members to tremble.</p>
 <p>This man had killed tens of the Luo Clan members without blinking just awhile ago and was not even stained with their blood, his current demeanor had caused them to feel a chill.</p>
 <p>“The Tu Clan right? Coming to the Hai Clan to show off your might?” Qing Shui spoke to the tall and sturdy man.</p>
 <p>“This matter is between the Tu Clan and the Hai Clan, I advise sir to not interfere so as to not get into any trouble. If you leave now, I can let you go.” Tu Gang frowned as he spoke to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Brother, wait for a moment!”</p>
 <p>At this moment, a pleasant voice that had a certain charm to it was heard, which had caused his body to not be able to utilize any strength.</p>
 <p>“Heartstring Enticement, a technique to control the spirit?” Qing Shui’s spirit energy was sufficiently strong, so there were no changes. But many people had entered into a drunk-like state.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quietly lamented about the strength of this technique, this voice had the effect of controlling the soul, as long as one heard her voice and their spirit energy could not resist it, they would be charmed to an idiotic state. If it were stronger, it might even be able to cause the target to permanently turn into a fool, as though the soul was taken away.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui glanced in the direction of the voice and saw a woman. He was not able to guess her age, she was dressed in black clothes and had a strange glow to her. She appeared as though she was a spirit of the night in this gloomy Cold Ice City. Below her feet was a pair of snow-white boots that made her black dress seemed even brighter.</p>
 <p>Her figure was as enchanting as the devil's, when contrasted with the black dress, her skin appeared to be even more snow white. She had soft black hair, slender neck, and eyes as dark as onyx, her nose was as elegant as white jade. She had a faint smile that seemed gently, giving off a boundless charm.</p>
 <p>This was a female that was in between a woman and a girl, she had the charm of a matured woman but the spirit and refreshing aura of a girl.</p>
 <p>“Big Miss Tu Ling!”</p>
 <p>After a period of time, people start to wake up and greeted her.</p>
 <p>Just a casual word from her that was not directed at anyone had caused such an effect, Qing Shui carefully circulated his Nature Energy to its peak.</p>
 <p>“Hello, I am Tu Ling!” The girl’s charming voice resounded, directed at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>In that instant, Qing Shui felt his thoughts got distracted, but very soon, his Nature Energy broke the spell. At the same time, the Yin-Yang Image in his sea of consciousness spun faster.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not conceal that moment of distraction, he even dragged it out longer. He turned his head to look at this woman called Tu Ling.</p>
 <p>“Sir, if you withdraw, I can agree to any of your conditions, alright?” The girl said to Qing Shui again, her voice seemed even more enticing.</p>
 <p>A ‘soul controlling’ energy that was stronger than earlier rushed at Qing Shui but his Nature Energy and Yin-Yang Image had resisted it.</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui knew that this woman already had started her attack towards him. If his spirit energy was insufficient, he would have been bewitched by her, that would probably be the time she would make her killing move.</p>
 <p>“Sir, how about I dance for you!”</p>
 <p>The charm in this girl’s voice increased again, at the same time, without waiting for Qing Shui to answer, she sky walked and started dancing in the air at about half a person’s height.</p>
 <p>Her dance did not seem flirtatious or wanton but instead, it caused people to felt that it was pretty, a spirit-shaking pretty dance that would cause one to slowly descend into the ‘world’ she had established</p>
 <p>Spirit Slaying dance!</p>
