Qing Shui was stunned for a moment, before turning to Xiyue Kun. Treasure maps in the Nine Continents were extremely mystical, if you had the map, the treasure would not be lost, as one needed to find the treasury to be able to locate the treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the treasury was still intact, then it meant that the treasure within were untouched, but what puzzled Qing Shui was that under normal circumstances, there would be no samaritans who would obediently give up treasure maps, as upon obtaining these maps they would go ahead and collect the treasure. Qing Shui felt that it was dubious that the treasure map was recently discovered and an expedition had yet to be organized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Noticing the puzzling look in Qing Shui’s gaze, Xiyue Lun smilingly proclaimed: “ We do know the location that this treasure map is pointing to, but are washing our hands off this business as it is too dangerous and risky. You are different from us, we cannot work with others on this. Though the Xiyue Clan is decent in Linhai City, we have very few capable people, so if exposed, we might have to pay for carrying jade, losing far more than we would gain. As for you, as a Miraculous Physician, I believe there are more than a few powers willing to work for you.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiyue Lun’s words were very concise and obvious, and was a true testament to the situation. Qing Shui smiled as he opened the treasure map, pinpointing the location of the treasury to be at the&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Kunpeng Mountain is the massive local mountain range, the largest in the vicinity, with the exception of the Ice Ocean City. It was also famed for being an extremely vicious and dangerous place, with rumors even citing the existence of Kun Peng&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the depths of the northern sea lies a fish, its name is Kun. The Kun’s vastness spans thousands of li. Transforming into a bird, its name is Peng. Peng’s width, spanning an unknown thousands of li. In its fury, its wings encompass and squash down the heaven’s clouds. As a bird, it traverses the seas to the southern dephs, an inhabitant of the southern depths, an inhabitant of the heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuang zi had never told of the northern depths’ vastness, but a single fish spanning thousands of li, the immensity of the water’s surface could only be imagined. Kun is a massive fish living in the northern sea; Peng was a giant bird that was transformed from a Kun, both were similarly large, with backs as vast as Mount Tai, its wings encompassing the heaven’s clouds, the world that the Kun Peng lived in was a massive, boundless one. The Roc could send water flying three thousand li, a single flap giving it ninety thousand li of majesty and momentum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Kun Peng was a true roc, an existence that was in no way inferior to dragons or phoenixes. In his previous life, Qing Shui found the legends of the Kun Peng unimaginable, that a bird could be that immense, but upon arriving on the Nine Continents, Qing Shui had even seen dragons, such as the lady and her Giant Azure Dragon, spanning thousands of metres, while the Kun Peng’s back was akin to a mountain. Though this was slightly exaggerated, Qing Shui believed that the Kun Peng should already be one of the largest kinds of Demonic Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The treasury was located deep within Kun Peng Mountain. Qing Shui believed that they had to have tried entering, after all, no one would bear to give away a treasure map without trying. However, Qing Shui did not bother about such details, he was still very excited, after all, he had once found three treasure maps, with the Emperor’s Qi being one of the extremely formidable abilities obtained from one of the maps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui kept the treasure map and said smilingly:” Then I shan’t be too courteous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is only natural, there will be many times when we to trouble Mister Qing, if Mister Qing has any need for the Xiyue Clan, you need only ask. If we are capable of accomplishing the task, we would definitely not refuse.” The Xiyue Clan perfectly described its stance, without drawing suspicion or overly flattering others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, nodding his head before leaving, a mutually beneficial relationship, as long as they were able to bring out something that could move him, he was not against helping them out. After all, he needed to work with these powers, to allow him to obtain resources that would move him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Imperial Cuisine Hall had gotten on the right track, its influence expanding, with rich and powerful people visiting each day as food, since time immemorial, has always been&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The food Qing Shui ate here was not any less addictive than smoking cigarettes in his past life, even if some strong cultivators didn’t eat for a while, they would begin pining for it, just like how they pined for women.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, not eating would not cause any problems for strong cultivators, with no side effects like depression. The Imperial Cuisine Hall had a limit on the amount one could buy, first come first served, while those who came late would have nothing. Trying to save up the amount one could buy was impossible, while reselling it was equally an impossibility, unless one was willing to give up the small amount they could buy themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Imperial Cuisine Hall had already become a unique existence, but there were definitely those who were not pleased by this development, such as the Hua Clan and the Zheng Clan, and now the two were together in careful discussion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Zheng Yuan, you’ve already seen the rise of the Imperial Cuisine Hall. At this rate, there would be no place for our two clans on Linhai Street.” An old man from the Hua Clan told another elegant, scholarly old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The rise of the Imperial Cuisine Hall is inevitable and cannot be stopped, Old Brother Hua, let’s just endure it.” The old man sighed</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Endure it, he wasted my Hua Clan’s descendant, and now the whole world knows about it, where should I hide my face then.” The Hua Clan old man said, exasperated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hua Old Brother, perhaps this is unpleasant to hear, but you should be clear on the sheer number of atrocities that kid from your clan has committed, just that no one dares to say anything out of fear for the Hua Clan. This might even allow your Hua Clan to have greater longevity.” Zheng Yuan shook his head while saying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m really unwilling, Old brother, you have to help me.” the old man from the Hua Clan looked at Zheng Yuan, a surge of unwillingness and reluctance in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are some things that doesn’t require one to do themselves, don’t force yourself down a narrow path.” Zheng Yuan sighed, before telling the old man from the Hua Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old Brother, your meaning is?”The old man from the Hua Clan knew that Zheng Yuan was famous for his intellect, his wit even exceeding that one from the Hua Clan, getting rid of his enemies without even having to lift a finger, this old man’s ploy of borrowing a knife to kill was legendary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Linhai City’s first prince Lan Lingfeng, he is proud and arrogant, his strength is pretty good, but once he hears of anyone stronger than him, he would go and spar with them, regardless of whether it’s cultivation or other matters, you can let them probe each other, then you would be able to retreat and advance freely, without falling into a state of passivity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then how should I go about letting them fight?”The Hua Clan old man asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lan Lingfeng has always liked Ziche Sha, if anyone dared to get just a little close with her, it would be equivalent to touching his reverse scale</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">, Ziche Sha’s father has been afflicted with a quirky disease for a long time now, they have long given up on treating it, if you can convince the Ziche Clan to invite the Imperial Cuisine Hall to treat him, if he is treated, ZIche Sha would definitely be grateful towards Qing Shui, and as Linhai City and the Imperial Capital’s number one beauty, something untoward would definitely happen then.” Zheng Yuan casually stated, making the Hua Clan old man feel as if it could work.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Goodbye old brother, I’ll go make the preparations”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Remember to ensure that the Lan Clan and the Imperial Cuisine Hall completely fall out, with these two tigers duking it out, then we can fish for the benefits, if we allow the Imperial Cuisine Hall to get closer with the Lan Clan, then we would be doing others a favour.” Zheng Yuan reminded him.</span></p>
