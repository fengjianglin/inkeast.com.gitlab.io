 <p><strong>AST 1347 - Attitude of the Puyang Clan, False God Tribulation</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The old woman felt really curious looking at Qing Shui. If it had been other doctors or alchemists, she definitely wouldn’t feel anything. But Qing Shui was different. The old woman was still particularly astonished with the change in Puyang Qing.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Even though there was a huge gap in strength, she wondered if his medical expertise would have effect on her False God Grade. Despite not knowing, she was still willing to give it a try. Even if it meant only to witness the medical expertise of this young man, she also felt the need to try it.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“What do you need me to do?” The old woman looked at Qing Shui with a smile.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“I need you to be very confident. If even you yourself don’t have that sort of strong desire, even if you have taken in divine pills or unique medicines, it would still be useless. I can tell that you seemed to have seen through life and death. That way, the effect brought about from me helping you would be a lot smaller.” Qing Shui needed her strong desire to seek survival.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The old woman remained silent. Actually, just like what Qing Shui said, she didn’t really weigh life and death very heavily. So much so that she had already planned to live her remaining life quietly.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>All powerful warriors were lonely. For people like Headmaster Sui and Headmaster Cao who were close like brothers, inseparable and also like-minded with each other, it was already considered a sort of blessing. A lot of people might have seemed like they had a lot of friends, in actuality, they didn’t feel that great deep inside.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“I can tell that you have yet again stumbled upon another bottleneck of your grade. Don’t you want to breakthrough and have a look at it?” Qing Shui was telling the truth. It was just that he didn’t know what grade it was. After all, he had no idea on what kind of strength and grade came after False God Warriors.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Huh, you are actually able to tell that I have reached a bottleneck. Actually, I am at the bottleneck for Grade One False God. If I want to breakthrough to Grade Two False God, I will have to go through False God Tribulation once again.”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“False God Tribulation?” Qing Shui asked confused. He really wanted to ask the old woman questions regarding False God Realm. But he felt that this was somewhat rude. But seeing an opportunity now, he naturally wouldn’t let it pass.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Yes, False God also consisted of ten levels. In other words, it has ten grades, just like Martial Emperor, Martial Saint and Martial King. For the first few grades, one would only have to break through the bottleneck to achieve the next grade. As for False God, it is a bit different. To break through each time, one would need to experience False God Tribulation. Once they succeeded in making it through the False God Tribulation only then would they be able to break through to another grade. If they were to fail it, the only thing which awaited them would be death. Hence, a lot of people wouldn’t want to continue breaking through once they reached False God Grade. If they were to fail, they would disappear right away,” the old woman explained slowly.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Is False God Tribulation really formidable?” Qing Shui was very curious.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Warriors at False God grade would have to break through the existing obstacles if they want to break through to the next grade. And at the moment when they broke through the barriers, it would trigger a few unusual phenomenons across heaven and earth. The majority of people would trigger Heavenly Thunder. Grade One would trigger Grade One Heavenly Thunder. Grade Two would trigger Grade Two Heavenly Thunder. Compared to the Grade One Heavenly Thunder, it was even thicker and it lasts even longer.”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Is the False God Tribulation the same for every False God Warrior?”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“They are all different. But there is one thing which is similar, the stronger the person is, the more powerful the unusual phenomenon will be. As for how frightening it is, even I myself am not clear about it.” The old woman seemed like she was looking forward to see it, talking up to this point.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Will there be a significant increase in strength every time a person breaks through a level?” Qing Shui said with a smile.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“This is related to the strength of the person who broke through to False God Realm. For someone who broke through to False God at a strength worth three hundred thousand sun, compared to those with strength worth four and five hundred thousand sun, there is a large difference between them. Furthermore, following the False God Tribulation, the difference in the increase in strength will also widen.”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Oh, so this is the case. Well then, please allow me to help you attempt it!”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Alright!” The old woman smiled and nodded.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Puyang Qing quickly took over the little girl from the old woman. After that, the three of them made their ways towards the living room. They also didn’t say much. They just got into the main topic right away.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui first helped the old woman perform Constitution Nurturing. After that, he helped release the impurities and filthy substances from her body. He also helped heal some of her unmentionable diseases. Even though breaking through to False God might help heal a bit of the unmentionable diseases and purify some of the filthy substances and impurities, when all was said and done, the old woman had still lived for a long period of time. There would definitely be a huge amount of filthy substances and impurities within her. False God warriors might have been powerful but the impurities within their bodies came in even larger amounts compared to that of Martial Emperors.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Drop after drop of black liquid dripped down. To his surprise, an amount worth almost a small cup of tea has been accumulated. At the moment when Qing Shui stopped, Puyang Qing held up the small cup and went to sort it out.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The little girl was playing outside. After all, it’s better to not let children see the scene of acupuncture treatments.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>At the moment when the first drop of impurity got removed from her body, a fresh aura emerged from within her body. Even though it was very weak, it was very distinct. It was just like her vital force awakening slightly. That was a kind of life force. At this moment, hope once again lit within her. She was even thinking about aiming for Grade Two False God.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>At the moment when a lot of the impurities within her body were removed, she had come to fully believe Qing Shui’s words. This young man truly possessed extremely terrifying medical expertise. Any clan who could make friends with a doctor like him was the clan’s luck. After all, for a powerful warrior to be able to live up an additional a thousand years…… This sort of benefits…...</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Not only had her vitality become more powerful, she also looked even younger. Or rather, it was a kind of spirit. The old woman still looked very old and serene. But she seemed like she has had one more additional spirit energy added to her, just like a kind of spiritual movement.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The old woman noticed that her strength had become even more stable. She only smiled after quite a while, “Just your medical expertise alone is already enough to help you rush headlong across the continent. Given time, with just one word from you, there will be countless people coming to fight for you.”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Granny, you must be joking.” Qing Shui shook his head.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“No, I mean it. But the precondition is that you need to showcase your abilities. But it would be best that you have huge strength at your disposal to act as a deterrence,” the old woman replied.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Yes, I am also trying hard to raise my strength. Qing Shui now also understood this saying.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Forging skill, medical expertise, cooking skill and more, all of these weren’t Qing Shui’s goal. They were all only his methods. Methods for becoming a strong warrior. Or else, he would rather only make his friends and close relatives food. Also, the good stuff within the blacksmith store.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The reason why the old woman valued Qing Shui so highly was because Qing Shui had helped her increased her lifespan a lot. Even if he conserved his energy, it was still worth not less than eight hundred years.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The lifespan of False God was already considered to be really long. They could live up to five thousand years. Unfortunately, almost everyone was unable to live up to three thousand years old. Furthermore, this was still after they had eaten all of the consumable medicinal pills which helped increased lifespans.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui had already been conservative by helping her increase her lifespan by eight hundred years. Originally, he never even planned to help her increase by that much. But for a moment, he didn’t manage to restrain himself. Ordinary warriors, other than those at Xiantian Realm, would hardly be affected. The higher up they progressed, the less they would have. For State Master Grades, normally, they could only live up to half of their lifespan and they would have been considered to have run out of life. Similarly, for False Gods, most of them could also only live up to half of it.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui on the other hand, if he operated all of his strength, he should be able to help increase an overall 80% of lifespan for a person. That’s the maximum amount. Any more than that and he wouldn’t be able to achieve it even with his medical expertise.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Qing`Er, no matter how things turn out in the future, this person will always be Puyang Clan’s friend and a benefactor. No matter what he does,” the old man looked at Puyang Qing and said.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Old Ancestor, Qing`Er will keep it in mind.” Puyang Qing was also an old man in his sixties. But compared to the granny, there was a huge gap between their seniority.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Granny, the little brat has now arranged betrothal of minors with my son. No matter how things turn out in the future, I hope that other than friends, we can still end up as relatives by marriage.” Qing Shui smiled. Simultaneously, deep down, he also knew that the old man was trying to declare his position.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Alright, Zhengming has great veins and bones. Judging from her look, I can tell that in the future, she will achieve great things and everything will go smoothly for her in her life. “The old man stood up looked out the window at Puyang Zhengming who was playing.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Granny, I have two medicinal pills with me here. I am wondering if they will be of use to people at your strength?” Qing Shui handed over two porcelain bottles. They were Ren and Du Duo Meridians Strengthening Pill.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Alright, I will give it a try once I find the time to do it.” The old woman put them carefully away right after she accepted them.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Oh yes, use it when you want to break through your current grade. It shall be of help to you. At the moment when you take them, it is best if you make the preparations for breaking through your current grade,” Qing Shui thought about something and said seriously.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Thank you mister!”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Granny, at the very least, we are considered friends! I am your junior, why don’t you call me Qing Shui?”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Well then, I will put down the formality. Qing Shui, I have to thank you for helping Qing`Er, if you hadn’t helped him, it was basically hopeless for him to break through to the False God Level.”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>They shared a conversation with each other. At noon, the group had lunch right in the old woman’s room.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Granny, how is Yehuang Clan?” Qing Shui hesitated for a while and said.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The old woman thought for a while, “it should be quite ordinary. There are a lot of clans like this. They are all the same. Yehuang Clan should be really powerful in Yehuang Country.”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The old woman gave Qing Shui a strange look at the time when she finished speaking.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Granny, how strong is Dancing Phoenix Continent City? It is said that the continent city is a lot more powerful than Yehuang Country.” Qing Shui had heard Yehuang Duzui and Yehuang Duxing say before about there being powerful forces which could easily eliminate Yehuang Clan.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“The continent city is one of the most powerful spots in a continent. There isn’t even a single Grade Two False God warrior in Yehuang Country.”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Granny, do you know anything about the Demon Lord from Demon Lord Palace? How strong is she?” The woman has turned enemy with an entire continent. It was likely that she might be very powerful. Also, the divine turtle and her Demon Lord Palace, just how strong were they?</strong></p>
 <p><strong>This time, the old woman didn’t seem to feel particularly curious. She also didn’t really ask Qing Shui anything. She only spoke gently, “The Demon Lord Palace is very powerful. So is the woman. She should be equal in strength with the most powerful person in Dancing Phoenix Continent. Most importantly, that divine turtle of hers is infinitely powerful.”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The old woman didn’t say much. Despite this, Qing Shui still managed to understand a few things about it. It was not that easy for people to face off against her.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>……</strong></p>
 <p><strong>By the time Qing Shui returned to Imperial Cuisine Hall, it was already halfway through the afternoon. His visit this time to Puyang Clan had helped him gain a lot. He was still a long way ahead from helping the woman. Other than that, it was that the person whom his mother missed also seemed to be really powerful. For all of these, he would only have the ability to investigate them once he achieved Eighth Heavenly Layer and became a False God Warrior.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Cultivate, researching on cooking, refining demons, magic weapons, drawings and also training a swarm of Jade Emperor Bees. Qing Shui also looked through the Nine Yang Pharmacopoeia to see if he could find any medicinal pills which helped raise the grade of his Spiritual Medicinal Beasts.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The days just went past like this. Unknowingly, half a year had passed.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>To other people, half a year was just like a snap of the fingers. But to Qing Shui, it wasn’t the same. He spent his six months very efficiently. It was just that halfway through it, he would still head back to Qing Clan. He would use the Ren and Du Meridian Strengthening Pills and Yang Pill to help raise their strength. Certainly, only a minority of people could use Yang Pills.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Luan Luan was one of them. She was one of those who was improving the fastest. The Ren and Du Duo Meridians Strengthening Pill was considered to have provided Luan Luan with a significant improvement. In the future, her strength was bound to continue rising and become even more terrifying.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Wenren Wu-shuang had also come out of her seclusion. Her strength also skyrocketed. Her body physique was very similar to Yehuang Guwu’s but they were also not entirely the same. Ever since the last time when Qing Shui performed Duo Cultivation and awakened her body physique, her formidable bones and veins ability had finally displayed their prominence.</strong></p>
