 <p><strong>AST 1291 - The Beaten Up Qing Shui, The Daring Woman</strong></p>
 <p>In another word, Qing Shui felt incomparably happy as this step was a very crucial one. Although he managed to achieve it while he was muddle-headed, he didn’t really mind it that much. He just felt really lucky that it happened to him. If he had known the importance and difficulty of the huge gate of Heavenly Dao, Qing Shui might not have been able to achieve it so quickly. This could also be considered as a case of reaping benefits from a garden where there was nothing sowed in there.</p>
 <p>At the moment, the most important thing he needs to do was to quickly make his Five Elements Divine Flag ascend a grade. Since there was such thing as the Five Elements Divine Flag, Qing Shui felt that other people who traveled around the World of the Nine Continents should possess similar things as well. Maybe they might not be that powerful yet, for example, they might only be able to travel back and forth within a continent. However, this would still help them save up a lot of time.</p>
 <p>It was fine even if he could only set up one checkpoint for now. Unfortunately, it doesn’t have any grade at the moment. Qing Shui wanted to make both his and the woman’s Five Elements Divine Flag to be able to set up one checkpoint each. Naturally, he would set up his flag around the five continents and he hoped that the woman would set up her flag in the Western Oxhe Continent. He might be able to convince her about this.</p>
 <p>Even though this plan might sound a bit unfair, he still hoped for things to turn out this way. Most importantly, these two flags still had the function to allow them to reach each other almost instantly.</p>
 <p>If she could set up her checkpoint at the Western Oxhe Continent and Qing Shui set up his at the five continents, by the time Qing Shui felt like coming back from the five continents while the woman also happened to be in it, Qing Shui could first make the woman return to the Western Oxhe Continent. The reason being that that was where she set up her checkpoint on. Qing Shui on the other hand, could just use the function of the flag, which transferred the ‘husband and wife’ to be together, to arrive by her side in the Western Oxhe Continent.</p>
 <p>However, these were all only ideas which Qing Shui thought about as the woman might choose to set up her checkpoint at the three continents. She might even made him be the one to set up his checkpoint on the Western Oxhe Continent.</p>
 <p>…………...</p>
 <p>Both Yu Ruyan and Tantai Xuan had already prepared the meal. Even though the woman was currently with them, the atmosphere around the place was still relatively relaxed. The two girls would still address the woman as ‘Master’, but they seemed to be more like sisters instead. Sometimes, the informalities they shared with each other made them looked that they were real sisters.</p>
 <p>“Martial Aunt, if your Five Elements Divine Flag happens to achieve its first grade during this time, where do you plan to set up your checkpoint?” Qing Shui felt the need to ask her about this.</p>
 <p>“I have read a few records about the Five Elements Divine Flag. It seems that the checkpoint for a first grade Five Elements Divine Flag can only be set up at around the five continents.” The woman said with a smile after a few thoughts.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. It could only be set up around the five continents, it seemed like it will be impossible for him to set up checkpoints at around the three continents. In fact, the grade which it needed to set up a checkpoint in the three continents was already quite high.</p>
 <p>“Is that so? It seems like I won’t be able to just go wherever I want for a long time.” Qing Shui said in a slightly upset tone.</p>
 <p>“Take it slowly. Cultivation is a really crucial thing. Once your strength has increased, you can let the demonic beasts with remarkable abilities lend you a hand. This way, even though it may take some time, it is still a way that will work.” The woman could feel that Qing Shui was a bit depressed. She opened her mouth and tried to comfort him.</p>
 <p>“Alright. How long will Martial Aunt stay on the Western Oxhe Continent?” Qing Shui asked after he thought for a while.</p>
 <p>“I think I will be staying here for quite a while. This time, I managed to take advantage of you and step across the gate towards Heavenly Dao. I am planning to bring Ruyan and Xuan`Er back tomorrow. They should be able to experience a significant boost in strength.” The woman said happily.</p>
 <p>“Oh, that will be great too!”</p>
 <p>After their dinner, they started to chat with each other while drinking tea as the sky slowly grew dark.</p>
 <p>“Master, let’s sleep together tonight.” Tantai Xuan said happily.</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui immediately spurted out his tea. After that, he awkwardly wiped his mouth.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan looked at Qing Shui, confused. Right at this moment, the woman shot a glare at him. “Have you started to think about something else? Can two women not sleep together?”</p>
 <p>“Of course you can……”</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan wanted to say something, but before she managed to do so, Qing Shui opened his mouth and proceeded to say, “Ruyan, there is something I would like to tell you.”</p>
 <p>Both Tantai Xuan and the woman left, both Yu Ruyan and Qing Shui sent them off. They would be leaving tomorrow, and Qing Shui wouldn’t just let her go like that. Naturally, Yu Ruyan was aware of what was going on, she immediately blushed as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui grabbed Yu Ruyan as soon as he closed the door. “Ruyan, let’s have some fun together.”</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan, “......”</p>
 <p>“Let’s not do it, my master is here!” Yu Ruyan tried to object against it in a soft tone. At this very moment, Qing Shui was already carrying her to their bed.</p>
 <p>“It’s no use no matter who is here. This is a matter of paramount importance, let’s only talk about the other things once we finished having our fun. Hm, your body is already starting to react this way and yet, you’re telling me you don’t want to do it?” Qing Shui smiled as he grabbed her perky breast. He was trying to savor that soft feel of her twin peaks.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan knew that it was no use no matter what she said. She really missed Qing Shui as well and even had the thought that at this very moment, she had changed slightly. She actually found it to be enjoyable and really comfortable.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui kissed her face, mouth, nose, eyes, ears and her neck……</p>
 <p>After that, he violently suckled her pink nipples on her snow-white breasts. Yu Ruyan’s soft breasts were very plump and firm. Compared to before, it has gotten even more fully rounded. It felt extremely smooth and bouncy and there was even a faint, fragrant smell to it. Even just looking at her breasts could make others be in a daze.</p>
 <p>While sucking on her one of her nipples, Qing Shui felt a comfortable sensation that was hard to describe in words. With his other hand, he toyed with her other snow-white, soft breast and was constantly kneading it</p>
 <p>A soft and very sexy gasp that could shake through one’s core could be heard.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>At the moment when Qing Shui suckled Yu Ruyan’s pinkish breast, the body of the woman who was in another building trembled. Aside from being shocked, she helplessly whispered with complicated thoughts, “This darned telepathy……”</p>
 <p>“Master, are you alright?” Tantai Xuan felt that the woman’s expression changed.</p>
 <p>“I’m fine. Let’s go sleep. You guys are going to seclude yourself and start cultivating tomorrow.”</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan didn’t feel anything particularly strange about it, nor did she find anything suspicious. She just covered herself with blankets after she made a sound of agreement.</p>
 <p>The woman, on the other hand, leaned on her side with her back facing Tantai Xuan. At this moment, she experienced that particular feeling of horniness more and more strongly.</p>
 <p>Her situation was almost similar to Tantai Xuan in the past. However, she was aware that this time, it had something to do with the Five Elements Divine Flag. She felt that she was where Yu Ruyan was at the moment. That sensation was constantly being transmitted to her body clearly, she clenched her teeth with all of her force to endure it.</p>
 <p>However, she wasn’t able to endure the strange feeling no matter how much she tried to do so.</p>
 <p>After that, she immediately decided to head over to Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan’s bed.</p>
 <p>Both Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan were now in a state of so much pleasure that they didn’t mind if they die. Furthermore, Yu Ruyan was in a very dominant position and had her eyes slightly closed. Even if Qing Shui let her be the one to lead, she would still have her eyes closed. Qing Shui on the other hand, preferred to have his eyes opened. He really enjoyed looking at Yu Ruyan’s beautiful figure at the moment.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui felt really strange when he sensed the fluctuation caused by the Five Elements Divine Flag. After that, he immediately saw an enchanting woman, who was in her pajamas, appeared on the bed.</p>
 <p>The woman didn’t make any noise. Qing Shui looked at her with both of his eyes widely opened. Meanwhile, Yu Ruyan didn’t notice anything as she had her back facing the woman.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s powerful weapon was thrusting in and out at a moderate pace. At that moment, he felt extremely shocked by what the woman did next. She actually extended her white hand and grabbed Qing Shui’s balls…..</p>
 <p>The only thing which was on his mind at the moment was that the Five Elements Divine Flag could inflict harm on people. Why didn’t he think that things would turn out this way back then? How could he possibly do anything similar in the future? Under this kind of circumstances where someone would suddenly pop up out of nowhere, if it had been someone else, they would have been scared to the point that their weapon would soften.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt a bit of pain and quickly asked for forgiveness with his eyes. This woman was truly extremely weird. She immediately told Qing Shui silently with her lips that he must end it quickly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly nodded his head. His life treasure was laying in someone else’s hand. This was the first time he felt so embarrassed and worn-out.</p>
 <p>And just as the martial aunt was leaving, she even flicked his balls once. This made Qing Shui’s heart thump. After that, the woman left swiftly, her body posture was very demon-like but looked really graceful at the same time. He knew that the woman was very powerful, it seemed that he had truly underestimated her.</p>
 <p>However before she left, Qing Shui quickly initiated.. He caressed her plump ass as he let out a light moan. The woman who just went out felt her body turning soft. She blushed as she cursed in her heart. “You little beast!”</p>
 <p>Despite her reminder, Qing Shui still continued on for an hour before he finally shot his load. Yu Ruyan was now already sleeping with a face full of satisfaction but Qing Shui was still not sleepy yet. He put on his clothes quietly and walked out of the room.</p>
 <p>The instant he was out, he spotted a figure at the top of a roof of a nearby building. That was none other than the martial aunt, and she was now clad in her pyjamas. Qing Shui sped over but as he neared, he noticed a look of extreme satisfaction on the woman’s face, along with a slight blush. This was an expression only women would made at the peak of their climax.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also spotted some moisture at her private area...</p>
 <p>“What are you looking at? Did you know what just happened?” The woman asked grumpily.</p>
 <p>“Well, I never really thought about this. What shall I do now?” Qing Shui felt really upset right now. The incident with Tantai Xuan from last time had already upset him enough. Now, the same thing had repeated once again with her master.</p>
 <p>Actually, Qing Shui was still unable to come back to his senses. This woman had actually used her hands to touch him just now. He couldn’t totally comprehend it and even until now, he couldn’t understand what was going on.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, I will stop blaming you for it. You’re the one who brought me into the huge gate of Heavenly Dao. But you need to make sure you treat Xuan`Er and Ruyan well.” The woman looked at Qing Shui. They were less than one inch away from each other.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know if it was because Tantai Xuan told her about her prior experience. But in any case, she would find out sooner or later. Hence, he nodded and tried to avoid the woman’s beautiful eyes. This old demoness made Qing Shui felt really conflicted in his mind. He didn’t understand why she came. That horny feeling would have disappeared when he left tomorrow and they are very far away from each other. Why would she go to his room and even touched his d*ck? Not only that, it was even at the time when he was doing it with Yu Ruyan with every scene playing out vividly before her eyes.</p>
 <p>The woman then went back to her room. Qing Shui looked at her as she disappeared from his sight. This was an exceptionally beautiful and pure demoness who couldn’t be measured simply with ordinary human thoughts. She was a mature and daring woman.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also returned to his room. He looked at the sky and right away went into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>By stepping into the Heavenly Dao, Qing Shui’s body, which initially felt like a full bottle, currently felt like an empty bucket. Hence, he was now able to refine the feedback strength provided by the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. As he thought about it, he got very agitated. The breakthrough to the huge gate of Heavenly Dao was going to be one of the large turning points in his life.</p>
 <p>Once this happened, there would no longer be anyone in the Western Oxhe Continent who would be able to stop him. As for the Desolate Sect and the barbarians, Qing Shui felt that they were nothing to be worried about.</p>
 <p>With the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui was able to refine the Five Elements Divine Flag many more times.</p>
 <p>But this time, he needed to absorb the energy. He sort of assumed that the process would take up a few days or more, but he wasn’t really afraid of this. If he could manage to set up a checkpoint with his Five Elements Divine Flag, he would head off to the five continents earlier to visit his family. It would be even better if the Five Elements Divine Flag could bring along people with it upon return.</p>
