 <p><strong>AST 991 - Who's Arrogant, Who's Funny, Instant Kill</strong></p>
 <p>“You killing one person as a warning could ruin an entire family, how about I kill one of you as a warning?”</p>
 <p>The voice came from below. However, the moment the words ended, a young man and an old man were standing in mid-air, about 100 meters away from them.</p>
 <p>The people who had arrived were Qing Shui and Ji Yunlang. Their appearances and Qing Shui's words caused the two old men to be stunned. At their cultivation level, they would never activate their spiritual sense to investigate if there were any other powerful people or dangers lurking around.</p>
 <p>It was because there were too few people who could really hurt them. Moreover, in the five continents, the strongest people would only be able to use a strength of 5,000 stars, even if the person had a physical strength of 10,000 stars.</p>
 <p>In these five continents, their cultivation level was already considered top notch. As long as one couldn't break through the regulations of the world, even if they were from the other four continents, they would still only have a strength of 5,000 stars.</p>
 <p>At their age, they were already able to accept a lot of things and even if Qing Shui were to scold them, they wouldn't be infuriated. It was because they felt that they would be able to kill the people before them with just a move of their fingers. They would just be using their lives in exchange for a few words. Moreover, most people wouldn't really get the chance to meet them.</p>
 <p>"It's you. Why, you're looking to a little kid for help?"</p>
 <p>The old man surnamed Wan looked at Ji Yunlang and said calmly. He only threw Qing Shui a quick glance and didn't look at him anymore but just continued to look at Ji Yunlang.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't pay him much heed. He had seen the other party's look of contempt and it wasn't the first time he had been looked down on. He was already used to it. Action speaks louder than words.</p>
 <p>He took out the Violet Star Thunder God. It was only after he took it out that the two old men looked at him in great astonishment. They'd finally turned to look at him straight in the eyes, their gazes filled with increasing astonishment.</p>
 <p>"Leave Greencloud Continent and compensate the families of the people you've killed until they're satisfied. What do you think of this suggestion?" Qing Shui's voice rang out once again. Right now, many people were around and watching.</p>
 <p>A number of them were wearing mourning clothes. Right now, this was the only way they could protest since the other party would definitely not go easy on them. Additionally, they didn't want to throw away their lives uselessly. Many of them had already lost their lives like this. However, they still couldn't take this lying down and there was even an old lady who was so angry that she had fainted quite a number of times.</p>
 <p>When everyone heard the conversation that was going on mid-air, they were all stunned. At the start, the people on the ground couldn't hear what the old men were saying but Qing Shui could hear the conversation they were having very clearly from the ground. Therefore, when he shouted out, many people had heard him.</p>
 <p>Right now, although their voices weren't loud, it could disseminate to quite a distance. Qing Shui looked at how helpless those people on the ground looked and thought of his past self. He understood their feelings and was also very infuriated. He couldn't stand it when the strong bullied the weak, especially when it was people from other continents coming over to act like bandits.</p>
 <p>This sudden situation made a lot of them stunned, but there were also many of them who were looking at them with curious and hopeful gazes. It seemed that in the past few days, Beiming Clan and Wan Clan had really angered the people.</p>
 <p>The number of people on the ground quickly grew by multiple folds and many people were cheering Qing Shui on. There were even people who shouted for Beiming Clan and Wan Clan to scram out of their continent.</p>
 <p>"Scram! Leave this place!"</p>
 <p>"Kill them! Kill them!"</p>
 <p>"These bandits... Give me back my child who you killed!"</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Old Man Wan didn't feel anything from the shouts and chidings coming from the ground. He looked at Qing Shui and smiled, "Young man, it's important to think before you speak. Don't you think that what you've just said is very funny?"</p>
 <p>"Funny? Very soon, you might not think so anymore. In a while, you'll know whose words are the funny ones," Qing Shui replied calmly before turning to look at Ji Yunlang.</p>
 <p>"Elder Brother, you should go down first!" Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</p>
 <p>"Brother, I'm fine. Elder Brother isn't that weak," Ji Yunlang shook his head and replied.</p>
 <p>"Then Elder Brother can just watch first. If I can't deal with the situation, then you can help me out," Qing Shui gave it some thought before he smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Ji Yunlang gave it some thought and nodded, taking a few steps back!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the two old men and said, "You guys came from Northern Sacred Lu Continent to Greencloud Continent and are acting so arrogantly. Do you really think that there's no one who could stand up to you in Greencloud Continent? If you guys were to die in Greencloud Continent, would there be anyone to help you retrieve your corpses?"</p>
 <p>At that moment, tens of silhouettes gradually appeared behind the two old men respectfully. There were also another four old men who were standing next to them.</p>
 <p>Through their clothes and accessories, it was clear that they were people from Beiming Clan and Wan Clan.The people from Beiming Clan were in white clothes while the ones from Wan Clan were in crimson red ones. An old man with a strong build and crimson red clothes stood out. His nose was very flat and he gave off an honest and amiable feeling. However, his pair of eyes were like blades with cold gleams.</p>
 <p>"I thought it was some powerful person. To think that it's just a kid. However, this kid is quite strong, at least amongst kids that is."</p>
 <p>This old man's voice was very calm and he looked at Qing Shui with his bright eyes. Holding onto the Violet Star Thunder God, Qing Shui's strength was close to 3,000 stars. It was just that his aura was very ethereal and even the people around him couldn't really grasp his real powers. Some of them might not even be able to sense his cultivation level at all.</p>
 <p>They guessed that the martial techniques which Qing Shui cultivated could conceal his Qi activities and that it must be some extremely good techniques. What astonished them was the Violet Star Thunder God which Qing Shui was holding. The domineering aura this weapon gave out allowed them to gain a basic grasp of Qing Shui's abilities.</p>
 <p>"Lad, there's no one who'd dare to be so arrogant before our two clans. Let me test you out and see what rights you have to act so arrogantly." A man wearing crimson red clothes walked out, his face full of unrestrain.</p>
 <p>"Mobai, don't act recklessly," Beiming Jiannan quickly said.</p>
 <p>"Brother Beiming, have you been scared out of your wits by this lad? I'm going to teach him today that there are people who he cannot afford to offend," Wan Mobai turned and said as he looked at Qing Shui. His eyes were extremely cold and sharp.</p>
 <p>The surroundings fell quiet, not even a single person from the crowd on the ground spoke a word. All of them lifted their heads and looked at the sky, hoping to see a miracle. This was especially true for the individuals who were wearing snow-white mourning clothes.</p>
 <p>"Since you guys insist on doing it this day, I hope you won't regret this." Qing Shui looked toward the two clans who didn't seem to be taking him seriously. They had all grown up from threats and had experienced many battles. Not a single one of them would be scared of the words of a young man with a cultivation that was only slightly decent.</p>
 <p>Moreover, in the five continents, one could at most hit out with a strength of 5,000 stars. Amongst them, there were already two who could deal out such a high level of damage. Thus, they weren't worried. They acted like they were enjoying a show, as if they were looking at a sparring session between juniors.</p>
 <p>"Make your move. Otherwise, I'm worried that you won't have another chance!" Qing Shui looked at Wan Mobai and said calmly.</p>
 <p>"Arrogant!"</p>
 <p>Wan Mobai wielded a crimson backhanded saber. Qing Shui sensed that it could increase one's strength by three times. This could be considered quite good. This person was likely highly regarded in Wan Clan.</p>
 <p>In Wan Clan, Wan Mobai was the top amongst the people of his generation. In the future, he might be the one to lead Wan Clan. This time around, the biggest reason he was here was that they hoped that Wan Mobai would be able to attain a breakthrough by using the spiritual herbs in the Sacred Land. They might be able to come across some fruits or things with amazing effects.</p>
 <p>Wan Mobai didn't say another word and swept out with his crimson backhanded saber horizontally. Immediately, it turned red like blood and even Wan Mobai's body was like a heap of fire, his strength swelling out at a crazy speed.</p>
 <p>Mmm, over 2,400 stars. He was only at over 1,800 stars previously but now his strength had increased suddenly by 600 stars. He had temporarily reached the strength of a Grade Three Martial Emperor and it should be thanks to the effects of that blood-red light.</p>
 <p>Crimson Fire Slash!</p>
 <p>Wan Mobai leaped up into the air. His silhouette was like a flash of fire, streaking out in a brilliant arch. When he reached the highest point of the arch, he suddenly pushed toward Qing Shui, attacking from above. An even more brilliant fire saber slashed out toward Qing Shui's head, bringing about a pitch black ripple.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hadn't moved at all. But at this moment, he finally moved.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps!</p>
 <p>Tiger Tailwhip Kick!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't even bother to use Raging Blow and just kicked out toward the opponent's Dantian. In terms of strength and cultivation, Wan Mobai was far from a match for Qing Shui. Moreover, when Qing Shui was using the Nine Palace Steps, dealing him an instant kill was easy.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui didn't kill him. He merely crippled him and let him drop down towards the ground and landing before the people who were wearing mourning clothes.</p>
 <p>Having been crippled, although Wan Mobai wouldn't die from the fall, he would be unable to move at all. The people in mourning clothes gushed up towards Wan Mobai, crying, shouting, scolding, and most importantly, beating him.</p>
 <p>The pitiful Wan Mobai who was a Martial Emperor, died just like that. It was because he had killed many family members of those who were dressed in mourning clothes.</p>
 <p>The world was very quiet right now, even those dressed in mourning clothes had become silent. However, they couldn't hide the happiness that they were feeling. They were able to relieve some of the fury in their hearts. It was a way of venting their hatred.</p>
 <p>Both Wan Clan and Beiming Clan were first astonished and soon became furious, especially Wan Clan. That old man with a flat nose, who was dressed in crimson clothes, looked so angry that it was like he could spew flames from his eyes. He looked at Qing Shui, his body trembling.</p>
 <p>"The conditions are still the same as before. Do you guys want to give it some more consideration?" Qing Shui said expressionlessly.</p>
 <p>"To hell with considerations! Today, I'll let you know what it means by living a life worst than death! I'll let you know that even death would be an extravagant wish." The old man drew out a similar crimson backhanded saber, unleashing his aura violently as he walked over to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>4,800 stars!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's current spiritual sense could clearly sense the other party's cultivation, but he didn't think anything about it. It was because very soon, this old man would die. A person like him couldn't be spared.</p>
 <p>With each step the old man took, the pressure in the air increased. Suddenly, the old man pounced toward Qing Shui with a flash, his backhanded saber creating a series of afterimages as he slashed out towards Qing Shui's right arm.</p>
 <p>Fast, too fast!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt a pressure, as if there was an aura that was trying to confine him. This was a type of pressure exerted by someone who was more powerful on someone weaker. The weaker party would find it hard to take even a single step.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's Nature Energy dissolved the other party's pressure in an instant.</p>
 <p>Raging Blow!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had a strength of close to 3,000 stars to begin with but it now increased by another fold explosively. It was a pity that he could only perform an attack with a strength of 5,000 stars. Therefore, Qing Shui's current strength was limited to 5,000 stars.</p>
 <p>Nine Palace Steps!</p>
 <p>The explosive increase in Qing Shui's strength caused the old man to be shocked. He then clenched his teeth and went all out with a slash towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Since you wish to chop off my right arm, then I'll take your right arm. One more thing, there hasn't been a person who had scolded me that still remains alive."</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>The old man stumbled backward. In addition to the small gap between their strengths, the clever angle at which Qing Shui attacked from caused him to be pushed back multiple steps. Qing Shui moved with his Nine Palace Steps once again, not giving his opponent any time for a breather.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Kacha!</p>
