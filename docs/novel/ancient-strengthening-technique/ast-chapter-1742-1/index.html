 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, with Qing Shui’s personality, he wouldn’t get scared by it. Let alone this time, it was the opposing side that was trying to look for trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, what shall we do?” The Sunset Palace Mistress knit her brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Yunfeng and Muyun Qingge also instinctively frowned. No one could actually act calmly when they ran into things like this. But luckily, their group still had a backbone supporting them: Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For now, there was no need for them to think of a solution. The only thing they needed to do was to follow him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the people from the Ocean Demonic Palace and revealed a merciless smile at the corner of his mouth. After a while, she spoke, “Let’s go. We will kill this big guy. Remember, we don’t have to kill it for real. We just have to get ready to battle against the people from the Ocean Demonic Palace.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one had any objections about the things which Qing Shui said. But they still felt a bit burdened hearing what he said. Nevertheless, they were still eager to give it a try. Deep down, warriors were all hot-blooded. They liked challenges. Even if they knew that they might not be a match against their opponents, they would still like to give it a try.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Four Symbols Formation! Earth Halo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stood on the offensive spot. The girls, on the other hand, stood on the spots which helped boost the users’ defenses. Actually, the position they were at also helped increased their offensive prowess, but the most significant increase was to their defensive prowess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the time being, Qing Shui’s strength had greatly increased. While battling against this big guy, he was able to advance and retreat at his own will. Compared to before, it had become a lot easier. The Guardian Beast possessed a huge figure and tremendous strength. It also possessed powerful fire attributes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the two girls and Shui Yunfeng were elites in the ocean. They possessed formidable water attributed techniques. Hence, it’s not that tough for them to suppress the Guardian Beast, with its fire attributes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had been keeping an eye on Ocean Demonic Palace. He wasn’t sure if they would attempt a sneak attack on him. Since they were here first, would the Ocean Demonic Palace be patient enough to wait for them to finish the battle?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He released his Spiritual Sense and constantly tried to remind everyone to be careful while fighting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Yiyun was standing at a distance not far away from them. He slightly squinted his eyes as he slowly examined the people in the battle. Initially, he looked down on the group. But now, he felt that he seemed to have underestimated them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though Yan Ziyun might not be the leader among the Ocean Demons, he was still considered to hold quite a respectable position among his group. In fact, he was the one in charge of making decisions for certain things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I changed my mind. Initially, I never planned to kill them. But now, I figure that these people must not live.” Yan Ziyun said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young master, how about the two women?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Leave the women behind. Drakina and Mermaid tribes are very rare nowadays. It will be useful to leave them behind so long as they don’t die. Kill the rest of them.” Yan Ziyun said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man who was speaking beforehand revealed an expression which signalled that he has understood his order. The two Ocean Demons beside him who seemed a lot older knit their brows. One of the elderly men with a slightly taller figure said, “It might not be easy to kill them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though he might be an elder, he actually looked more like he was middle-aged. Ocean Demons possessed formidable lifespans. Despite being over fifty, they would still retain their young look. This was also why a lot of men and women were envious towards them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, they mustn’t live. The young man will definitely pose a threat to us in the future if he lives.” Yan Ziyun knitted his brows and said in a firm tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man let out a sigh in his heart. He seemed to be disappointed about something. His brows were hanging low.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Get ready, we will be making our move soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young master, we can wait for them to kill the Guardian Beast first before we make our move. Wouldn’t that be better?” The young male Ocean Demon from before asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“For now, they would definitely not show all their tricks and kill the Guardian Beast. They are trying to defend themselves from us. Since that’s what they’re doing, it means that they have already made the decision that a battle between us would eventually unfold. With that being the case, there is no reason for us to continue holding our steps. Let them witness the strength of the Ocean Demons!” Yan Ziyun revealed a merciless smile on his face. Formidable killing intention could also be felt being emitted from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, Qing Shui revealed a not so obvious smile on his face. Suddenly, with just a flash of movement, he appeared beside Shui Yunfeng. Right at this moment, Yan Ziyun and an elderly man also appeared right in front of Shui Yunfeng. They were already almost about to attempt a sneak attack on him with their fork-like weapons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who would have thought it’d just be a group of useless brats.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beng-beng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s current strength was double that of his strength from before. He directly took on the old man’s attack. Shui Yunfeng, on the other hand, was blown backwards by Yan Ziyun. Right behind him was none other than the Guardian Beast itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had long since been prepared for it. He immediately operated his consciousness and the Hell Nightmare Beast which was about the size of a small mountain immediately appeared right between them and the Guardian Beast. Shui Yunfeng managed to come to a stop thanks to the Hell Nightmare Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the rest of the Ocean Demons also began charging their ways here. Immediately, Qing Shui’s eyes became as sharp as a sword. As he waved his arm, the Dark Phoenix, Dragon Spider, and Dragon Elephant showed up one after another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had already used the Battle God’s Halo and also the formations. Furthermore, they mainly served the purpose of boosting his defensive prowess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Art of Pursuing!</span></p>

All of this happened in an instant. Qing Shui was aware that since they had decided to fight, he shouldn’t hold back. He would be delighted to leave every single one of them behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mighty Elephant Stomp!</span></p>

The old man from before who managed to surprise Qing Shui immediately stopped on that spot. He was dizzy thanks to the spin.</span></p>

Despite the huge differences in their strength, he was actually the only person who got dizzy from the spin. Qing Shui didn’t move while the Dragon Slaying Beast formed a golden line with its speed as fast as lightning.</span></p>

The old man’s figure had disappeared.</span></p>

He shouted loudly as he charged his way towards Qing Shui.</span></p>

The elderly man who had died was an elite from their branch. Now, even if Yan Ziyu managed to kill the people in front of him, it still wouldn’t take the fact that he had suffered great losses.</span></p>

Yan Ziyun somehow felt that he was responsible for the old man getting killed. He could never find a good enough excuse to inform his clan about it if he went back this time. Initially, he was supposed to have held a very firm position within his clan, but now, it seemed all hopes for him had turned to dust.</span></p>

On top of it flashed light resembling that of thunders and lightnings. The only thing was that the light was snow white in color. It was giving out intense energy that felt as if it could engulf everything in one go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brat, I will definitely make sure that I crush your soul!”</span></p>

He was reminded of the spirit-like attacks from the Hell Tiger. Though it wasn’t as powerful as the spirit-like attacks of the Ocean Demons, Qing Shui had yet again forged ahead vigorously in his strength. His Nine Yang Dragon Soul was also a lot more powerful than before.</span></p>

It let out loud and clear dragon crying noises as it instantly charged towards the snow white soul.</span></p>

The reason was because he felt the intense shock and the restless Spiritual Sense across his body. Or rather, his very Sea of Consciousness was fluctuating.</span></p>

On the contrary, he swiftly made it charge its way towards the two girls, as they were being put at a disadvantage by the Ocean Demons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ocean Demons were considered to be a kind of demonic beasts. They were almost equal when fighting against Qing Shui’s demonic beasts. In comparison to the opponents, Qing Shui’s demonic beasts slightly lacked in offensive prowess. However, their defensive prowess and resistance towards certain attacks were even greater than that of the Ocean Demons. Hence, for the time being, they were able to fight to a draw. If there was any single factor which might help lead them to victory, it would be none other than the Dragon Slaying Beast.</span></p>
