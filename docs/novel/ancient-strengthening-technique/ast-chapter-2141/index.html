 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why would you suddenly ask about the young mistress? It has been such a long time since I last saw her out here. It’s said that she is currently cultivating inside the Sword Heart Pavilion located within Taiyi Immortal Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui revealed an awkward smile, “So I assume that you would like me to meet your daughter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though she didn’t say it, Nuo Lan also understood what this ‘meeting’ would mean. She gave Qing Shui a strange look when she heard what Qing Shui said. All of a sudden, she felt weird, but she didn’t know how to describe these feelings in words. Nevertheless, she still smiled and continued, “If you are really able to get her to marry you, there is no doubt that you must have devoted yourself greatly to the god in the past.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t like a forced marriage.” Qing Shui said in a serious tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In your dream. I do admit that you are very outstanding, but somehow, I keep having a feeling that she isn’t suitable for you.” Nuo Lan said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, then do you think that you are?” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come on! To tell you the truth, the moment you see the Young Mistress, you will immediately think that she is a goddess. Erm, how shall I put it…… It’s just like, in other women’s eyes, she is like a green herb.” Nuo Lan said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph? For you to look up to her to this extent, it must mean that she is an amazing person.” Qing Shui also found it really weird. Nuo Lan was like the woman among women. Since she possessed the Immortal Fox Physique, there was nothing to complain about her look and her temperament. She was no doubt a top quality woman. But for someone like her to compliment another woman this much, to the point she even felt inferior to the other person. Seeing that, Qing Shui only got more and more excited to see how exactly this woman, who needed her father to help look for a husband, looked like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She is indeed amazing. But a word of advice for you, don’t try to lay your hands on her. One careless mistake may cause you to not even want to get close to other women anymore.” Nuo Lan chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, Qing Shui got even more confused. He looked at Nuo Lan, “I am a bit puzzled.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me put it this way. I have seen her a few times, and she is the kind of woman who desired nothing. If you are to get married to her, you may end up not even being able to touch her hands in your entire lifetime.” Nuo Lan explained.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing that, Qing Shui finally understood what was going on. But at the same time, he was also getting more and more curious. People often said that women were the ones curious about all things, but this wasn’t true. It actually applied to both men and women. So long as it was something interesting, they would be curious to know more about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two returned to the Imperial Cuisine Hall. The whole place looked the same as usual. But by now, there were two additional people who were waiting to be treated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All along, Zhang Yue had been in the hall. He had been trying his best to take in medical knowledge for the past few days. Ever since Qing Shui came back, Zhang Yue would ask him about the questions which he had prepared himself whenever he saw Qing Shui free. At the same time, he had also been trying to recognize some of the herbs and prescribe medicines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His body physique was suitable to be a physician. Back then, Qing Shui didn’t have high hopes on him. But in order to return him the favor, he also would try his best to at least make him a well-known physician in the area where he was at. Added on his cultivations, he should be able to become a rich man here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, since Qing Shui had already taken him as his disciple, this had changed his whole fate. Looking at how things were at the moment, Qing Shui felt that it shouldn’t be a problem leaving Zhang Yue to take control of one of the Imperial Cuisine Halls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yue`er, you are going to learn acupuncture with me tomorrow. It consists of a wide range of subjects. Take these needles with you and try to get used to the feeling of holding a needle as soon as possible.” Qing Shui passed Zhang Yue a huge box of silver needles. These were all made by Qing Shui himself in the past. For now, since he only used the Gold Needle and Life and Death Needles, the silver needles could simply be used as a tool to teach his disciples.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first thing which came into Qing Shui’s sight as soon as he went in was the Primordial Pig. It was often said that being lecherous was a dragon’s nature. Thus, dragons would have nine offsprings. A lot of the demonic beasts contained the dragon tribe’s bloodlines. Still, it was beyond Qing Shui’s expectations that the dragons would target even the pigs… The Primordial Pig…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like before, Qing Shui had his sight fixed on the beast that was being restrained. This beast was very terrifying. Nothing, other than the spider web, could bind it. At the moment, Qing Shui was thinking about how he should handle this thing. The reason was that he knew there was no way he could possibly tame it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt that it was very unfortunate that he was unable to do so. However, he revealed a joyful expression as soon as he saw the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace in the distance. He might have a way of dealing with this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three corpses of the Advancing Divine Worms from before had been dealt with by Qing Shui. He had picked a lot of things from the trees in preparation to make medicinal herbs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, Qing Shui was preparing the Demon Refining Furnace to refine the demonic beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were two methods in which the demons could be refined. The first one was converting the beast into something like an Origin Essence Pill and feeding it to other demonic beasts. There was a chance that the beast taking the pill would attain the abilities of the demonic beast that had been refined. Its strength would also increase at the same time. The amount of strength increased would depend on the strength of both the demonic beast taking the pill and the one that was refined. If the difference in power was too big, the pill might not be effective. There was a chance the body of the beast would burst from the excessive power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second method was putting in multiple different beasts into the furnace. The beast which survived until the end would attain the abilities of other beasts. By then, either an upgraded version or a brand new beast would be produced. There was also a chance that the demonic beast might be mutated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After pondering for half a day, Qing Shui made up his mind and went with the first method. Though the first method might be brutal, it had to be done, seeing how it was not possible for Qing Shui to tame the Primordial Pig. Added on that they had yet to develop any attachments for now, it was not too hard for him to do it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui also found the second method a bit brutal. If his demonic beasts ended up being swallowed by the Primordial Pig, Qing Shui would feel heartbroken. After all, those demonic beasts had been following him for quite a long time. In Qing Shui’s eyes, the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was an honest brother and man to the other beasts. Usually, it would eat meat and drink wine in the realm along with the Dark Phoenix and Dragon Spider.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, Qing Shui made his mind up to use the first method this time and gave the crystal to the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. It had been a long time since the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant last got involved in a battle. It was not able to catch up in terms of its strength. Even though it hadn’t made any complaints so far, Qing Shui could see it was cultivating really hard as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, Qing Shui decided to leave this opportunity to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if it had already known its own fate, the Primordial Pig kept on giving off ear-piercing shrieks. Its tiny pupils were firmly fixed on Qing Shui. Despite its attempt to bite off the spider thread with its mouth, it was tightly bound by it. As of now, its entire fate rested in Qing Shui’s hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui saw the beast’s ferocious look, he immediately tossed it into the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The refining process was uninteresting. Moreover, it also happened over a long period of time. Qing Shui was controlling the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace and Primordial Flame with his Spirit Energy. The pictures of the demonic beasts on the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace shone very brightly, giving off a sacred feeling. It also contained mysterious energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Maybe because the Primordial Pig was bound by the spider thread, it didn’t show that much violence when it was struggling. The only thing that was heard was its terrifying shrieking noises. But as time passed, its voice started getting softer and quieter. Eventually, no more noises could be heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seven days. It had been seven days before the process was finally finished! Only after that did Qing Shui came to a stop. Knowing that things were settled, Qing Shui didn’t rush to open the Demon Refining Furnace. Since he was already exhausted, he immediately started filling up his stomach and slept for about six hours.</span></p>
