 <p><strong>AST 890 - Long-armed Vicious Monkey King, The Difficult Attempt to Lure the Enemy Away</strong></p>
 <p>The gap in abilities between each grade of the Martial Emperor realm was very wide and since he had not the power to go against the opponent, he could only choose to "steal". Qing Shui had everything thought out. It would only be courting death if he were to fight head-on with the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had already located the position of the Sky Penetrating Grass through his spiritual sense and of course, knew where the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King was located. It was not far away from the two Sky Penetrating Grass.</p>
 <p>He knew that it would be very difficult to get to them without the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King's realizing it but fortunately, Qing Shui had the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He called back the Five-Headed Demonic Spider and slowly headed up that silvery white mountain.</p>
 <p>He walked very slowly, thinking of how he could get his hands on that Sky Penetrating Grass. He had already gotten his hands on one in that place with the deity. He scanned with his spiritual sense briefly and was affirmative that these two Sky Penetrating Grass were definitely at least 5,000 years of age or more. However, he didn't know why that Long-armed Vicious Monkey King had not taken it.</p>
 <p>Could it be that this medicinal herb was already over 9,000 years?</p>
 <p>Was it waiting for them to reach 10,000 years of age?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought about it, feeling puzzled. This was not impossible. The 10,000th year was also a turning point for medicinal herbs, a great one. Even the most useless medicinal herb would have a "Immortal Grass Qi" when they've reached 10,000 years of age. This was something very precious.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't care about it right now. He was trying to think of how he could make this powerful demonic beast leave this place for a short while. As long as it left, everything would be easier. He could also make his escape immediately after getting the Sky Penetrating Grass.</p>
 <p>Once he reached the foot of the mountain, Qing Shui sensed a spiritual sense scanning in his direction but since he couldn't avoid it, he naturally let the spiritual sense hit him but still tried his best to conceal his abilities.</p>
 <p>A tremendous ape's cry rang out!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had never thought that an ape's cry could be so terrifying. It was so terrifying that it was as if it could tear his heart apart. Just from its cry alone, one could sense that it was a huge monster...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't care about that spiritual sense and headed on the straight path up that steep mountain, as if sensing that the powerful spiritual sense was getting closer to it.</p>
 <p>Ignoring that spiritual sense, Qing Shui headed for the top of the mountain, not anxious. He was very certain that it would definitely not be too far away from that Sky Penetrating Grass and thus he could advance so bravely.</p>
 <p>The Five-Headed Demonic Spider was arranged to be in another direction and not allowed to get too near. Qing Shui was thinking of trying to lure the enemy away but it was just that the target was too powerful and he could not bear to sacrifice the Five-Headed Demonic Spider.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Qing Shui decided to take the risk himself while communicating with the Five-Headed Demonic Spider, thinking about how he should go about it.</p>
 <p>The ape's cry grew increasingly piercing and ferocious and Qing Shui could tell that it was trying to show off its might and had the intention to scare Qing Shui off. Although his cultivation level was not at a level that it would feel concerned over, there was still another Five-Headed Demonic Spider and it should be able to sense that the other party was here to snatch the treasures it was guarding.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui went all the way up to the peak of the mountain. After all, it was huge and thus even though he had arrived at the peak, he could not see the huge Long-armed Vicious Monkey King. The mountain's peak was also covered with a large spread of forest which was several hundred feet tall and densely packed together, appearing to be even more majestic from the mountain's peak.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked around the surroundings and unleashed his spiritual sense, observing the movements of that Long-armed Vicious Monkey King before slowly closing in on the place he was familiar with. At the same time, he also started to let the Five-Headed Demonic Spider head up in the direction of the mountain's peak.</p>
 <p>It was because Qing Shui realized that the terrain of this mountain's peak was especially suitable for the Five-Headed Demonic Spider as its Corrosive Poison Net could exist for a very long time and this place was suitable for creating webs...</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui first checked it out, there were no descriptions of this application in the Five-Headed Demonic Spider's battle techniques. However, subconsciously, he felt that spiders must create webs and thus when he tested out the Five-Headed Demonic Spider's abilities, he specially let it form webs.</p>
 <p>The moment it did, he understood. The Five-Headed Demonic Spider told him that it was for defense purposes, such as forming webs at caves entrances or by surrounding itself with webs.</p>
 <p>The mountain terrain was not flat and thus there were many spots which were suitable for forming webs. The Five-Headed Demonic Spider's webs were very big and could reach out to a large area. It was very useful when fighting against an existence of the same level.</p>
 <p>If they were to make use of the geographical advantages, just one Five-Headed Demonic Spider could make many demonic beasts of a similar level be at a loss and if they were not careful, they might not even be left with a corpse. It was because they would be in great trouble if they were to be tangled up in the Five-Headed Demonic Spider's webs.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stopped moving. He was still very far away from where the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King was at, but he was now thinking of changing methods. He knew that he must not be impatient, otherwise he would definitely be in trouble.</p>
 <p>Communicating through their thoughts, Qing Shui let the Five-Headed Demonic Spider come towards him from another direction while he set up a tent and thought about how he could lure away the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King.</p>
 <p>What had made Qing Shui feel gloomy was that this demonic beast seemed to be able to sense his thoughts and plans and simply refused to leave its spot. This also left him feeling quite helpless.</p>
 <p>Not very long later, the Five-Headed Demonic Spider appeared next to Qing Shui. Qing Shui first let it scatter out its Corrosive Poison Web densely in the area in multiple layers.</p>
 <p>He then released a hundred Demonic Spiders and called out the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, unleashing multiple Mighty Elephant Stomps and cries in the area. He also called out the Fire Bird and the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui even scattered some poison on the densely packed spider webs, telling his demonic beasts that they should not leave the area covered by the spider webs, before telling them to cry out as if they were putting up a demonstration of their powers.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't know if, other than the Five-Headed Demonic Spider, the demonic beasts would be able to cause it to panic.</p>
 <p>However, thankfully, he still had the Five-Headed Demonic Spider.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui left the place and slowly headed deeper in. He had not walked too far in when he sensed a gushing aura before hearing a furious bellow. The ape's cry was a bit piercing to the ear.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui still advanced carefully. He was testing the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King's limits and waiting for it to respond. He was already very close, being less than 1,000 meters away.</p>
 <p>Moreover, Qing Shui's spiritual sense could already sense its existence. At this moment, Qing Shui's heart thumped very quickly because of the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King and even for himself this 1,000 meters would only take but a second to cross.</p>
 <p>Expert level Focused Concentration!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui started his Expert level Focused Concentration and not only did his abilities increase by a little, more importantly his concentration would be focused and in this condition, the prowess of both his attacks and defenses could be raised by about 20%. it could also increase his resistance to spirit energy attacks by a lot, allowing his spirit energy to be better displayed.</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui was focusing primarily in order to allow his spiritual sense to react extremely quickly.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Qing Shui dashed forth at rapid speed. His current speed had already exceeded supersonic speed and it would only take him a moment to cross 1,000 meters. What was between Qing Shui and the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King was a horizontal stretch of mountains.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui dashed up the top of a mountain and in that instant, he chose to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Therefore, after Qing Shui crossed the mountains and was not far away from the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King, he disappeared.</p>
 <p>Completely disappeared!</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, his heart started to palpitate at an increasing rate. That moment he had just been through was extremely dangerous and if he was not careful, he could have been left dead.</p>
 <p>After the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King saw that Qing Shui was approaching, with a slight hesitation, its huge body flashed and its big arms that were like a "Jiao" as they lashed out towards Qing Shui. In that instant, a huge black hole appeared in the air.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui disappeared but the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King looked around, feeling dubious. Earlier, what he hit was Qing Shui's after image, but now Qing Shui had disappeared right before its eyes and it couldn't even sense anything with its spiritual sense. Therefore, he felt that Qing Shui must have been devoured by the black hole it had created.</p>
 <p>And right now, Qing Shui was looking out of the realm at the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King while letting the Five-Headed Demonic Spider get closer, creating webs as it advanced. He hoped to be able to lure the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King some distance away.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King then at the two Sky Penetrating Grass which were not very far away. He was very agitated. Even though they were right in front of his eyes, he could not lay his hands on them.</p>
 <p>In order to get something, one must be able to pay the price for it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui let an ordinary Demonic Spider out and let it run far away. However, it was quickly killed by the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King while the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King didn't even move an inch.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hesitated and then called out another beast but this time, it was a Jade Emperor Bee. Similarly, it was not able to let the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King move a single step but its stance was slightly inclined forward.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then released two Demonic Spiders!</p>
 <p>Two Jade Emperor Bees!</p>
 <p>Three!</p>
 <p>Four!</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt very helpless. Each time he sent them out, he felt horrible. Although these were not humans and could not be compared to the other demonic beasts such as the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and the Fire Bird, they had all belonged to him. He would feel sad even if he were to break the tea set he used often, let alone them. They were unlike the black fish and turtles and thus he felt a little sad.</p>
 <p>At the same time, he continued to communicate with the Five-Headed Demonic Spider, letting it speed up its rate of advancement. However, he still got it to create its webs properly, allowing it to put up some momentary defenses.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was now very agitated since the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King had walked several tens of meters away and at this moment, the Five-Headed Demonic Spider had already appeared on the mountain range.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was very agitated. Whether or not this plan would be a success would be dependent on this now. He quickly urged the Five-Headed Demonic Spider to form its webs properly, since as long as it could bide for a short moment, it would be safe.</p>
 <p>Chi chi!</p>
 <p>The Five-Headed Demonic Spider cried out toward the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King, as if challenging it.</p>
 <p>This made Qing Shui both happy and worried. He was happy that this Five-Headed Demonic Spider was very clever and probably had a bright future before it. After Qing Shui tensed up, he stared at the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King's huge body.</p>
 <p>Poison Silk Entanglement!</p>
 <p>The Five-Headed Demonic Spider suddenly unleashed the Poison Silk Entanglement at the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King.</p>
 <p>Flying Spider Silk!</p>
 <p>Corrosive Poison Web!</p>
 <p>At this moment, the Five-Headed Demonic Spider circulated its abilities to its limits, trying the best it could to agitate the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King.</p>
 <p>After letting out a huge bellow which was still slightly high pitched, the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King shot toward the Five-Headed Demonic Spider.</p>
 <p>Almost at the same time, after taking the Gale Pellet and the Agility-Enhancing Fruit, Qing Shui also dashed out. His goal: the Sky Penetrating Grass.</p>
 <p>The Five-Headed Demonic Spider's speed was also very fast. Having increased by five times, it would not lose to the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King in terms of speed. It threw out its Corrosive Poison Webs repeatedly toward the Long-armed Vicious Monkey King.</p>
