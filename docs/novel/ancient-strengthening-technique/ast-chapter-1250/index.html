 <p><strong>AST 1250 - Getting Ready to Leave, Yet Another Challenge Letter</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s most powerful aspect was still his Spirit Energy. Of course, the strength of his Nine Continents Mountain was incomparably terrifying, but in comparison, it was still his control of Spirit Energy that was the most powerful.</p>
 <p>If the chances of his attack prowess doubling were met, the attacks of his Spirit Energy would become more powerful than ever. However, Qing Shui was more confident about the confinement strength of his Spirit Energy under the effect of the Eight-eight Divine Nebula Formation. For example, he felt more confident about the confinement strength of his Great Golden Buddha Palm Imprint and his Seventh Wave. Additionally, the binding strength of his Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines was also quite terrifying.</p>
 <p>Both the Tidal Cloud Wave Seal and Seal of Xuantian would also increase significantly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was satisfied. As long as his Spirit Energy could confine his opponent, for example, the Bloodthirsty Demonic Vine, it would be a lot easier for him to play his opponents to death. Another example was, he could completely cripple his enemy with the Thunderous Beast or immediately let the Treasure Hunting Pig to come out through his own body.</p>
 <p>Hence, it could be said that his current killing prowess had increased a lot. This time, Qing Shui was really satisfied. Even though he was aware that the strongest force within the Western Oxhe Continent was around 8,000 sun, but how many of those people exist within the Western Oxhe Continent? Most probably these people are extremely rare in number.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s increase in strength made the energy within his body many times more powerful. His entire body was not in the slightest inferior to demonic beasts at the same level. The Nine Yang Golden Body, even his Ancient Strengthening Technique had helped strengthen his physical body. Additionally, there was the power up provided by his Violet Gold Bloodline.</p>
 <p>The enormous breakthrough this time meant that Qing Shui had begun taking over the top circle of strength within the Western Oxhe Continent. The refinement last time was an enormous turning point. It could be considered as something extremely crucial. However, only this time could be considered as a true huge leap he took, as the breakthrough this time have helped him completely unlocked this phase.</p>
 <p>Now, there were a lot of things that Qing Shui no longer had to be too worried about. He could let just go ahead and do whatever he wanted to.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>On the second day, Qing Sha was there for her morning practice like usual. Because of the time within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui wouldn’t normally be able to make it early. Hence, Qing Sha was always earlier than him.</p>
 <p>As time passed, Qing Sha got more and more powerful. She had already surpassed the Seventh Princess and Yan Jinyu. Even though her pernicious aura, baleful aura, and murderous aura were very strong, it was no longer something to be concerned about as long as her mind was awake. No one had decided that only white sword Qi would be considered righteous and that black sword Qi would be considered evil. What was evil were humans. Evil humans would still be evil even if they use white sword Qi.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also practiced his Taichi Fist and had a really calm mind as his chest was filled with Nature Energy. At the moment when he lifted his hand and moved his leg, the entire Heaven and Earth followed his movement and also began to move rhythmically.</p>
 <p>After she finished her practice, Qing Sha could clearly tell the changes in Qing Shui. His entire person as well as his aura had changed. However, he was still the father which she was familiar with - the person who had treated her the best in this world.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui seemed to really enjoyed practicing his Taichi Fist. The golden qi around his body was much more in quantity.. It was a lot more powerful than the Taichi Golden Qi in the past. Qing Sha also benefited a lot by watching Qing Shui practiced his Taichi Fist. With her current cultivation, the amount of benefits she could get from watching someone with Qing Shui’s level practicing Taichi Fist was immeasurable.</p>
 <p>This was considered as truly touching the great gate of Heavenly Dao. As Qing Shui swayed his hand, he carried along the rhythmic movement of the Heaven and Earth. Even at the time when he swung his arms, the Qi that was released was strong enough to pressure someone to death.</p>
 <p>“Father, you broke through once again!”</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui stopped, Qing Sha happily approached him and embraced his arm.</p>
 <p>“Yes, it’s considered a breakthrough. Oh yes, little lass, I’m going to talk to you about something.” Since Qing Shui had already refined that powerful strength, the day for him to leave was near.</p>
 <p>“Oh, father is leaving. Bring me along!” Qing Sha smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Little lass, maybe later on, I might have to move around and the current you is unsuitable for going with me. Your cultivation is at its most crucial moment. Do you not want to continue increasing your strength?” QIng Shui asked Qing Sha as he walked.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, do you not want me anymore?” Suddenly, Qing Sha’s face turned pale. She looked at Qing Shui seriously.</p>
 <p>“How could I not? Little lass, why would you think that way?” Qing Shui rubbed her head when he saw her expression.</p>
 <p>“I am scared that father will never come back ever again once you leave.” Qing Sha said in a sad tone.</p>
 <p>“Little lass, you still have them here. Why won’t I come back? I am still hoping for Sister Su to become the headmaster here. The thing you need to do now is to cultivate hard.” Qing Shui said patiently.</p>
 <p>Qing Sha rolled her eyes. “Father, do you like her?”</p>
 <p>“Why do you ask?” Qing Shui knew that Qing Sha was talking about the Eldest Princess.</p>
 <p>“Why can’t I ask this? I just feel that father treats her differently. You will hold her hand from time to time and even hug her.” Qing Sha pouted.</p>
 <p>“Erm, does this mean I like her then?” Qing Shui was stunned and asked with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Don’t treat me like a child. You guys are already like this, is this still counted as being normal friends?” Qing Sha said in an unsatisfied tone.</p>
 <p>“Well then, little lass, do you want me to like her?” Qing Shui never expected for Qing Sha to think this way. Since she was already thinking like that, Yan Jinyu and the Seventh Princess most likely also had the same thought.</p>
 <p>“It is useless whether I am willing to do so or not. You need to ask your wife.” Qing Sha chuckled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui softly knocked her head and smiled. “Promise me to cultivate here well. Do you want to join the Heaven Secrets Academy? Forget it, this is still your choice. One more thing, if you need any help, you can look for her okay?”</p>
 <p>Qing Sha hesitated for a while. “I’ll listen to father as long as you take out some time to visit me..”</p>
 <p>“I will promise you this. Don’t worry, it’s very easy for me to come back.” Qing Shui had the Nine Continents Boots. He wouldn’t need that much time to come back with his Nine Continents Step Effect. Even tho the Divine Might Dynasty might be really far away from the Heaven Secrets Academy, it was still within Qing Shui’s acceptable range.</p>
 <p>In the morning, Qing Shui headed off to the Heaven Secret Court. The other two old men from before were also there. Now, Qing Shui’s formidable Spiritual Sense was able to vaguely feel Headmaster Cao’s strength. It was around 5,000 sun, or roughly a little less than that.</p>
 <p>Headmaster Cao was considered as one of the few Deputy Headmaster of the Heaven Secret Academy. As for the strength of the other old man, Qing Shui could only sense it vaguely. He was unable to feel his actual strength, however, what he could sensed was even stronger than Headmaster Cao’s.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing Qing Shui, the two old men were shocked. The old man in gold dragon gown smiled happily. “Qing Shui, indeed I am right, I wonder how much strength can you fight against now?”</p>
 <p>Actually, the old man was really curious. After all, there was a time where Qing Shui was able to fight equally with the Saint Child who possessed a strength worth 2,100 sun, with his own 500 sun of strength and 1,000 sun of strength of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant.</p>
 <p>“I can kill warriors with 4,000 sun worth of strength easily. As for 5,000 sun, I won’t be so sure about that, but I’ll still be able to protect myself!” Qing Shui knew that at this moment, he needed to say things like these to demonstrate his strength.</p>
 <p>The old man didn’t really look that shocked as he nodded. “The Heaven Secrets Academy will be your strongest shield. At least for now, it still can qualified to be that. I will try my best to let the girl in the Breezing Wind Veranda to grow stronger. By then, I will leave the Heaven Secrets Academy to her.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the old man with a strange look. “Old man, do you really believe me that much? Are you not afraid that I may steal away your Heaven Secrets Academy? Or are you not afraid that I am a spy sent by the other two dynasties?”</p>
 <p>“Haha, you have truly underestimated my old eyes. After ten years, or it may not even take that long, the Heaven Secrets Academy will be something you will no longer pay attention to. Besides, I am still quite confident when it comes to analyzing people. Or else, I would have eliminated you sooner. In any case, it is also a good thing that the Heaven Secrets Academy is in your hands.”</p>
 <p>The old man spoke calmly.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui heard the old man’s words, not only was he not angry, but on the contrary, he felt that the old man was very honest. This was an old man who had dedicated his whole heart to the Heaven Secrets Academy. He nodded with a smile and said: “I will try my best to help develop the Heaven Secrets Academy.”</p>
 <p>The three started to drink tea and talk about some bizarre things. Qing Shui on the other hand, also had things to ask on his visit this time. Hence, he asked about all of the questionable things which he prepared before coming.</p>
 <p>“How do people from Western Oxhe Continent travel to the other three continents?”</p>
 <p>“Half of the Western Oxhe Continent is the one we’re currently located in, other than this, it has another half. The other half of the continent is very dangerous. For example, after passing through the Desolate Mountain Regions, you’ll arrive in the other half of the continent. The only way to the other three continents is through the other half of the Western Oxhe Continent. One could travel to it by walking past the other half of Western Oxhe Continent. It may sound easy, but the journey is incomparably dangerous.” The old man in golden dragon gown said slowly after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>“Is this the only way?” Qing Shui asked, confused.</p>
 <p>“At least based on my knowledge, this is the only way. Actually, the World of the Nine Continents is just too big. The continents are separated by oceans and mountain regions. However, there are still the Ancient Great Formation that connect the other five continents with the Western Oxhe Continent. Legend has it that a long time ago, the Western Oxhe Continent used to also have another Ancient Great Formation to link with the other three continents, just like the other five. However, legend also said that later on, the three continents destroyed the formation. In a way, it can be considered that they have completely destroyed their link with the Western Oxhe Continent.”</p>
 <p>“Has anyone been to the three continents throughout these years?” Qing Shui asked after he thought for awhile.</p>
 <p>“Yes. Actually, there should be people that came from the other three continent in the Western Oxhe Continent. It’s very easy for legendary warriors to travel back and forth between the continents. However, there are only very few people from the Western Oxhe Continent who managed to travel there. Hence, it already became a legend.</p>
 <p>“What kind of strength do I need to travel smoothly to the other three continents?” Qing Shui had a feeling that he would definitely go there in the future. Hence, he felt that it would be best if he got a rough idea about it now.</p>
 <p>“A strength worth 3,000 sun should be able to endure the journey. However, you will still need speed, for example, a powerful flying beast. Otherwise, the amount of time this journey will consume isn’t something which a normal human can take.” The old man in golden dragon gown smiled as he looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“This journey seemed to be really far.” Qing Shui laughed</p>
 <p>“It’s indeed far. You will need 20 years time travelling at your full speed. Even if you possessed a long lifespan, you may not be able to stand the exhaustion during your journey.”</p>
 <p>Twenty years?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was shocked. He might have achieved this level of strength and have a long lifespan, but 20 years was still not a short time. Let alone during his journey, the loneliness, as well as the danger he could ran into, weren’t something which normal people could take. Since it was such a long time, the journey could be said to be filled with constant danger. The places which he would come across had a huge ocean included in it. It was incomparably dangerous. If he didn’t run into any deserted island, then he would need a few flying beasts to take turns on his journey.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, if you are planning to head off to the three continents, I would recommend you to do so a bit later.” The old man gave Qing Shui an advice out of good intention. He didn’t speak anymore than that.</p>
 <p>“Yes, I know. I still plan to stay here for a few more years.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui left after he asked again about the things regarding the Divine Might Dynasty. The main reason he came was to show the old man his hidden potential and increase his influence in the Heaven Secrets Academy. Other than that, he also asked a thing or two about stuffs which he would like to know himself.</p>
 <p>However, not long after Qing Shui reached home, he had received a challenge letter. This was a challenge letter delivered by a group of people together. The names on the list included Fu Yantian, Tian Jianxian, Zuo Baidong, Ya Fengshui and Yu Huwu in it.</p>
 <p>These were nearly the people from the five strongest forces among the Heaven Secrets Academy. Saint Child’s Band, Lord Sect, Zuoyue Hall… Furthermore, it was very likely that they were the main lords of their respective forces.</p>
