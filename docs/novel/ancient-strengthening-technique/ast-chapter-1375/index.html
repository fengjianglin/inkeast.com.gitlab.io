 <p><strong>AST 1375 - Arriving at the Continent's Capital. Manor, Wicked Servant, Showing Off Strength As A Form of Warning </strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't know why. Could it be because he cultivated the Ancient Strengthening Technique?</p>
 <p>At the False God realm, with the increment to each additional grade, one must go through a False God Tribulation. The False God Tribulation didn't serve to create disasters for the individual but was a tempering of the physical body. One would only be able to advance to the next grade after passing through the False God Tribulation.</p>
 <p>Therefore, the False God Tribulation was a qualitative improvement to a person's power. It served to stabilize one's power after the person had attained a breakthrough. Only by passing through the False God Tribulation would the person's body be able to withstand the explosive increment of powers from the breakthrough.</p>
 <p>Could it be that his physical body was strong enough and thus there wasn't a need for him to go through the False God Tribulation?</p>
 <p>It wasn't as if there was no one who didn't have to go through the False God Tribulations in this world. There had been some people who didn't have to experience the False God Tribulations before Grade Five False God.</p>
 <p>"If Elder Brother believes in me, come look for me after you're back from visiting your Master. When the time comes, I'll talk to you more about it."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had originally wanted to help Tianhe Renmo strengthen his foundations now. The Five Elements Spring of Life was very amazing. However, on thinking that Tianhe Renmo still had a powerful Master, he didn't want to let them see what he could do. He didn't wish to attract unnecessary trouble. Right now, he wasn't sure how his standing was amongst the strongest in the continent's capital.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Qing Shui decided to render his help after Tianhe Renmo had come back from his Master's place. By then, with just a little bit more time, Qing Shui's abilities would progress even further. At that time, he might be able to firm his standing in the continent's capital.</p>
 <p>The continent's capital shouldn't be too far from the Demon Lord Palace. The Demon Lord Palace was located in the intersection between the Dancing Phoenix Continent, Soaring Dragon Continent and Haohan Continent. It didn't belong to any of the three continents.</p>
 <p>It was only now that Qing Shui knew that the intersection point between the three continents was also very, very big. There was also the existence of some very powerful forces and Immortal Demons.</p>
 <p>Right now, using both his Emperor's Qi and the Hundred Birds Worshiping The Phoenix, he should be able to help her out, right? He wondered if the things he had given her previously were of any help. This time around, heading to the continent's capital, he should have more chances to meet her.</p>
 <p>Toward her, this lady who was like a goddess of an ice mountain, Qing Shui didn't know if his feelings were that of love. However, he was after all, her first man. No matter what the situation was, he had to help her. He wanted to help her.</p>
 <p>She was the Demon Lord. Qing Shui had no idea if she was someone good or bad. It wasn't easy to judge if a person was good or not. While a person might appear to be good to one, he might appear to be bad to another.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had the feeling that she wasn't a bad person. She was classified so for things that were meant to be from a very long time ago. Many of the people who seemed to be on the side of justice were just people wearing the hide of beasts and were worse than bad people.</p>
 <p>Moreover, even if she was someone bad, Qing Shui still wanted to help her. In this world which revered power, there was no good or bad. There were only the strong and the weak. Those in power are seen to be the good. There was a reason for every cause. It was just like the rascals in Qing Shui's previous life. Even if they were to bully people, they would select who they would bully. They tended to like to bully people who liked to put on a facade, even more than they themselves.</p>
 <p>Of course, this was just an analogy. Interests were placed above everything and there was no classification of good or bad. The most important thing was survival and development.</p>
 <p>"Of course I trust Brother. Alright, after I come back from my Master's place, I'll come to look for you." Tianhe Renmo was full of admiration for Qing Shui's medical skills and he now was even more admiring of Qing Shui himself.</p>
 <p>In their conversation earlier, Qing Shui had confirmed that there was definitely bad blood between Tianhe Renmo and Yelang Clan. However, this seemed to be a matter concerning only the younger generations and the seniors in the clan wouldn't involve themselves in this. However, the other time, Tianhe Renmo had still brought shame to the Tianhe Clan.</p>
 <p>Having lived with such great humiliation for so many years, Tianhe Renmo hadn't expected that he could still attain a breakthrough to False God. As if he had been born with a new life, Tianhe Renmo's fighting spirit had increased and he now had plenty of confidence. The event that had happened was when he was still at Peak Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>Therefore, as long as he could reach Grade Two False God, Tianhe Renmo definitely had a chance. At Peak Grade One False God, he could ensure that he would at least not lose. This was the reason he had come to the continent's capital. So many years had passed. He had no idea how that person in Yelang Clan was doing right now. And there was also her. She was the pain that would stick with Tianhe Renmo for life.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>They continued to travel for over a month, even with the Nine Continents Steps. In the middle, Qing Shui had gone back to Qing Clan once but only stayed for a night before he returned.</p>
 <p>With Yehuang Guwu around, it was easy for him to come and go. At night, they would rest but they would continue to travel at all other times. The Nine Continents Steps had allowed them to reduce the time by several fold.</p>
 <p>Dancing Phoenix Continent!</p>
 <p>The Dancing Phoenix Continent was too vast. Looking at the majestic mountains and rivers, the vast and boundless city seemed to exude a dignified aura. A man must hold great aspirations. Standing in the air and looking at this scene, Qing Shui felt an indescribable sense of comfort.</p>
 <p>"Elder Brother, you should go to visit your Master first. We'll first look for a place to stay before we think of the place where we'll set up a branch for the Imperial Cuisine Hall," Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</p>
 <p>"There's no need for that. Although the Tianhe Clan isn't located in the continent's capital, we have quite a number of assets in the continent's capital. There's a manor that we have that's very suitable for you to set up the Imperial Cuisine Hall. I'll bring you guys there," Tianhe Renmo smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Oh? Then we shan't stand on ceremony then," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"I'll feel bad if you do. I don't have many friends but you're definitely my best friend. My life and what I have today are all given by you. Even if you were to take them away, I wouldn't say a word."</p>
 <p>Tianhe Renmo was saying that no matter how Qing Shui treated him, he would still be considered his greatest friend.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could understand Tianhe Renmo's feelings. This man was one who was clear of his friends and foes. People like him were the best and most suitable to be friends with.</p>
 <p>Three days later, they arrived at the inner city!</p>
 <p>The continent's capital was far too big and was split up to be the outer city and the inner city. However, these two areas were both further segregated into many cities, with the most prosperous being the continent's capital. It was the true continent's capital, just like how it was for capital country of xxx continents and main cities.</p>
 <p>Right now, the group had arrived at the continent's real capital. Some of Tianhe Clan's assets were here as well but they had been suppressed so much that there wasn't much left, with the exception of some manors and businesses. These assets were considered to be negligible for a clan like the Tianhe Clan.</p>
 <p>The prosperity of the city was totally different compared to the other cities. There were many rustic and great manors concentrated together here, all of them being symbols of clans with a long running history.</p>
 <p>Tianhe Renmo brought Qing Shui and the ladies to a manor that didn't appear to be rustic but seemed to have a longer history that the buildings owned by ordinary wealthy merchants. For trade, it was still better to be more luxurious looking. The rustic feelings from buildings were things that were left behind for a very long time, being marks left behind by powerful experts over the many years. It wasn't something that could be created at the time of construction.</p>
 <p>The manor here was very big, with ten very big and tall pavilion buildings. The manor here was also worth a lot of money and was situated in a good location.</p>
 <p>"Brother, I'll give this place to you. I still have to head over to my Master's place." Tianhe Renmo hadn't plan on going in.</p>
 <p>"Alright. If there's any problems, remember to come and look for me here. Remember what I said earlier. Come and look for me here after your trip to visit your Master. When that time comes, I might be able to help you a little," Qing Shui reminded him again.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, I will." Tianhe Renmo said firmly. Since Qing Shui had said that, he knew that Qing Shui still had things backing him up. This young man whom he couldn't see through gave him an unfathomable feeling.</p>
 <p>Tianhe Renmo bade goodbye to Yehuang Guwu and Yuan Su before leaving.</p>
 <p>There were a few maids who were cleaning up and a steward as well. This steward was a man who was about 40 years old and his gaze was unfriendly when looking at Qing Shui. In the past, the money that Tianhe Clan had sent him for managing the maintenance of the manor was already sufficient for him and his family to lead a good life. However, if an outsider were to come and become the owner of the place, it would be very hard for him to live in the place as easily as he hoped to do. He stayed very comfortably here but if someone else were to come, things would be different.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at this man. Although the latter had tried very hard to conceal himself, Qing Shui could still tell what he was thinking. Qing Shui smiled and said, "What's your name?"</p>
 <p>"Zhao Yaowu."</p>
 <p>The man didn't seem to have heard Tianhe Renmo telling Qing Shui that the manor was now his. It could be due to the long time he had been spending in this manor which made him even feel like the manor was his. It might still be more acceptable if the one coming to take over the place was a member of the Tianhe Clan but he knew that the people from Tianhe Clan wouldn't come. After all, the most outstanding young man from Tianhe Clan had been defeated and the fury and anxiety he had felt had caused him to experience Qi Deviation. Therefore, there would always be people coming to find trouble if they were to come and stay.</p>
 <p>As for selling of the manor, it was even more impossible. It would only be done if they were at their wits end. This was especially so for a great clan. As long as they still had the means to progress, they wouldn't sell the manor, even if it meant that they had to leave it idling by the side.</p>
 <p>The man didn't know if this young man was a member of Tianhe Clan but he knew that the young man wouldn't be staying for too long. Toward a person who would find it hard to keep his own life, he wasn't planning to show him a good attitude.</p>
 <p>Even though the man didn't show too much of this on his face, Qing Shui knew that this man was a wicked servant or might have already been driven by greed to the extent that he no longer knew of his own standing and wasn't aware that Qing Shui could get him to scram at anytime.</p>
 <p>"How many years have you been staying here?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>"30 years."</p>
 <p>"It's been 30 years. It hasn't been a short while," Qing Shui continued to smile and said.</p>
 <p>"That's right. No one is more familiar with this place than myself. No one has more feelings for this place than myself," Zhao Yaowu said proudly.</p>
 <p>"But you're only a steward here. It just takes one word if I wish for you to leave this place." After saying that, Qing Shui smiled and headed to the pavilion buildings at the back together with the two ladies.</p>
 <p>Zhao Yaowu looked at the two ladies of unparalleled beauty and his lustful gaze landed on their beautiful butts. At this moment, Qing Shui suddenly turned back and with a wave of his arm, Zhao Yaowu was sent flying as he spewed out blood.</p>
 <p>"Scram. If you take another step in here in the future, then you'll bear the consequences yourself." Qing Shui was infuriated. His women were his reverse scales. If this steward didn't show such an expression, then he wouldn't have chased him out right now.</p>
 <p>Zhao Yaowu threw a fierce glare at Qing Shui before leaving in a pathetic state.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was deliberately showing off his strength as a warning.This Zhao Yaowu was definitely related to some powers. Otherwise, being just a servant, he couldn't possibly to be so audacious.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Qing Shui wanted to see who were the ones who didn't know any better. Even if it wasn't the Yelang Clan, they would definitely have a very close relationship with the Yelang Clan. He still needed some time before he could set up his Imperial Cuisine Hall. Therefore, right now, Qing Shui wanted to keep a high profile. It would be even better if he could get some people involved. If that were to happen, the starting up of the Imperial Cuisine Hall would come naturally.</p>
