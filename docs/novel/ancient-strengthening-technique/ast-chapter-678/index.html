 <p><strong>AST 678 - Yet another progression in relationships, the shy Di Chen</strong></p>
 <p>After a while, Di Chen opened up the door and walked out wearing pure white colored pajamas. At this moment, Qing Shui, who saw the scene was completely stunned.</p>
 <p>She was so beautiful… Beautiful to the point that words were simply unable to express it. Di Chen’s elegance was something that had been incomparable all along. Her pale white skin and jet-black brows always looked so extraordinarily beautiful. Her fine nose had just about the right sharpness and her slender body was extremely attractive. Her gentle curves were able to shock people. The white powder that she had on her added on an elegant aura to her look.</p>
 <p>When Di Chen saw Qing Shui’s blank look, she let out a gentle smile and approached him: “What are you thinking about? Are you not able to recognize me anymore?”</p>
 <p>Every single one of her twinkles and smiles had a fatal charm to it. Most importantly, every single one felt extremely elegant and cute coming from Di Chen. Qing Shui never expected that this would actually happen on Di Chen.</p>
 <p>“You look really good……” Qing Shui came back to his senses. He didn’t know what to say. Hence, he made up a bold statement.</p>
 <p>“Which part of me looks beautiful?” Di Chen walked up to Qing Shui, held his hand and walked to the soft and comfortable white beast skin sofa at the side. They sat down beside each other.</p>
 <p>“They all look beautiful. Your face, nose, eyes, mouth, ears, neck, shoulders as well as your breast…….” Before Qing Shui managed to finish, his mouth was already covered by Di Chen’s hand.</p>
 <p>“Stop saying it.” Di Chen shyly stopped Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Alright alright, I’ll stop talking about that.” Di Chen’s pajamas went all the way down to her feet. Only her pale feet were exposed to the air, adding on an extraordinarily elegant feeling to her, making her looked like a goddess who came down from heaven.</p>
 <p>“Why are you out at this time? You missed me?” Qing Shui pulled Di Chen’s hand and smiled.</p>
 <p>Looking at Qing Shui’s current appearance, Di Chen felt that Qing Shui truly had changed. He had turned out to be a person who was able to support both heaven and earth. The little man who was once self-abased in front of her had truly grown up to be a confident person.</p>
 <p>She felt a sense of joy. As she thought about the time when he got hurt, she couldn’t help but blush from the things she said at that time. She never expected herself to actually say something like this to someone.</p>
 <p>“I miss you……” Di Chen told Qing Shui gently with a smile.</p>
 <p>“You really missed me?” Originally, Qing Shui thought that Di Chen would either deny it or refute it. He never expected her to admit it so calmly. This actually stunned him.</p>
 <p>“I missed you too… Chen`Er, you mentioned that you’re my woman before. Come, call me your husband.” Qing Shui smiled at Di Chen. This woman had completely blushed because of him.</p>
 <p>“I’m not calling you that!” Di Chen blushed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and looked at Di Chen: “It’s either you call me your husband or we do something that only husband and wife can do. You choose.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the woman who was really shy at the moment and felt a kind of indescribable feeling through his body. That kind of feeling was like when the spirit left one’s body. He felt really satisfied both mentally and physically.</p>
 <p>“Do not tease me like that.” Di Chen glared at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled. He didn’t say anything. He grabbed one of her hands while slowly embracing her with his other hand. After that, he slowly got closer to her.</p>
 <p>“Chen`Er, not calling me your husband would mean that you want to sleep with me. Wow, coincidentally, I have the intention to do so, we happen to be having the same view.” Qing Shui smiled as he slowly got closer to Di Chen.</p>
 <p>“Alright Qing Shui, cut it out.” Di Chen blushed because of Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qing Shui quickly got close to her and attached his lips to Di Chen’s mouth. It felt soft yet delicate. For a moment, the fragrant smooth feeling made Qing Shui a bit lost.</p>
 <p>Di Chen was stunned. She never expected Qing Shui to be so bold. Her body turned rigid as she subconsciously opened up her small mouth.</p>
 <p>At the most crucial moment, Qing Shui came back to his senses. When it comes to kissing, Qing Shui was quite skillful. He quickly extended his tongue all the way into Di Chen’s mouth. The moment it came in contact with the small tongue of hers, Qing Shui felt as if he had entered a fantasy.</p>
 <p>He greedily licked Di Chen’s saliva in her mouth. His tongue was really agile between her snow white teeth. After that, he started curling around her tongue as if he wanted to swallow it whole.</p>
 <p>He didn’t actually swallow it however……. He was only sucking it back into his mouth.</p>
 <p>Di Chen’s body was stiff. By the time she recovered, she has already been attacked by Qing Shui. What made her feel even more ashamed was that her tongue was actually in Qing Shui’s mouth.</p>
 <p>She didn’t know how she felt at the moment. The only thing she felt was her extremely fast heartbeat. It was as if her heart was about to burst out. She was feeling nervous and shy and quickly pushed Qing Shui away. She didn’t know where she got such strength from.</p>
 <p>At the moment when the two separated from each other, a sparkling thin thread was connected between their lips. It was almost a foot long. It was right there connecting the two to one another.</p>
 <p>Di Chen was so shy that her face felt as hot as fire. She was still embraced by Qing Shui. At this moment, the thin sparkling thread between the two caused her to feel so ashamed that she was unable to show her face.</p>
 <p>Di Chen slightly raised her head. Only after that did the thread break off. She didn’t dare to look at Qing Shui. Qing Shui on the other hand, fixed his gaze on Di Chen while reminiscing about the feeling back when he was about to be killed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was well aware that it was impossible for them to be husband and wife before they even kissed. Hence, he planned to first tease her a little to help make a breakthrough to their relationship.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui looked at the small woman who was just like an unmatched beauty at this moment, Qing Shui was infatuated with the kind of aura which she gave offt. But he was aware that they had just started and he needed to know his limit. After all, Di Chen wasn’t like any other woman. Even though it wasn’t as bad as Zhu Qing’s, she did not harbour any good opinions of men either.</p>
 <p>“You’re getting naughtier and naughtier.” Di Chen raised her head and looked at Qing Shui. There was still faint powder on her beautiful face. It almost made Qing Shui lose control over himself. He tried his best to recover the flame in his heart.</p>
 <p>“How am I naughty if the woman I’m kissing is my woman……”</p>
 <p>“Who’s your woman……?”</p>
 <p>“You said before that you’re my woman.” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p>At the time Qing Shui was injured, Di Chen had said before that she was his woman. Hence, she felt a bit shy and anxious when Qing Shui mentioned it. She felt that she shouldn’t have said stuff like that.</p>
 <p>“Chen`Er, you’re my woman, you’re my buddy for life! I love you, I don’t know how to express it. Sometimes, I would even feel like swallowing you whole… I really want to hold you in my heart.” Qing Shui felt really blessed. He didn’t really know how to express his feelings and thus said it in quite a random way. He didn’t want Di Chen to have any worries.”</p>
 <p>“At that time, the things that I said… Would it have been better…….”</p>
 <p>No matter how beautiful a woman was, once they found a place where their heart belonged, they would often begin to worry about their gains and losses. Woman often wished to be perfect. They would never allow themselves to have the slightest bit of defects in front of the person they loved.</p>
 <p>“The only thing that I know is that I really love hearing it. At that time when you said that you’re my woman, it made me felt that my entire life was worth it. You’re perfect, perfect to the point where it would make ordinary people feel ashamed of their inferiority. Yet they would never expect you to admire a normal person like me.” Qing Shui meant it when he said it.</p>
 <p>“You only know how to lie to me!” Di Chen smiled and shot a glance at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“I swear that none of the things that I’m saying are……”</p>
 <p>Di Chen quickly covered Qing Shui’s mouth: “You really are an idiot. Do not simply make oaths next time.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui let out his tongue and licked Di Chen’s white hands. This caused Di Chen to quickly retract her hands and glare at Qing Shui grumpily. But she wasn’t actually angry.</p>
 <p>“Call me your husband. Shall we practice kissing?” Qing Shui embraced Di Chen. The two of their faces were less than an inch away from each other. They could even feel each other’s breath.</p>
 <p>“Husband!” Di Chen looked at Qing Shui with a shy expression as he approached her yet again. She hurriedly called him her husband except she did it with her face facing down.</p>
 <p>“Good girl, here, let your husband kiss you……”</p>
 <p>“You rascal……”</p>
 <p>When Di Chen finished speaking, Di Chen looked at Qing Shui with a misty-eyed expression. This very expression caused Qing Shui to boldly kiss her once again. Not only that, he even started to slowly press her against the soft “sofa”.</p>
 <p>This time, Qing Shui had become a bit lost in lust. He kissed her greedily. From time to time, he would let out noises which would make people blush. He had also begun to feel a soft squeezing sensation. For a moment, Qing Shui was lost in the sea of greed.</p>
 <p>At the moment Qing Shui felt a sharp pain in his tongue, he felt as if he woke up from his dream. At this moment, Di Chen was still wearing her pajamas. However, one of Qing Shui’s hands was already grabbing her ample, sharp, plump and perfectly shaped breast…...</p>
 <p>“Stinky bastard, get up quick!” Di Chen said grumpily.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly sat upright. He almost said sorry. But soon, he realized that it would be better if he didn’t say it because it wasn’t necessary for him to do so if it was about things like this.</p>
 <p>“Is it still painful?” Di Chen asked Qing Shui embarrassingly. Prior to this, the little brat had also gone too far. She was out of options, that’s why she bit his tongue.</p>
 <p>“No, it’s not painful… You can bite me whenever you want……”</p>
 <p>“Alright then, I’m going to sleep now. You should rest early too.” After Di Chen finished speaking, she quickly left. She noticed that she would definitely be ‘eaten’ up by him if she continued staying here.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui fell asleep in the study room. He only woke up when the sky turned bright. By the time he went out, Di Chen had already woken up. Qing Shui felt a bit shy when he saw Di Chen. Nevertheless, he still greeted her with a smile.</p>
 <p>After washing up, Qing Shui walked out of his room and practiced his Taichi Fist. This had become one of Qing Shui’s habits. It was also a routine which he found really important. Only by practicing Taichi Fist would he be able to raise his Nature Energy and Minute Subtlety.</p>
 <p>Taichi Fist could help cultivate one’s moral character and mentality as well as increase one’s energy. Furthermore, it could also help increase blood flow and strengthen the connection between the external and internal parts of the body. This caused the body to feel even more pleasant, resulting in a more powerful display in strength and explosive power.</p>
 <p>“Uncle!”</p>
 <p>Di Xian who had been standing beside Qing Shui all the time only approached him after he finished practicing the Taichi Fist.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui really liked this girl who was around fifteen to sixteen years of age. With Qing Shui’s current maturity added up with his two lives as a human, the children that he had would have been older than her. Even Luan Luan was slightly older than her.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the little brat was really polite. She only approached him after he finished training.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, what’s up?” Qing Shui asked while smiling.</p>
 <p>“You promised me that you’d teach me how to cultivate! When are you going to do it?” Di Xian pouted at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“How about now?” Qing Shui thought about it for a while. He didn’t want to upset the little brat. Hence, he planned to teach her for half an hour everyday after his morning exercises.</p>
 <p>“Alright alright!” Di Xian said happily.</p>
 <p>“What do you want to learn?” Qing Shui asked after thinking for a while. He was curious on what she wanted to learn.</p>
 <p>“I want to learn the battle technique where you hit people with iron balls!” Di Xian sounded really nervous when she said it. After all, from her perspective, the techniques which Qing Shui used should be something that he kept for himself.</p>
 <p>“Are you sure that’s what you want to learn?”</p>
