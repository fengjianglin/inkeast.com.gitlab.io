 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was rather satisfied with his current strength and despite losing some part of the Immortal Dao Divine Origin, it was not a total waste. Previously, he could only rely on his own powerful defensive power and resilience, but now he apparently needed them no more. His current strength was daunting enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was pleased to have the Parry Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda. Before this, only less than 30 million Dao Force could be blocked. Now, literally 200 million Dao Force could be mitigated. Coupled with his 300 million defense power, Qing Shui was an invincible man now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the Parry Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda came in handy with its powerful effect; almost overturning the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Absorbing the powerful energy in his body, it was like a penniless beggar who became a wealthy man overnight. The feeling of the transformation was amazing. In fact, Qing Shui felt even greater than the situation above.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qi flowed throughout his body and moved swiftly like a dragon. Qing Shui flashed freely across the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. He moved rapidly up and down, leaving traces of his shadow. His hands waved and performed the Taichi Fist, Ancient God Thirteen Steps, Saintly Hands, and so on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The precious trait of the Immortal Dao Divine Origin was its ability to strengthen one’s foundation. Hence, Qing Shui didn’t need to worry about his realm. Qing Shui’s realm remained but it was sufficient; he could perform optimally with his current strength now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don't have to be so careful as before anymore,” Qing Shui said while putting up the happiest smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three years of living in seclusion, or maybe not seclusion, Qing Shui had been independent of any force. The outstanding Art of Healing from the Imperial Cuisine Hall had spread further now. In these three years, Qing Shui wasted most of his time on Art of Healing. Since he intended to become the Imperial Doctor, he certainly needed to raise his reputation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were many Imperial Doctors and Immortal Doctors, but they were nothing. Most importantly, Qing Shui could treat anyone without being tied to any forces. He would not request payment for treating or saving people, especially for the capable ones. Instead, he would use another way, such as asking for a favor or assistance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The stronger a warrior was, the more he appreciated his life. After all, his life and death alone could change the entire family’s condition. It was common for a warrior to be injured; thus, nobody could guarantee to live without any illnesses and disasters. In this case, Qing Shui as the Imperial Doctor would play a very essential role.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if someone wanted to go against the Imperial Cuisine Hall and Qing Shui, a lot of people would disagree, this was also the ability of a successful doctor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After staying for a moment, it was almost time, so Qing Shui left the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It appeared to be still early outside, but it was already bright. However, it felt like cloudy days all the time in Linhai City. Stepping out of the room, Qing Shui bumped into Tantai Lingyan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Morning!” Qing Shui greeted with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan looked at Qing Shui in astonishment. In just one night, this man seemed to change a little. In fact, there was a major transformation. Now, Qing Shui appeared more mature. Though he still looked young and his eyes were still bright, it was slightly peculiar and enticing. However, there was a sense of maturity, very prominent maturity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mm, morning, why do you look strange today,” Tantai Lingyan said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within three years, Qing Shui was close to this woman, but they had yet to become an actual husband and wife. Putting aside the incident when they first met, it never happened again over these years, the furthest they had been was kissing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was speechless about himself, he owed everything to his superb self-control after all. However, he was ashamed of this excuse…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Really, Little Yan Yan,” Qing Shui stared at this remarkable beauty while wetting his lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan knocked on Qing Shui's head, “I noticed no change.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was unsure of his personality, he was a nobleman and just person on the outside. More importantly, he was a steady man. However, he acted differently in front of his woman and was exceptionally shameless in front of Tantai Lingyan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did not acknowledge himself as a baffled person, but he indeed had a strong ego and little endurance. As his strength increased, his women would admire his endurance very much. Since his women were all outstanding, Qing Shui gained his confidence as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was true when people said ‘one would be more shameless, confident and forgiving when he had greater strength.’ Everything depended mainly on strength nowadays and the dexterity would be enhanced as the strength improved. Therefore, everything would be more efficient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mm, Qing Shui, let’s practice some sword skills,” Tantai Lingyan continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was not the first time Qing Shui accompanied her during the sword practice. Qing Shui smiled in joy and it made Tantai Lingyan blush. Qing Shui then grabbed Tantai Lingyan and disappeared in the corner of the yard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Continents Steps!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a beautiful valley and also a place he used to visit frequently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The valley was moderate in size, but since the boundary was easily visible, they could see very far with their sharp eyesight. There were plenty of green grass and bushes which were dense and short like a trimmed lawn; they were so thick that one could step on them. Around the area, there were only a few trees, not very tall, scattering over the area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a clear and small lake in the middle. Several birds were drinking by the lake; at times, some dainty beasts appeared too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The weather was fine and unlike Linhai City, it was very bright here. The clothes billowed in the gentle breeze. Looking at the pretty woman by his side who was holding a sword, Qing Shui felt like she was almost blown away with her fluttering long cuff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s begin!” Tantai Lingyan smiled while raising the Angelic Sword in her hands slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded, his hands became crystal clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mm, you’re not using any weapon?” Tantai Lingyan experienced a massive breakthrough in three years, her Glacier Divine Sword’s current attacking power exceeded 3 million Dao Force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Tantai Lingyan could practice the Glacier Divine Sword up to this level. Moreover, she only took such a short period to master it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Tantai Lingyan’s improvement and transformation within three years. She was also one of those who improved greatly among the rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I refined the Immortal Dao Divine Origin,” Qing Shui did not explain further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan pondered and startled. After all, Qing Shui had not refined it for three years and suddenly he said that he had done it today. Nevertheless, she was delighted. The sword in her hand stabbed towards Qing Shui with a hint of coldness.</span></p>
