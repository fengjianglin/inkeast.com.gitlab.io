 <p><strong>AST 1267 - My Calm Mental State Has Been Completely Destroyed By You</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Di Chen unknowingly stayed at the Diwu Clan till it turned dark. Diwu Zhisha tried to make them to stay, but he still wanted to go back to the Heaven Secrets Academy before the new year. Therefore, he didn't wish to waste even one day worth of the Nine Continents Steps.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Qing Shui was so insistent, Diwu Zhisha stopped persisting and told them to be careful on their way.</p>
 <p>After he bid them goodbye, Qing Shui used the Nine Continents Steps directly, proceeding forth 20 times in a row while he carried Di Chen. Although Di Chen didn't know how far they had travelled each time, she knew that it was very far. She looked at Qing Shui in astonishment.</p>
 <p>"In the future, I'll bring you around with the Nine Continents Steps. There are places which we can go directly. We can stay a little longer at beautiful places, but there are also places which we should just skipped through." The upgrade of the Nine Continents Steps this time around was beyond estimation.</p>
 <p>After he used the Nine Continents Steps 20 times consecutively, Qing Shui called out his Fire Bird. The color of the black bird, which was the same as a black jade, gave off a different kind of astonishing beauty. When Di Chen saw the Fire Bird, she was clearly taken aback. "You've gotten another Luan-typed demonic beast?"</p>
 <p>"This is that Fire Bird. I hadn't expected that he would become like this either. Why not let it be a match for your Blue Luan?" Qing Shui took Di Chen's hand and jumped up.</p>
 <p>"Be serious. Stop with your smooth-talk." Di Chen had already gotten used to this man's teasing, and he was the only one who would dare to tease her like this. However, she liked this. There were people who tried hard to appear in their best before her but then take any possible chance to stare at her. It was fine if she didn't notice but if she did, it would feel very distasteful.</p>
 <p>"Is my tongue really that smooth?" Qing Shui smiled and put his face close.</p>
 <p>Di Chen blushed. She had no way to deal with Qing Shui. This man knew his limits well and the best way to deal with him is to change the topic.</p>
 <p>"Where should I go after leaving the Lotus Sect?"</p>
 <p>"If you were to leave the Lotus Sect, I'd like for you to go to the Heaven Secrets Academy. In the future, the control over the Heaven Secrets Academy would be in you guys' hands." Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</p>
 <p>People from his previous life would say that women must have their own career and can't be overly reliant on men. All intelligent women would know this. It was because if they were to become too reliant on men, they would just be like decorative vases. However, their lifespan as decorative vases won't be long and their attractiveness would drop as the time passed. Although Qing Shui wasn't fully agreeable to such thinking, he felt that it did make sense. And earlier, from what Di Chen had said, it was clear that she didn't want to just be a decorative vase.</p>
 <p>"You guys?" Di Chen looked at Qing Shui, puzzled.</p>
 <p>"Great Yu Dynasty's Eldest Princess is also at the Heaven Secrets Academy. I had initially planned on letting her gain control of the Heaven Secrets Academy. It'll be even better if you can do the job since I'll feel even more confident then." Qing Shui said quickly. He hadn't told Di Chen about the matter with the Eldest Princess previously. It wasn't because he was trying to hide anything, since there were no way he could keep things hidden.</p>
 <p>"Oh? Seems like this is another soul mate of our Young Master Qing." Di Chen smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Nothing has happened between us yet." Qing Shui said as he appeared to be a little guilty.</p>
 <p>"You pick other things up really fast, but it's a pity that you still don't know how to lie." Di Chen said happily.</p>
 <p>"There's still nothing that has happened between us. Aren't you angry?" Qing Shui said, a little awkward.</p>
 <p>"I am. From the very start when I met you, I knew that you won't have just one woman. What's the difference with a few more?" Di Chen said, relaxed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui never knew Di Chen's real thoughts and he hugged her gently. "Having you is already a great blessing for me, but I'm just a b*stard. All of you are very outstanding and I can't bear to let go of any of you."</p>
 <p>"Are you a fool? Who's asking you to let go? If you're one who likes new and discards the old, and is an unfeeling person, who would be willing to stay with you? This is life, you don't have to feel this way. I'm very happy now too." Di Chen touched Qing Shui's face. Her beautiful face that could cause the downfall of countries and cities now was full of tenderness and love.</p>
 <p>"I've once had a dream of another world. In that world, every man can only be married to one woman. They're not allowed to have two wives. If one wished to have two women, he must do it secretly and only one of the woman could be given an official status. I'd dreamt that I had a very bad life there, not having a single woman with me, and no one likes me..."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Di Chen and slowly said some stuff. He won't tell anyone his own secret. This secret could only be left to rot in his body.</p>
 <p>As long as humans can't enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui would also keep it a secret forever. He didn't know if it was possible for people to stay in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, but he felt that the chances of it being possible wouldn't be high. However, it wouldn't be totally impossible.</p>
 <p>In the world of cultivators, when one reached the realm of False Gods, the person would be like a god who was on earth. Those people should have many treasured items with them. However, Qing Shui still felt that there weren't many which could compare to the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>"That's your dreams. Dreams are the direct opposite to reality. It seems like you're very scared of losing us. Otherwise, you wouldn't have a dream like this."</p>
 <p>"You're my baby. In this life, the next life, and the life after, you'll still be mine." Qing Shui said with dominance.</p>
 <p>"Greedy guy." Di Chen smiled in reply.</p>
 <p>"Oh, right, why didn't you let Sister Ruyan go to the Heaven Secrets Academy?" Di Chen knew that Yu Ruyan had come.</p>
 <p>"She's at Putuo Mountain."</p>
 <p>"Since you have a soulmate in the Heaven Secrets Academy, wouldn't it be better for her to be in the Heaven Secrets Academy?" Di Chen looked at Qing Shui and asked.</p>
 <p>"Ruyan and a member of the Putuo Mountain are close as sisters and thus she had chosen to stay at Putuo Mountain. Moreover at that time, I hadn't gone to the Heaven Secrets Academy yet." Qing Shui felt a little guilty as well when he mentioned the Putuo Mountain, but it was still fine since there was really nothing between him and Tantai Xuan.</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, it had already turned dark.</p>
 <p>"Let's go down to have a rest and continue the journey early tomorrow morning."</p>
 <p>As she heard Qing Shui's words, Di Chen's expression appeared to be a little unnatural but she still nodded.</p>
 <p>This was a boundless stretch of desolate land, an empty space between dynasties, and one wouldn't be able to see the end to it. However, it was a pity that the land was very barren and even the ground were like rocks, with not even a stalk of grass.</p>
 <p>"Hmm? You're blushing. Are you thinking of some unhealthy things?" Qing Shui's hand reached into her clothes with great experience.</p>
 <p>"You little rascal. My calm mental state has been completely destroyed by you." Di Chen said, aggrieved. However, she didn't stop him and allowed his hand to reach under his clothes as she sensed the feeling from his hands that seemed to have a demonic attraction.</p>
 <p>"Living humans are guided by their seven emotions and six desires. This is the difference between humans and demonic beasts. Eradicating one's emotions and desires is harmful in the long run and one would eventually become like an emotionless demonic beast, like a walking corpse. Cultivating doesn't mean that one must be void of emotions and desires but it's just that one must be able to control his own emotions and desires, allowing themselves to be the one to guide their emotions and desires." Qing Shui looked at the extremely charming Di Chen and said seriously.</p>
 <p>"I know these. You're not allowed to reach your hand lower any further." Di Chen panted slightly and said.</p>
 <p>"Just let me touch a little. I promise not to put my hand in." Qing Shui said softly next to her ears and then lick her beautiful cheeks and went around.</p>
 <p>"If you were to stick your tongue out, I'll cut it off for you." Di Chen trembled uncontrollably. Qing Shui's tongue made her felt beyond ticklish.</p>
 <p>"My tongue has other uses. Without it, you'll have one less experience..."</p>
 <p>"Die!"</p>
 <p>Di Chen pushed away Qing Shui, embarrassed. Her face was completely flushed red. That day, Qing Shui kissed her entire body but she managed to block the most crucial part. She knew what he was referring to. Those words made her felt very anxious and her heart beat very fast.</p>
 <p>She felt that she had been corrupted.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that it would probably take a very long time to get this goddess to let herself loose. It was already a tremendous improvement to go through what they had done today. One must take his meal very slowly, one mouthful at a time.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui set up the tent for Di Chen and wanted to enter but was shut out by her. He shamelessly bite her gently all over before he returned to his tent.</p>
 <p>In the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, it was just cultivation after cultivation for him. With the two Spiritual Medicinal Beasts, the Treasure Hunting Pig and the Jade Emperor Queen Bee, the plants in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal grew at a rate that was several times faster than before. Most importantly was their medicinal effects. Right now, Qing Shui no longer had to be so rigid in the pursuit of their years. As long as the effect was there, even one that was only ten or a hundred years would work.</p>
 <p>It was a pity that the grade of the Spiritual Medicinal Beasts were still quite low.</p>
 <p>He had accumulated quite a lot of the Spring of Life. That ‘small well’ was already filled up to the depth of one's palm. However, its base was like in a conical shape and thus, there weren't a lot but it wasn't very little either. This thing was far too precious.</p>
 <p>Cultivation. Right now, Qing Shui had additional things that he would need to cultivate. He needed to temper the Nine Continents Mountain and the Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p>This time around, Qing Shui helped Di Chen to reforge her weapon. However, it was a pity that he wasn't as lucky this time around. It neither became a legendary grade nor a spiritual weapon. However, the increase in its prowess still made Di Chen very satisfied with it.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Two days before the new year, Qing Shui and Di Chen arrived at the Heaven Secrets Academy. As he looked at the towering buildings, Qing Shui realized that everything here seemed to feel a little familiar. It might be because right now, there were people that he knew here.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui brought Di Chen back to his own manor. When he arrived at the door, he saw the Eldest Princess there. When the latter saw Di Chen, the two ladies assessed each other.</p>
 <p>"Congratulations on successfully achieving your goal." The Eldest Princess smiled and said to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Hello, I'm Yu Sunu. He has brought you up countless times and has been trying to get news of you around in the Great Yu Dynasty. Only a beauty like yourself would be so unforgettable for him." The Eldest Princess smiled and greeted Di Chen.</p>
 <p>"Hello, I'm Di Chen. He said that you're his soulmate. Stop praising me. You'll also be praising yourself when you do, since you're in no way inferior to me." Di Chen went up to take Yu Sunu’s hand and said.</p>
 <p>"I had met you once back in the Divine Might Dynasty three years ago. You give me a very familiar feeling, as if we've known each other for very long."</p>
 <p>"I have the same feeling as well. Why don't we address each other as sisters?" Di Chen knew that this lady would also be a part of Qing Shui's life in the future and decided to help him along.</p>
 <p>"I can't ask for anything better!"</p>
 <p>Sometimes, Qing Shui would have the feeling that a lady's thoughts are unfathomable. However, he was very happy to see this scene. He sort of knew that Di Chen was doing it for him, and the Eldest Princess could be doing the same as well.</p>
 <p>In a short while, Qing Sha, Yan Jinyu, and the Seventh Princess came.</p>
 <p>"Father!"</p>
 <p>When Qing Sha saw Qing Shui, she ran over happily and wrapped her arms around him.</p>
 <p>When Di Chen saw Qing Sha, she was also taken aback. Di Chen knew that Qing Yin was Qing Shui's oldest daughter but even she wasn't this old.</p>
 <p>Yan Jinyu and the Seventh Princess both looked at the unrivaled beauty who was in no way inferior to the Eldest Princess. They then looked at Qing Shui and thought that this man really was blessed with women.</p>
