 <p><strong>&lt;AST 1195 - Unintentional killing intent, Scarlet Flame Sect</strong></p>
 <p>When Qing Shui heard the Eldest Princess being mentioned once again, he smiled and asked, “Is she coming for the Fifth Princess’s wedding?”</p>
 <p>“Hehe, you are right but at the same time also wrong!” The Seventh Princess smiled and said. She looked really beautiful. It was a kind of serene beauty. It was perhaps because the weapon Qing Shui helped her forge was too good, causing her to constantly be in a state of excitement.</p>
 <p>“How can it be both right and wrong?”</p>
 <p>“Because the wedding day was intentionally set on the day the Eldest Princess returns, rather than her coming back for the wedding.” The Seventh Princess smiled as she explained</p>
 <p>Qing Shui understood now. The Eldest Princess truly had a respected status.</p>
 <p>“Is this weapon powerful?” Yan Jinyu asked puzzledly. Both Yan Yangzhao and herself were really curious. There were very few weapons that could make Seventh Princess so stirred up.</p>
 <p>“A legendary weapon. Do you think it’s powerful,” the Seventh Princess’s reply immediately made the two freeze in shock.</p>
 <p>After a long while, both Yan Jinyu and Yan Yangzhao looked at Qing Shui dumbstruck. He had actually forged a legendary weapon.</p>
 <p>After a legendary weapon recognizes an owner, they would be able to communicate and establish a terrifying compatibility, so much so that they would be able to connect themselves to their owner’s spirit energy and be able to murder people with flying swords. This level surpassed even Qing Shui’s hidden weapons.</p>
 <p>This was also what made legendary weapons totally different from ordinary weapons. Once a legendary weapon recognized its master, as long as the Owner Recognizing Method isn’t removed, it would constantly increase its owner’s strength regardless of whether the weapon was in their hands. One way for them to stop recognizing their owner was to kill their owner. Alternatively, an extreme expert could also forcefully erase the imprint on the sword.</p>
 <p>Legendary grade, just as its name states, it’s already a legendary object. Why would they not be shocked? Qing Shui helplessly shook his head, “There are only that much Yang Stone. If there was one more, I would definitely keep this sword for myself and help her forge another one. I can only say that she is really lucky.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s words made the Seventh Princess laugh. She laughed because of Qing Shui’s honesty. He was a very honest person. If it had been someone else, they would definitely not give it to her. She was certain that they might even take the sword and run away. He instead was willing to tell her something like this, which meant that he really liked this sword too.</p>
 <p>Considering that he was able to give her the sword even though he liked it a lot, this meant that he was a frank person and was extremely principled. This kind of person was worth being friends with.</p>
 <p>“This is the first legendary weapon that I have forged. I don’t know when I will be able to forge another one.” Qing Shui said with a smile, trusting that they would know what he meant.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t want others to know that he could forge legendary weapons. If experts were to look for him to forge legendary weapons, it would make things difficult for him.</p>
 <p>“I know, I won’t tell anyone and cause others to make things difficult for you.” the Seventh Princess smiled intelligently and said.</p>
 <p>“But don’t you want people to know about you? This is a very good chance for you to raise the reputation of the Firecloud Blacksmith Store.” the Seventh Princess asked as she continued talking.</p>
 <p>“At the moment, I still lack the strength to protect myself. If people with bad intentions were to find out about this, I might be stolen away……” Qing Shui smiled and responded.</p>
 <p>Both the girls laughed when they heard what he said. In that instant, they both looked like flowers that had just blossomed. The beauty that they showed was very attractive. Qing Shui quietly avoided it.</p>
 <p>The girl was still beside Qing Shui. She didn’t speak and didn’t laugh. However, people felt very natural about it because she had acted this way from the beginning.</p>
 <p>They arrived at the Yan Clan very quickly, the Dragon Horse Cart went straight into the Yan Clan. When it stopped, they got off the cart. In just a short while, people from the Yan Clan, including Yan Dingtian came out. This time, Qing Shui was able to vaguely sense Yan Dingtian’s strength even though he was still unsure of the exact level.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing Qing Shui, Yan Dingtian’s eyes brightened and had a surprised and stifled expression. Qing Shui also sensed it. He knew that his increase in strength made him somewhat terrified or apprehensive. Most importantly, Qing Shui actually saw a trace of killing intent in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was really uncomfortable under Yan Dingtian’s gaze. Nevertheless, he still greeted him with a smile. He was aware that he would be leaving quite soon, most likely after Yan Yangchi’s wedding.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, you’re here, let’s take a walk together. It’s all thanks to you that the Yan Clan managed to escape suffering.” Yan Dingtian warmly pulled Qing Shui along.</p>
 <p>Even now, Qing Shui was unable to tell what Yan Dingtian was thinking about. Experts like him were often very unpredictable. All along, he had had a good impression of Yan Dingtian. Merely, the momentary killing intent had leaked unconsciously. Perhaps it was normal but nevertheless, he already had his own thoughts.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was aware that he had snatched a lot of the Yan Clan’s reputation when he represented them. He treated the Yan Clan as his friends only because of Yan Jinyu and the others. He didn’t really have any relations with the seniors of the Yan Clan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was already treating this feast as a leaving banquet. At most, he might visit once more during Yan Yangchi’s wedding. Actually, he knew from the beginning that he was just a passing traveller. If there was anything for him to remember, it would be Yan Jinyu as she was his sworn sister. Since they had already acknowledged each other, regardless of the reason, they had kowtowed to heaven and earth. As long as it was allowed, they would be brother and sister forever.</p>
 <p>No one knew what Qing Shui was thinking in his heart. He also knew that Yan Dingtian would definitely not act against him. However, this was a common problem within aristocratic clans. The aristocratic clan would restrict him, causing Qing Shui to eliminate thoughts of having close ties with the entire Yan Clan.</p>
 <p>The family feast this time was very harmonious. Yan Dingtian’s eyes once again wavered when he saw the little girl. He asked Qing Shui who she was. Qing Shui randomly found an excuse to dodge the question. Yan Dingtian greeted the little girl but the little girl didn’t respond.</p>
 <p>This made Yan Dingtian feel quite awkward. Qing Shui quickly came out to try to solve the problem.</p>
 <p>“Father, didn’t you have something to tell us? Qing Shui has also arrived, why don’t you say it?” Yan Huoyun sat next to Yan Dingtian and said while acting like a spoiled child.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw Yan Dingtian’s pampering expression while looking at his daughter. He was a great father.</p>
 <p>“Rong City which is near the Scarlet Flame Region has been occupied by people from the Scarlet Flame Region. I am planning to get you guys to lead people there to eliminate them,” Yan Dingtian said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“It’s the people from Scarlet Flame Region again! This time, we have to exterminate them!” Yan Hu said furiously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sat there and didn’t say anything. Scarlet Flame Region was at the intersection between the Great Yu Dynasty and the Great Virtue Dynasty. It was a vast and incomparably hot area. The people within it were mostly those who couldn’t survive either dynasty, with the majority of them being warriors. Throughout these years, they had actually become a unique force. They took on the responsibility to destroy both the Great Yu Dynasty and Great Virtue Dynasty.</p>
 <p>“There would be people from the other clans as well as people from the royal family joining the expedition this time. It can be considered setting up a peaceful situation for Yanchi’s wedding. During this period of time, the Scarlet Flame Region has been too savage!” Yan Dingtian chuckled.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, will you be going? I heard that those people have many good items. They might even have a small piece of Yang Stone.” Seventh Princess smiled as she looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>It had already been mentioned that this was to set up a peaceful situation for Yan Yangchi’s wedding. Therefore, Qing Shui was unable to decline. After all, he also wanted to have a look at the people from Scarlet Flame Region. If he was in luck, he might be able to get a few decent objects.</p>
 <p>“Since everyone is going, I will naturally have to go for the sake of Brother Yan’s wedding,” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>They agreed to set off in two days. Everyone would take these two days to rest and reorganize while they wait for the rest to gather before heading to Rong City together.</p>
 <p>After the banquet ended, Yan Dingtian and the others left. The Seventh Princess looked at Qing Shui and said softly, “Qing Shui, can I give the sword to someone else?”</p>
 <p>She spoke really softly, as if she was scared that Qing Shui would be unwilling to allow it. This also made her feel weird.</p>
 <p>“It’s yours. Of course it’s ok as long as you want to.” Qing Shui responded after pausing for a moment. He never imagined that someone would actually give such a strong weapon to someone else after they got it.</p>
 <p>“Thank you!” the Seventh Princess said happily.</p>
 <p>“Oh, I got it. The Eldest Princess!” Qing Shui said with a smile. Originally, he thought that Seventh Princess was giving the Eldest Princess the sword to ask for news about Di Chen. However, he realized he had overrated himself when he saw her smile.</p>
 <p>She was delighted to give her that, so much so that she was happy from giving it to her. He knew that the Eldest Princess and Seventh Princess were born from the same father and mother. And it was precisely because of the Eldest Princess that the Seventh Princess held such a high status that the struggle between the princes wouldn’t cause her any harm.</p>
 <p>The Seventh Princess didn’t say anything but there was a happy smile on her face.</p>
 <p>“Oh yeah, have you ever fought against the people from the Scarlet Flame Region?”</p>
 <p>While Qing Shui was talking, the others had also walked over.</p>
 <p>“The people from Scarlet Flame Region have a very disorganized military force. They also have a lot of strong warriors or else they would have long since been eliminated by the Great Yu Dynasty and Great Virtue Dynasty,” Yan Yangchi replied.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui understood that the people from Scarlet Flame Region should have very strong warriors to overseeing them. In the past, he had heard that not only was the deepest part of the Scarlet Flame Region not covered in torrid heat, it had a favourable climate throughout the year with enchanting scenery. It was said that there was a sect there called the Scarlet Flame Sect. The reason why the people from the region were able to survive until now was precisely because of the sect.</p>
 <p>Some things were really profound, for example, it was perfectly normal for someone to exist, the same when someone died. Perhaps it was because of this that the Great Yu Dynasty, Great Virtue Dynasty as well as the Scarlet Flame Sect didn’t make any huge moves. In the past, both dynasties had once organized a huge troop of powerful warriors to enter the Scarlet Flame Region. However, less than 10% of them managed to return. It was also after that time that they found out Scarlet Flame Region had a sect. Furthermore, there were also quite a few oases in Scarlet Flame Region.</p>
 <p>Since that time, as long as people from Scarlet Flame Region didn’t cause trouble, fights wouldn’t usually break out. After all, the Scarlet Flame Region held the initiave.</p>
 <p>This time, they occupied Rong City. Both Great Yu Dynasty and Yan City couldn’t just stay silent, therefore they were going to teach them a lesson.</p>
 <p>Through this, Qing Shui found out that that Scarlet Flame Sect wasn’t to be messed with, so much so that there were many other implications.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui brought the girl back to the blacksmith store. In two days, he would be going to Rong City. Hence he intended to settle the girl in the Yan Clan.</p>
 <p>“Little girl, in two days, would you stay in the Yan Clan for a few days and wait for me to return?” Qing Shui asked as he headed back.</p>
 <p>“No!”</p>
 <p>Her reply stunned Qing Shui. If she didn’t want to stay in the Yan Clan, did he have to bring her along?</p>
 <p>“I will follow you wherever you go,” the girl looked at Qing Shui and responded indiffently like before.</p>
 <p>“Alright alright, we'll go together. Are you not afraid of danger?”</p>
 <p>“There is nothing much that can scare me anymore.” The girl had hidden meanings in her words at times. Qing Shui could understand what she said, but he was only able to guess that the girl ought to have gone through a tragic event in her life. Otherwise she wouldn’t have such a strong resentment, vicious and pernicious aura.</p>
