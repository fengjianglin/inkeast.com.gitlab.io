Thus, Qing Shui also remained silent. As the two stood together, Sheng Jun looked into the distance while Qing Shui followed her along and did the same thing. Only from time to time, he would move his sight back onto her. Just like that, the place was taken over by a moment of silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you for helping me.” After quite a while, Sheng Jun turned around and said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We are friends. You don’t treat your friends so formally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was not the first time Sheng Jun thanked Qing Shui. It was out of her expectations that a matter which even she had difficulties solving, would take such a dramatic turn. It made her felt like she was in a dream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even if we are friends, it’s still necessary for me to thank you. Other than repeating it over and over again, I also don’t know how I can repay you for it.” Sheng Jun chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That doesn’t sound sincere at all.” Qing Shui smiled and said. Though he didn’t make it clear, she should be able to understand what he meant. Any more obvious, he would risk being slapped again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t want to act like a gangster, nor did he intend to say anything straightforward. He just felt that it was nice to tease her from time to time. To begin with, men and women were supposed to be attracted to each other. Under the condition that they found the opposite genders pleasant to their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘It was easy to get a wife, but not someone who could understand you’. Even if they weren’t fated to be a couple, it would still be nice if they could end up as close friends with each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Certainly, Sheng Jun also understood what Qing Shui’s intentions. But she could never figure out what this man was thinking. He seemed to be very friendly and easy to get along with. At the same time, he was also reliable, but yet unpredictable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was not that everyone else, especially in the case of capable people, could be predicted easily. However, the fact that Qing Shui was unpredictable and yet people felt safe around him, had become quite a contradiction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Usually, one would feel insecure being around a person whom they failed to understand. It was because they didn’t know exactly what kind of personality this person held. As the saying went “Birds of a feather flock together”. If you couldn’t see through a person, how could you expect yourself to get along with him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brat, I am leaving soon.” Qing Shui said after a moment a silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This should be the second time Qing Shui called her that. Even he has become unsure of it. This nickname was quite an unusual one as it could be used on both a daughter and a person whom he liked. It was the way an elder would usually address the youngsters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, the rest of the possible meanings were easily rejected off the chart. This was the way to address a person whom you’re close to. Thus, it would cause people to think the true meaning behind it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sheng Jun trembled. Suddenly, she noticed that this man was clear and tranquil. Though the time they have been together was quite short, she has started to get used to having him around. In the past, she has also interacted with a few men before, but none of them could give her this kind of feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like that, she silently looked at Qing Shui. Her mind seemed to have drifted off to another place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although she knew that Qing Shui would go, this was too sudden for her. She didn’t know how to react for a moment. But eventually, she smiled, “Are you in a rush?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can choose to stay if you miss me.” Qing Shui teased her again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I do miss you, why don’t you stay?” Sheng Jun said straightforwardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned. He revealed an awkward smile. He knew that Sheng Jun didn’t mean it that way, but he had to leave now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Under what name shall I stay as?” Qing Shui still had his own method to deal with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aren’t we friends? It’s perfectly normal for friends to stay.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s different. Has there been any friends who stay together forever?” Qing Shui was examining this woman. He cast his eyes down mischievously to look at her slender body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You did that on purpose.” Sheng Jun said helplessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s gazes made her felt very uncomfortable. Or rather, unsettled. She knew that Qing Shui was doing it on purpose. So long as she was against it, he wouldn’t do anything to her. She was sure about what type of person Qing Shui was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will come to look for you in the future.” Qing Shui said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You must make your words count.” Sheng Jun said in joy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She wasn’t aware that the joy she felt has already caused some ripples in her calm mind. A calm mind was like a mirror, any ripples couldn’t exist on it, or else it would break.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui has been through that before. He had a mixture of complex feelings when he saw her reaction. It would be a lie if he said that he didn’t want to have a woman like this as his wife. It was not wrong for guys to be attracted to beautiful women, but they must act responsibly. This was the key differences between a good man and a jerk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By being responsible, it didn’t only mean showing responsibility to her, but to himself as well as the other women who were already his wives. Thus, sometimes, Qing Shui would find things to be quite difficult. Love came from the heart, it was uncontrollable. No matter how sensible a person might be, he would be blinded immediately as soon as he fell in love. The reason why they could act rationally was that they haven’t met someone who could take off their rational judgment. This applied to both men and women, only that it’s worse in men.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course I will. See you around!” Qing Shui smiled and nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His smile looked warm. While standing in front of Qing Shui, Sheng Jun hugged him gently and said in a soft voice, “Don’t think too much, it’s only a simple hug.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui extended his arms and hugged her tightly. At the moment, this woman needed a hint of encouragement to clear up her mind from the things she was confused about. However, Qing Shui didn’t cross the line and made sure he didn’t overthink things. However, it should be her who had been thinking too much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though she might be hugging him, Qing Shui knew that she didn’t have the intention to do any more stuff than that. But her heart has begun to feel a bit restless. Maybe she didn’t even know the reason behind her own actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui has felt similar things before in his previous incarnation. After a hug and a kiss, the two people stopped contacting each other. A lot of obstacles, in reality, couldn’t be solved that easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sheng Jun put her hands around Qing Shui’s neck and dug her head into Qing Shui’s chest. The two were hugging each other silently. The faint fragrance on her body, her slender figure, as well as her perky breasts, caused Qing Shui’s heart to start racing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His body reacted to it. It happened once before when she was dancing with the sword. This time, he still tried his best to avoid contact with her, but because they were hugging each other very tightly, he wasn’t able to control the little thing below his body from erecting. It began pushing against a soft spot.</span></p>

She lifted up her head to look at Qing Shui. A bit of blush could be seen on her pale face. At the moment when Qing Shui was about to move forward by one step, Sheng Jun took a step back and freed herself from Qing Shui’s arms.</span></p>

If a woman like you fails to make me feel anything, I feel like I would have been better off dead.” Qing Shui revealed a bitter smile. At the moment, it felt as though she has put herself in an embarrassing situation.</span></p>

Their first instinct would be to have intimate actions with the person they loved. To express how much they missed each other. When two people who miss each other meet, the first thing they would do is hug each other tightly. So tight that they may as well squeeze into each other’s bodies. But that doesn’t solve the problem, gods make men for only one purpose… That is…. The most intimate actions a couple can ever have.”</span></p>

In fact, this was the second time she felt it. But for a woman who had yet to experience any human affairs, even if they had the thoughts of it, it would be hard for them to actually take the first step.</span></p>

Humans, as well as the majority of inheritances, will need it.” Qing Shui smiled and looked at the embarrassed woman.</span></p>
