 <p><strong>AST 1279 - Berserker Blood Pill, Spirit Gathering Pill, Heading for Southern Sea Putuo Mountain</strong></p>
 <p>When Qing Shui said this now, the weight his words held was clearly different from before. Fu Tongsheng's descendants still felt that they had been dealt a great shock, especially Fu Cang, who stood there dazed, like a puppet. The others didn't bother him either.</p>
 <p>Right now, Fu Tongsheng couldn't describe his feelings. There was a saying which said to never look down on a poor young man since there were countless possibilities for his future. Right now, the potential which Qing Shui had displayed was already tremendous. Even Fu Tongsheng himself felt that he wasn't able to stand up to him. In time, Qing Shui's achievements would be immeasurable.</p>
 <p>"Alright, Uncle Fu agrees. But you must be the one to handle and organize this matter. In the future, you must be the one to lead as well. Uncle Fu won't agree to others taking this position," Fu Tongsheng looked at Qing Shui and said seriously.</p>
 <p>"Then I'll thank Uncle Fu. Don't worry, I can guarantee that if Divine Might Dynasty were to join this alliance, you won't be suffering from any losses. I have no intentions on uniting the Divine Might Dynasty and setting up a great dynasty myself. My inspiration is to fight my way to the other three continents. Therefore, Uncle Fu, you can rest assured."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's words were very clear. He didn't care for Western Oxhe Continent and there was no need for Fu Tongsheng to be worried that Qing Shui would do anything against the Divine Might Dynasty.</p>
 <p>Hearing Qing Shui's words, Fu Tongsheng's had a mixture of feelings but it was mostly astonishment, extreme astonishment. Even for someone at Fu Tongsheng's level, it wasn't that he hadn't thought of fighting his way to the other three continents but it was far too difficult to achieve. Therefore, he no longer thought about it. However, now someone else had brought it up. Furthermore, it was a young man. Most importantly, he felt that this young man wasn't bragging. He might really be able to accomplish it.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, if you were a descendant of our Fu Clan, I’d be able to smile myself awake even if I were to be in a dream. Today, I'll call the shots here. Fu Clan will forever support you. I won't be pretentious about it either. In the future, if it's convenient for you, please do help out Fu Clan," Fu Tongsheng smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could sense the sincerity in Fu Tongsheng's eyes. Fu Tongsheng was an intelligent person. Qing Shui smiled, nodding, "If such a day come, I'll definitely do so. I've said that Fu Clan won't be suffering from any losses. You'll only get tremendous benefits."</p>
 <p>The matter was decided. Cultivators were men of their words. Qing Shui hadn't expected to convince two parties within such a short period of time. At least for now, there were no issues for Lotus Sect to work together with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Brother Qing, I have a few types of medicine here, please help me refine them!" Right now, Fu Rong's address toward Qing Shui had changed. This lass treated Qing Shui very casually, as if they were real friends.</p>
 <p>Fu Tongsheng also had two types of medicine which he required Qing Shui's help to refine. They were the Berserker Blood Pill and Spirit Gathering Pill.</p>
 <p>The Berserker Blood Pill was very domineering. It was only effective if one was hurt. When one was seriously injured, taking it could allow his strength to double. The more serious the injuries, the greater the increase in strength and the lighter the wounds, the lesser the increase. Of course, it was still very dangerous in such a situation. After all, the Berserker Blood Pill wouldn't heal one's injuries and the person could lose his life at any moment.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw this medicinal pill, his eyes lit up. This thing was best for people with a strong vitality. If a person could still struggle on even after being seriously injured, then taking this Berserker Blood Pill would allow the person to make a come back very quickly.</p>
 <p>However, if the person's vitality wasn't strong enough, then getting seriously injured could cause the person to die at any time. Once dead, the Berserker Blood Pill or anything else wouldn't be of any use.</p>
 <p>The Spirit Gathering Pill was used to recover one's spirit energy. The process was a gradual one and wasn't instantaneous. Eating one of it could allow one to be able to recover their spirit energy constantly for 15 minutes. It could only be used to recover one's spirit energy.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had the Vital Essence Pill but if he could use it interchangeably with the Spirit Gathering Pill, it wouldn't be bad either. However, the Spirit Gathering Pill wasn't too attractive to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stayed for a few days in Fu Clan and helped them refine some medicinal pills. Of course, remunerations were required. He took some of the Berserker Blood Pills as remuneration.</p>
 <p>During these few days, Qing Shui and the younger generation of Fu Clan got along better. However, Fu Cang was nowhere to be seen. The improvement in their relationship was also something relative. Fu Jian and Qing Shui got along well but Fu Jian was very respectful to Qing Shui. After all, in terms of their seniority, Fu Jian was one generation younger.</p>
 <p>It was different for Fu Rong. She was the youngest. However, she was Fu Tongsheng's youngest daughter. She wasn't old but her seniority was there. These nephews had to give way to this aunt of theirs.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's alchemy was still very powerful and all of his attempts had succeeded. Qing Shui only took three Berserker Blood Pills and left. He still needed to go look for other powers, to at least greet them. As long as he could get stronger or his Spirit Gathering Lamp could increase by a grade, then it would be very easy for him to put together a powerful alliance in the Western Oxhe Continent.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>After leaving the Divine Might Dynasty, Qing Shui headed for the Great Yu Dynasty. He wanted to head to the Southern Sea Putuo Mountain. For one, it was to meet Yu Ruyan and Tantai Xuan. Another reason was for him to talk about the matter of the alliance.</p>
 <p>However, on thinking that he would be meeting Tantai Xuan, Qing Shui felt a little strange. After all, he had been seen naked by that lady and she had even seen clearly the scene of him have sex with Yu Ruyan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn't be said to have suffered a loss to be seen. After all, he was a guy. There was no need for him to chase after a lady who had seen him having sex with his own woman. However, if it was a man, Qing Shui would definitely make him disappear</p>
 <p>There was another thing. Tantai Xuan hadn't been through such acts herself. He didn't know if seeing such a scene would cause her to be traumatized. After all, she had not experienced such acts but ended up seeing an ugly person entering her body...</p>
 <p>However, at Tantai Xuan's age, she wasn't like those young lasses from his previous life. Even though she hadn't experienced such acts herself, she should know a little about them. She could still get to know about these through certain martial arts, books or things like that. Furthermore, after one reached a certain age, they would slowly get to know some stuff even if they didn't specially learn about them.</p>
 <p>Every world would have its own culture.</p>
 <p>His Nine Continents Steps had improved by a grade and its speed was now very fast. The Fire Bird was also much faster now. Therefore, it only took a few days for him to reach the Southern Sea Putuo Mountain. This was much faster than before and right now, it was much more convenient than before for him to travel.</p>
 <p>The Southern Sea looked very big but this was an inner sea. However, it was said to be linked to the true Southern Sea through a great river, a tremendous one. Qing Shui didn't see it but he knew that it definitely wasn't one which those rivers from his previous life could be compared to.</p>
 <p>A few days later, Qing Shui stopped above the Southern Sea and looked toward the Putuo Mountain, which was in the distance. He was in no hurry to proceed. He just stood there, took out the Pure Gold Fishing Rod and put it into the water. He knew that in a while, there would be people who would come by to look for him.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui fished up a few fish which were not bad, two figures flew toward him. However, they weren't Yu Ruyan and Tantai Xuan. Qing Shui could only tell them who he was looking for and got their help to pass on a message.</p>
 <p>The two ladies were nice to talk to. They agreed and left. It could be because Qing Shui had a good attitude and they felt that this probably wasn't the first time Qing Shui came. It was because he knew to stand there and not proceed.</p>
 <p>This time around, after the two ladies left, he soon saw two figures flying toward him. Qing Shui's vision was very strong and very quickly, the two figures appeared next to him.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui!"</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan, beautiful as always, jumped into Qing Shui's arms happily. This took him a little by surprise. This mature lady was now less restrained than before. It could be because she knew that Tantai Xuan had seen them before and thus didn't care much about it anymore.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hugged Yu Ruyan then smiled and looked at Tantai Xuan. When Tantai Xuan's gaze met Qing Shui's, she felt a little embarrassed. That scene was one which she could never forget. She even suspected she felt some trauma now.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan weren't too overboard, they did use quite a few different poses. There were a few which were especially daring. That clear image seemed to have imprinted itself in her mind. Qing Shui's and Yu Ruyan's actions were seen very clearly by her.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan let go of Qing Shui then turned to look at Tantai Xuan and then said, smiling, "It's very warm. Do you want to try hugging as well? I don't mind."</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan's transformation did cause Qing Shui to be a little stunned. This also showed that the relationship between the two ladies was especially good. Otherwise, she wouldn't say something like this.</p>
 <p>"I don't care for that. Only you would treat him as a treasure," Tantai Xuan replied unnaturally.</p>
 <p>"But I know that someone sleep talks..."</p>
 <p>"My dear elder sister, don't say any more. Were there any witnesses? How would I know if you were speaking the truth?" Tantai Xuan quickly pulled Yu Ruyan and said.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan smiled and didn't continue. She then looked toward Qing Shui, "Why have you thought of coming to look for us now?"</p>
 <p>After Yu Ruyan brought up that question, she saw Qing Shui's teasing glance. The two ladies 'tsk'ed at the same time. Yu Ruyan knew Qing Shui's gaze while Tantai Xuan had once again recalled that scene...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled awkwardly and realized that Tantai Xuan's strength had grown crazily once again. It seemed that this time around, she had come to the Western Oxhe Continent to improve her abilities. It had grown too tremendously. Seems like he shouldn’t underestimate any legacies that had been passed down.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan was Southern Sea Putuo Mountain's Chief Senior Disciple, just like Di Chen was to the Lotus Sect. Southern Sea Putuo Mountain kept a low profile and didn't appear as glamorous as the Great Yu Dynasty. However, they were actually on the same level as the Heaven Secrets Academy, Lotus Sect and the Divine Might Dynasty.</p>
 <p>"Miss Tantai, you're really good at concealing. To think that Southern Sea Putuo Mountain's abilities are top notch in the Western Oxhe Continent." Qing Shui smiled and looked at Tantai Xuan.</p>
 <p>"You've become even more powerful. I still can't sense your abilities.” Tantai Xuan didn't reply to Qing Shui's question directly but brought the topic back to him.</p>
 <p>"Why don't we have a spar?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>"I don't want to. You're probably not up to anything good." Tantai Xuan smiled and rejected directly.</p>
 <p>"Ruyan, I've found Chen`er."</p>
 <p>"Really? Where is she?" Yu Ruyan asked happily.</p>
 <p>"At Lotus Sect!"</p>
 <p>"You went to Lotus Sect?" Tantai Xuan asked, a little taken aback</p>
 <p>"I haven't just gone to the Lotus Sect but I've been to the Divine Might Dynasty as well. Oh, right, I'm now Heaven Secrets Academy's Guest Custodian," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Hmmm? The reason you've come today is definitely not just to visit us. Go on. What matters do you have?" Tantai Xuan asked, feeling curious.</p>
 <p>"I want to meet your Master," Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</p>
 <p>"Meet my Master? Is it very important?"</p>
 <p>"I want to form an alliance with Putuo Mountain," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Form an alliance? Form what alliance?" Tantai Xuan asked, puzzled.</p>
 <p>"A continental alliance!"</p>
 <p>"You want to unify the Western Oxhe Continent..." Tantai Xuan looked at Qing Shui in a daze.</p>
 <p>"It's an alliance, not unify..."</p>
 <p>"Then who is going to lead the alliance?" Tantai Xuan looked at Qing Shui curiously.</p>
 <p>"I reckon that if I'm not the one, probably no one would be able to take on the job..."</p>
 <p>"Aren't you being too shameless?" Tantai Xuan smiled and said.</p>
