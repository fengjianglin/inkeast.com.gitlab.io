 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The voice which came through from the room sounded very arousing. It was even more pleasant to hear than the most beautiful music from his previous incarnation. Her seductive face was completely filled with faint blushes. She had a very reluctant expression and at the same time, she was also giving out extraordinary aura.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had fallen head over heel for this body which was the most divine to be ever seen in this world. It was as if she was the work of gods itself. Though he had conquered this body many times, each and every time he indulged in it, he would go through a huge mental shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After going through such a rough time, the room eventually quieted down. Yiye Jiange lazily curled herself up within Qing Shui’s arm. She seemed very tired. On her lovely face was a faint satisfied expression. This had given Qing Shui the biggest pleasure he could ever have.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he could already have a woman like her, what else could he ask more?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A very long time ago, Yiye Jiange used to be Qing Shui’s master. Though back then, they had established the master-disciple relationship just to protect him. Every time she thought back about it, she would feel like it had all been a dream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whenever Qing Shui was free, he would also tease her with things like that, particularly when there were only two of them together. Back then, when she was almost reaching the peak of Witch Mountain, Qing Shui had begun calling her his master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why am I always the more active one? Did you miss me?” Qing Shui lowered down his head and kissed Yiye Jiange’s forehead.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are always rushing through your journey. Would you have time to even stop? I don’t have enough courage to do so.” Yiye Jiange squinted her eyes and said lazily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you regret it?” Qing Shui knew that he could not stay by his woman’s side for a long time. It seemed unlikely for him to make them stay together. Each of them had their own things to do. Some were even the Sect Lords for their respective sects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui would really like to take a break but if he didn’t solve certain things, his life would never be peaceful. Qing Shui felt that he must help and solve Tantai Lingyan’s problem. She was the woman with the most anxiety. If he never solved it, she would never be able to find happiness. Seeing his own woman not being happy, how could he himself be the same?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why shall I regret it? Such life is already something which I could never have dreamt of. Before, I had never expected that we would make it this far, nor would I ever expect that we would end up how we are currently.” Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui happily. She seemed to be particularly interested in thinking about all of these.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“At that time, what was in your head when you saved me? What was your impression about me?” As Qing Shui thought back to the events which had happened, he also began finding it more and more mysterious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I didn’t really think too much when I first saved you. I only viewed you as a child at that time.” Yiye Jiange blushed as she recalled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well, now that an old cow gets to eat some young grass, do you feel that you have somehow earned something in return?” Qing Shui smiled and looked at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are the old cow here!” Yiye Jiange shouted grumpily. She also smiled soon after she said it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have never expected for such a day to come as well. When I first saw you, I tend to think that you were like Xuannu and not someone whom I can ever get close to.” Qing Shui was looking back on the scene when he first saw her. He wasn’t intentionally trying to say cheesy things, nor was he trying to degrade himself. Deep down within his body hid a mind that came from his previous incarnation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, it was perfectly normal for him to have such thoughts. It was perfectly normal for people from his previous incarnation to harbor such thoughts if they saw Yiye Jiange. After all, an extreme beauty like her was beyond words. In his previous incarnation, even the celebrities or beautiful women who used photoshop could never be compared to Yiye Jiange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Qing Shui and Yiye Jiange were speaking, Qing Xiu woke up. They were already laying down on their bed in the bedroom and the little brat was right beside them. Their private time together was very enjoyable. Having the little brat with them, however, just felt as warm and loving.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The little brat had yet to reach a year old but he was very active. His face could also be considered handsome and charming. At the moment, he was within Yiye Jiange’s arm and played around with Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the second day, Qing Shui woke up very early. As expected, they had gone through yet another storm in the morning. The man was unusually more active during the day. When they were finished, both of them woke up at the same time. It had always been said that women nurtured with love tend to look very beautiful. But in the case of Yiye Jiange, it seemed unusually even more clear. In the morning when they were having their breakfast, the other girls gave Yiye Jiange weird looks. This caused Yiye Jiange to keep blushing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other girls hadn’t experienced any human affairs. Tantai Lingyan was an exception as she experienced it once. Though with that said, she wasn’t any better compared to the other girls. Still, they were also able to understand what had happened during the night. After all, it was a natural thing to do.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sister Jiange, you look very beautiful today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh yes, indeed. What happened?” Luo Qingcheng agreed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It might be because Qing Shui is back!” Qing Hanye said with a smirk.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why didn’t I become more beautiful then?” Luo Qingcheng carried on and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As for this... Sister Jiange knows better than anyone. This is all thanks to Qing Shui.” Qing Hanye continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haven’t you guys had enough?” Yiye Jiange interrupted their conversation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sister Jiange, share with us. How did you feel?” Qing Hanye lowered down her volume and said with a gentle smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though she said it very softly, everyone in the room could hear it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan, on the other hand, lowered her head and continued eating. Qin Qing smiled as she looked at Qing Shui opposite her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t really feel embarrassed about it. In fact, he actually felt proud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After eating breakfast, Qing Shui bid his farewell with the others girls and went on to check out the Imperial Cuisine hall. Tantai Lingyan and Qin Qing said that they also wanted to go and take a look around that place. Seeing that, Qing Hanye also said that she wanted to join.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, Qing Shui had no choice but to take them along. The place wasn’t so far away to begin with.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though the Great Confucian Empire might have conquered the Ice Domain Dynasty and all other dynasties around it, not many changes had occurred around Linhai City. This place was still snowing as usual, which reminded Qing Shui of the Ice Snow City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It snowed all year long around that area. It was almost as if this place wouldn’t go three days without snow. In Qing Shui’s mind appeared Hai Dongqing, and then his other girls, his mother, and his family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, he had begun to miss his home. It had been a while since he went away.&nbsp;</span></p>

She thus became a lot more powerful than Qing Hanye, Yiye Jiange, and the others.</span></p>

However, he didn’t treat it as anything serious. The Imperial Cuisine Hall seemed to have gotten very quiet, however. No one could be seen around the hall. This was what caused Qing Shui to become very wary.</span></p>

They both welcomed Qing Shui with their own fists.</span></p>

Without you, it feels like we are lacking our backbone for support.” Lan Lingfeng chuckled.</span></p>

Certainly, Yin Tong’s son was also there. They gave him the present which they had prepared for him.</span></p>

Qing Shui had never imagined that a day when he became a godfather would come. Furthermore, he had even gotten himself a few godchildren. From the way things were developing, he reckoned that in the future, it might continue to increase.</span></p>

The only problem now is that the Imperial Cuisine Hall can no longer run its business. You have seen it for yourself. Not many people come here anymore.” Lan Lingfeng said helplessly.</span></p>
