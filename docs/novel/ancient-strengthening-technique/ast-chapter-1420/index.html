 <p><strong>AST 1420 - Entering The Heavenly Dao Again, Realm Of Drawing Breakthrough, First Level Of Drawing Souls</strong></p>
 <p>Of course, Qing Shui did not have any objections. It would be best if the Demon Lord could join in as well, but that possibility was low. He did not have any excessive expectations. Even in terms of Hua Rumei, Qing Shui did not expect her to help him in this front in any way.</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei could not wait to try her first bite, she kept blinking towards Qing Shui, “The food looked delicious, but only after the first bite were you able to tell that it tastes way beyond what you can imagine.”</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei had never thought that a man could have such achievements in cooking, it was definitely a peak existence. Most Imperial Chefs in the World the Nine Continents were normal people or women, there were very few martial artists in this profession. Even if they were good at cooking, they were not this highly skilled. It could be seen that this man was not only innately talented in martial arts, but he was also talented in other areas. He was an existence beyond this world, even she felt ashamed of being inferior. This man was not only an expert in the martial arts, but also in medicine, refining pellets, and cooking. There was nothing he did not know.</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei stopped thinking about it and just continued to eat everything.</p>
 <p>The woman slowly ate her food, it was very natural and elegant. It was a sight that triggered the senses, an elegant, natural beauty. If not for the natural flow of her movements, it could not be considered elegance.</p>
 <p>Though her face did not have any obvious changes, Qing Shui could see a flash of surprise on that beautiful face of hers. She raised her head to look at Qing Shui, and at that moment their eyes met.</p>
 <p>“Delicious?” Qing Shui asked proudly.</p>
 <p>“En!” The woman lightly nodded. She felt that this man had a small change. It seemed he was more fearless than before, he was now more mature and braver.</p>
 <p>“Then you should eat more.” Qing Shui laughed as he ate more.</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei was surprised by what she saw. This boy’s change was fast. Even the Palace Lord seemed to treat him differently compared to other men. She never ate food with men before, moreover, she would not directly receive things handed to her by men.</p>
 <p>But today, everything seemed to have been breaking through the ice. The more it was like this, the more she felt that these two had a relationship that was not known to other people. However, it should not be something ridiculous.</p>
 <p>However, Hua Rumei could never guess that it was indeed ridiculous. It was so ridiculous to the point where even if she was audacious enough, she would still not be able to guess it.</p>
 <p>Hua Rumei lightly patted her full belly and said, “This was the best meal I have ever had. If someone married Qing Shui then they would be blessed for the rest of their lives, don’t you think so, Palace Lord?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s hands were shaking. Hua Rumei and the Demon Lord’s relationship was just like sisters. Most people would not dare to make this type of joke but for her, there was no pressure at all to talk this way in front of the Demon Lord.</p>
 <p>This time, the woman did not say anything. Hua Rumei’s words had no effect. This was probably not the first time she had said something along these lines. The Demon Lord’s silence did not make Hua Rumei feel anything being out of place.</p>
 <p>After the meal, as Qing Shui cleaned the table, Hua Rumei stood up, “We should do this, the Palace Lord and I did not help much earlier. Let us wash the dishes.”</p>
 <p>The woman was stunned for a second, and Qing Shui looked at the woman weirdly. The woman nodded her head and said, “It should be so.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui massaged his temples and decided that he should just let them wash the dishes. Watching their two soft and snow-white hands washed the dishes was a type of enjoyment. Hua Rumei took her time, at the start she and the Demon Lord washed their own bowls before washing the other dishes and pots.</p>
 <p>At the end, Hua Rumei took her time with the last bowl she was washing, seemingly washing it again and again. Then, the Demon Lord took Qing Shui’s bowl……</p>
 <p>At that moment, Qing Shui felt he was seeing a hallucination. He felt that she was just like his own woman. It was only natural for her to wash his bowl, but the Demon Lord was washing the bowl that he had used.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui thought about this part, it felt like it wasn’t something special. He had already touched her body, and thoroughly at that. But thinking about what happened just now, he felt something that could not be described. Perhaps it was because they were under the influence of drugs. That cool and elegant, yet cold and bewitching beauty of hers. Together with her snow-white soft skin that was smooth to touch, and tender curves like a heavenly jade sculpture carved by the Gods……</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, the expression on your face is weird. What are you thinking about?” Hua Rumei smiled as she reached out her hand to wave it in front of Qing Shui’s face.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui finally got his focus back, his face blushed red. He saw that the Demon Lord was also looking at him, her expression somewhat unnatural. It seemed like she had figured out what Qing Shui was thinking about or at least guessed a little bit of it.</p>
 <p>“I was thinking that some things that happened can’t be changed. There’s no room for regret, but there must be a way to redeem myself,” Qing Shui said with a sigh.</p>
 <p>“Depression setting in? Come tell older sister what you did wrong, I will give you some advice.” Hua Rumei seemed interested.</p>
 <p>The Demon Lord just gave her farewell before returning to her tent.</p>
 <p>“Do you really want to listen?” Qing Shui asked and laughed.</p>
 <p>“If you want to say it, then I will listen,” Hua Rumei said while laughing.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head, “It is alright, there is nothing much to be said. There’s no one that has never made mistakes, these were all from the past when I was young. Maybe making many mistakes was the correct way forward.”</p>
 <p>“Why is making mistakes the correct way forward?” Hua Rumei and Qing Shui chatted at the table as the sky was getting dark.</p>
 <p>“The mistakes made when someone was young, the heavens would forgive. Because the mistakes were made while young, they can fix it and redeem themselves when the person gets older. This way, they will have things to do. They would never feel emptiness since there was something for them yearn for. Making mistakes when they were young, there would be good memories to look back on when they are old. It will be something memorable, and they would not feel that their life was bland…”</p>
 <p>“I can’t tell if your words sort of make sense. Seems like I should make some mistakes, or else I would feel sad,” Hua Rumei looked at Qing Shui and said seriously.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shook his head, he had heard these words before in his previous life. Though it was usually considered as a digression in a chat, it did have some principles. He finally understood the principles of it when he was in this place. At his current age, with his children getting older, Qing Shui could understand that there were many mistakes that he could not make any more.</p>
 <p>“There’s a price to pay for making mistakes, else people would make many mistakes. Some mistakes can be made, but some should not be made at all. Even making it once would result in not even having the chance to make regrets.”</p>
 <p>“Oh? Do you feel like you just accomplished something by teaching your older sister?” Hua Rumei laughed.</p>
 <p>“Of course. Otherwise, why would the older generations love to teach the younger generations?” Qing Shui also laughed.</p>
 <p>After they chatted for a while, Hua Rumei and Qing Shui left to return to their own tents. Qing Shui entered his own tent, then he directly went inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Cultivate!</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui discovered that his heart was in a mess, he could not calm down. His head was filled with the Demon Lord’s figure, he did not know why this was happening. His mind was just filled with the Demon Lord’s silhouette from today, especially during the scene when she was washing dishes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, who could not calmly cultivate, took out his Golden Calligraphy Brush and Moonstone Ink Slab. He also took out some paper, and he started drawing after he prepared the ink.</p>
 <p>The drawing was, of course, of the Demon Lord.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t improve on his Realm of Drawing for a long time. This time, he just followed her silhouette in his mind and began drawing it.</p>
 <p>He was no longer attached to the realm of his Drawing, what he wanted was to draw the figure of her that resided within his mind. When he was bored, he could take a look at it and reminisce.</p>
 <p>While he was indulged in his art, he began to recall the start of the experience. He added the little bits of understanding he had gained, a bit of love, tenderness, and longingness, all of these feelings.</p>
 <p>The brush in his hand drew on top of the beast skin, he was not drawing with overconfidence and ease, nor was he drawing with force. He was drawing with a sense of harmony, one that captivated people.</p>
 <p>Heavenly Dao!</p>
 <p>As someone who had already entered the Heavenly Dao, Qing Shui once again walked forward a giant step.</p>
 <p>The Heavenly Dao was hard to grasp, it was its mysterious power. However, he could borrow power, a lot of power!</p>
 <p>By the time Qing Shui stopped, he noticed that his remaining time within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was more than half gone, but this drawing was the one that Qing Shui was most satisfied with. Now, he was happy. He now advanced in the level of his Realm of Drawing and had broken through the level of Drawing Bones.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had been at the level of Drawing Bones for too long, he had been prepared to not have any breakthrough in it. Moreover, the time he had spent cultivating his Realm of Drawing arts had been less and less. He had never thought that he would have a breakthrough now, especially since there had been no hints of it.</p>
 <p>The level of Drawing Souls!</p>
 <p>As he thought about it, Qing Shui felt that it was a bit surreal. He looked at the woman in the drawing, and it gave off a feeling like it was alive. He was certain about the feeling it gave off, it was even more than just being vivid and lifelike.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had suddenly broken through to the level of Drawing Souls. It was said that the level of Drawing Souls would be able to draw out actual souls, but it was too surreal. Qing Shui felt that it was more like a breakthrough to another realm. The drawings were even more captivating, but whether it could draw something that was alive, he did not know. The possibility was low. Qing Shui’s level could bestow the person within his drawing with essence, qi, and spirit. After he thought about it for a while, he felt that this was not possible since it did not adhere to the Heavenly Dao.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at this drawing. It didn’t matter who was looking at it, they would feel shocked. This was definitely the highest tier drawing within the World of the Nine Continents. Breaking through was a good thing, as Qing Shui was mostly doing it for Heavenly Talismans. He was not doing it for drawing pictures. Thus, Drawing Souls was about the essence of the drawing. Being able to draw an even deeper level of things, it could help capture unspeakable things.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui discovered that he was not tired at all and even felt comfortable himself. This made him shocked again. This time, the breakthrough did not increase his strength but his storage of essence, qi, and spirit had doubled. This was terrifying. His burst damage did not change, but his battle endurance doubled……</p>
 <p>As the amount of essence, qi, and spirit he could store within his body had increased, his resistances also increased. If he got one point higher he would break through again, thus, the benefits were big.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui’s state of mind was calmer. However, his heart was still in a mess, even if it got a bit better. The woman had a destructive power even just by standing there without moving. She could make men lose their appetite and completely disheartened.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had felt this feeling before, having her was like having the world while losing her was like losing his own life.</p>
 <p>That was why there would be people who wanted the beauty but not their dynasty, since losing one’s livelihood could make the dynasty useless. There was no one to share their happiness.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The second day, Qing Shui woke up early and started to practice his Taichi Fist from afar. His Heavenly Dao seemed to have advanced by quite a bit, even his Taichi Fist seemed to also carry a natural bearing.</p>
 <p>A golden Taichi Golden Qi enveloped Qing Shui’s surrounding and just like water, it moves along with his fist. This Taichi Golden Qi was the most flexible and yet the most firm. It would moved with the flow of his movement, with firmness and Yang energy.</p>
 <p>Each fist from Qing Shui was like in its own realm. He seemed to be practicing without the world’s influence, it was a sight to behold. People would not dare to underestimate his ability.</p>
 <p>The Demon Lord and Hua Rumei stood outside their tents as they watched Qing Shui from afar.</p>
 <p>“How is it? Bringing him has brought our chances of victory up huh?” Hua Rumei said happily.</p>
