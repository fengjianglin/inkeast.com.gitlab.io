 <p><strong><strong>AST 586 - Crippling the Sky Tyrant Lord with just one move! Di Chen stepped forth!</strong></strong></p>
 <p><strong>“To think that you would still be alive and even have your own children.” The Sky Tyrant Lord spoke to Qing Shui indifferently while looking at Di Chen who wasn’t far away.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The Sky Tyrant Lord took the lead as the gang walked in one after another. The clan members of Qing Clan, the sects, and aristocratic clans from Green Cloud Continent which came to congratulate Qing Shui all looked at the Sky Tyrant Lord and his gang. There were some who felt worried, some who found it entertaining, and some who just smiled humbly.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Elder Ge, Cang Wuya and his party all walked to the side of Qing Shui and looked at him in concern. So did Qing Luo and Lin Zhanhan. Qing Shui however, he smiled, shook his head and approached Di Chen.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Today is my baby’s one month old birthday! Everyone is here as guests, Qing Clan truly welcomes all of you. If you have any other things which you would like to sort out, I hope that you can come again some other day.” Qing Shui glanced towards the Sky Tyrant Lord and said in a way which sounded neither servile nor overbearing.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The fire in Qing Shui’s stomach was already burning really fiercely. Today, Qing Shui didn’t want to make his move. It’s not that he couldn’t do it, it’s just that it was a bit inappropriate to do so on a happy day like this. He was afraid that the battle between Martial Saints might frighten the children.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Chen`Er, come back, I really like you… I will treat you well for the rest of my life…” A middle-aged tall and sturdy man behind the Sky Tyrant Lord was upfront to Di Chen spoke.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Without guessing, Qing Shui could already tell that he was the child of the Sky Tyrant Lord, who was also the person Di Chen had been avoiding. He is the little tyrant in the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“I have nothing to do with you, stop bothering me, I don’t even know you.” Di Chen said slowly. The way she looked into the man’s eyes was really calm.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Why? Could it be that you really like that brat?” The man suddenly became really violent. He glanced towards Qing Shui with a cold expression and pointed at him with his finger.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“You have no right to interfere with who I like, it has nothing to do with you.” Di Chen knitted her brows and said unhappily.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Why can’t you feel anything despite how much I love you? Tell me what I lack in, and I’ll change!” The man looked at Di Chen and said persistently.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“All for a woman, such a useless trash.” The Sky Tyrant Lord said in dissatisfaction.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“You’re just sick! So does that mean if you love someone, the person will necessarily have to love you back and marry you as well?” Qing Shui broke into laughter and said. A brain dead person like him was useless in everything.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Actually, this didn’t really mean anything. A lot of people were more stiff in certain things. It could be that this man really did love Di Chen, but there were a lot of men who liked Di Chen. It would have been really annoying if all of them had been like him. That was why Qing Shui stood up for her.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“What are you? Disappear, you don’t have the right to talk here!” The man screamed at Qing Shui. The way he did it made people feel like Qing Shui snatched Di Chen away from him.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui was stunned by his actions. But after a while, he said indifferently: “Today is my child’s one month birthday, don’t scare my child. Please go. Oh, and the person who screamed the loudest, you are the dumbest person I have ever seen.”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“You...You….”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Chen`Er, I don’t want to force you to go back with me. Have you forgotten about what happened to this brat last time? Or could it be that you still want to see it one more time? I won’t mind adding two lives to it this time.” The Sky Tyrant Lord looked at Di Chen. The words that he said made everyone present feel really frightened and angry.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Di Chen’s body was shivering. She turned around and looked at QIng Shui with a dull expression. She never expected them to make things worse this time. Must she really sacrifice herself for the sake of Di Clan and the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord?</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Why would the house where she had lived for twenty years turned out like this? Her father who cherished her in every possible way when she was young, her brother, senior, every single one of them were like murderers now. Who else could she trust?</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Will you guys feel satisfied if I die?” Di Chen looked at the Sky Tyrant Lord.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“You can’t die. If you die, I’ll have everyone here accompany you down there. Will you feel satisfied with that?” The Sky Tyrant Lord knitted his brows and said. He was well aware of how persistent this brat could be. He didn’t know what else to do other than using her weakness against her for now. As long as he could manage to kill Qing Shui later, everything would be fine.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Qing Shui……” Di Chen turned around and looked at Qing Shui. She was shivering when she spoke.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Sister Chen, do you believe in me?” When Qing Shui saw Di Chen, he knew that she would agree. The more he thought about it, the worse he felt. Nothing would have been able to force her if it hadn’t been for the words they said.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Di Chen looked at Qing Shui’s clear and tranquil eyes: “I believe in you. But I really can’t let you walk the wrong path! If I could, I’d really hope to see you again!”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>After finished speaking, she turned around and looked at the people in her surroundings. She paid the most attention at the members from Qing Clan and the two little babies whom she carried a lot of times before. It’s just that when she turned around, her arm was immediately grabbed by Qing Shui.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Who said that you are going? I haven’t even given you permission to go.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Qing Shui, stop it. Don’t act rashly. You are not alone.”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Do you really think that they would let Qing Clan go if you followed them?” Qing Shui smiled and looked at Di Chen. He wasn’t as nervous as she thought.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>When Di Chen heard Qing Shui’s words, she immediately went silent. She was more familiar with the Sky Tyrant Lord than anyone else. It’s just that she wasn’t thinking much about it at that time. But as she thought about it now, she realized that Qing Shui was right. Nothing would have changed regardless of whether she left or not. The Sky Tyrant Lord would definitely not let anyone here off so easily.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Brat, let go of her……”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The man screamed and looked as if he was about to charge towards Qing Shui. Just as that happened, he was stopped by the Sky Tyrant Lord, “You useless trash! Are you seeking death!”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The three generations of Qing clan looked at the people opposite them furiously. A lot of the people present felt really bad and unwell because every time something like this happened, Qing Shui would be the only one to face it.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Brother Qing Shui, I’m going to fight them.” Qing You was about to charge into them with his huge hammer.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Come back, we should spectate from the side. Don’t give them any trouble.” Qing Shui pulled Qing You back and said in a funny manner.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Chen`Er, have you made up your mind? I’m doing this for your own good too. You will understand in the future.” The Sky Tyrant Lord told Di Chen gently.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Enough, like I said again and again, today is my children’s one month birthday. Originally, I didn’t want to cause any ruckus. But from the way you guys behaved, it would have been really pointless if I don’t do anything about it.” Qing Shui fixed his sight at the Sky Tyrant Lord.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui thought about the time when he got injured by the Sky Tyrant Lord. If his strength at that time had been his full power, Qing Shui assumed that he would only be either at the first peak Martial Saint grade or the early stage of Second Martial Saint grade.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>It’s just that for now, Qing Shui felt that his strength was only around 300 countries worth. Most importantly, out of all the people who came, he was the strongest person among them. It seemed like he really didn’t pay attention to Heavenly Palace and himself.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui assumed that they weren’t aware of the incident with the Diamond Gigantic Elephant murdering warriors at the peak of the first Martial Saint grade. He counted the time. Since it had been a long time, could it be that they weren’t here because they found out he annihilated Zhan Clan?</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Just by you alone? Don’t make me laugh!” The Sky Tyrant Lord looked at Qing Shui mockingly and laughed at the fragile young man a few years ago. Even though he seemed a little different compared to before, it still didn’t matter a lot to him.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Are you ready? My children’s one month birthday is really important. I don’t have time to keep you guys company.” Qing Shui fixed his sight at the Sky Tyrant Lord and slowly walked towards him.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“You arrogant brat! You are seeking death!”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The Sky Tyrant Lord screamed loudly. His body rose up a few hundred meters into the sky and charged towards Qing Shui.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Emperor’s Qi!</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui waved his hands and immediately immobilized the Sky Tyrant Lord.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Roar!</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui revolved his aura all the way to its peak. As he stepped off the ground with both of his feet, he similarly floated into the sky. It’s just that his speed was significantly faster compared to the Sky Tyrant Lord. He charged toward the Sky Tyrant Lord while performing his Tiger Laceration.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Roar！</strong></p>
 <p><strong>It was a loud and depressing noise. The next thing that followed up was a black colored tiger claw slapping towards the Sky Tyrant Lord.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>When Qing Shui used his Emperor’s Qi, the Sky Tyrant Lord didn’t actually notice it. Qing Shui only changed his expression after he flew up the sky with the ability which was only exclusive to Martial Saint grade warriors. When the enormous tiger claws approached the Sky Tyrant Lord, he realized that he came here today just to seek death.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Beng!</strong></p>
 <p><strong>A tremendous shockwave accompanied by a loud noise straight away charged towards where the Sky Tyrant Lord was. Qing Shu didn’t let his Qi force spread out to prevent hurting the people behind him.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Even though a lot of the people here already knew that Qing Shui was a Martial Saint warrior, but they had yet to witness it with their own eyes. They had only heard from the rumors. At the moment they saw the things happening in front of their eyes, they all felt incomparably shocked.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Pu!</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Peng!</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The Sky Tyrant Lord got blasted backwards and spat out fresh blood from his mouth. Coincidentally, he clashed exactly into the middle-aged man back then, in other words, his own son. The impact immediately blew the sturdy man away accompanied with a miserable shriek and bone cracking noise.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>One hit…...</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The Sky Tyrant Lord actually spat out blood after receiving only one blow from the young man. Qing Shui was the only one who knew that he was crippled. He returned him the favor which he once gave him. Sometimes, killing a person wasn’t the way to give them true despair.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui descended from the air like he was walking down the stairs and approached the Sky Tyrant Lord with a sarcastic face. He had been waiting for this day for a really long time.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The Sky Tyrant Lord had now lost his strength. He felt really heartbroken and completely disheartened. He felt just like a clown, travelling for a few million miles just to come here and die. He found it really ridiculous.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“I said before that I don’t have time to play with you. Why are you so stubborn? Do you really think that I won’t dare to kill you?” Qing Shui stood in front of the Sky Tyrant Lord.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The Sky Tyrant Lord’s son curled up on a spot far away with his head badly bruised. If he didn’t die from it, he would no longer be able to live a good life. Furthermore, Qing Shui also crippled him on purpose.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>As the remaining people saw the Sky Tyrant Lord not being able to evade even one move from Qing Shui, they all lowered their head and didn’t dare to speak. All of them added up wouldn’t even be enough to squeeze into the gap of Qing Shui’s teeth.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Today, you guys are the one seeking death! I do not have a choice. If I’m the one taking action, you will all be able to die in peace.” Qing Shui slowly raised his hand and was about to smack the Sky Tyrant Lord’s head.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Stop! If you kill the Sky Tyrant Lord, the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord won’t let you go!”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Brat, the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord isn’t something you should pick a fight with. Know your place and let the Sky Tyrant Lord go.”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>……</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Haha!” Qing Shui laughed. After that, he quickly squeezed into the crowd and straight away crippled half of the people from the Sky Tyrant Lord. The people who yelled at him previously got crippled by Qing Shui as well. Even if they didn’t die now, he wouldn’t last longer than three days.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“It seems like I really have to kill him today. If news about this gets spread around, everyone will think that I’m letting him go because I feel threatened. That would be really shameful. Everyone lives to fight for themselves! So considering that I’m fighting for myself now, I will have to kill him today!”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>After finished speaking, Qing Shui raised his hand and dropped it down towards the head of the Sky Tyrant Lord while leaving an afterimage in the air.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Qing Shui……”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>At this moment, Di Chen opened her mouth and called out to Qing Shui.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>‘Sister Chen!”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Can you promise me to let them go? I’ll consider it as repaying them for the time when they looked after me.” Di Chen said softly.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui stopped his hand in mid-air. It was so close to the Sky Tyrant Lord’s head that he could even feel the firmness in the attack. If it hadn’t been for Di Chen stopping him, Qing Shui would definitely kill the Sky Tyrant Lord.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Since Sister Chen suggested it, I will naturally allow it.” Qing Shui’s hands were seemingly shivering. After that, he slowly pulled back his hand.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“All of you! Disappear! I no longer have anything to do with you! You guys won’t treat me as your daughter! Stop getting me involved in the things between Di Clan and you! GO!” Di Chen looked at the Sky Tyrant Lord in sorrow.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The Sky Tyrant Lord looked at Qing Shui with an expression full of hatred. He showed the same face to Di Chen as he climbed on the bird with enormous wings with other people and left their sights.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Qing Shui successfully drove away the formidable opponents! Congratulations!”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>‘Qing Shui’s strength is indeed formidable! Respect! Full of respect!”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>……</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui hinted for the others to continue on with the party. Furthermore, he asked the people in the kitchen to prepare more dishes to calm down the crowd. Luckily, everything happened as Qing Shui expected.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Even though all of these things were within Qing Shui’s expectation, it didn’t mean that the others thought the same. For example, the Qing Clan, and Di Chen who was beside Qing Shui.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>She had been staring at Qing Shui for a long time. Nevertheless, she still found it hard to calm down. She only noticed after a while that Qing Shui was still standing quietly beside her.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Qing Shui… Sorry…?”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Why are you apologizing to me?”</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“I stopped you from killing him. Deep down, I keep on having the feeling that I owe him a lot. No matter what, he was still the one who brought me up. If I didn’t do this today, I would have feltl really uneasy. Only by doing this have I been able to completely let everything go.” Di Chen said feeling guilty.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>“Alright, don’t feel sad anymore. As long as you are able to let go of it, I won’t mind letting them go. Compared to you, what are they? I just want you to be happy.” Qing Shui smiled as he comforted her.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Since the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord members left, the atmosphere in the surroundings got even more lively. The people from Qing Clan were all incomparably happy. The three generations of Qing Clan all looked at Qing Shui admirably. They never thought that Qing Shui would actually turn out to be so strong despite being not being so outstanding when he was young.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>About the incident involving the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord today, Qing Shui didn’t really feel surprised about it. In fact, he felt that they would come even earlier than this. After driving them away, Qing Shui didn’t really feel that relaxed. The Sky Tyrant Lord wasn’t what Qing Shui was worried about, nor was it the fourth grade Martial Saint warrior in the residence. What Qing Shui was truly concerned about was the even even stronger warriors who were hiding within the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui wasn’t sure if even stronger Martial Saint warriors would come after the Sky Tyrant Lord left. For now, Qing Shui knew that he had to increase his strength as soon as possible since it would take them half a year to come back and forth.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Qing Shui felt that he needed to cultivate even harder during these six months to make sure that he could advance further in his strength.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>The days went on peacefully. With the Aroma Concentration Pill and the Spirit Concentrating Pill, most of the clan members in Qing Clan managed to increase their strength at a steady pace. As for the Rainbow Trout fish in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, it had already long since become edible.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Also there was the Tiger Vitality Pill, Constituting Nurturing Pill and the thickened soup with extraordinary effect which Qing Shui blended himself. Occasionally, Qing Shui would help them cultivate their aura and help them clear up some of their small acupoints to make sure they would benefit a lot from it.</strong></p>
