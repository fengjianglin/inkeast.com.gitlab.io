 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2227 - Five Colored Formation Breaking Stone</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pfft!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After one month in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, a clear cracking sound was heard. He felt like floating as if something in his body was cleared off. A great refreshing feeling flowed throughout his entire body. It was cozy and was a whole new feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, he realized his abilities were enhanced. Qing Shui was surprised but he got used to it shortly. Previously when he achieved a breakthrough, his strength increased as well. Besides, the main increment was the external resistance like oppressing the lower realms, resisting the same realm and resisting being oppressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was an indirect increase of strength instead of a true strength increment. As long as his realm was higher, he would be able to oppress his opponent and his strength would be enhanced. That was an intangible power. It was fair to be declared as a strength increment. It mainly depended on the realm of both parties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was taken aback as he found out that his attacking power had breached 11 billion dao after this breakthrough. His strength almost doubled as a result. Qing Shui was at the Late Divine Connection Realm. Perhaps that was accumulated from earlier days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His realm also skipped a few small stages. Qing Shui was pleased but not overly surprised by the 50 billion Dao increase in attacking power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the Late Divine Connection Realm, he would still be oppressed by the Cave Realm. At least, the extent of oppression would not be so great as it was recently. With the strength enhancement now, his defense would increase immensely. The Stellar Transposition was catching up as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before this, he was more than a realm behind and he was being oppressed by someone who was double his strength. It was extremely difficult before this. However, things were different now. Qing Shui was confident in fighting against the old men outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui had experienced a great transformation in his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui's defense was almost 140 billion Dao under the effects of the Defense Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda, the Paragon Golden Armor, and Foolish Loyalty. The attack of the Nine Continents Mountain was about 55 billion Dao with the power of Shield Attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apart from that, Qing Shui noticed minor changes on the Divine Weapon Flying Sword. It became heavier and sharper. The Flying Sword was based on the owner's body. As Qing Shui's strength increased, the power of the Flying Sword would increase alongside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was satisfied with the breakthrough at this moment. He was looking forward to attaining the Cave Realm. If he achieved the Cave Realm, he could probably kill the old men within seconds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the breakthrough was over, Qing Shui spent the remaining time observing the Ancient Drawing of Divine Realm. However, he no longer felt the deep stir inside. It was as if he had lost the previous mutual connection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was to be expected as Qing Shui was now in the same realm as this Ancient Drawing. Though he had yet to reach the Peak Divine Connection and Half-step Cave Realm, it was not that impactful to watch the battle at this realm anymore. Qing Shui reckoned he could do the same in a battle like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was still bright when he came out. Walking to the front yard, the others seemed to be in a discussion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They haven't left yet. After trying for half a day and failing to break the formation, they are resting in the tents nearby. They said to kill any of our men who walk outside. They don't believe that we would stay here forever,” Beihuang Yu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha! Of course we will go out. Why would we stay? Still, ignore them for two days first,” Qing Shui nodded before walking out after saying that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He noticed the Golden Yakshas who were resting in their camps nearby.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many creatures and living humans in the Sea King Palace; several of them were really killed as they went out, including the normal Aquatics.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui knew they wanted to provoke him and force him into a battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui surveyed the surroundings. The terrain was too simple and the opponents were widely distributed. He gave up the plan of trapping them in a formation. It was impossible when the opponents had their guards up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Coward, get out!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you not coming out? Stay in there forever then! I will kill every one of you who comes out. Let's see how long you can stay inside.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yunlong, you are a coward! Isn't the Silver Dragon Palace powerful? Why are you hiding in there?” A middle-aged Golden Yaksha screamed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui looked at them while standing in the formation with Yunlong and others. The Golden Yaksha yelled after seeing Yunlong. He must have shouted as he saw Yunlong. His age was probably similar to Yunlong and they should have been opponents on other days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yunlong calmly responded with a smile, “You're more fertile than pigs. Such a cheap life; I won't fight with you guys and lower myself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Golden Yaksha was so angry that his face turned red. Pointing at Yunlong, he said, “Get out and fight with me. Only good at words, are you a man?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am a man and I know it. You, on the other hand, are not married yet. I would ask myself whether you are one.” Yunlong was not irritated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui smirked, seeing that this elder brother was good at bickering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You, you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides being unable to fight, he also lost in the argument. Thus, he panted angrily and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, the old men stepped forward and looked at Qing Shui. They knew this young man was in charge of the Sea King Palace so the elder who led the previous attack approached him, “You can't be always hiding inside. We’ll sort this out one day.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No rush. I have ample food supplies here,” Qing Shui said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I actually have something that can break the formation but I've been thinking if I should use it. Behold.” The Elder took out a five-colored sparkling stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“...Formation Breaking Stone.” Qing Shui sounded surprised. This old man owned various items and this particular item could break many great formations. The Formation Breaking Stone was graded with colors. For example, this Five-colored Formation Breaking Stone was good enough to break the formation of the Sea King Palace. The Seven-colored Formation Breaking Stone could break any kind of formations, but it was very rare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you want me to use this Formation Breaking Stone or will you come out and have a proper battle with me?” The Elder looked at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui heaved a sigh. He knew the Elder was reluctant in giving up the Formation Breaking Stone. Otherwise, he would have used it much earlier. The Formation Breaking Stone was extremely precious. Still, Qing Shui knew that the Elder would use this Formation Breaking Stone under desperation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were a hundred thousand Golden Yakshas across. An amount that the Sea King Palace could never handle. Luckily, Qing Shui’s strength had been improved. The opponent proposed for a fight which was exactly what Qing Shui was wishing for now. If he killed this Elder, the Sea King Palace would have a greater chance of victory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We go one on one or all three of you together?” Qing Shui asked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don't try to provoke me. I will finish you myself,” The Elder said confidently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The opponent was at the Cave Realm so he definitely deserved the confidence. However, Qing Shui wondered which stage of the Cave Realm he was at now. One would only achieve the Cave Realm by opening the caves in his body. A cave could be upgraded to the next realm and it was better when the number increased. Eight Cave Realm was the limit, something that only absolute geniuses could achieve. Only those with special bloodlines or the Ancient Pure Breed Desolate Beast could attain the Nine Cave Realm while reaching the Ten Cave Realm solely depended on chances.</span></p>
