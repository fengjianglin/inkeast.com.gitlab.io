 <p><strong>AST 838 - The Effect of the Heart Toxin Talisman, Two Hearts</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui threw out his Heart Toxin Talisman.</p>
 <p>It was impossible to dodge the Heart Toxin Talisman, just like it was for the Descending Heavens Talisman. Therefore, even though Hu Langsha tried to dodge it, he was still hit. Then, stunned for a moment, his face immediately flushed red.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw Hu Langsha's expression and was stunned too. To think that someone who was so old would have such an expression. This of one of extreme excite... Usually, one would only have such an expression when in his dreams, having sex with ladies he could never dream to touch. To think that this old man would have such an expression as well.</p>
 <p>It seemed that the old man's spirit energy was ordinary as well. Everything happened in just an instant and Qing Shui shot out two Frosted Iron Balls with no hesitation. Twin Dragon Balls!</p>
 <p>In this crucial moment, with Qing Shui having delayed a short moment earlier, the old man was able to dodge getting hit in critical spots but his shoulders and lower abdomen were pierced. Although the injuries were serious, they were not fatal.</p>
 <p>The old man looked at Qing Shui. It was only now that a hint of surprise appeared in his eyes. This young man was a demon. To think that he was able to create illusions which could cause one to lose their minds.</p>
 <p>"Kill!" Suddenly, with a loud bellow, the old man waved his hand.</p>
 <p>The "Four-headed Red Jiao" which was in mid-air, pounced toward Qing Shui, its four huge heads spewing out thick crimson colored flames. At the same time, it whipped out its huge tail like a steel whip from behind Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Hu Langsha was considered to have been crippled. The other people in the surroundings were still drowned in the astonishing scene from earlier and had not sensed that Qing Shui had weakened them. They merely saw Qing Shui's creepy Talisman Arts and terrifying Hidden Weapon Technique.</p>
 <p>Standing on top of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, Yun Duan realized that this man had been giving her too many astonishments throughout the day. What was his actual level? How had he been spending all these years? How could he be so powerful?</p>
 <p>Although she did not understand, she was now especially surprised. Cloud Adventurer Guild was considered to have been saved. Herself, her family and the people from Cloud Adventurer Guild were now all safe. Wasn't this her goal? In order to achieve this goal, she had not cared about pushing herself toward hell.</p>
 <p>However, very quickly, she saw that huge Four-headed Red Jiao pouncing toward Qing Shui. Although she knew that he should be fine she still could not help but feel worried.</p>
 <p>This feeling made her understand that unknowingly, he had already gotten ahold of her heart. To think that her heart was thumping as he moved, making her both happy and anxious.</p>
 <p>Looking at the Four-headed Red Jiao which had pounced over, Qing Shui dashed up, dodging that whipping tail and then shot downward rapidly, performing the "Mountain Splitting Strike" with the Thunder God in his left hand.</p>
 <p>This was one of the more powerful moves in Qing Shui's "Hammer Techniques". It specialized in attacking demonic beasts of a larger size. This was a tremoring attack which had a small area effect. The attack had a penetrating effect and could ignore the impact resistance of armor of a certain level.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>With the hammer swinging out at full force, even the Four-headed Red Jiao could not help but let out a horrified cry. It shot upward and once again spewed crimson colored flames toward Qing Shui. The four streams of crimson colored flames pounced toward Qing Shui like four huge fire pythons.</p>
 <p>This time around, Qing Shui didn't dodge them. He merely circulated his powers to their maximum level and circulating the Ancient Technique: Flames of Yin-Yang to its limits. When performing the primordial flames, he had to circulate the Ancient Technique: Flames of Yin-Yang.</p>
 <p>Sword of Sixth Wave!</p>
 <p>Boom boom...</p>
 <p>The terrifying crimson colored flames hit Qing Shui's body but a strange scene occurred. Those flames seemed to have entered his body and his Big Dipper Sword slashed down on one of the Four-headed Red Jiao's heads.</p>
 <p>With tremendous howl which pierced through the clouds, one of its huge heads was smashed, spouting out fresh blood ten meters upward which eventually fell down as rain.</p>
 <p>Although the Four-headed Red Jiao would not die from losing just one of its heads, that immense pain would make it lose its cool and its battle prowess would also be raised slightly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was not worried about this Four-headed Red Jiao at all. It was because things that were of the fire element had no impact on him. This huge demonic beast was quite strong but it was a pity that he was its opponent. It was quickly killed by Qing Shui without even being able to unleash 30% of its prowess.</p>
 <p>As the huge Four-headed Red Jiao fell to the ground, the earth trembled. It also announced the end of the battle and spelled the demise of the Hu Wei Adventurer Guild.</p>
 <p>Of course, Cloud Adventurer Guild also gained attention immediately. People were also concerned about Miss Yun Duan's man. Where did this guy come from? How strong is he? ...</p>
 <p>The old man was already dead. It could be because when he saw that the Four-headed Red Jiao was not a match for Qing Shui, he knew what would become of himself. Although he could not accept this ending, he had no other choice.</p>
 <p>Having entered into seclusion training, what had welcomed him on the first day he came out was death. He had thought that this time he came out, Hu Wei Adventurer Guild would become more powerful once again and even control the entire Heavenly Beast City.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui put the Four-headed Red Jiao's corpse into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. As for the others, other people will take care of them.</p>
 <p>Yun Duan leaped down from the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and quickly ran over to Qing Shui, "Are you alright?"</p>
 <p>Looking at this lady who was full of concern for him, Qing Shui smiled, "I'm fine. Everything here has been taken care of. Let's go back!"</p>
 <p>"Mmm!" Yun Duan smiled and nodded.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui put away the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and called out the Fire Bird.</p>
 <p>This time around, Qing Shui hesitated about whether he should pull her up without saying a word. He had forgotten that Yun Duan was an elementary Martial Saint and could fly. However, he seemed to have neglected this issue.</p>
 <p>However, just then, Yun Duan smiled and reached out her hand for Qing Shui. Her face that was like white jade had a hint of a flush to it. She didn't lower her head but forced herself to look into Qing Shui's eyes.</p>
 <p>That resisting yet welcoming expression made Qing Shui's heart skipp a beat. He could not help but think of how a lady's beauty is more fatal when it's released unintentionally. It could really draw one to their death.</p>
 <p>"So beautiful!" Qing Shui pulled her up by her hand and leaped up while the Fire Bird flew below them. The two of them landed on the Fire Bird and then flew toward Cloud Adventurer Guild.</p>
 <p>The Fire Bird's speed was stable and did not fly fast this time around. The battle had just ended and Qing Shui needed to calm his heart. This process was very important toward cultivators.</p>
 <p>When he was at the Hu Wei Adventurer Guild, Qing Shui's spiritual sense had encompassed the surroundings and he had even asked Yun Duan who the stronger people in Hu Wei Adventurer Guild were.</p>
 <p>There would definitely be people he had missed and there could be quite a lot of them. After all, they had so many people and Qing Shui had not reached the stage where he had lost his sanity. However, those who managed to survive were also those that Qing Shui had decided to let off. There were already no powerful cultivators amongst them. Even if they wished to get up on their feet again, they would not be able to reach the same level without a few hundred years.</p>
 <p>Even on the Fire Bird, Qing Shui didn't let go of Yun Duan's hand. Yun Duan let Qing Shui hold her hand. Something that neither she nor the Cloud Adventurer Guild had been able to accomplish, this man accomplished in less than half a day.</p>
 <p>Even the most rational lady would have an emotional side to her. She now started to believe that she had an affinity with Qing Shui. She was also starting to believe what her grandfather had said before he had passed away.</p>
 <p>Would she really have a relationship with him?</p>
 <p>Yun Duan looked at Qing Shui in a daze. Although she was looking at Qing Shui, her mind was no longer on him. She was lost in her own thoughts.</p>
 <p>However, when Qing Shui saw that she was looking at him in a daze, he could tell that she was lost in her thoughts. He slightly tightened his grip on her hand and smiled, saying, "Why are you staring at me like that? You want to eat me up?"</p>
 <p>Yun Duan seemed to have been shocked to her senses and when she heard Qing Shui's words, she chided, "What's there about you that's good to eat?"</p>
 <p>"You're very delicious!" Qing Shui smiled and said softly.</p>
 <p>Yun Duan's body trembled a little but a hint of disappointment appeared on her face, "Do you look down on me?"</p>
 <p>"Why would I?!" Qing Shui quickly said.</p>
 <p>"I'm also forced to do this. I haven't liked anyone before. Every since the other time you... I haven't had any contact with other men..." Yun Duan's voice was very, very soft.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gently hugged Yun Duan. "Don't think too much. Having met each other again this time, it means that our affinity is there. In fact, ever since we met this time, I've not planned to let you leave me. It's because you can only be my woman."</p>
 <p>"How can you be so domineering?" Yun Duan lifted her head shyly and mumbled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui put his hands around her waist, his heart very calm. He lowered his head gently and planted a kiss on her forehead, "Duan`er..."</p>
 <p>This was the first time he had called her this. Even Qing Shui himself felt a little bit weird.</p>
 <p>However, Yun Duan softly answered him and rested her head on his shoulder.</p>
 <p>"Duan`er, back in Heavenly Palace, why did you agree to use yourself to make a deal with me?" Qing Shui asked.</p>
 <p>Yun Duan's body stiffened up before she said, "Feng Clan saved my life before and I'm indebted to them. Only by doing so could I leave. Feng Wuji has had his eyes on me for a long time. However, they knew that I came from Central Continent. If I didn't do this, he'd definitely try to get his hands on me regardless of the means used."</p>
 <p>"Then do you regret it?"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and looked at Yun Duan. Back then, he was astonished that this was her first time.</p>
 <p>"You rascal. Thinking about it, it might be because I owed you in my previous life." Yun Duan's face was flushed red. To think that thinking about the past had made her feel slightly happy because the two of them had met once again.</p>
 <p>"Duan`er, will you be my woman?" Qing Shui said softly next to her ear.</p>
 <p>"I'm your woman!" Yun Duan put her hands around Qing Shui's neck softly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't stand on ceremony and kissed those red and moist lips, planting kisses all over her poised and dignified face. Before he knew it, his hands were already on her round and perky beautiful butt. That smooth and bouncy feeling made Qing Shui have a strong urge to eat her up immediately.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui!" Yun Duan gasped and called out to Qing Shui who was undressing her.</p>
 <p>"Mmmm!" Qing Shui let go of her hand, with the other still in her clothes... He felt a little sorry. It could be because he hadn't touched any women for quite a while and could not hold back.</p>
 <p>He thought that Yun Duan would reprimand him. But Yun Duan's reaction earlier was also quite big and she panted, her beautiful face appearing embarrassed, "We're going to arrive soon!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took a look and saw that they were going to arrive at the Cloud Adventurer Guild soon. He grinned, saying, "Leave the door open for me tonight. I can't hold it in anymore..."</p>
 <p>Such crude words made Yun Duan's flushed face even more tempting and a faint mist appeared in her beautiful eyes. She felt very complicated, slightly nervous, a little happy and there also seemed to be a slight hint of anticipation...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled, one hand still remaining in her clothes, thoroughly feeling her peaks. That wonderful feeling made Qing Shui's heart itch.</p>
