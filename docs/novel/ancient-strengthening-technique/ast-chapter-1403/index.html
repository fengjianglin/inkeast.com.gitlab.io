 <p><strong>AST 1403 - Progress, Increase in Martial Realm Grade, Yiye Jiange Becomes Formidable</strong></p>
 <p>After waiting for so long, a breakthrough finally occurred. Moreover, the strength increase was well beyond Qing Shui’s expectations. Originally, he had estimated that he would reach around ten million sun in strength. With his various debuffs, the Paragon Heavenly Technique, and the Phoenix Finger, he could handle many situations.</p>
 <p>The feeling of being powerful was definitely good, just like how experts generally were more audacious. Qing Shui knew of this before, but he could really feel it now. He felt that he could go to many places now that he had been hesitant to go to before. This was his confidence in his strength.</p>
 <p>He continued to cultivate to stabilize his strength within the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. By the time he headed out, it was already dusk.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan had already started learning the Divine Beast Possession. Moreover, one of the elders was in charge of teaching Luan Luan. In addition, with Qing Shui’s assistance, her beasts had enhanced significantly this year. Many of them could be considered formidable.</p>
 <p>The members of the Qing Clan were slowly arriving. Qing Qing and Guo Polu were here too, as well as those who had lived with the Qing Clan for many years. This included the Martial Saints and their descendants who had grudges with the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. Qing Shui would bring them all over to the Phoenix Dance Continent.</p>
 <p>It only took time, but this was nothing to worry about. Unlike in his previous life, the lifespan here was a lot longer.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Qing Shui knew that the Divine Beast Sect was part of the Four Great Evil Powers. They also resided within the endless wasteland that was part of the intersection of the three continents.</p>
 <p>The intersection of the three continents was separated into three regions. The Phoenix Dance Continent, Soaring Dragon Continent, and Haohan Continent each had possession of one of the regions. There was actually an unmarked region that was barren, covered with mountains, deserts, forests and swamps. This area was rampant with beasts. Some forces that couldn’t be found in the three continents lived in the unmarked region</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was not certain whether the Four Great Evil Powers were connected. An enemy’s enemy was one’s ally, but there could also be exceptions. The bad guys could be separated by levels so Qing Shui knew that things were never absolute.</p>
 <p>The two elders looked at Qing Shui, suddenly realized something, and laughed out cheerfully, “Even if the two of us combined forces, we probably are no match for you.”</p>
 <p>Having interacted with Qing Shui for so long, the elder knew that Qing Shui’s physical strength was formidable. Moreover, they knew that he also had many martial arts techniques as a foundation. After sensing Qing Shui’s strength, he said those words without hesitation.</p>
 <p>“A person’s strength has its limits. There are still many areas that we will need to rely on both elders.” Qing Shui said while laughing and drinking wine with the two elders in the courtyard pavilion.</p>
 <p>“Having traveled for so long, this place is great. Now this place is our home. Even if we lose our lives, we will protect them.” The elder said happily.</p>
 <p>The two elders had no name. They said they had forgotten it. Thus, Qing Shui called them elder and second elder.</p>
 <p>Time passed by slowly. The members of Qing Clan that resided in the Phoenix Dance Continent continued to grow. These included Canghai Mingyue, Huoyun Liu-li, Qing Zun, Qing Ming, Qing Yin, Yun Duan, Zhu Qing, Qing Long as well as some others.</p>
 <p>He could bring two people at once, but each transfer still required a large amount of time. Unknowingly, half a year had gone by.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s strength did not improve significantly this past time. Right now, his focus was on stabilizing his foundational strength and cultivating battle techniques, in particular the Phoenix Finger. For the remainder of his time, other than going to Central Continent and the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, he did his best to raise the strength of those around him.</p>
 <p>The Imperial Cuisine Hall had already become a unique power existence. They remained low-key, but had a good reputation. Nobody dared to directly provoke the Imperial Cuisine Hall. Many familiar people knew, but those who were not well-informed would come and show arrogance. However, Qing Shui never sunk to their level. He would just have them directly thrown out.</p>
 <p>In the past half year, Qing Shui’s strength had not increased much, but his effectiveness with the Phoenix Finger had taken great leaps. The level of the Phoenix Finger had increased significantly during this time.</p>
 <p>Though his own strength had not improved greatly, his battle prowess had increased significantly. Compared to Qing Shui, the others made significant progress and improvements in their strength. Luan Luan and his women had the greatest improvements. They were already formidable, but since the women had their blood awakened, their strength increased rapidly. Moreover, they were assisted by Qing Shui and the elder. In addition, they could use the Origin Returning Pill, Greencloud Up-step Pellet, and Yang Pill now.</p>
 <p>As long as they could use these medicinal pellets, the matter of their strength increasing was just one of time. Although they could only use one pellet per year, Qing Shui had double dosage pellets. All of the Origin Returning, One-Yang Pill, Two-Yang Pill, Three-Yang Pill, etc. could raise their strengths significantly.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Qing Shui also assisted them with Acupuncture and Strength Infusion, infusing them with Shield Attack Power to help them breakthrough. Afterwards, he would stabilize their strength. This was a rapid and forceful method for infusing cultivation.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui still had not successfully refined the Five-Yang Pill.</p>
 <p>In addition, the two elders’ strengths were also apparent. It even increased a lot. Their body’s functionality greatly increased and they had a stronger foundation.</p>
 <p>Yehuang Guwu’s strength had also reached Peak Second Grade False God, reaching four million sun in strength. The White Tigers she summoned have a horrifying strength of 12 million. Moreover, she could summon six at once……</p>
 <p>With the presence of Yehuang Guwu, this place was safe. Though others were formidable, they were still very far from the top strengths within the Phoenix Dance Continent.</p>
 <p>Once they reached the State Master level, they could take the Yang Pill to raise the strength to the sun realm, that used ‘sun’ as the unit for their strength.</p>
 <p>The women’s strengths had already reached Martial Emperor. This was a realm that required a vast accumulation of strength.</p>
 <p>Marital Emperor martial artists were formidable. Even a low level Martial Emperor was a top-tiered martial artist, but all of them were just incomparable to False God martial artists. False God martial artists were almost a divine and immortal existence on land.</p>
 <p>The strength of the Qing Clan’s third generation was weaker, and it was not easy to raise it. They were very hard-working. Qing Shui tried his best to enhance their cultivation and talents. Compared to before, their talents had multiplied several times.</p>
 <p>This was a long-term mission. A clan’s strength was developed through several generations, even several dozen generations. Even though Qing Shui had formidable medicinal pellets, everything still required time, several generations of time.</p>
 <p>The Qing Clan was only at its fourth generation. It was already quite fast that they had today’s accomplishments. Moreover, his clan had an apparent weakness. If Qing Shui died, this clan was over. When a clan was supported by only one pillar, this clan was in serious danger. If the pillar toppled than the whole clan but also topple.</p>
 <p>A formidable clan would have many formidable martial artists, with a tightly-knit family network and its own inheritance. This way, the clan would be able to pass its inheritance on to the next generation, and it would also live on for a longer period of time.</p>
 <p>Within the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui stared at Yiye Jiange’s portrait. He stared at it for a while. He did not know where she was, or whether she was well.</p>
 <p>He stared blankly, not knowing for how long. Everything in front of him was a blur. Then, Qing Shui appeared inside a giant Crystal Palace.</p>
 <p>He looked at the 9 headed giant Crystal Beast in front of him. Its Jade Scaled Armor reflected the light. Its body was releasing a formidable aura.</p>
 <p>Immortal Demon, a False God beast, but a formidable Immortal Demon. It was not weaker than the Fire Bird or Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant by any means.</p>
 <p>Although many changes had occurred, Qing Shui could feel that it was Yiye Jiange’s Seven-headed Crystal Beast. Now it had evolved to nine heads. Its size was also at least ten times bigger……</p>
 <p>This probably meant that the Inheritance was successful, but where was Yiye Jiange? Qing Shui looked around the giant Crystal Palace.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, he felt a familiar fluctuation. Qing Shui turned his head. In plain clothes, a divine woman walked out.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange.</p>
 <p>With her usual heavenly air, it seemed like she was even more otherworldly. No one would dare defile her. The way she carried herself was mystical, to the point where it was difficult for people to approach.</p>
 <p>She had become so formidable, Qing Shui felt that her strength was equal to his own. Her body gave off a sense that made Qing Shui feel that her battle prowess would be terrifying. However, he was especially happy inside. He would rather his women be stronger than he was.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange was stunned when she saw Qing Shui, but she quickly knew this was not real. Rather, it was a type of spiritual communication. After realizing this, she smiled towards Qing Shui and walked over.</p>
 <p>A smile towards life!</p>
 <p>This smile was light, but it carried a strong vitality. There was a feeling that was indescribable, like when an immortal divine being took pity on a mortal.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui.” Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui’s stunned face and laughed.</p>
 <p>“Are you well? Do you know where this place is?” Qing Shui grabbed her hand and asked. He now knew that she was safe and well. Also, knowing that her beast had enhanced its strength significantly made his heart more settled.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know. This place is restricted, but I will soon be able to leave.”</p>
 <p>“En, I can’t help you, but this is good. That guy’s strength was not weak by any means. This palace is under the water, so when you leave you can use the Crystal Beast. There’s nothing to worry about but still, be careful.” Qing Shui pointed to the Crystal Beast as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“I know... are you guys well?” Unknowingly, Yiye Jiange had already left for three years.</p>
 <p>“The majority of the Qing Clan has migrated to Phoenix Dance Continent. When you are able to come, go directly to the Phoenix Dance Continent and find the Imperial Cuisine Hall, or go to the Central Continent’s Qing Residence. I will go back once a month and when the time comes, I’ll bring you over.”</p>
 <p>“En, only I’m not sure where I am situated right now. I estimate that it will take some time to go back, but you don’t have to worry. The Crystal Beast’s speed and lifesaving ability are quite formidable.” Yiye Jiange said joyfully.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui was about to speak, a sudden fluctuation flashed and Qing Shui was brought back to the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. Time almost did not move. At least now, he knew that Yiye Jiange was safe. He had to tell Luan Luan and Yiye Tian this news. They would probably be happy, and everyone in the Qing Clan would probably be happy to hear it.</p>
 <p>Continent’s Capital was the Continent’s Capital for a reason. The Imperial Cuisine Hall gained another two doctors, also of the highborn. This time, the Imperial Cuisine Hall became stronger. The two doctors knew that the Imperial Cuisine Hall was strong and they could not leave the Imperial Cuisine Hall since it was beneficial to their clan and career. Thus, they tried their best to fit into the normal operations of the Imperial Cuisine Hall.</p>
 <p>Yuan Su basically did not need to attend to the patients. Without much to do, she researched alchemy recipes, such as the Triple Portion Alchemy Recipe…</p>
 <p>Other than cultivating, Yehuang Guwu was protecting the safety of this location with the two elders. This was Qing Clan’s foundation and mistakes were not tolerable. Further, she also instructed other people on their cultivation.</p>
 <p>Many of the items were prepared beforehand by Qing Shui, such as pellets and techniques. Knowing that Yehuang Guwu was here, plus the fact that he had the Nine Continents Boots, Qing Shui decided to go out for an errand. There were things he could work on, but each month he was still required to return to the Central Continent to bring people over to the Phoenix Dance Continent.</p>
