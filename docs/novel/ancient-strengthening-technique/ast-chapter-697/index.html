 <p><strong>AST 697 - It’s hard to find the Immortal Fox, The persistent beauty, Obscure Realm Heavenly Thunder Slash</strong></p>
 <p>“Alright!” Hai Dongqing responded after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui continued to stay here for one more night. He used that pressure pressure to refine the tendons and bones. He thought about the time when he ran into the Howling Moon Silver Ape in the Deity Cave. Yet, there wasn’t anything here this time. This caused Qing Shui to feel really weird because there should be a Guardian Beast in this Deity Cave.</p>
 <p>Last time, Qing Shui had a feeling that the Howling Moon Silver Ape should be the Guardian Beast of that Deity Cave. Unfortunately, he didn’t really know what it was protecting. In the end, turned out it also didn’t leave with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Every Deity Statue was different. The only thing in common about them was that they were all treasures left behind by past warriors for destiny to decide their owners. As for the pressure released from it, it’s a kind of test for the person who was about to possess it. It could also be said that the pressure was to ensure that the Deity Statue wasn’t destroyed.</p>
 <p>As for Guardian Beasts, they were likely to be demonic beasts tamed by experts while they were still alive. Soon, the duty of protecting the Deity Statue started being passed down generation to generation. It could also be that some of the beasts were forced to surrender in front of the intimidating pressure of the Deity Statue. They’d rather protect this place or maybe a certain thing here.</p>
 <p>Of course, there was also the possibility that the previous Guardian Beast no longer existed and even now, there was yet to be any new Guardian Beast to replace it. It could potentially lead to lack of protections of the beasts here for a long period of time.</p>
 <p>Hence, Qing Shui felt really weird. It might be that he managed to reach here at the right time, when there wasn’t any Guardian Beast looking after the place.</p>
 <p>Just like this, Qing Shui and Hai Dongqing stayed for one more night. Upon refining the tendons and bones this time, Qing Shui felt the toughness of his body had become perfectly stable.</p>
 <p>Ang!</p>
 <p>At this moment, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant outside let out a mad cry.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui realized something was wrong. Normally, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant would only let out roars like this when it was facing formidable enemies as a sign of protest. Simultaneously, it did this to warn Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go out and have a look.” Qing Shui told Hai Dongqing as he led her out of the cave.</p>
 <p>As soon as they stepped outside, Qing Shui noticed that the Diamond Gigantic Elephant was staring far away into the distance. It didn’t blink its enormous eyes even once as it shook its body restlessly and stomped the ground.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui released his spiritual sense and sensed a formidable aura getting closer. He didn’t dare to let his guard down.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Hai Dongqing wore the Luan Silver Battle Armor while standing beside of Qing Shui. She was also looking far off into the distance. This time, she wasn’t as nervous as before. She knew exactly why, it was all because of the man she had beside her.”</p>
 <p>Kong!</p>
 <p>There was a loud roar coming from the distance. It seemed to be in reply to the Diamond Gigantic Elephant’s trumpet. Very quickly, a black dot could already be seen. It was drawing close at such incredible speed.</p>
 <p>Such incredible speed!</p>
 <p>Once the enemy got closer, Qing Shui could clearly see its appearance.</p>
 <p>This was a demonic beast which had a full body of snow white fur. It was about thirty meters long and the snow white fur across its body looked really neat. It looked tall and divine. Its pair of jade green eyes made it even more good-looking. It no longer felt eerie and frightening. This was the only demonic beast Qing Shui saw that was clean to the point where it didn’t have any dust on it.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>There was yet another loud roaring noise. Soon after, the demonic beast was already about a hundred meters away from Qing Shui. It started by staring at the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and gave out two low cries.</p>
 <p>Similarly, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant responded by trumpeting twice. Strangely, Qing Shui could feel the hostility between the two demonic beasts slowly disappearing. Very quickly, the enormous snow white demonic beast fixed its sight on Hai Dongqing.</p>
 <p>Whine!</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing first reacted in surprise. After that, she started walking towards the enormous beast. As she did so, Qing Shui hurriedly grabbed her. He ended up subconsciously pulling Hai Dongqing’s pale hand.</p>
 <p>Her skin was smooth and delicate. It was so soft that it felt like she didn’t have any bones. Qing Shui couldn’t help but felt excited. Despite this, he didn’t let go of her: “Don’t act rashly, are you ok?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was afraid that she might have suffered some kind of mental attack, hence, he wanted to confirm it.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I’m fine and awake. Let go of me, I’ll tell you about it later.” Hai Dongqing felt a sense of warmth as she looked at Qing Shui’s anxious look.</p>
 <p>It felt really good to have someone who cared for you.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui let go of her. After all. She had the Luan Silver Battle Dress. If she were to run into any trouble, she would be able to rely on the Luan Silver Battle Dress for to block it.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing smiled as she approached the snow white colored enormous beast.</p>
 <p>Whine!</p>
 <p>Even though Qing Shui had managed to figure it out, he still felt a bit unbelievable. The enormous snow white demonic beast started to lie prone in front of Hai Dongqing, even so, it was still a few times taller than Hai Dongqing herself.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing extended her hands and touched the snow white colored demonic beast. She smiled gently.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was standing next to her. He was intoxicated with her beautiful appearance. Hence, he tried his best to avoid eye contact with her. A beautiful woman was just like a fatal poisonous medicine, they could cause someone to lose control over themselves with their beauty.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing seemingly felt something and shot a sideways glance at Qing Shui. She smiled before gently saying: “Qing Shui, this one is responsible for looking after the Luan Silver Battle Dress.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui finally knew why Hai Dongqing went towards the demonic beast previously. It seemed she was able to communicate with it. Furthermore, it seemed like this demonic beast would only follow the person wearing the Luan Silver Battle Dress.</p>
 <p>“Can you understand demonic beast’s language?”</p>
 <p>“I can only understand its meaning.” Hai Dongqing smiled while pointing at the Silver Spirit Beast.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui attempted to sense the Silver Spirit Beast and realized that it was a bit superior to the Diamond Gigantic Elephant in terms of strength. It was already considered to have extremely outstanding talent. He couldn’t help but wonder if it would have more or less growth potential than the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>Actually, Qing Shui’s Diamond Gigantic Elephant had also only reached adulthood. And this was only because it lived in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. As Qing Shui saw Hai Dongqing getting along particularly well with the Silver Spirit Beast, he smiled.</p>
 <p>“Congratulations on getting a formidable demonic beast.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Initially, when Hai Dongqing heard Qing Shui’s words, she also felt really happy. But very quickly, she lost the mood to smile. This was because she thought that eventually, she would have to return the Luan Silver Battle Dress to him. The Silver Spirit Beast would only follow the person with the Luan Silver Battle Dress.</p>
 <p>“Not long after this, I’m going to give the Luan Silver Battle Dress to you. Then, the Silver Spirit Beast will definitely start following you.” Hai Dongqing smiled and said. Even though she was a bit unwilling to do so, she had no choice because the Luan Silver Battle Dress wasn’t actually hers.</p>
 <p>“Actually, have you noticed something? The Silver Spirit Beast is going to follow you forever. Even though it looked like it’s protecting these treasures, the Luan Silver Battle Dress, it seems to me more like it’s protecting the portrait instead. If you don’t believe me, you can ask the Silver Spirit Beast.” Qing Shui smiled. He possessed formidable Spiritual Sense, meaning that he could detect even the slightest fluctuation in his surroundings. He noticed that the Silver Spirit Beast wasn’t actually interested in the Luan Silver Battle Dress. On the contrary, it seemed to be particularly attracted to Hai Dongqing. This reminded Qing Shui of the Portraits of Beauty in which the Luan Silver Battle Dress was a part.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing’s beautiful pupils shone. Soon, she started touching the Silver Spirit Beast in joy.</p>
 <p>“The Silver Spirit Beast and the Luan Silver Battle Dress would provide you with a significant boost in your strength, so much so that you might stand a chance in facing Du Clan. Take it, not to mention that we came here together. Once you run into something which suits you, it should naturally be yours.” Qing Shui smiled as he attempted to convince her once more.</p>
 <p>“No I can’t, it’s too precious, you should just leave it for people more important to you.” Hai Dongqing said firmly after hesitating for a while. These words were something which she wouldn’t have said unless she made a firm decision. The reason was because these clothes could potentially help her solve Hai Clan’s crisis.</p>
 <p>“Are we friends?” Qing Shui didn’t know what’s going on. The more she refused to take it, the more eager he felt to give it to her. Furthermore, Qing Shui also felt that this set of clothes suited her particularly well. If it hadn’t been because of the sixth Portraits of Beauty, Qing Shui wouldn’t have been trying convince her to keep it. Of course wearing it could definitely help her through the crisis of Hai Clan.</p>
 <p>“It’s precisely because we’re friends that I cannot keep it.”</p>
 <p>“Take it… regardless of your exterior or in my heart, you are much more valuable than these clothes.”</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing didn’t know what to say and shot a glare at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Alright, it’s decided then. We will go look for the Three-tailed Immortal Fox together. If we managed to find its blood, I will definitely give you a present which I’m sure you’ll like.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Just like that, Hai Dongqing stopped tangling herself with the problem. She stopped talking about giving it back to Qing Shui but she did not promise to keep it either. Similarly, Qing Shui didn’t say any more about it. Finding the Three-tailed Immortal Fox’s Blood would make him feel much better than having the Luan Silver Battle Dress. Out of everything, Qing Shui enjoyed having powerful raw strength the most. External forces were unreliable in the sense that they had a lot of limitations, for example, time limit. Of course, when one reached his peak in terms of his raw strength and couldn’t improve any further, these false Divine Artifacts would turn out to be their next best alternatives.</p>
 <p>Soon after, the two went even deeper into the cave to look for the Three-tailed Immortal Fox. This time, they had the Silver Spirit Beast beside them, providing them with additional strength.</p>
 <p>Unknowingly, half a month had passed. They only managed to run into a few fox type demonic beasts. On several occasions, they even mistakenly identified some of the white foxes as the Immortal Foxes.</p>
 <p>They were almost at the end of the messy cave. If they still didn’t manage to find it here, they would have to move to another spot. The longer it took, the more hopeless they felt.</p>
 <p>Actually, no matter how one looked at it, this place was quite suitable to be the Immortal Foxes’ habitat. Despite this, they weren’t able to find even a single trace of the Immortal Fox. If they had run into any foxes, had it even been only a two tailed fox, it would at least give Qing Shui some hope knowing that the Immortal Foxes still existed.</p>
 <p>“Let’s take a break for a while and eat something. We are going to search through this entire place today before the sky gets dark.” Qing Shui stopped and told Hai Dongqing.</p>
 <p>“The Immortal Fox is such a difficult creature to find.” Qing Shui sighed with regret after dinner.</p>
 <p>“If we can’t find it here, I’ll bring you to a place. That place will definitely have it, but……” Hai Dongqing sounded a bit hesitant when she was saying it.</p>
 <p>“What? Carry on. Miss Hai, please be straightforward and say it.” Qing Shui said agitatedly.</p>
 <p>“In the middle of Immortal Fox Valley, there is a place known as the Immortal Fox Lake. I’m pretty sure that we will be able to find Immortal Foxes if we stay there. However, it does come with a risk. Legend has it that the place is filled with a lot of Peak Martial Saint Demonic Beasts.” Hai Dongqing confessed.</p>
 <p>When he heard about that, he felt both happy and worried. Nevertheless, he felt that it was necessary for him to go there. So long as he couldn’t manage to find it here, he would definitely go there. The only thing was that it might be a bit inconvenient if he brought Hai Dongqing along.</p>
 <p>“We will look through this entire place today. If we still don’t manage to find anything, we will set off for Immortal Fox Lake tomorrow.” Qing Shui didn’t want to miss the golden opportunity. He felt that there ought to be a way for him to find it.</p>
 <p>The sky has gotten dark. Qing Shui and Hai Dongqing had looked through the last few holes with no discoveries. However, it wasn’t actually surprising that this happened. Fortunately, they managed to find out about the Immortal Fox Lake. There was a huge possibility that it existed there.</p>
 <p>They rested in a cave nearby.</p>
 <p>Within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p>A faint halo emerged, indicating that Qing Shui’s Heavenly Thunder Slash has reached the Obscure Realm. This was one of the techniques which took Qing Shui the longest time to master.</p>
 <p>Obscure Realm Heavenly Thunder Slash!</p>
